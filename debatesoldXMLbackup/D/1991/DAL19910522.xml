      <P>Will the Taoiseach provide the House with an opportunity during the day, either now or later, to express its sympathy with the Indian people and the greatest and largest democracy in the world on the tragic murder of one of their most important political leaders, Mr. Rajiv Gandhi? Ireland has had close links with India and I know the Irish people share with the Indian people their sense of loss.</P>

The Taoiseach did indicate that we would be discussing conterminously the legislation to establish on a statutory basis the company to administer such generous tax allowances.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General is the only officer mentioned in the Constitution who specifically works for this House and not for the Executive.  The Public Accounts Committee issued a report two years ago seeking to update his powers, which date from 1966, and the Taoiseach had kindly indicated that the Government would bring in legislation.  During the last session I was told that it would not be introduced during that session but that it would possibly be taken in this session and we are now talking about the next session.  May I ask that the House make a special effort to introduce the legislation in this session and perhaps the Taoiseach would consider that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate and understand the Deputy's concern because this matter is of particular interest to him, and also, I can assure the Deputy, to the Government.  I understand it is being discussed by the Whips at present and we will make every effort to get it in this session, if possible, or at least to have it circulated in this session.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 85:</P>
      <P>In page 30, line 31, to delete &ldquo;subsection&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;section&rdquo;. Amendments Nos. 85 to 92, together inclusive, are in the main technical amendments and are required to ensure that the restrictions contained in section 24 are correctly targeted.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 86 deals with the situation where a lender receives a repayment of capital from a non-trading Shannon company before 31 December 1991.  Under paragraph (ii) of the proviso to paragraph (a) of subsection (3B), a lender who receives such a repayment will immediately become subject to the 40 per cent ceiling.  Under the provisions of the Finance Bill as published, that lender would not be able to make advances in excess of the 40 per cent ceiling until after 31 December 1991 when the new list in paragraph (b) of subsection (3B) comes into force.  The lender would not have access to the £170 million list contained in the Finance Bill, 1990, as access to companies on that list is only available when the conditions of paragraph (b) of subsection (3A) are met.  The amendment ensures that a lender in those circumstances will be able to make advances before 31 December 1991, to companies on the list referred to in the 1990 provisions.  This is a mechanism by which we stop people coming out before the termination of the loan and getting in again before the date on which the loan expires.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 87 makes it clear that only loans which are denominated in a foreign currency are subject to the restrictions in the new subsection (4A) and that the rate to be used for the purposes of the 80 per cent of DIBOR rule is the three month Dublin interbank offered rate on Irish pounds.  The amendment also secures that the interest is not to be treated as a distribution in the hands of the lender.  It will, however, continue to be treated as distribution in the case of the borrower.  This is in line with the existing restrictions on section 84 borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1874" /> Amendment No. 88 ensures that interest on a high-coupon loan which is not to be treated as a distribution will be taxable in the hands of the lender but that such treatment will not result in the interest becoming an allowable deduction in the case of the borrower.  Amendment No. 89 specifies that the three month DIBOR rate is the rate on Irish pounds. Amendment No. 92 provides that the 80 per cent of DIBOR rule is not to be applied to a loan to a borrower which is a non-manufacturing company carrying on trade in the Shannon Airport Zone.</P>
    <P>Amendment Nos. 85, 90 and 91 are drafting matters to facilitate the above amendments.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendments to the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not have any objections to the amendments. The measures being taken by the Minister now are in line with the series of measures which were taken since 1984 when section 84 loans were first restricted.  In 1984, Deputy Alan Dukes, the then Minister, proposed that section 84 loans would be restricted by and large to manufacturing industries.  There were further restrictions in 1989 when the lending agencies, as I understand it, could only lend 110 per cent of their outstanding amounts. That was further restricted by the Minister last year.</P>
      <P>I think we are down now to 40 per cent of what was originally denominated.  As well as following what is now well established sequence and putting restrictions on section 84 loans with the view to taking more tax from the corporate sector, there is a loosening up and concessions are being given to certain new businesses. Manufacturing projects which fulfil certain conditions will be able to borrow and agencies will be able to lend above the 40 per cent barrier.  I should like the Minister to reflect publicly with us on why he is doing this and to deal specifically with the mechanism which will allow certain companies to benefit from these new arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, exceptions will only be made where the Minister for Industry <Col N="1875" /> and Commerce and the Department of Industry and Commerce, on the advice of the IDA, put forward proposals to the Revenue Commissioners.  It seems peculiar that the IDA will be the authority who decide whether a particular company get a specific type of lending, especially when it is taxed based lending. I should like to hear the Minister's reflections on this point because I think the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners should decide who gets tax relief for a particular type of lending.  As I understand it, the initiator will be the IDA, and unless they list the company appropriate for this type of lending it will not be put forward by the Department of Industry and Commerce, and, consequently, it will not be adjudicated on by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>The mechanism which is being followed this year is similar to the one operated in 1990.  The IDA will complete a list of projects, taking into account appropriate submissions from both the Shannon Development Company and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  All these projects will have to conform in all respects to the qualification criteria specified in section 24.  This list will then be submitted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and transmitted to me and the Department of Finance for approval.  When approved, this list will be sent to the IDA by the Department of Industry and Commerce for notification to all companies on the list.  The list will then be available to the qualifying banks to indicate to them the companies to which section 84 facilities can be provided under the transitional arrangement. This is to provide for pipeline projects where companies coming in from abroad would be ready to start negotiations, be they in the middle of negotiations or completing negotiations.  I think the Deputy would agree that in those circumstances it would be advisable that we are seen to carry through the good faith of the negotiators, the IDA or the Shannon Development Company, <Col N="1876" /> and ensure that the credibility of those development companies is kept intact.</P>

      <P>It is part of the ongoing mechanism to scale down the use of section 84.  Clearly in the middle of any period when it is being scaled down there will be companies in the pipeline and at different stages of negotiation.  As I said already, it is to protect the good faith and credibility of the development agencies in their dealings with foreign companies that the rules will not be changed half way through the negotiation. That is specifically what is provided for here.</P>
      <P>The development agencies will apply the same criteria they apply when grant-aiding projects in the normal way.  They will assess the project on the basis of product, business plans, marketing and job creation.  They will consider the cost per job from a grant point of view and will also take into account the benefit of section 84.  It is all part of the one operation.  The creation of additional employment is central to any grant application, whether it comes from Údarás na Gaeltachta, Shannon Development or the IDA.  It will do no more or less than cater for those projects and proposals which are in the pipeline or in the process of negotiation and ensure that no new projects can be taken in after that.  It is a way of scaling down the use of section 84.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 84 which was ruled out of order refers to the same matter.  It raised a point which it is incumbent on us to advert to at this stage in so far as we spent yesterday debating the different aspects of the income tax provisions.  I think all sides of the House were agreed that there is a necessity to broaden the taxation base.  We might disagree as to where that broadening of the base should happen, but if we are to give continued reliefs to the PAYE sector, then the money has to be raised elsewhere. This section deals with the corporate sector, the first area we have an opportunity to look at.</P>
      <P>My concern about the debate we have just had on the Minister's amendments is that when one compares the present system and the actual yield from the corporate sector, the net point at the end of the day is that insufficient is being contributed by the corporate sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment sought to intrude a new argument into the debate which was that an alternative minimum tax ought be established below which no section of the corporate sector, no matter <Col N="1880" /> what specific regime attaches to it, could avoid paying.  We can talk all day about the 40 per cent tax regime on the corporate sector other than the IDA manufacturing area.  However, the facts are that hardly anybody in their right mind is paying an effective rate of 40 per cent corporation tax.  There are so many allowances and reliefs and escape hatches that may be availed of that nobody is paying it.</P>
    <P>What my amendment effectively sought to do was to introduce an effective minimum rate of 10 per cent so that, no matter what the circumstances, if one was making a profit one could not pay less than 10 per cent.  For example, it is a practice followed in the United States with their ACT tax and it seems to have a great deal to recommend it.  It really is disingenuous of us in this House to talk about giving further relief to the PAYE sector if, at some stage, we do not identify where we are going to find the revenue that is lost.  Deputy Noonan made the point that the Progressive Democrats, who are in the vanguard of this movement, have never identified where we are going to find the money.</P>
    <P>Here we have a corporate sector which, broadly speaking, has been doing extremely well in recent years.  They have made unprecedented profits.  They have given a tremendous performance with greater efficiency in industry.  Yet, because of a combination of the IDA tax regime applied to the various allowances, reliefs and escape hatches in section 84, they are paying hardly any tax.  The section 84 reference by the Minister is effectively a mechanism to allow the banks themselves, who make substantial profits, to avoid paying their fair share of tax; it is an escape hatch for them under the guise of assisting industry.</P>
    <P>I know the IDA would be extremely angry if that were to be cut out entirely. They argue strongly that such a facility has to be there, but I do not believe it has to be there in the wide open way it is at the moment, and Deputy Noonan's questions about employment and precisely what is the prospectus that has to <Col N="1881" /> be advanced before this can be made available are very pertinent.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am unhappy once again that we have glided over this section creating the most generous climate possible in any western European country in terms of the tax regime applying to business in Ireland without in any way tightening up or ensuring that we get a better yield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister might indicate the Government's thinking in relation to the future of section 84 type reliefs having regard to the OECD report published in today's media in regard to the level of corporation tax here.  It would benefit everybody if there was some clarity from the Minister as to how he would like to see corporation tax move over the next few years in a manner not unlike the commitments given in relation to personal tax.  It would be particularly beneficial to industry, given the long lead in time from planning. There are very few areas in this open market economy of ours over which we have domestic control to the extent that we have over our own domestic tax regime.  Having regard to all the constraints, the greater the degree of certainty that can be offered by the Minister for Finance the better it is for industry generally in planning ahead.</P>
      <P>In response to the points raised by Deputies Noonan and Rabbitte, will the Minister outline what the thinking in the Department now is?  Each year we are getting restrictions and a tightening down in relation to the operation of section 84. Is there a long term vista, and if so, can it be revealed at this stage?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> If I recall correctly, last year when we were talking <Col N="1882" /> about transitional arrangements the aggregate amount which could be availed of in this type of borrowing in transitional arrangements was £170 million.  Now we are into a second year of transitional arrangements and the aggregate amount this year is £250 million plus and the residue of last year's aggregate amount. That is an awful lot of money.  What is the residue from last year?  What is the estimate of the Department's tax loss on this?  Supposing no transitional arrangements were made, what would be the return to the Exchequer?  How much of last year's aggregate amount is still there to be added to the £250 million allowed for this year?  What is the estimated loss to the Exchequer of making this concession for a further 12 months at the new aggregated amount?  Does the Minister think it appropriate that it is the IDA or SFADCo or Údarás na Gaeltachta who should, in effect, be the decision makers on whether companies will get tax breaks of what looks like about £300 million? Aggregated relief on PAYE, according to the Minister's tables yesterday, was £53 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked what minimum tax rate should be applied instead of the allowances that are there.  However, a minimum tax rate of corporate tax is useful where tax allowances are generally available which significantly reduce the part of a company's profit charged to tax.</P>
      <P>Accelerated capital allowances were principally responsible for transforming accounting profits into losses or greatly reduced profits for tax purposes.  These allowances are being phased out. Accordingly, there will be increasingly little difference between profits for accounts purposes and profits for tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the phasing out of accelerated capital allowances, there has been substantial reduction of groups relief and section 84 lending.  In addition, a company must pay advanced corporate tax every time they distribute profits to shareholders in the form of a dividend.  To the extent that a company distribute their <Col N="1883" /> profits the ACT is, for all practical purposes, a minimum corporate tax rate. Calls for a minimum corporation tax rate ignore the substantial changes which have taken place in our corporation tax code over the last number of years.  I am satisfied that the elimination of free depreciation and the introduction of advanced corporate tax achieved largely the same objectives as underlie calls for a minimum tax on companies.</P>
    <P>The ending of export sales relief is just another part of the whole area where corporate tax will now be paid where it was not being paid.  Up to 1990 we had zero tax on exports; now it is 10 per cent corporate tax &mdash; the systematic reduction in the lending under section 84 in the last three years and again in this year's Bill accelerated capital allowances, which was one of the greatest mechanisms for reducing profits into losses or eliminating them, and the restriction in the 10 per cent carried out last year by narrowing the definition of manufacturing tax have combined to make an effective corporate tax payable.  It is interesting to look back over the figures of the last couple of years to see what has happened.  In 1987 the corporate tax yield was £255.7 million; we are projecting this year £527 million. The percentage of revenue that corporate tax represents&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a function of profitability or a widening of the tax base?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a combination of both. While the earlier years would not have been great for profits, it is becoming evident, in the elimination of all the various factors, I am talking about plus profits last year.  It is very difficult to draw a line between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been asked about 1986 in terms of profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine there would not have been many profits in 1986 or 1987.  The 1987 base is probably a fair base from which to move.  Most of the changes I am talking about came about <Col N="1884" /> in those three to four years and they will take increasing effect as we go along. Export sales relief will not come into play effectively until 1992.  There would be a build up of accelerated allowances that would probably wipe out a certain amount of profit in 1991 but we will begin to see the full effect of that in 1992 rather than 1991.  We expect that trend to continue. Last year we reduced the ceiling to 75 per cent for section 84 loans and this year we are taking that ceiling down to 40 per cent.  At the end of this year there will be about £500 million coming out of the Shannon section 84 loans.  We brought in amendments to make sure there can be no mechanism for coming out early and getting back in, that our objective cannot be frustrated.  The returns from corporation tax are rising gradually.  They were £255.7 million in 1987, £285.9 million in 1988, £303 million in 1989, £474 million in 1990 and £527 million in 1991.</P>
      <P>The same objective has been achieved in a different way.  One must always be careful when taking away investment incentives that one remains competitive for international investment which, I am sure the House will appreciate, is a very competitive market.  We do not want to put out disincentive ideas and certainly we do not want to to be accused of changing the rules in the middle of negotiations.  If we change rules half way the opposition in the marketplace will very soon use that against the IDA and against Ireland.  We have to be careful about that and, consequently, we move slowly.  We need to ensure that we do not do damage to our investment; we need all the investment we can get.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On the last point, let me draw the Minister's attention to something which has been drawn to my attention regarding accelerated capital allowances which the Minister has been talking about.  When the changes were made the cost of equipment could be written off in 10 per cent tranches. Now it is operating not on a straight line basis where 10 per cent is taken off every year but on 10 per cent of the <Col N="1885" /> residue in subsequent years.  Therefore, for accounting purposes a company can write off the cost of a machine over the life of the machine, perhaps seven or eight years, but for tax purposes, because it is 10 per cent of residues along a line, they cannot write off the tax allowances for up to 40 years.  A small residual tax break is being kept in the books up to the 40th year until it diminishes to a point of irrelevance.  Purely for the sake of the profession, will the Minister consider bringing the 10 per cent on a straight line basis rather than 10 per cent of the residue as one goes on, effectively decreasing into infinity?  Does he see the point?</P>

We hope to have a new package of wear and tear rates to encompass what the Deputy is talking about and many other facets that will cause problems.

      <P>I do not want to delay the House, but it is an important section. Notwithstanding what the Minister has said, I still argue that the total tax take is too small.  I do not know whether the Minister has the up to date figures.  If he has not, I would like to hear them before we finally enact this measure.</P>
      <P>The table in the report on the second triennial review of industrial performance measures the cost of tax reliefs in industry in the area of export sales relief as £729.2 million in 1987-88, £131.4 million for the 10 per cent tax rate and £98.8 million for the section 84 loans.  The Minister has confused the point Deputy Quinn put.  Did the Minister say £255 million was the 1987 figure?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>And it is now projected to be £527 million?   The Minister stood the point Deputy Quinn was making on its head.  From the profit base of 1986-87 to the profits we have been experiencing over the last two or three years, which are projected into 1991-92, £527 million is not an increase of any significance in real terms, the point being that the take is still very marginal.  Has the Minister the up-to-date figure?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not consider going from £255 million to £527 million from 1987 to 1991 infinitesimal or not a real increase.  It is a real increase and as years go by I expect the area on which we have taken action will show greater increases.  The figures Deputy Rabbitte was quoting came from the industrial performance review where they calculated export sales relief as tax foregone at the rate of 50 per cent corporate tax, despite the fact that corporate tax by and large in the whole manufacturing area is 10 per cent.  I raised this question previously and was told that the basis on which it is <Col N="1887" /> calculated is tax foregone on the basis of a 50 per cent corporate tax rate which in my view is not a true reflection of the position.  Manufacturing tax is not 50 per cent, it is 10 per cent.  The other trading corporate tax rates were 50 per cent and are now on the way down to 40 per cent. Therefore, that figure had to be discounted from what it is at the moment.</P>

To what extent does the figure of £200-plus million in 1986 represent a percentage of the total profits reported by companies at the time, and how does that figure compare with the £500 million he is quoting now?   He has given us an increase from £200-plus million to £500-plus million which is a substantial amount of money in anybody's book.  What is the comparable percentage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 93:</P>
      <P>In page 33, before section 25, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;25. &mdash;Section 87 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, is hereby amended, as respects any acquisition of shares on or after the 25th day of July, 1990, in subsection (4) by the addition of the following paragraph after paragraph (d):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(e) Nothing in this subsection shall require a company, which is a subsidiary (being a subsidiary within the meaning of section 155 of the Companies Act, 1963) of another company to be treated as making a distribution where it acquires shares in the other company pursuant to section 9 (1) of the Insurance Act, 1990.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Tax planners have always sought ways of getting profits out of a company to the company's owners while avoiding the ACT liability for the company and the income tax liability for the owner or shareholder which are chargeable on the payment of a dividend by the company.</P>
      <P>One method of transferring company profits to shareholders would be to redeem shares at a substantial premium &mdash; the premium being effectively a distribution of profits to the shareholders.</P>
      <P>The Corporation Tax Act, 1976, anticipated that method of distributing profits to shareholders and provided that premiums paid to shareholders under such arrangements would be treated the same as dividends for tax purposes.  Accordingly, whenever a company pay a premium over subscription moneys on acquiring their own shares the premium is classified as a &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; resulting in an ACT charge on the company and on income tax liability for the shareholder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Corporation Tax Act also provided for a variation of such arrangements which could be organised in the case of a group of companies.  Instead of <Col N="1889" /> the issuing company redeeming or otherwise acquiring their own shares at a premium, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the issuing company could acquire the shares from the shareholders at a substantial premium.  This would simply be another way of transferring the issuing company's profits, albeit profits held in a subsidiary, to the issuing company's shareholders.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Insurance Act, 1990, allows a subsidiary life assurance company to acquire and hold shares of any class in its quoted holding company on behalf of its policyholders.  Section 9 allows life assurance companies which are subsidiaries of quoted companies to acquire shares in their parent companies for the purposes of achieving the same representative spread of investment in quoted securities for their policyholders as any other collective investment vehicle.</P>
    <P>Such acquisitions of shares by a subsidiary are fundamentally different from the tax avoidance arrangements addressed by the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, to the extent that the acquisition is not for the benefit of the subsidiary, their quoted holding company or the holding company's shareholders.  It is wholly for the benefit of the life assurance policyholders of the subsidiary.  The subsidiary acquire the shares not on their own behalf but rather on behalf of the policyholders.</P>
    <P>The new section will ensure that where subsidiaries acquire shares in holding companies on behalf of policyholders, as managers of a life assurance fund, any premium paid over the issue price of the holding company shares will not be treated as a distribution of profits to the shareholders in the holding company. Accordingly, the subsidiary will not have to pay ACT where it acquires its holding company's shares in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 87 (4) of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, treats any amount distributed out of the assets of a 90 per cent subsidiary to the shareholders of its holding company as a &ldquo;distribution&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment of section 87, which is to have effect from the date of the enactment of the Insurance Act, 1990, <Col N="1890" /> sets out an exception to the treatment of acquisitions of holding company shares by subsidiaries as including a distribution of profits to the holding company's shareholders.</P>
    <P>The new paragraph (e) to be added to subsection (4) of section 87 will prevent a subsidiary from being treated as making a distribution by virtue of acquiring their quoted holding company's shares for the purposes of a life assurance policyholders' fund.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, prevents certain tax avoidance arrangements by treating any premium, over the issue price of the shares, paid by a subsidiary in acquiring their holding company's shares as a distribution of the subsidiary's profits &mdash; in the same way as if the subsidiary paid a dividend to the holding company's shareholders.  This results in an ACT liability for the subsidiary.</P>
    <P>There is no tax avoidance in the case of a life assurance subsidiary of a quoted holding company acquiring shares in the holding company for the benefit of their policyholders' life assurance fund.</P>
    <P>Any premia paid in such circumstances will not be treated as distributions of profits and no ACT will be payable.  This is to provide for Irish Life holding shares in their holding company in that kind of situation.</P>

      <P>This section ensures that goods sold into intervention will continue to be excluded from the meaning of goods for the purpose of manufacturing relief.  Section 41 of the Finance Act, 1990, among other things, defined meat processed within the State as goods for the purposes of manufacturing relief.  It was not intended, however, that this provision should override the long standing statutory exclusion of goods sold into intervention from the scope of the manufacturing relief scheme.  This section ensures that the exclusion of section 39 (3) (a) of the Finance Act, 1980, of goods sold into intervention from the meaning of goods for manufacturing relief shall continue notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) (c) (vi) inserted by <Col N="1892" /> section 41 of the Finance Act, 1990, of section 39, that certain meat processed within the State qualified as such goods.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not get it totally right last year.  The Finance Act, 1990, in section 41 provided that meat processed in certain premises will qualify for manufacturing relief.  Subsection (3) of section 39 of the Finance Act, 1980, stated that sales into intervention will not qualify for manufacturing relief.  Thus, in the case of meat which is processed in a qualifying factory but which is sold into intervention it can be argued that they are two contradictory provisions: one saying that manufacturing relief is due and another saying that manufacturing relief is not due.  Manufacturing relief was <Col N="1893" /> never given in respect of intervention sales nor was export sales relief given either.  This section merely restores the position to what it was prior to the enactment of the 1990 Finance Act, that is that sales of goods into intervention do not qualify for manufacturing relief.  In other words, there was ambiguity in that section last year, and this is to correct that ambiguity.  Sales into intervention were never believed to be in that category. There is an argument left as a result of last year's section, and this takes away the argument.</P>

      <P>No. Section 27 (2) deems a section to have come into effect as respects accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 1990.

      <P>My recollection is not as clear as the Deputy's.  Last year <Col N="1894" /> we may have been talking about two different situations.  In relation to the definition of &ldquo;manufacturing&rdquo;, meat is covered provided the work is carried on in qualifying premises, but intervention beef never qualified for export sales relief.  The definition of &ldquo;manufacturing&rdquo; is one thing but intervention sales of meat is quite another.  In the area of intervention the rate is 40 per cent as against 10 per cent and that is what I wanted to clear up.</P>

Is it possible, in enacting the Finance Bill, 1991, to bring in a measure the effect of which goes back over the preceding tax year?   We have just talked about not breaking faith with companies and the <Col N="1895" /> importance of being seen to be certain about what we are doing and so on.  If this ambiguity exists and if it is considered necessary to bring it forward, it would seem reasonable if one were in the business over the last year to claim manufacturing relief at the higher rate for goods going into intervention, and have a reasonable expectation of getting it.</P>

      <P>Every year we bring forward technical amendments to strengthen the Bill or to remove ambiguity or to put more certainty into tax legislation. It is never the intention that such ambiguity might arise.  It was not noticed.  This happens many times and will continue to happen because none of us is perfect and can produce sections which do not leave some room for argument.  It was never the intention that this ambiguity should arise and when somebody questioned the situation we decided to rectify it, to remove doubt.  It was never the intention to give this relief in relation to intervention beef anyway and anyone in the trade would know that intervention products have always been treated separately. There was a High Court case claiming export sales relief on intervention products some years ago.  The position was cleared up a long time ago.  This section is to make sure the old position stands. In other words, if a person is killing beef and putting it into intervention he is liable to 40 per cent corporate tax rate as against somebody who is killing beef, exporting it, or selling it otherwise, who is subject to a 10 per cent corporate tax rate.</P>

      <P>I would like to hear the Minister's argument for advancing this <Col N="1896" /> section.  What are the technical difficulties which might affect Shannon if this section was not brought forward?</P>
      <P>It is a bit disconcerting that we make up industrial policy &mdash; if the Minister will excuse the analogy &mdash; on the hoof.  Here we are again extending concessions that were intended to be temporary.  In sections 28 and 29 they are gradually becoming permanent.  They were good ideas at the time to stimulate employment and wealth creation in particular areas.  They were temporary measures designed for that purpose and now we are extending them.  Last year we extended the special manufacturing regime applying in respect of IDA industries. Meanwhile, we do not seem to be able to tackle the question of industrial policy in a comprehensive sense.  We are making tax arrangements irrespective of a more fundamental re-think that may be necessary as a result of current reviews of industrial policy.  It now looks as if the temporary measure in section 28 is becoming permanent.  I am not sure as to what are the technical difficulties which specifically affect the Shannon 10 per cent certification.  Can the Minister indicate more precisely who will benefit, or who will lose if this section is not brought forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the introduction of the Finance Act, 1990, there may have been doubt about whether the repair and maintenance of aircraft constituted manufacture for the purpose of a 10 per cent rate.  A company carrying out those activities in the Shannon Airport zone would have been entitled to receive a certificate under section 39A of the Finance Act, 1980, entitling them to the benefits of certification.  Section 41 of the Finance Act, 1990, made it clear that repair work did not constitute manufacture and specifically provided that the repair and maintenance of aircraft was to be treated as the manufacture of goods.  As certification under section 39A of the Finance Act, 1980, was available only to a company that was not otherwise entitled to the 10 per cent manufacturing rate, that provision had the unintended effect <Col N="1897" /> of disqualifying any Shannon company that carried out those activities from certification under section 39A of the Finance Act, 1980.  The provision restores the position so that the Minister for Finance is not prevented from issuing a certificate for an activity that is specifically referred to in the Shannon certificate legislation.  The new proposal for the Shannon zone will be a major beneficiary of that provision.  Deputy Rabbitte and all other Members would welcome that proposal, and would wish there were more like it.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Our region has a specific interest in the measure because of a proposal that could involve up to 2,000 jobs.  Shannon Aerospace are already training young people in the repair and refurbishment of aircraft. It is hoped that the progress already made by the organisation will continue. Work is being carried out on the site and young people are in Germany on training programmes.  If the project is the success that its promoters believe it will be, an enormous number of jobs will be created in the region.  Jobs are badly needed there.  I thank the Minister for bringing in the legislation and for removing any doubt that the project which is, like so many Shannon projects, tax driven, will not be ruled out through a technicality.</P>

      <P>We are all agreed on the seriousness of the unemployment rate.  I raised the point of whether it was the best approach to make things up as we go along.  I ask the Minister that again.</P>
      <P>When speaking to section 84, Deputy Quinn asked the Minister whether there was a strategy for the medium term.  He did not get a reply.  Under the provisions of section 28 and the extension in time from the year 2000 to 2005, does the Minister expect such an extension to be a permanent feature of the landscape rather than a temporary measure designed by the circumstances referred to by Deputy Noonan?  If we are all still here in five years, will the date be again extended, to 2010?  Does the Minister have a plan in that regard?</P>

      <P>It is not for me to enter a debate on industrial policy, new industrial policy, or revisions that might come into being.  That is a matter for another Minister in charge of another Department.  In relation to that strategy, as far as I am concerned I have made it clear that section 84 is being phased out, that accelerated capital allowances finish in April 1992, and that export sales relief has gone.  In other areas I have managed to get as close to the minimum corporate tax rate as possible.  That is the strategy, it is working and it is clearly shown to work.</P>
      <P>In relation to the extension of the 10 per cent rate for Shannon in the year 2005, it is not open for any Minister for Finance &mdash; not me nor anyone else &mdash; to speculate on what will happen beyond that time because that depends upon what will have to be done in regard to national incentives for industry.  That was renegotiated with the present Commissioner, Sir Leon Britten, for the financial services centre and the Shannon region.  There is no doubt that the issue will be examined before 2005.  It will also be studied under the whole revision of national incentives that is taking place at Commission level.  It is not open to anyone to speculate on what might happen after that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>My arguments in relation to this section are similar to those I have already made.  Could the Minister say why it is necessary to extend the period for the Custom House Docks area? I would like him to comment on the rate of success of that temporary arrangement &mdash; if I may describe it as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that would be the proper description for it. The measure provides for an extension to the period.  Section 39B of the Finance <Col N="1899" /> Act, 1980, enables certain certified training operations carried on in the Custom House Docks area in Dublin to qualify for manufacture relief.  The section extends the final date for qualification for manufacturing relief in the Custom House Docks area by substituting the new date of 31 December 2005, as approved by the EC, for the existing end date of 31 December 2000, provided in subsection 39B (2) of the Finance Act, 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for a little more information on the reason for making the extension. Could the Minister talk about the rate of success of the project and give the reason for now making the time extension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue arose over time.  It was decided that new projects would be considered.  If my recollection serves me correctly, they were to finish up at the end of the year.  That date had to be extended, otherwise the service would have had to withdraw from the marketplace and stop selling the centre as it stood.  I consider the measure to be a further extension and a major boost to the whole area of financial services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already about 165 companies, with a job retention of about 2,600, have been approved for the centre itself.  In relation to the Shannon extension, there are already 60 companies employing 1,479 staff &mdash; and that is only one sector of the Shannon zone, where the total employment figure is 5,000.  There are already 750 jobs in place in the financial services centre.  Nobody would deny that it has brought a regeneration of activity into that part of the city.  The operation is very successful.  It has attracted big names from around the world, providing jobs and revenue that would not otherwise have been provided.  It brings Dublin and Ireland into international focus.  It does not matter what part of the world one comes from in the financial services area now, one knows about the financial services centre in Dublin.  It will contribute significantly, not only in the creation of jobs but also in the provision of revenue. <Col N="1900" /> In reply to the question raised earlier by Deputy Noonan, I have some estimate figures on the financial services, corporate tax on which is probably running at about £25 million at the moment.  All in all, the centre is doing the job that it was put up to do and has certainly provided new growth in the economy.  It has a significant contribution to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking to section 29 and, to a certain extent, to section 30, I note that there seems to be an incremental increase in the time limits on both of those matters.  Again, could the Minister say whether there is a strategy?   In two or three years' time are we again likely to be extending the period from 2010 to 2020?  Is there a policy behind these amendments?  If so, what is the aggregate intent of that policy?</P>
      <P>In deference to the Chair and to the sanity of the debate, I shall not go into the fantasy of the number of jobs promised for creation in the construction of the financial services centre.  That belongs to a different Gubu period of literary fiction. In fact, the promises for 3,000 or 4,000 jobs on the site never came to pass. Members can go into that matter at another time.  In relation to section 29 and section 30, I ask what is the thinking behind the incremental increase, the reason for the extension, and whether there will be any other extensions.  Will there be a longer period in the years ahead and, if so, why do we not build it in now?  What is the policy strategic thinking behind these two changes, which must be taken together?</P>

These companies do not benefit this country and indeed distract attention from the need <Col N="1901" /> to develop indigenous industry based on home ownership and control.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there was a problem at EC level and, as part of the negotiations between Sir Leon Brittan and me, the 10 per cent tax rate was introduced in 1980 for the financial services sector.  That would have been a very short time for people to make investment decisions of the sort which have to be made in regard to the financial services centre and that is why I looked for an extention of time.  In reply to Deputy Quinn, it was an extremely tough battle to get it done this year and if it had not been for our high rate of unemployment and the discussions on peripherality, I am not sure that the EC would have acceded to it.  I do not know what will happen in the future but it certainly gives a new lease of life in that the lead time will be ten years or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Garland's suggestion would not benefit the economy, it is the weirdest thinking I have heard yet.  Multinational companies, to a large extent, have come to Ireland to transact normal banking business.  If the financial services centre did not exist, Mitsubishi, Trust or Commerzbank in Germany would not have come.  It is incremental business as far as our economy is concerned.  It will create decent revenue and jobs which would not otherwise have been created in the growth area of international financial services. The whole strategic thinking behind it was to grab a section of that growth in relation to which Ireland was ideally situated.  We have the telecommunications infrastructure and the right time zone; people are coming out of third level colleges and going to New York and London financial centres to <Col N="1902" /> make a living.  Who would begrudge them the opportunity to earn their livelihoods here?   Ancillary services will also benefit. To suggest that our economy will not benefit is not living in the real world.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In page 38, before section 32, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;32. &mdash;Section 25 (as amended by section 38 of the Finance Act, 1990), of the Finance Act, 1989, shall have effect as respects dividends paid on or after the 6th day of April, 1991, as if in subsection (3) (a) for &lsquo;6th day of April, 1991&rsquo; there was substituted '6th day of April, 1992&rsquo;:</P>
      <P>Provided that a company shall not be entitled, by virtue of this section, to specify, in accordance with subsection (1) of the said section 25, that a distribution, being an interim dividend, or part of it is to be treated as made for the accounting period in which it is made where&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  the circumstances of the company are such that, if the distribution or the part of it, as the case may be, were treated as made for the accounting period in which it is made the company would be unable, at the time when the interim dividend is paid, to determine without recourse to estimation, how much of the distribution or the part of it, as the case may be, would, in accordance with <Col N="1903" /> subsection (1) of section 45 (as amended by section 24 of the Finance Act, 1989) of the Finance Act, 1980, be treated as a specified distribution for the purposes of subsection (2) of the said section 45, or</P>
    <P>(b)  that treatment of the distribution or the part of it, as the case may be, as made for the accounting period in which it is made, would facilitate any arrangement whereby the tax credit in respect of a dividend received by a shareholder could exceed the tax credit, if any, in respect of a dividend received by another shareholder notwithstanding that the shareholdings of those shareholders carry the same or substantially similar rights in respect of dividends and capital.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Company profits are effectively subject to a double charge to tax.  They are charged to corporation tax in the hands of the company and then to income tax as dividends in the hands of shareholders. Tax credits attaching to dividends give a measure of relief from the double taxation of such income.</P>
    <P>The credit given to the shareholder for corporation tax paid by the company is equal to half of the corporation tax paid on the profits represented by the dividend. The other half of the corporation tax is the company's net contribution to the Exchequer in paying such tax.</P>
    <P>Since the tax credit attaching to a dividend is equal to half of the corporation tax paid on the profits paid out by the company, the rate at which the company paid corporation tax on the profits will make a substantial difference to the amount of the tax credit.  Clearly the tax credit in respect of a dividend paid out of profits charged at 40 per cent will be greater than the tax credit attaching to a dividend paid out of profits charged at 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Where there is a mix of 10 per cent and 40 per cent profits in a company, the tax credit in respect of a dividend paid out of those profits will be made up of a similar mix of 10 per cent and 40 per cent tax <Col N="1904" /> credits.  In general, therefore, dividends are treated as paid out of the profits of completed years of account so that the mix of 10 per cent profits and 40 per cents profits is known for the purposes of calculating the tax credit.</P>
    <P>There are companies which will know the precise mix of 10 per cent and 40 per cent income for a year well before the year is over.  Examples of such companies would include most IFSC companies whose income is all charged at 10 per cent and most holding companies which can restrict their receipt of 10 per cent and 40 per cent income in any year from the reserves of subsidiaries to specific amounts agreed in advance.</P>
    <P>Such companies will have no problem calculating tax credits in respect of an interim dividend on the basis of the mix of 10 per cent and 40 per cent income in the year in which the dividend is paid and which is not yet over.  In recognition of this, section 32 will allow such companies elect to calculate the tax credit attaching to an interim dividend on the basis of the corporation tax which will be payable for the year in which the dividend is paid.  In this way the interim dividend tax credit will reflect the corporation tax payable on the profits out of which the dividend is actually paid.  However, there are companies with income charged at both 10 per cent and 40 per cent who could not predict the final mix of that income for any year before the end of the year. Accurate calculation of tax credits for interim dividends for such companies on the basis of current profits is simply not possible.  Accordingly, such companies will have to base those calculations on the finalised mix of profits for preceding, completed years of account.</P>
    <P>In addition, companies which would obtain assistance for certain &ldquo;dual-share&rdquo; arrangements, which are under review by officials of my Department in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners, will not be allowed elect for &ldquo;current-year&rdquo; treatment of interim dividends. The arrangements in question involve different rates of tax credit being paid in respect of the same dividend, depending on the shareholder receiving <Col N="1905" /> the dividend.  Such arrangements seek to maximize tax benefits to shareholders in an unintended way at the expense of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Section 32 prohibits companies from using the extension of &ldquo;current year treatment&rdquo; provided by the section for the purposes of such arrangements.</P>
    <P>The main provision of section 32 extends until 6 April 1992 a company's option to elect to treat an interim dividend as paid out of the profits of the year in which it is paid &mdash; for the purposes of calculating the tax credit to be carried by the dividend.</P>
    <P>The proviso excludes two categories of company from the one year extension of current year treatment of interim dividends.</P>
    <P>The rules for calculating tax credits in respect of dividends essentially involve three steps, (a) treat the dividend as paid out of the distributable income of a particular year, (b) establish the mix of income taxed at 40 per cent and income taxed at 10 per cent in that year, and (c) give the dividend the same mix of 40 per cent and 10 per cent tax credits.  There are companies for which step (b) &mdash; establishing the mix of 10 per cent and 40 per cent income &mdash; will not be possible until after the end of any year.  Calculating tax credits for interim dividends by reference to the expected mix of 10 per cent and 40 per cent income of a year not yet ended involves such companies in estimation.  They cannot calculate tax credits on that basis &ldquo;without recourse to estimation&rdquo;.  Such companies will not be allowed avail of the extension of the option to treat interim dividends as paid out of current profits for tax purposes. However, they will continue to be able to choose to treat the dividends as paid out of the profits of any of a number of years ending before the payment of the dividend.</P>
    <P>It would appear that some companies are offering &ldquo;dual shares&rdquo; to their shareholders as part of an arrangement intended to give tax benefits to their shareholders at minimum cost to the <Col N="1906" /> company and therefore maximum cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>A &ldquo;dual share&rdquo; is a £1 ordinary share in respect of which a 1p bonus share has been issued.  If the shareholder so elects, he will receive his annual dividends paid on the &ldquo;penny&rdquo; shares with a full 25/75ths tax credit.  The well informed institutional investors who do so will be entitled to have the tax credit paid to them by the Exchequer.  Although the company have to pay advance corporation tax, ACT, to match the tax credit, the tax exempt institutional shareholders will receive a payment of the full tax credit from the State.</P>
    <P>Individual shareholders who make no such election will fare equally well in receiving the same dividend paid on the £1 ordinary shares.  The same net dividend will in their case carry not a 25/75th but rather a 1/18th tax credit.  To the extent that the section would facilitate such arrangements by a company, that company will not be entitled to exercise the option provided by the section.</P>
    <P>In summary, section 32 will allow companies to opt for another year to treat interim dividends as paid out of current profits for the purpose of calculating tax credits.  The proviso rules out that option (a) where the company exercising it would be unable to calculate tax credits attaching to their dividends accurately on the current profits basis and (b) where it would assist the company in arrangements designed to target tax benefits to institutional and individual shareholders at maximum cost to the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 95:</P>
      <P>In page 39, before section 35, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;35.&mdash;(1) In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;agency&rsquo; means a charitable body providing development aid or emergency relief in developing countries and designated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs by order made under this section;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;tax&rsquo; means income tax or corporation tax, as the case may be.</P>
      <P>(2)  This section applies to a gift of money which, on or after the 6th day of April, 1990, is made to an agency and is not deductible in computing for the purposes of tax the profits or gains of a trade or profession or is not income to which the provisions of section 439 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, apply.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Revenue Commissioners may consult with an agency in relation to any question which may arise in connection with subsection (2).</P>
      <P>(4)  Where a person proves he has made a gift to which this section applies and claims relief from tax by reference thereto, the provisions of subsection (5) or, as the case may be, subsection (6) shall apply:</P>
      <P>Provided that in determining the net amount of the gift for the purposes of those subsections, the amount or value of any consideration received by the said person as a result of making the gift, whether received directly or indirectly from an agency or any other person, shall be deducted from the amount of the gift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  For the purposes of income tax for the year of assessment in which a person makes a gift to which this section applies, the net amount thereof shall, subject to subsection (6), be deducted from or set off against any income of the person chargeable to income tax for that year and tax shall, <Col N="1909" /> where necessary, be discharged or repaid accordingly; and the total income of the person or, where the person is a wife whose husband is assessed to income tax in accordance with the provisions of section 194 (inserted by the Finance Act, 1980) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, the total income of the husband shall be calculated accordingly:</P>
    <P>Provided that relief under this Act shall not be given to a person for a year of assessment if the gift (or the aggregate of the net amounts of gifts) made by him in that year, being a gift or gifts, as the case may be, to which this section applies, does not exceed £100.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where a gift to which this section applies is made by a company&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the net amount thereof shall, for the purposes of corporation tax, be deemed to be a loss incurred by the company in a separate trade in the accounting period of the company in which the gift is made, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the references in subsection (5) to a year of assessment shall be construed as references to an accounting period of the company.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The intent of this amendment is quite clear.  It attempts to ensure that charitable organisations such as Concern, Goal, or any such body which provides development aid or emergency relief in Third World countries benefit from corporate contributions which may be claimed against tax.  There is an advertisement in <i>The Irish Times</i> today which states that the Publicity Club of Ireland intend to pay due tribute to Mr. John O'Shea of Goal.  He is just one of the many people who have responded to the instincts of the Irish nation's concern for the Third World.</P>
    <P>During the years we have failed badly to meet the United Nations' target. Indeed, during the term of office of the present Coalition and that of their predecessors we have gone backwards in relation to our commitment to increase <Col N="1910" /> ODA.  I suggest that this is one way of tapping into the compassion, charity and the sense of solidarity which Irish people have for The Third World.  I know that it would broaden the tax base and runs counter to the arguments offered previously but consistency is not something that this House is renowned for.  There is a good reason for considering it.  I do not think this is the first time such an amendment has been considered.  I await the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn's amendment proposes tax relief for donations to charities which provide development aid or emergency relief in developing countries.</P>
      <P>I would share the Deputy's concern about the plight of those in the Third World and I am sure that all Deputies will join with me in paying tribute to the tremendous work done by Third World charities.  I am glad to say that in 1991 £43.7 million has been allocated for official development assistance, representing an increase of some £9 million over 1990.  This amount includes grants for educational, agricultural and infrastructural projects on a bilateral basis, mostly in Africa, as well as contributions to multilateral agencies such as the United Nations, and this now brings our overseas development assistance up to 0.18 per cent of GNP.</P>
      <P>The provision will enable us to meet all the mandatory commitments for this year and also to increase the value of our bilateral aid in real terms.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that the Government's policy remains one of commitment to the maintenance and expansion of overseas development assistance as soon as economic circumstances permit.  However, the continuing serious budgetary and economic problems facing the country make it impossible for the Government at this stage to expand the aid programme to the United Nations' target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While our overseas development assistance contributions have been given in the form of financial assistance, we <Col N="1911" /> should not forget the immense unofficial contribution made by the many Irish voluntary workers overseas, as well as the voluntary contributions made by the Irish public.</P>
    <P>However, as a Government we have gone to the limit on what we can afford, and to give tax concessions of the type suggested would represent a very real additional cost to the Exchequer which could not be afforded in the present budgetary situation and if conceded would, of course, have to be recovered elsewhere.  Everyone will agree that our current levels of tax are too high and I am very reluctant to look for more revenue from any source to make up the deficiency.  We are trying to widen the tax base, not narrow it.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, Deputies will appreciate that I am not in a position to make the concessions sought by Deputy Quinn.</P>

    <P>This is a technical amendment which simply ensures that the definition of &ldquo;qualifying assets&rdquo; contained in paragraph (b) of section 36 of the Bill, includes an amendment to the text of <Col N="1912" /> that definition which was provided for in section 84 of the Finance Act, 1990.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2) The amount specified in subsection (1) (a) shall be increased each year by the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index in the period ending November of the previous year.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is self-explanatory.  The present subsection effectively increases the previous threshold.  I am suggesting that we be consistent in this instance and link it to the price index.  I am wondering what the Minister's response is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of his comments yesterday, I am somewhat surprised that Deputy Quinn has proposed this amendment.  He seeks in this amendment to link to the consumer price index the limit of £200,000 on the consideration received on disposal of assets in order to qualify for relief under section 27 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975.  The threshold has stood at £50,000 since 1975 and is now being increased to the more realistic figure of £200,000.  The figure provided in section 36 is adequate to meet present needs and to encourage the transfer of enterprise to younger and more dynamic hands.</P>
      <P>To tie the limit to the consumer price index may appear to give certainty to taxpayers.  However, it would also tie the Government's hands in the event of a difficult budgetary situation.  If it was found necessary in such circumstances to change the legislation it would have achieved nothing more than raising false expectations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that periodic reviews, taking the wider policy issues into consideration, <Col N="1913" /> are the way to approach the issue.  The threshold will be kept at an appropriate level in this way.  I do not see the value in providing for an inflexible approach and, accordingly, I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This section relates to the vitality and vibrancy of small family owned businesses in this economy, a sector that is being very dramatically ignored and abandoned by successive administrations.  We only have to look at the dynamism in the economy of northern Italy to see the potential resource that family-owned businesses offer to this economy.  We have concentrated exclusively, in my estimation, on multinational companies and on large plcs here and have not given the kind of sensitive hands-on support that family companies require.  I welcome the Minister's amendment in so far as his response does realistically lift the threshold and, therefore, enables a transition, not just of ownership, but of managerial decision-making and power.  I am sure the Minister can relate to the concerns I am expressing. If the Minister is prepared to say the threshold will be kept under regular review and that the figure of £200,000 will not become an impediment &mdash; there are other areas that were the subject of a very interesting seminar that was cosponsored by one of our newspapers &mdash; I would be prepared to withdraw my amendment.  However, a marker should be put down by the Labour Party that we see small and medium-sized enterprises in general, but family-owned enterprises in particular, as enterprises that have been neglected to the detriment of the vibrancy of this economy.</P>

The seminar to which the Minister referred identified a number of impediments.  I would not expect the Minister to deal <Col N="1915" /> with all of them in one go but may I take it from what the Minister said that his Department are aware of these impediments and are prepared to look at them with a view to having self-imposed constraints removed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This section deals with the artistic world and gives certain exemption to people who loan artistic works to the State, provided they are in a place that is open to the public for a period of six years.  It is the kind of section politicians will rush to support.  None of us would like to be called a philistine and I will not be opposing the section because I do not want to be stamped as a philistine.  However, I should like to put forward a philistine argument for the purposes of debate which the Minister may reflect on between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people who invest in works of art, the same way as people invest in any commodity, whether it is hogs, cotton, olive oil, alumina, tin, copper or currency they are going to buy into it.  I am thinking in particular about paintings because it is the area where there is most value.  People are buying paintings as an investment and are buying on a capital gains.  People are buying paintings who would not know the back of a picture from the front of it.  At least the ultimate <Col N="1916" /> owner of the picture would have no particular interest in the artistic merits of it; it is simply another commodity.  A painting valued at, say, £200,000 at present day prices &mdash; that example was brought to my attention &mdash; could have been bought ten years ago for £15,000. In six years' time it could be worth about £400,000.  When one allows for inflation, under the present tax code the capital gains tax that would apply would apply on the sum of £250,000.  A painting bought at £25,000, now worth £200,000, in six years' time could be worth £400,000.  If the owner gives it to the State, it is hung in the National Gallery, in the Minister's office or any place to which the public have access for six years the tax break will be huge.  I have no problem with the tax break for people who own artistic works and who want to lend them to the State so that they are not locked up in a vault or under the kind of security in a house which we know has to be put in place to ensure that artistic works are not stolen. To bring these paintings to the public notice for their enjoyment is great.  But, on the other hand, if this is simply to be used as a method of avoiding capital gains tax by people who have no particular interest in the arts, it is a different kettle of fish.  I want to point out that the potential for avoidance of capital gains tax is very great indeed.  I have no doubt it will encourage investment in the arts and in artistic artefacts here and they will be loaned to the State.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another point I touched on.  From reading the newspapers, it would seem that it is increasingly difficult to have valuable artistic works hanging in private homes &mdash; I say &ldquo;hanging&rdquo; because I am thinking of pictures rather than other works of art &mdash; because there are enormous security problems.  We are led to believe that there is an international ring operating in Ireland at present who are stealing pictures on commission, if certain reports are true, and almost stealing paintings to order.  There are advantages for people who possess valuable works of art and give them to the State for six years, the State will have to pick up the bill for <Col N="1917" /> security, there is a big tax advantage and, I presume, the State will also have to insure the works of art in their possession over the six year period.  I have no doubt that it will encourage investment in the arts and artistic artefacts which will be lent to the State.</P>
    <P>This section has very big advantages. Even though the thrust of my comments has been about paintings, of course, it would not apply just to paintings.  The section says that this provision will apply to any picture, print, book, manuscript, sculpture, piece of jewellery or work of art.  Would a piece of antique furniture be considered to be a work of art?  Is the section drafted to include antiques which, it can be argued, are works of art?  I want to ask the Minister, first, what the scope of the section will be and, second, if he has taken into account the fact that while art is for all our enjoyment &mdash; a thing of beauty is a joy forever &mdash; some people regard it as a commodity to be bought and sold, something which can preserve the value of money.  They will regard this provision as a risk free mechanism for securing their asset at State expense over a six year period and avoiding the payment of capital gains tax, which is very important.</P>
    <P>If we are to accept this section, I should like to make a comment from the other end of the argument.  While a limit of £25,000 is reasonable for paintings.  perhaps it is too high for other works of art. It is suggested in a submission made to me that in the case of period furniture, jewellery, china, glass, books, prints, manuscripts and other works of art a ceiling of £3,000 would be appropriate. I am advised that artistic objects along the lines I have mentioned of great value can be bought for £3,000 or more.  By pitching the value at £25,000 for every category listed in the opening sentence of this section, one might cut out many acquisitions which would be very desirable and add to our store of national treasures.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister between now and Report Stage to look at the implications for tax avoidance which he is opening up, and which are very real indeed.  Secondly, <Col N="1918" /> he should look at the section to see if it can be redrafted so that there would be different ceilings for different artistic areas.  While the limit of £25,000 might be appropriate for paintings it is not necessarily appropriate for a book or manuscript, even though it might be of great cultural value to the State and the people of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious that it is almost 12.30 p.m., at which time these matters have to be disposed of.  I think we will hear much about this section on Saturday afternoon when the Taoiseach, the cultural Tsar of this nation, will make great play of it.  I welcome the inclusion of this provision.  We should let it sit for the first year or so to see how it works. It is to be welcomed that our visual art heritage is appreciating in value, particularly in the international world, a recognition we previously did not give ourselves.  There was a certain view that while there was a great literary tradition and skill in this country that there was no visual or plastic arts tradition, skill or competence here.  I think that is no longer the case.</P>
      <P>I want to say to Deputy Noonan that this provision will require a museum or gallery to accept such a work of art.  We are not talking about thousands of institutions in the State; realistically they could be counted on the fingers of one person.  Therefore, the ability to exploit this provision will be constrained by the fact that a work has to be accepted by a museum or museums.  While I accept the concern Deputy Noonan has about the abuse of this provision, I think it can be very carefully monitored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the year when Dublin holds the title of European City of Culture we need to increase the store of cultural assets in the city.  Cultural tourism is increasingly a major asset for employment, particularly among people with low skills.  Dublin is a European capital city which could benefit from an increase in its number of cultural venues, including the Museum of Modern Art which will be opened on Saturday. The revenue generated within Paris, Rome or Glasgow, which has the Birrell <Col N="1919" /> Museum and which attracts an enormous number of visitors, is an indication of the macro-economic effects a measure like this might have.</P>
    <P>I welcome this provision and perhaps on Report Stage the Minister will be able to give us a response on it.  We should watch how the provision operates over the next few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan is to be congratulated for breaking the taboo we all feel about being branded as Philistines when we want to be like the Taoiseach, who has acquired the reputation of <i>lo roi de soleil</i> in his nearby sun palace.</P>
      <P>A very serious point has been raised by Deputy Noonan and there is no doubt, especially with this exemption limit, that works of art are bought and sold as commodities. It will be interesting to see how this provision will operate.  It is certainly much better to allow a work of art to be available for public access in a gallery or museum for a period of six years rather than availing of the current offer from An Post to put your few bob into post office bonds.  The deprivation a person will suffer from for five or six years will not be great either, particularly if he belongs to the section of purchasers who do not know whether a painting is hung up side down or otherwise.  This provision will not do anything for struggling living artists whose work as of yet is a long way off the threshold set in this section.  It will not encourage people who have the finance at their disposal to purchase works of art from struggling, living Irish artists.  It will not encourage people to put their money into that area as distinct from the quality art envisaged in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Noonan raised this point as there are questions that can be asked about it.  This provision will unquestionably be used as a tax shelter. For all our talk about broadening the base and giving relief to the PAYE sector, when we look at what we have <Col N="1920" /> done so far on the corporation tax section and the capital gains tax section we can see that all we have done is give additional reliefs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This section seeks to encourage people to make works of art available to the general public, who will benefit from their display.  As Deputy Quinn said, this area can and will be monitored.  I will look at some of the points raised by Deputy Noonan between now and Report Stage.  I think it will be a case of monitoring the operation of this provision.  It will not apply all over the country.  I expect there will only be a relatively small number of museums involved, which will have to be approved and monitored by the Revenue Commissioners. It will be a matter of learning from experience but in general terms it will give some impetus to increasing people's appreciation of art, which, as Deputy Rabbitte said, can only serve to help struggling artists who have not yet reached the pinnacle of their careers.  In the Year of European Culture it is some recognition that we are indeed conscious of what needs to be done and, hopefully, it will help those museums to draw more attention and get more people's appreciation for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>On the role of Temple Bar Renewal Limited, as I said on Second Stage the aim of the tax incentive package for Temple Bar is that existing buildings in the area should be refurbished and conserved in a manner which maintained their character, that new construction will only be allowed where it complements the architecture of the area and that the activities to be <Col N="1925" /> encouraged in the area would be those which are in keeping with its ambience. In order to ensure that this happens, a special role is being given to Temple Bar Renewal Limited, and the approval of this company will be necessary before refurbishment or any new construction expenditure can qualify for the special tax reliefs.  This procedure is wholly appropriate in the circumstances of the tax incentives package for Temple Bar.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners would not have the knowledge or the expertise required to decide whether or not particular construction or refurbishment work would be in keeping with the character and fabric of the area.  On the other hand Temple Bar Renewal Limited, which is chaired by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, has a board of directors which is made up of high ranking officials of Government Departments, municipal and other State bodies and members of Temple Bar Development Council who represent people from the area itself.</P>
      <P>Given the composition of the board of directors of the company, it can be safely assumed that only projects which will contribute in the right manner to the revitalisation and development of the area will be approved by Temple Bar Renewal Limited.  There can be no suggestion that ill-conceived projects will gain approval for tax purposes.  Furthermore, under the terms of the forthcoming Temple Bar Renewal and Development Bill, Temple Bar Renewal Limited will be required to lay their decisions before both Houses of the Oireachtas for their information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The involvement of a body other than the Revenue Commissioners in approval of tax reliefs is not without precedent. For example, under the BES legislation if a company carrying on qualifying tourist activities wish to raise BES funding, they must first obtain Bord Fáilte approval for a three-year marketing and development plan.  Similarly, to qualify for section 84 lending, a company must be on the list approved by the IDA.  I would add that the Revenue Commissioners will, of course, be the final arbiters as regards <Col N="1926" /> compliance with the terms of the Temple Bar legislation in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>There are two companies involved: Temple Bar Renewal Limited, a company chaired by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, to be the policy company referred to in the Finance Bill, and Temple Bar Properties Limited, which will be the property development company; both will be provided for in the Temple Bar Area Development Bill, which the Taoiseach has said will come to the Oireachtas shortly.  So far as I know it is at the final stage of drafting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not repeat what I said rather extensively on Second Stage, but it is very hard to evaluate the effectiveness of these very generous measures if the Bill, for which no doubt the Minister for Finance will have an input, does not clarify a certain set of specific procedural relationships.  In other parts of Dublin city different sets of officials are second guessing, improving and in some cases setting up contradictory impediments in the way of a particular project. Let me be precise.  The Minister said in reply that the Temple Bar Renewal Company will have a role in evaluating the architectural suitability of a particular project.  If that project subsequently has to go for planning permission to Dublin Corporation another set of officials, who will not necessarily agree with the officials in the Temple Bar Renewal Limited, may determine that in their view it is not architecturally suitable.  If a ring is drawn around this extensive area of Dublin city where planning permission will not be required and if it is to be administered in a manner similar to the Custom House Docks area, then that eliminates a possibility for conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another area of conflict that is even much worse than that to which I have referred, that is in relation to the application and the administration of building by-laws.  The situation in this area is outrageous, and in deference to the time constraints I will not take up the time of the House.  There is something that is less predictable in terms of its outcome than the prospect of winning <Col N="1927" /> the Lotto in relation to getting a clear response from the building control section of Dublin Corporation because they are trying to adjudicate between different kinds of by-law approvals.  The tax incentives are heavily geared towards encouraging the owners of an existing property to refurbish that property, and all the benefits of the tax allowances are geared in that way, which I welcome &mdash; that was a weakness in the original designated areas &mdash; but you will not be able to renew existing buildings unless you get a specific set of exemptions from the building by-laws control section of Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The building by-laws themselves, which are the statutory instruments that currently apply have been superseded by the draft building regulations, which still do not have the effect of law because the Building Control Act has not established the mechanism for their administration. In other words, there is an immensely complex, Byzantine, bureaucratic mine-field and if it is not cleared in advance through the legislation to give effect to these provisions &mdash; because these provisions do not come into play until the legislative bodies come into it &mdash; then the positive intent will be very seriously frustrated.  I do not know if that point has been adequately made by other people.  It is not an inspired, original point; anybody who knows the territory will understand it, but I would like to hear the thinking of the Minister for Finance on this matter and what action he proposes to take in relation to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposals in the Finance Bill for the Temple Bar area. When we were drawing up the draft development plan at the initial stages I, and a colleague of mine, moved that the buildings in Temple Bar be listed.  That was the first interest that anyone had in the Temple Bar area three years ago, but since then everyone has taken a great interest in it, including the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance.  There are tax incentives now for a number of areas in Dublin including the designated areas, <Col N="1928" /> the Custom House Docks site area and now the Temple Bar area.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the incentives for development in the inner city, it takes from development outside these areas. What other role will Dublin Corporation have &mdash; with the exception of the Lord Mayor &mdash; in this matter?  Deputy Quinn has pointed out that the Custom House Docks do not have to seek planning permission from Dublin Corporation, they merely have to notify Dublin Corporation of what they intend to do and ask the planning authority to rubber stamp it.  Will the new council which the Minister is setting up for Temple Bar be a planning authority in their own right for the Temple Bar area or will they be subject to the local authority?  Will any of the elected members of Dublin City Council, with the exception of the Lord Mayor, be on the council for the Temple Bar area?</P>

      <P>I appreciate that these matters will have to come before the House again, so I will not go into them in detail.  However, in section 48 the area described as the Temple Bar area is set out in the Second Schedule and it specifically excludes the area currently owned by Dublin Corporation civic offices.  It is bounded by Fishamble Street, Winetavern Street and Wood Quay.  The success of the Temple Bar area necessities the provision of two large car parks.  A cursory examination of the property shows that there is no available space, with one or two exceptions, on which to build the kind of multi-storey car park that would be needed to give the throughput of numbers to make this a success. The only cleared area, which has already destroyed or excavated, depending on which word one wants to use, the archaeological remains that once were there, is the notorious property owned by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the taxation provisions which generally apply for a multi-storey car park apply to a car park that could be built adjacent to the designated area?  Looking <Col N="1930" /> at this project from the point of view of including provision for a large car park, which is generally conceded to be necessary, there is no space in the area designated attached to section 48.  The nearest space available is owned by Dublin Corporation which, if the grand design is to be completed, would hold two more of those nuclear, bunker-type office blocks, but nobody would seriously advocate that.  It is currently used as a car park.  This is an obvious opportunity to include it and the beneficiary would be the State.  I am not sure if an operator coming in to build a multi-storey car park in that area would gain the various tax reliefs specified in other sections.  If they would not, I invite the Minister to consider the matter before coming back on Report Stage, to extend the Schedule to include the property owned exclusively by Dublin Corporation, in other words, to move the boundary westwards from Fishamble Street to Winetavern Street.</P>

      <P>We all accept that we will have another opportunity to deal with the detail of this.  I am a long time non-executive director in a company in this area.  What is the Minister's response to the view that a less lavish package of incentives would in any event have boosted this area which is on the way up, and that it will now be developed at the cost of other designated areas in the city where the existing incentives have not worked, and that they in fact will slip into further dereliction whereas this area will be boosted unnecessarily?  On the question of the discretion as to who qualifies for relief, who will ultimately make the decision?  The shares will be vested in the Taoiseach.  Does that imply that ultimately the Taoiseach will make the decision?  It is unfair to put any Taoiseach in a situation where ultimately he will <Col N="1931" /> make the decision about who will benefit from the reliefs.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General in his report on the performance of the BES scheme was extremely critical of the lack of monitoring, of the lack of any independent authority to say what value for money was given as a result of the BES.  Is it envisaged that there will be an independent body, for instance the Revenue Commissioners, to monitor progress and to give this House some kind of report other than what we get directly from the companies concerned about value for money and the progress on projects envisaged here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the car parks, one car park is already designated by Dublin Corporation on an ESB/Bank of Ireland site and another is being considered in the area between Fishamble Street and Parliament Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the generosity of the tax incentives package, the development of the Temple Bar area has been undertaken by the Government on the basis of unanimous proposals and recommendations made by Temple Bar Renewal Ltd., which represents people from the area, in Dublin Corporation's action plan for the area and by representative groups chaired by the two most recent Lords Mayor of Dublin.  The development also has the support of the Arts Council, which will eventually be involved in its implementation.  The special tax reliefs scheme provided for Temple Bar are generous.  They represent a significant contribution to architectural conservation.  I reject any contention that the reliefs are over-generous. The needs of the area require a particular set of incentives.  These have been devised after a lot of consideration and following advice from expert groups. The tax incentives are tailor-made for the Temple Bar area.  For the first time on the urban renewal front the Government have shifted the balance in favour of refurbishment and against construction, something this area requires.  I do not see how anyone can object to this approach, <Col N="1932" /> since refurbishment is the key to the sensitive development of the Temple Bar. The application of the incentives will be selective and will require the approval of Temple Bar Renewal Ltd. and, in the final analysis, the Revenue Commissioners will determine whether or not people have complied with the law.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 100:</P>
      <P>In page 48, subsection (1) (a), line 9, after &ldquo;section 48 (3)&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;, if paragraph (a) of the definition of &lsquo;qualifying premises&rsquo; in subsection (1) of the said section 42 had not been enacted&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments relate to the application of accelerated capital allowances and double rent allowance to certain industrial buildings in the Temple Bar Area.  In the Bill as published, section 49 provides that accelerated capital allowances will be given in respect of expenditure incurred on the refurbishment of existing commercial buildings and on the construction of new commercial buildings in Temple Bar.  The section also provides that a double rent deduction will be granted as an expense in computing trading profits for tax purposes to a trader renting either a newly constructed or a refurbished commercial building.</P>
      <P>Section 49 excludes industrial buildings from these tax allowances.  This was indicative of the active discrimination which Temple Bar Renewal Limited would exercise in their role of approving suitable developments as eligible for the special tax reliefs.  Large warehouses, factories and similar industrial buildings were to be discouraged as not being in keeping with the character and intended development of Temple Bar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On reconsideration, it has been realised that this blanket exclusion of industrial buildings would also affect certain categories of activities which it is felt should be encouraged in the overall plan for the Temple Bar Area; for example, small workshops and craft manufacturing, the premises of which would <Col N="1934" /> be classed as industrial buildings for tax purposes.  It is accepted that newly constructed craft workshops or existing buildings in Temple Bar which are refurbished for such activites could, if in keeping with the character and fabric of the area &mdash; and this question would be a matter for Temple Bar Renewal Limited to decide &mdash; have a significant role to play in the revitalisation of the area.</P>
    <P>To achieve this it is necessary to amend section 49 to ensure that certain industrial buildings may, at the discretion of Temple Bar Renewal Limited, qualify for the reliefs available in respect of approved non-industrial buildings, namely, accelerated capital allowances and the double rent deduction.  These amendments reflect the criteria, which are included in the Temple Bar Area Development Bill, for approval of the construction or refurbishment of buildings or premises by Temple Bar Renewal Limited.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to section 49 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 49 provides in Clause (II) of subsection (2) (b) (ii) for the extension to Temple Bar of the owner-occupier allowance in respect of expenditure incurred on residential buildings.  As Deputies will know, such an allowance already exists in the other designated areas.  The section provides that expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of a building in the Temple Bar Area which is first used after construction or refurbishment as the sole or main residence of the individual who incurred the expenditure will qualify for tax allowances by way of a deduction from the individual's total assessable income.  In the case of new residential buildings in Temple Bar the allowance granted is the same as that given in the other designated areas, that is, 50 per cent available at 5 per cent per year for ten years.  For refurbished residential buildings in <Col N="1936" /> Temple Bar, however, the section allows a 100 per cent accelerated allowance.</P>
    <P>Views have been expressed that this 100 per cent allowance is excessive, particularly in being so front-loaded &mdash; the entire cost of a refurbished residential premises could be set off against income tax in year one.  I accept that the 100 per cent once-off tax allowance in respect of expenditure incurred by owner-occupiers on the refurbishment of residential premises in the Temple Bar area is indeed too generous.  In addition, the fact that the full allowance is available in year one does not act as an incentive for residents to remain in the area &mdash; and, after all, that is one of the principal objectives of the whole package of reliefs.  Accordingly, the Government have decided that instead of a full 100 per cent allowance being available in year one, the 100 per cent allowance should be given in increments of 10 per cent over ten years. Furthermore, as is the position with relief on expenditure incurred by owner-occupiers on residential premises in other designated areas, the yearly allowance will be available only for each year in which the premises is the sole or main residence of the individual who incurred the expenditure. The allowance will thus be spread out in a manner reflecting the relief available in the case of new residential premises in Temple Bar.  The amendment will also emphasise the concept of a commitment by owner-occupiers of residential buildings in Temple Bar to remain in the area.</P>

      <P>This amendment, which is of a technical nature, relates to the proviso to subsection 49 (2) (b).  Its purpose is to ensure that site cost is excluded from the market value as of 1 January 1991 of premises in the Temple Bar Area when that amount falls to be included with the amount of refurbishment expenditure on premises on which tax relief is to be given.</P>
      <P>The proviso to section 49 (2) (b) deems capital expenditure incurred on a refurbished commercial building or the expenditure incurred on a refurbished owner-occupied residential building to include the lesser of the purchase price paid for the building, exclusive of site cost, or its market value as at 1 January 1991, on condition that the refurbishment expenditure is at least equal to the purchase price or market value, whichever is relevant. This amendment ensures that for the purposes of the tax reliefs valuations of buildings as at 1 January 1991 will not be dealt with on the same basis as the determination of the amount of the purchase price of a building the purchase cost and market value must each be calculated exclusive of site value.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that the Minister considers this lavish package to be necessary.  The removal of the ring-fencing, as I understand it, applies not only to the Temple Bar Area but also to other designated areas in the city and to the Custom House Docks site as well. Why does the Minister consider it necessary to remove the ring-fencing?  In other words, there can be a setoff not only against income from the refurbished building but also against income from any other building in the designated area.  I do not understand the reason for such a wide provision.  It is difficult enough, if not impossible, to estimate the loss to the Exchequer of tax incentives of this kind. The BES has proved that.  I fail to understand the necessity for that provision.  It seems to be very much overgenerous.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> To go back to the point made by Deputy Rabbitte, I presume income arising from rent for properties outside designated areas can be claimed against residential accommodation built under the reliefs available in this section.  It is extremely generous; I never objected to a section 23 arrangement which allowed rental income deriving from building or refurbishment to be set off against the cost of construction, but when it is so wide that income coming from any other rented accommodation anywhere in this State can be offset against costs, it is extremely generous indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1939" /> It is one of those mechanisms calculated to make people with a reasonable income wealthy and the device used is that if you can convert income to an asset you are not taxed on it.  If you have a property in Cork for which you are collecting £10,000 in rent, that sum can be converted into an asset by the acquisition of an apartment in one of the designated areas or in the Temple Bar Area.  You skip the bit in the middle about having the use of the income.  That is the manner in which people to a large degree are accumulating wealth at present.  It creates problems because, naturally, only people with income surplus to their day to day needs get involved in such activities.  The tax system is geared to assets and buildings and there is very little employment content, apart from the construction stage.</P>
    <P>The same was true of the business expansion scheme and when it went off the rails it was because of the assets backing of certain projects.  If you give the taxpayer a choice in relation to tax breaks he or she will always opt for the break which is asset backed rather than the break in which there is a risk, which is reasonable.  However, when it runs across a series of tax breaks, from the BES to section 23, it means that people's surplus income is not going to investment which creates ongoing jobs, it is going to the accumulation of assets which add to the wealth of individuals; in effect, it is taken out of the real economy and, apart from a boost at the construction stage where some jobs are created, there is no long-term effect.  It is not an exaggeration to say that the combination of reliefs in the Temple Bar Area are so generous that they could lead to a situation where it would be worth people's while to erect a building purely to avail of the tax breaks on rental income which could arise elsewhere in the State.  That is an extreme example as, under normal circumstances, it does not happen.</P>
    <P>It is far more difficult to identify section 23 accommodation which is totally under-used. If someone builds a block of flats, turns the key in the door and appoints a <Col N="1940" /> security man, it is obvious that the flats are empty.  Of course that does not happen but the section certainly leads to the under-utilisation of accommodation and tying up resources which could be used elsewhere.  This might sound a bit long-winded but, as our unemployment levels are in excess of 19 per cent and heading for 300,000 people unemployed, one of the fundamental issues which must be addressed is the uses to which the savings of citizens are put.  Many of these savings are being encouraged into activities in which there is no employment return.</P>
    <P>Our party leader, Deputy John Bruton, has been talking about having a rule at Government level where every proposal put to Government should be subject to an employment audit, which is not a bad idea.  I remember when we were in Government Ministers could bring in proposals and they did not have to state the financial cost, it was up to the Department of Finance to identify the cost.  That has now changed and every proposal to Government must be accompanied by an estimate of the cost, including ongoing costs.  It would be appropriate if the Government could in future, as part of Cabinet procedure, say that every proposal which comes from any Department would have to have an employment audit and show how it would affect employment.</P>
    <P>There is only a given quantum of savings in any country and if they are directed into non-productive asset building, is it any wonder our unemployment levels are high?  We must measure all these tax avoidance schemes, not only on a Keynesian scale of how much we will get when the investment is made but the ongoing employment effects and what alternative methods of investment would be used if these devices were not there. We are house and building mad in this country.  There is 85 per cent home ownership&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is terrific at a social level and we have many <Col N="1941" /> incentives which encourage more building. However, one could argue that at one end of the market the amount of space is totally under-utilised.</P>
      <P>The other side of it is that the IDA give all sorts of grants for plants rather than for employment and there are a whole series of schemes in this regard which encourage building.  The designated areas are working well but we must measure the impact on employment, not only of the direct activity but the impact on employment if the savings were used in alternative ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a misunderstanding in relation to section 23.  It was never ring-fenced since expenditure from 1988 incurred in construction of rental accommodation is available to offset against all profits from the levy on premises anywhere in the State.  It is not being changed here today.  However, in regard to expenditure incurred on the conversion or refurbishment of such accommodation, the position is that the expenditure can be offset only against profits from the levy on the particular premises involved, in other words, a ring-fencing of the relief applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chapter VII of the Bill now proposes to remove this ring-fencing for Temple Bar and other designated areas and it will remain in place for all other areas.  The reason the ring-fencing is being removed for Temple Bar is to give a kick start to development in the area.  As Deputies know, the development of Temple Bar is the Government's flagship project for Dublin's Year of European City of Culture, 1991.  We are anxious, therefore, to get the development under way as quickly as possible.  In so far as the other designated areas are concerned, the House will be aware that the urban renewal scheme will expire in 1993; conservation and refurbishment of existing housing is a particularly desirable objective of the urban renewal programme.  In order to stimulate such work before the expiry date of the scheme, the Government decided to remove the ring-fencing in section 23, conversion and refurbishment expenditure in the designated areas, in <Col N="1942" /> other words, to bring back communities to live there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the second option the Minister read to which we are referring. The question is whether it is necessary. It is extraordinarily generous that rather than being able to set off against the specific building which was the subject of the refurbishment, it is to be extended in the manner we described. Why?  It is a bit like the argument about the art section earlier, it is, similarily, to be an outcast to be seen to oppose urban renewal and nobody wishes to do that. This is a temptation to go down the road of the BES experience.</P>

      <P>It is true that this area is governed by statutes dating from 1866 and has not been touched since then. I am hopeful that the proposals I intend putting forward to Government will be considered at the earliest possible moment.  With regard to the precedent in the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990, it was agreed that section 12 (2) of that Act would provide that the chief executive of the agency shall be accountable for the accounts of the agency for the purposes of the Exchequer and Audit Department Acts, 1866 and 1921, under which accounting officers are appointed.  This agency is closely linked with my own Department in the exercise of their functions.  It was provided for on a statutory basis and, <Col N="1946" /> consequently, the Deputy's question is bound up with the question of the future role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <P>From the information contained in flow records over the last 60 years, there is no significant change in the water regime of the River Shannon and there are no manmade or naturally induced restrictions which seriously affect the position.  The removal of local obstructions, a costly exercise in itself, would be of little benefit or would have no perceptible effect Flooding occurs because the channel is incapable of conveying adequately the large volumes of water involved.  The problem can be rectified only by carrying out large-scale civil engineering works which would involve substantial deepening and widening at very substantial cost.  There are no plans at present to carry out such a scheme of works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 17, 36 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The importance which Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland attach to the concept of economic and social cohesion is evidenced by the various proposals which each has presented in the context of the conferences on both political union and economic and monetary union.  These proposals in turn have ensured that this issue has been put very firmly on the agenda of both conferences. So effective have they been that both the Commission and the Presidency have now been encouraged into putting their own proposals on the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland led the debate since last January. To date, the discussion at ministerial level has been confined to the Political Union Conference.  However, this matter will be discussed by Finance <Col N="1948" /> Ministers at our next Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware, from previous statements which I have made in this House, that the Intergovernmental Conferences are also meeting at the level of personal representatives.  Within this group, discussions are in train among the representatives of the less-developed member states about matters of mutual concern in this crucial area and I, myself, am also in regular contact with my colleagues from those member states. Deputies can, therefore, rest assured on this score.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Spanish proposals in particular, I would say that they fit in very well with the framework which we have proposed.  While the details of Spain's proposal for an Inter-State Compensation Fund have yet to be fleshed out, we certainly support the idea that the Community should move in the direction of the kind of redistributive mechanisms which are common within existing federations.  In this, Deputies will recall that, in relation to the European Community, one of the policy objectives of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is:</P>
    <P>progressive extension of the role of the Community budget through the creation of a Community system of revenue and expenditure, inherent in which would be the fiscal equalisation mechanisms characteristic of all fully fledged political and economic unions.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Spanish proposals which we would endorse is that advocating a change in the Community's revenue system to one which fully respects the principle of progressivity.</P>
    <P>Economic and social cohesion is but one aspect of the current negotiations on economic and monetary union.  There are other important issues relating to, for example, budgetary concerns and the impact of the establishment of a future European system of central banks.  None of these issues has yet advanced to a stage where it would be helpful to circulate a White Paper.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his rather discursive reply.  May I ask him if he proposes to invite his colleagues from Spain, Portugal and Greece to Dublin to discuss in public and therefore in a political way the position of peripheral countries in relation to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the prospects of achieving social cohesion?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Deputy's query I have spoken to the Ministers from the countries concerned on the margins of the last Intergovernmental Conference at the informal meeting of ECO-FIN at the weekend and I have since written to them requesting a formal meeting, but the venue is still left open.  The Deputy can take it that we will be meeting.  At the personal representative level, there is very close liaison between the member states concerned, that is, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland, because we have a common interest, and the Deputy can take it that the issue is being pursued at that level also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that. Can I take it that this will take on the dimension of a political initiative, similar to some of the Franco-German initiatives on European affairs, and attract a similar profile, and that it will be seen as four or five member states coming together to agree a position in advance on the issue of social cohesion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It will certainly take on as much of a political dimension as we can possibly put into it because, as the Deputy and Members of the House will be aware, at the very start cohesion was not an issue that the Commission or President Delors wished to discuss at the EMU conference.  Consequently, when we lodged our paper last January and others followed with proposals along similar lines, it finally forced the Commission to put the issue on the agenda and to come forward with proposals. At the recent informal meeting of. ECO-FIN, President Jacques Delors outlined for the first time his views as to <Col N="1950" /> the future developments of financing and expenditure beyond 1993, taking into account the issue of economic and social cohesion as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The most recent proposals in the indirect tax area have been put forward not by the EC Commission but by the Luxembourg Presidency.  In an effort to forge an agreement on this complex dossier, they have tabled a set of compromise proposals on VAT and excise duties for discussion at the ECO-FIN Council on 3 June next.  The Presidency is hoping to get agreement on minimum levels for the standard and reduced VAT rates, the classification of goods and services for the different VAT rates and the maintenance of zero VAT rating, as well as on minimum levels of excise duties on alcohols, tobacco and mineral oils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the latest proposals are designed to allow member states greater flexibility in settling their indirect tax rates, the reality remains that, if distortions of trade and diversions of revenue are to be avoided when fiscal border formalities are removed, member states will have no alternative but to approximate their rates to those of neighbouring member states. Accordingly, in Ireland's case, the major determinant of the cost of approximation will be the rates adopted by the UK, <Col N="1951" /> though these may ultimately be influenced by the position in the continental member states.</P>
    <P>The House may recall that I recently costed full equalisation of our indirect tax rates with current UK rates at some £560 million.  The actual cost of the degree of approximation needed to allow the Single Market concept to operate is likely to be lower.  It will depend on the extent to which differential rates <i>vis-á-vis</i> the UK are considered sustainable and, of course, on the nature of the ultimate settlement reached at Community level. Against that background, it is not possible to estimate accurately the final cost of tax approximation for Ireland.</P>
    <P>In all discussions to date, I have consistently argued that the overall package must be designed to avoid undue budgetary consequences for Ireland.  In this regard, my immediate concern is that the regime should provide for a sharing of the burden of adjustment between low tax and high tax member states.  I shall endeavour to ensure that the final arrangements are satisfactory in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Could the Minister confirm that Ireland has dropped its claim for compensation at the point of harmonisation and as that was the only clear-cut policy position being put forward by the Irish Government, we now do not have a formal policy position before the Commission or the Luxembourg Presidency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that we have not dropped our claim for compensation. Nobody knows the shape of the final package and what the figures are likely to be.  It is true that things have moved along quite a lot since the claim was first submitted in that we have had a reduction of 4 per cent in the VAT rate from 25 per cent to 21 per cent, which has narrowed the gap at a cost of hundreds of millions to the Exchequer, but on the other hand, the British Government increased the standard VAT rate by 2.5 <Col N="1952" /> per cent in the March budget.  A combination of both has narrowed the gap quite significantly and this changes the estimated figures in our calculations. However, what we do not know at this stage is whether the United Kingdom is likely to hold the level they are at or try to approximate more closely to the continental VAT rates.  The situation is much too fluid to say what the final outcome will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Would the Minister agree that both he and the Government have always regarded EC policy on harmonisation as a burden or a penalty on the Irish Exchequer and that at no time have they attempted to evaluate the benefits either in terms of trade or economic activity?  Further, is the Minister's reference to the increase in the UK VAT rates not a confirmation of this attitude that now the imposition will no longer be as great because we will have to approximate only to 17.5 per cent instead of a 15 per cent VAT rate?  Does the Minister not consider this a very outdated attitude to harmonisation and at this late stage, would he put forward proposals to the EC Commission or to the Luxembourg Presidency which would evaluate the cost benefit to us of reducing the VAT rates and excise duties?  Does the Minister agree that we should have a more positive attitude to harmonisation rather than to be acting as the junior partner who has to be dragged kicking and screaming into the last decade of the century?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Noonan it would appear that no one was having any problems with the harmonisation of VAT rates at EC level except Ireland.  However if he had attended some of the meetings I have attended as late as the weekend before last he would have heard the cries of the various Finance Ministers who, by their very nature, do not want to give away revenue and make their job more difficult for themselves.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not being dragged along by the heels.  We are being realistic.  The reduction of 4 per cent was a major move in that direction and a full demonstration of the political will to come to grips with the harmonisation of VAT rates.  It was a major hurdle to cross the road towards tax approximation.  The underlying concept is that there will be no distortions of trade and no anti-competitive practices between member states as a result of tax approximation.  Because the trade distortions between the North and the South of Ireland have been removed quite substantially and, in fact, in most cases indirect taxation favours us down here, this is a major step forward which we all welcome.  Consequently it will cost us less to remove some of the trade distortions in future.</P>
      <P>We have always taken a positive attitude towards harmonisation, and we have to evaluate the impact in revenue terms against the impetus it will give to trade. Of course, all those exercises are done at budget time and in the lead up to the budget.  There is no question that we are being just dragged along, as the Deputy suggested.  We have made a realistic appraisal of where we stand and what we can do, taking into account that we have to take on board the reduction in personal taxation &mdash; and the Deputy knows our commitment in that regard.  Indeed, changes may have to take place in relation to DIRT tax in the next couple of years in order to remain competitive from the point of view of capital.  We have also to consider the removal of VAT at the point of import.  All these areas have to be considered and cannot be treated as lightly as the Deputy would like to suggest.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> May I ask the Minister specifically if any research or work is being done in his Department on the optimum level of the standard rate of VAT and excise duty at which we would maximise our trade <Col N="1954" /> advantage, encourage our tourist industry and ultimately create the maximum number of jobs?  Has any work along these lines been done in his Department and, if so, can this information be given to us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Studies along these lines are ongoing in the Department in terms of building up fiscal and economic policy.  With regard to VAT rates, it is not a question of what we would like; it is a question of what the Community will agree.  As the Deputy knows, it has to be a unanimous decision by the 12 member states.  The latest proposal from the Luxembourg Presidency, tabled in an informal way but which will be discussed formally at the next meeting, recommends abandoning the lower rates of VAT bands of 4 to 9 per cent and replacing them with a minimum rate of 5 per cent.  They also propose replacing the upper rates of 14-20 per cent with a minimum VAT standard band rate of 14-16 per cent.  I am merely giving the Deputy judgments as there are a number of variations involved &mdash; for example, Luxembourg are at 12 per cent, Spain are at 12 per cent, Germany are at 14 per cent while Britain are out of that category.  If there is going to be agreement on VAT rates next month, I expect it to fall at 5 per cent at the lower end and 14-16 per cent at the upper end.  The zero rate of VAT can be retained by the countries which have it at present in regard to the items which are included in that classification. I am giving the Deputy the up-to-date position in this regard.  As I have said, this proposal will be discussed formally at the next meeting of ECO-FIN.</P>
      <P>With regard to excise duties, this issue has only recently been put on the table and there is a very wide divergence between the views of the member states. For instance, it has been proposed by some countries that there should be a zero rating for wine on the basis that it is food and provides nourishment and low rates for alcohol and tobacco.  We still have a long way to go on this issue.</P>

Payments totalling £326,000 have been authorised to date, mainly in respect of financial, actuarial and legal services in connection with the restructuring of the company last year and advice in connection with the preparations for the flotation.  The firms to which payments have been made to date are NCB and Goldman Sachs, the leading financial advisers, A. &amp; L. Good-body, legal advisers, and R. Watson and Sons, actuarial advisers.

      <P>Yes, and perhaps more.  I hope the Deputy knows the size of the flotation.  The usual fee for stockbroking on a Euro syndicate basis is between 3 and 4.5 per cent, depending on various aspects.  I hope to get that figure down to at least 3 per cent.  I believe Goldman Sachs, financial advisors, will enhance the status of the floatation in view of the fact that they are an international company.  We received proposals from many European banks but I believe Goldman Sachs are the best <Col N="1958" /> people to lead the Euro syndicate in this regard.</P>

I am sorry to have to disappoint the Deputy but that is the reality.  With regard to the selection of financial advisors, this was done by way of a competitive process.  No fewer than 25 proposals were submitted and all tenders were accepted on a competitive basis.

      <Quest>the number of tax inspectors engaged in self-assessed returns from the self-employed or companies and the numbers actually engaged in the auditing of returns; his views on whether these are adequate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Before answering the <Col N="1960" /> Deputy's question, I want to give the House necessary background information. The changeover from the old system to self-assessment is a major management challenge.  To ensure that this changeover takes place in an orderly manner, the two systems must run in tandem for a number of years.  As the volume of work under the old system diminishes, staff can be released to operate the new system.</P>
      <P>I must stress that it is not a necessary condition of the success of the self-assessment system that a full audit system be in place from day 1.  Inspectors of taxes have a six-year period during which cases remain open and cases chosen for audit in any year are liable to be audited for the preceding five years.  Against this background, I am satisfied that the transition to the new self-assessment system is progressing satisfactorily, including the implementation of the audit programme.</P>
      <P>So far, it has been possible to release 532 Revenue staff to the administration of the self-assessment system.  Of these, 45 are inspectors who are engaged directly in self-assessment audit work. It is expected that this number will be increased to 100 inspectors of taxes over the course of 1991, with further deployment of personnel into the audit area during 1992 and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>Up to now the audit function has been confined to income tax returns only.  A corporation tax audit unit was established at the end of 1990 and audits will commence shortly.</P>
      <P>The audit of income tax returns, to which the Deputy is referring, is, of course, only one dimension of the total Revenue audit capacity.  There are also separate audit programmes covering employer's PAYE, value-added tax and construction industry tax.  The total audit programme last year involved 241 officers and entailed some 26,000 visits and resulted in an impact on 9 per cent of the taxpayer base of 270,000 (including companies).  This is very high by international standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a further 28,000 compliance visits (covering such items as tax payments and non-filing of various <Col N="1961" /> returns) were made by officers of the Revenue Commissioners, bringing the total between audit and compliance visits to approximately 19 per cent of the taxpayer base.</P>
    <P>The level of self-assessment audits should be such as to ensure compliance by and confidence of taxpayers in the system.  Bearing in mind the level of audit coverage already available and the additional resources being freed for audit work over the coming years, the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that they have adequate resources to put in place an effective audit programme as part of the self-assessment system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>How many audits were actually carried out last year?  Is the Minister concerned that the audits that were carried out produced an average take for the Exchequer of about £10,000?  Would the Minister agree with the estimate of the union representing Revenue staffs that the total amount outstanding in tax from the self-employed area under self-assessment is in the order of £400 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two or three parts to the question that are totally different from the question put down here and I will not comment on them without the adequate information in front of me.  The question was in regard to the number of tax inspectors engaged in self-assessment returns from the self-employed and the numbers actually engaged in the auditing of returns.  I have already said that this is a two-stage operation, that the systems are run in tandem and that there is a six-year period to go back on them anyway.  Naturally, as people are released from the old system there are more available to go into the new system.  I also provided in the budget this year £1 million additional resources for this area and the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that they have adequate resources to do the job they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>My first question arose directly from the Minister's reply in which he stated that the work of the <Col N="1962" /> persons involved in auditing impacted on 9 per cent of cases.  I would like the Minister to clarify whether that means that 9 per cent of the cases were audited or whether in fact the numbers audited are actually less than 1 per cent, as claimed by the union representing the staffs.  I would like the Minister to clarify that.  I do not think that is a separate question.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilmore knows that the Revenue Commissioners are trying to get more and more people into an area where they state they have adequate resources.  Where there were shortfalls, I provided £1 million in the budget this year to help them along their way.  They are satisfied with the resources they have.  They do not want to take on any more staff that they would not need in a year or two.  People are being released all the time from the old system to take on the new system.  Deputy Gilmore is trying to create a situation where the new system would be staffed up and there would be all that additional staff in a year or two, and then, of course, it <Col N="1963" /> would give more members to his own association.  We all know where he is coming from now.</P>

The group are a very useful forum.  They provide views from various sectors that can help the Revenue Commissioners to combat the black economy.  This is a useful way of sharing information and defusing feelings in certain quarters that not enough is being done in this area. Quite a useful amount of information is being fed in and many areas have been followed through.  To give some idea without disclosing the hand of the Revenue Commissioners, they had 788 visits in the first three months of this year arising out of ideas that came through this forum.  Ninety-one persons were detected who were not previously on record and there were 132 people with substantial unreturned income.  There were 24 for further investigation and 21 for audit.  That gives some idea of the operations and how successful they have been.</P>

      <Quest>if he has been informed by the Central Statistics Office that the sale of motor cars in the first quarter of this year is substantially below that recorded during the first quarter last year; if he will outline his views on the cause of this decline; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the data on first <Col N="1967" /> registrations of private cars which the Central Statistics Office compile.  The latest figures published by the CSO relate to February 1991.  They show that registrations of new cars, in January and February combined, declined by 20.4 per cent compared with the same period last year; that this decline was particularly offset by an increase in the numbers of secondhand cars registered for the first time; and that total registrations declined by 15.3 per cent, year on year, over the first two months of 1991.</P>
      <P>I should point out, however, that in response to strong domestic economic growth, new private car registrations increased by 53 per cent over the three years to 1990 to a total in excess of 83,000 &mdash; the highest annual total since 1981; and that total first time registrations of private cars rose by 78 per cent over the period, again the highest figure since 1981.</P>
      <P>This growth underpinned a rapid buildup in the total stock of cars, inevitably implying a less buoyant outlook for growth in first time registrations.  The international economic downturn with its repercussions on the domestic economy, when added to this, implied some slowdown. The uncertainty generated by the Gulf crisis and recession in the UK and US which affected the timing of business investment decisions is reflected, in addition, in the pattern of private car registrations to date.  I remain confident that the car market will become more buoyant as international confidence returns and renewed growth in the US and UK spills over to our economy.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of some of the things the Deputy has mentioned but we are all well aware that <Col N="1968" /> there has been a marked slow down in economic activities since the last quarter of 1990 and the first quarter of this year. There were some signs of recovery in certain areas in May.  However, as I said at budget time and have repeated many times since then, I do not expect international recovery to start until the second part of this year.  Let us hope that we will participate in the recovery of the British economy, which can account for a significant amount of our growth in trade, the American economy and world trade in general when it takes place.</P>

There were 61,888 new cars in 1988; in 1989 there were 78,383, and 83,172 in 1990.  In 1990 registrations of secondhand cars increased substantially.

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that attendance for the clearance of merchandise is provided free of charge at Manorhamilton Road Station, County Leitrim, between the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on all days except Sundays and public holidays.  This attendance is continuous except on Saturdays, and other infrequent occasions when, if the volume of traffic permits, the office is closed during lunch hour. Additional attendance outside normal hours is provided, on prior request, between 8 a.m. &mdash; 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. &mdash; 8 p.m. from Monday to Friday on payment of a fee currently £5 per load of merchandise.  This fee is designed to cover the cost to the State of providing this additional service.  Requests for attendance outside these days and hours are granted only in urgent cases.  No instance where perishable goods have had <Col N="1970" /> to be destroyed as a result of delays or refusal to grant extra attendance has come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners. Staffing levels and hours of attendance are constantly reviewed and it is considered that the position at Manorhamilton Road Station is adequate to deal with the volume of commercial traffic through that route.

Is the Minister aware of the considerable delays being experienced by people who after queueing for two to three hours find when they have almost reached the post that the person in charge breaks for lunch, adding a further hour to their delay?  In this day and age when people are trying to meet deadlines that is not satisfactory. I ask the Minister to review the situation. Is the Minister further aware that this is the only crossing point within reach of people in the Blacklion area and that the alternative is to go to Clones or to Swanlinbar, which is open only occasionally? I understand that Clones is open on a full-time basis but it is not within reach of people who are travelling to the west.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the likely implications for this year's Exchequer borrowing requirement of the official tax and spending figures for the first quarter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my press statement which accompanied the release of the end-quarter Exchequer returns on 3 April last.  As pointed out in the statement, the annual pattern of Exchequer issues and receipts normally gives rise to a high first-quarter deficit &mdash; a position which typically adjusts later in the year.  For example, the current deficit for the first <Col N="1973" /> three months of 1990 was more than double the eventual outturn for the year.</P>
      <P>Revenues in the first quarter were sluggish, but, as I indicated in my statement, this can largely be put down to factors which were foreseen at budget-time, notably the effect of the income tax and VAT reductions introduced in the 1990 budget.  The weakness of car sales, to which uncertainties associated with the crisis in the Gulf may have contributed, depressed consumption taxes, and pay increases due under the PESP were not, in the main, reflected in the first quarter income tax figures.  The prospective improvement in economic trends later in the year, taken together with the effects of the 1991 budget and of the PESP pay increases, should all act to improve buoyancy, and I expect the tax revenue figures to improve significantly as the year progresses.</P>
      <P>Both non-capital supply services and Exchequer borrowing for capital purposes in the first quarter are in line with expectations.  So far as the first-quarter returns are concerned, therefore, there is no undue cause for concern at this stage, but I can assure the Deputy that the Government will be monitoring trends very closely over the remainder of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister still confident that the target of £460 million Exchequer borrowing requirement set in the budget still obtains particularly in view of the fall in tax revenue to which he has referred, the changes in the budget in relation to income tax which came on stream in April and the increase in unemployment which will add to the expenditure side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the picture is improving and at the end of April it showed an improvement over the position at the end of the first quarter.  I am aware of the additional expenditure that will be required for the extra unemployment figures.  There is some improvement on the tax side but, as I said some time ago &mdash; and I repeat it &mdash; we need the second quarter returns before we can <Col N="1974" /> definitively make up our minds as to whether the trends will give us the outturn we expect.  Everybody knew there was a slow first quarter and everybody knew everything was slowing down in the last quarter of last year.  It is a question of waiting to see trends for recovery.  The recovery projected in the budget, based on a 2.25 per cent growth rate, was based on a recovery in the second half of the year, not in the first half.  I know many commentators said it was impossible and it will not be achieved and yet two reports issued yesterday come very close to our projections in relation to growth.  Until I have had the second quarter figures I will not be able to determine a trend and I would be very foolish to say otherwise at this stage.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to employee pay-related social insurance contributions, the 1 per cent employment and training levy, the 1.25 per cent health contribution, and domestic service charges under local government legislation.  The total yield from these in 1991 is estimated at some £716 million, and to collect this amount in a full year through income tax by increasing the standard rate would mean a standard rate of over 40 per cent. A standard rate of this order would be very difficult to contemplate.  As the Deputy will be aware, the standard rate has been reduced from 35 per cent to 29 per cent over the past three budgets, and the Government's aim is to further reduce it to 25 per cent by 1993.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that we are really fooling ourselves by pretending that we have a lower rate of taxation than we have?  These other <Col N="1979" /> forms referred to in the question and in the answer are also taxation.  There is a great deal of inequity in PRSI payments and in local charges.  People in some areas do not pay local charges at all.  The PRSI system is also topsy turvy.  Does the Minister see any merit in having a single system and if there was a case for raising money by local authorities to finance local authority projects then it could be done in a fair and honest manner?  For the moment we have the worst of all worlds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard PRSI contributions as a tax in the sense that Deputy Deasy does, as one is getting benefit from the contributions.  Many trade union workers would look at it in that light.  A single rate of tax to incorporate all those things would not be fair and equitable; for instance, Dublin city do not impose water charges and other parts of the country do.  These charges are a matter of the local authority concerned.</P>

Of course, everything in the system is not equitable.  Health contributions is another area where one is paying for a service.  To incorporate all these things into a standard rate of 40 per cent is not on.</P>

      <P>To qualify for tax relief under the research and development scheme an individual must invest in shares of a research and development company which carries out a qualifying research and development project on behalf of a sponsoring company.  A qualifying research and development project is a project which has as its sole object the development of new or improved industrial processes, methods of products and is carried out wholly or mainly in the State.  Expenditure on plant forming an integral part of a bona fide R &amp; D project would be regarded as qualifying expenditure.

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <P>The company obviously complied with the scheme, otherwise they would not have been given the benefit.  That is not the reason for the scheme finishing.  It was introduced in 1986 and was due to end in 1991.  All that happened is that the Government did not renew the scheme, it was not renewed for many reasons.  First, since its introduction the scheme has been used for only ten projects.  Second, there is now a major investment in the science and technology part of the budget, which has increased from £3 million a couple of years ago to £25 million today.  The IDA supply facilities in their make-up of grant structure. Of course, research and development is an activity for which money can be received under the present BES scheme.  There is no point in having two schemes that run parallel.  At any rate, the scheme itself was open to so much abuse that it would have been very foolish to renew it on its existing basis.  The Exchequer was lucky in that it was not affected adversely earlier.</P>

      <P>I am not convinced that there is a need to introduce a new scheme for the variety of reasons I have given.  First, the IDA provide grants for research and development.  Second, the part of the budget dealing with science and technology finances quite a lot of research and development in that area and has increased from £3 million to £25 million.  Third, if a small company is looking for research and development assistance they could qualify under the BES scheme.  The market is well and truly covered, and I do not think there should be a surplus of schemes.</P>

All parties are represented there, all parties can use that forum as a vehicle <Col N="1984" /> for discussions, and if any proposals emanated from there they would be considered.

It was a cruel and devastating blow to his immediate family, to whose members, first of all, I extend profound condolences on behalf of the Government and people of Ireland.  Rajiv Gandhi had distinguished himself as a leader of his party, a leader of his people and an international statesman.  His premature death and the appalling circumstances surrounding it are, indeed, profoundly tragic.</P>
      <P>The atrocity has robbed India of one of its foremost political leaders and we share in the grief that has descended on the Indian people.  It is a grim and bitter irony that this savage event has deprived India of one of its most distinguished sons during the current democratic election. This brutal assault on the Gandhi family, and on Indian democracy, has evoked worldwide revulsion and the most heartfelt sympathy for the Indian people.  The Government condemn this atrocity in the strongest possible terms.</P>

    <P>It is particularly distressing that this act <Col N="2030" /> of violence occurred during an election campaign of great importance for the world's most populous democracy.

I have no doubt that the deeply rooted democratic traditions of the Indian people will withstand this effort to subvert democracy.</P>
    <P>Rajiv Gandhi was born into one of India's most respected and prominent families.  He followed in the footsteps of his grandfather Jawarharlal Nehru and his mother, Indira Gandhi, herself the tragic victim of assassination in 1984. Coming to power in the wake of his mother's murder, Rajiv Gandhi provided a vital link of continuity and stability which permitted the Indian people to unite under his leadership at that crucial time.</P>
    <P>Rajiv Gandhi's political philosophy was underpinned at all times by an exemplary commitment to the welfare of his people, whom he led from 1984 until 1989.  Despite the many challenges which he faced as leader of that vast and multifaceted country, his lifelong attachment to democracy and the rule of law was never in question.  As Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi sustained India in its role as a leader state in the South Asia region, as a major participant in the non-aligned movement and as a loyal member of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The peoples of India and Ireland have long enjoyed strong ties of friendship and mutual respect, forged in the quest for independence of both our countries.  We share in common with the Indian people many historical experiences and maintain excellent relations with that country, with which we share a deep commitment to democratic values, and to peace, justice and equality.</P>
    <P>The sad passing of Rajiv Gandhi now means that India has lost a conciliatory leader with the capacity to guide his country's progress towards the goal he had set of achieving a genuinely developed and modern society.  However, I have no doubt of the capacity of the Indian people <Col N="2031" /> and its leaders to overcome their tremendous sense of loss and to translate his vision into reality.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government and people of Ireland I extend our most sincere condolences to the Government and people of India on this sorrowful occasion.  I have arranged that the Tánaiste, Deputy Wilson, will represent the Government at the funeral.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I wish to express to the people of India and to the Gandhi family the deepest sympathy of our party and, I am sure, of all democrats throughout the world in the enormous and tragic loss which they suffered yesterday.</P>
      <P>Rajiv Gandhi is, in every sense, the victim of the passions engendered by historic religious and ethnic divisions in his country.  Democracy and tolerance have been preserved in India despite enormous burdens of under-development, despite the fact that there are literally hundreds of different languages spoken in that country, despite the fact that in 1949 India was partitioned and has since been repartitioned, despite the fact that passions remain deeply felt beneath the surface, nevertheless, in all those adverse circumstances, parliamentary democracy has been preserved in India, which must rate as one of the greatest 20th century achievements of mankind.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, this terrible murder will put even further strain on that enormous achievement.  As a country which struggled, as India did, for self-determination over many years and has achieved it &mdash; as we have also &mdash; in a democratic way and, having achieved it, preserved democracy, we in Ireland feel a very special affinity with the Indian people in their moment of great loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly sad, as the Taoiseach said, that this atrocity should have occurred in the midst of an election campaign; in the midst of the very expression of democracy which, in its essence, is an exercise in tolerance; that a violent act should strike down one of democracy's <Col N="2032" /> leading protagonists in the world's largest democracy is truly a great tragedy.</P>
    <P>We in this House join in expressing sympathy to the family which has suffered so much in the cause of democracy and express the hope that out of this tragedy a greater sense of understanding and tolerance will grow in India which will ensure that this awful event is not repeated.  I hope that out of that sense a greater tolerance will emerge in similar situations throughout the world, including those which, sadly, still exist within our own island.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I wish to express our condolences to the people of India and to extend to them our sympathy and solidarity at this traumatic time.  The links between the people of India and this country go back a long way.  It is often said that the existence of India as an independent parliamentary democracy owes more than a little to the inspiration drawn by Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru from their understanding of Ireland's colonial history. Indeed, Nehru, the grandfather of Rajiv Gandhi, wrote extensively about Ireland.</P>
      <P>Bearing this in mind the murder of Rajiv Gandhi has come as a great shock not only to us in Ireland but to the rest of the world.  The brutal manner of his death will have been traumatic for millions of the followers of the Congress Party and for every Indian democrat.  There will I am sure be attempts to retaliate which will only add to the suffering and tribulation of the people of India as a whole. Against this background the action of the outgoing Government in postponing the remaining phases of the election must be seen as a prudent and wise decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a leading advocate of the non-aligned movement, Rajiv Gandhi in his day played a major role in pursuing the objectives of freedom and equality.  Internationally, he will be remembered for among other things, his confrontations with Mrs. Thatcher at several Commonwealth conferences on the issue of sanctions with regard to South Africa. <Col N="2033" /> Domestically, he struggled to break down age old barriers in India and to improve the economic and social conditions of millions of his countrymen. There was every prospect that he would have secured an opportunity to carry on this work by victory in the election had it not been for his assassination.</P>
    <P>His death, like that of his mother before him, will inflame the troubled sub continent of India which is already in an extremely volatile state.  It must surely be hoped that some sense of order and reason will enable the people of India to come to terms with this disastrous event.</P>

      <P>The murder of Rajiv Gandhi is a particularly shocking and horrific outrage coming as it did less than seven years after the murder of his mother, Indira Gandhi.  The death of Rajiv Gandhi will clearly be felt most deeply in India where he still had so much to contribute to the development of his country but it will also be a great loss to the world community where he was recognised as a statesman of great stature. He was a champion of the Third World and an articulate voice for the non-aligned nations.  He should be particularly remembered for the contribution he made as Prime Minister of India in the early eighties, along with the leaders of Greece, Argentina, Sweden, Tanzania and Mexico, to the campaign for peace and disarmament.  This campaign helped in no small way to create the climate in which the later disarmament measures agreed by the nuclear powers became a reality.  Indeed, it is a sad indication of the violent times in which we live that two of those leaders, Olaf Palme and Rajiv Gandhi, have now fallen victim to vicious assassins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>India is a very complex society, as we are all aware.  It is going through a very difficult period at present as a result of religious and political conflict from which we hope it will soon emerge.  The independence and territorial integrity of India must be preserved.  Any disintegration of that country could plunge the entire region into conflict.  We express our support for those politicians in India from <Col N="2034" /> various parties who have rejected religious sectarianism and who are committed to a democratic and tolerant society.</P>
    <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I want to extend my deepest sympathy to the family of Mr. Gandhi and to the Indian people on their appalling loss.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I would like to join in the expressions of sympathy and condemnation which have been made here and elsewhere at the brutal murder of Mr. Rajiv Gandhi.  I would like to offer my deepest sympathy to the people of India and to the late Mr. Gandhi's family.</P>
      <P>One can only be filled with revulsion and horror that a person whose life had been committed to the preservation and strengthening of democracy in his native India should be struck down so callously during the course of an election campaign. Even in his short career in public life Mr. Gandhi demonstrated an outstanding commitment to democracy and to the advancement of India, both domestically and on the international stage. He represented a forward looking, progressive and inclusive India and rejected the politics of sectarian and class division which threatened constantly to undermine all the progress made in India since its independence.  Although a very different man he inherited in some ways at least the mantle of his namesake, Mahatma Gandhi, whose commitment to a nonsectarian and peace loving India has been an inspiration to divided communities throughout the world.</P>
      <P>As a society in which political violence can still be detected as an undercurrent Ireland, perhaps more than any other country, has empathy with the Indian people, that their best politicians can fall victim to self-appointed arbiters of life and death.  India's recent political history has indeed been troubled.  From Kashmir to Tamil Nadu and from the Punjab to Assam the entire sub continent is riven by separatism and sectarianism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family of Mr. Nehru, the first Prime Minister, have paid dearly for their <Col N="2035" /> commitment to the cause of India.  We must hope that Indian democracy, tolerance and pluralism are sufficiently strong to withstand the merciless violence to which they have been subjected.  For our part as a country, perhaps the best way in which Irishmen and women can honour the memory of people such as Rajiv Gandhi and his late mother is to practice the virtues of democratic, nonviolent, inclusive and pluralist politics both among ourselves and in our dealings with others.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 111 is in the name of Deputy Cotter.  Amendments Nos. 111, 113, 115 and 117 form a composite proposal and amendments Nos. 112, 114, 116 and 118 form an alternative composite proposal. It is proposed, therefore, with the agreement of the House, for discussion purposes to take amendments Nos. 111 to 118, inclusive, together.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 111:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2036" /> In page 66, subsection (2) (a), between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following definition:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;chicken production&rsquo; means chickens raised for human consumption and &lsquo;chicken producer&rsquo; shall be construed accordingly;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This section provides for a rebate in excise duty and is specifically aimed at one sector, the horticultural industry.  I find this somewhat unacceptable, although I welcome the fact that it applies to that sector.  My amendment broadens the scope to include chicken producers.  I will give a little background information.</P>
    <P>In 1990, 45 million chickens, 4.25 million turkeys, 1.5 million ducks and 2 million fowl were produced in this country. My own county would be the leader in the field of fowl production.  Therefore, it is extremely important to me that something should be done to ensure that an industry with a retail value of £300 million last year should be made a little more competitive and have better opportunities to develop in various directions. If the section is amended to include chicken production and chicken producers, it will do a great deal of good. The loss to the Exchequer would be quite small in national terms and would be in the region of a couple of hundred thousand pounds, but its effects would be quite meaningful to the industry in question.</P>
    <P>My amendment is quite narrow in focus and when I compare it with Deputy Noonan's amendment I will withdraw it in favour of Deputy Noonan's because his amendment covers poultry production while mine was narrowly defined to include only chicken producers.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will include Deputy Noonan's amendment rather than mine in the completed Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Concessions to the horticultural industry estimated at £20,000 in a full year will rectify a long standing anomaly by putting LPG on the same footing as oil used by the sector. No such anomaly exists in the poultry industry.  All heating oil and LPG bear <Col N="2037" /> excise duty at 17p a gallon.  It is estimated that oil and LPG account for in excess of 20 per cent of production costs in the horticultural industry, in other words it is one of the main overheads of the horticultural industry whereas LPG accounts for little more than 1 per cent of such costs in poultry production.  Consequently they are not comparable.  Very little oil is used by this sector.  It could be difficult to confine the excise duty relief to LPG for the poultry industry and it would inevitably give rise to pressure for similar relief to be granted to other intensive animal production processing operations and in turn open the door for those engaged in agriculture and industry to seek similar concessions for oil generally as well as for LPG.  The anomaly existed only in the horticultural sector; it does not exist in the poultry industry, and consequently it represented 20 times more of an overhead in the horticultural industry.  That is the reason I must refuse the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret what the Minister said.  I come from a constituency which has a high proliferation of poultry producers and we have two major producers in County Limerick. The excise duty relief on LPG will give them some incentive.  A great many poultry producers, at least in our area, are small farmers and this is an alternative enterprise for them.  Indeed in the recent farm initiative announced by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, the Minister was encouraging people to go into alternative farming, such as rabbits or other enterprises that had not been considered in the past.</P>
      <P>In this case we are dealing with an established industry and it is a pity the Minister's initiative on agriculture did not go far enough.  I saw the extension of the excise duty relief on LPG to the horticulture industry as an incentive and as a form of compensation to small producers. I support Deputy Noonan's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister has turned down this amendment out of <Col N="2038" /> hand.  In my county there has been great diversification into the poultry industry down the years.  Given the nature of agriculture in my county where farm units tend to be very small, the poultry industry should be given as big a boost as possible in order to retain some semblance of population in the rural parts of County Monaghan.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision.  In his response he gave us some figures and said that energy accounted for 20 per cent of the overheads in horticulture production whereas it accounted for only 1 per cent of chicken production costs.  That may well be but given that the cost to the Exchequer is so small, and it has been evaluated as costing in the region of £200,000, and in view of the input the industry is making to the rural economy in my county, in particular, and chicken houses are being erected without any assistance or grant aid from the State.  I urge the Minister to reconsider his position and allow the rebate to apply to this industry as well.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate what the Deputies are saying but as I pointed out LPG represents just 1 per cent of the overheads of the poultry industry as against the very high percentage of the overhead cost of horticultural production. It was an anomaly and now it will go.  Every time you close a door three or four more open.  Basically what I am saying is that I could not justify standing out against other sectors of the agricultural industry for a similar concession and that is the reason I have taken this stand.  I will certainly have another look at this between now and Report Stage but I would not hold out much hope.</P>

      <P>In page 66, after line 47, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a) Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1935, is hereby amended in subsection (11) (inserted by section 18 of the Finance Act, 1940) by the addition thereto of the following paragraph after paragraph (1) (inserted by section 20 of the Finance Act, 1960):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(m) prohibiting the addition to or mixing with any hydrocarbon oil of any substance and prohibiting the importation, keeping for sale, sale, transportation or delivery of any hydrocarbon oil in which such substance is present.&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>(b) Regulations made under the said section 21 shall apply and have effect as if they had been made under that section as amended by this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of an ongoing anti-evasion campaign the Revenue Commissioners intend to make regulations in the near future prescribing a marker and dye to be added to kerosene for consumption in the State.  This will make it easier to deal with smuggled supplies of kerosene. Absence of the prescribed marker will provide <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the product has been smuggled.  Marking will also help deal with the problem of evasion arising from the practice of adding kerosene to auto-diesel as an extender.  There is a difference in duty of some 85p per gallon between the two fuels.  However, to be effective marking must be accompanied by a ban on the importation of kerosene containing UK markers.  The purpose of the present amendment is, therefore, to provide a legal basis for such a ban.  The amendment will also <Col N="2040" /> have the effect of reinforcing the basis for the existing ban on the importation of diesel containing UK markers, that is, diesel for agricultural and heating use.</P>
    <P>The introduction in 1989 of a distinctive green marker, together with the ban on imports of red diesel, has already proved most successful as an anti-smuggling measure in the case of marked diesel.  The effect has been the virtual elimination of what was a very serious smuggling problem.  Agreement has been reached with the oil trade on the marking of kerosene and it is hoped to introduce marking from around mid-year.</P>

    <P>the expression &lsquo;motor vehicle&rsquo; means a mechanically propelled vehicle which is designed, constructed, and suitable for use on roads, but does not include a tractor which is designed and constructed for use <Col N="2041" /> for agricultural purposes or a road roller or a vehicle referred to in paragraph 2 (b) of Part I (inserted by the Finance Act, 1991) of the Schedule to the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a purely technical amendment. At the moment certain dump trucks are entitled to use marked gas oil as fuel. This is achieved by excluding them from the definition of a motor vehicle through a cross-reference to the law relating to vehicle road tax.  As certain changes are now being made to the road tax provisions in section 69 of this Bill, a consequential amendment is necessary to ensure that dump trucks continue to be legally entitled to use marked gas oil as opposed to auto-diesel as fuel.  Marked gas oil benefits from a rate of duty of 17 pence a gallon whereas auto-diesel attracts a rate of just over £1 per gallon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of inadequacies in the existing legislation, an increasing proportion of the holiday accommodation sector which operates in competition with the VAT liable hotel and guesthouse sector has no VAT liability. The accommodation involved includes non-Bord Fáilte registered bed and breakfast and guesthouse establishments, time share arrangements, holiday cottages and apartments.  This was <Col N="2042" /> giving rise to distortions in the holiday accommodation market as well as losses in the Revenue yield.</P>
      <P>Section 71 will delete the existing definition of &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; in section 1 of the VAT Act.  This definition could be replaced with a more exhaustive definition but it is felt that this would lead to problems in the future as the market develops with new forms of holiday accommodation coming onto the market. It has been decided, therefore, to replace this definition by a more general and broad statement of hotel and similar establishments liable at the 10 per cent rate.  This definition will be included in the Third Schedule to the VAT Act.  This is carried out in section 80 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>A number of problems had been encountered in the hotel and related sectors regarding the charging of VAT.  The main difficulty in this area is that persons who are in the hotel or guesthouse business are not treated as such for VAT purposes unless they are Bord Fáilte registered.  This arises because the Revenue Commissioners consider themselves bound by a decision of the Circuit Court.  Operators can, therefore, contrive to escape VAT liability by removing themselves from the Bord Fáilte register.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the problem has been encountered with the development of time share apartments where persons acquire the right to use holiday cottages and apartments for a set period each year over a number of years.  Under the existing practice, these are dealt with as lettings of immovable goods and as such are exempt from VAT.  While Bord Fáilte have extended their registration schemes for hotels and guesthouses to cover holiday cottages and apartments, these are not covered by the existing definition of &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; and are, therefore, treated as exempt with optional registration.  There has been a considerable expansion in this area in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourist accommodation services which will become liable to VAT for the first time include hotels, bed and breakfast and guesthouse establishments which provide holiday accommodation and are not registered with Bord Fáilte, holiday <Col N="2043" /> cottages, holiday chalets, time share cottages and apartments.  Registrations will only be required where the annual turnover threshold at £15,000 per annum is exceeded.  These establishments whose annual turnover is less than that figure will not be required to register for VAT although they may do so if they wish. Accordingly, many seasonal guesthouses and farm and county homes will not have to register for VAT.  There will, of course, be no change in the status of those establishments already registered for VAT.  Flats, boarding houses, nursing homes and so on will not be affected. Voluntary and charitable organisations which provide temporary accommodation such as An Óige, Shelter and the Simon Community are outside the scope of this proposal and will not be affected either.</P>

People in the tourist industry who have such accommodation appreciate that they will come within the tax net if they fall within the limits of registration.</P>
    <P>Because this measure was introduced in the Finance Bill and had not been signalled in the budget I put it to the Minister that travel agents have already sold holidays in the type of accommodation which will now come within the remit of the 10 per cent VAT regime. They have already taken firm bookings at a given price, and, consequently, will not be able to recoup the 10 per cent.  I ask the Minister to defer introducing this provision until the tourist season is over. The introduction of the 10 per cent VAT on self-catering holidays should only come in on 1 March next year but even if the Minister were to agree to introduce this measure on 1 November it would be a help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify the thinking behind including timeshare accommodation in the definition of hotels.  He read into the record a range of categories of accommodation that would now come under the VAT regime.  There is a view that <Col N="2045" /> somebody with a time share is in fact the owner of the property for the time they occupy it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is the basis on which it is sold.  Have the Minister for Finance and the officials in the Revenue Commissioners considered that?  Could the Minister explain the full implications to tourism and operators of the Circuit Court action he referred to <i>vis-à-vis</i> the registration by Bord Fáilte of guesthouses? I am not clear about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What the court decided was that the Act applied only to those that were registered by Bord Fáilte. We had to correct a problem that arose here.  I accept what the Deputy says, that time share involves ownership maybe for two weeks in the year, but they are being swopped around all the time and are considered to be part of competition with hotels and guesthouses.  It was to put them all on an even keel that this is in. They are all part of the whole area of accommodation in the tourism area.  That is why time share has been included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about 7,000 unlisted guesthouses in the country as opposed to 3,000 registered ones.  Standards have been upgraded very much in the last couple of years in the accommodation area of tourism.  The ceiling of £15,000 would bring a lot of farmhouses into the VAT net and might have a negative effect of discouraging people from registering so that in the end we would have more unlisted guesthouses.  That would be a negative step for the tourist industry in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister's decision to include self-catering time shares for VAT purposes will, in the long term, prove detrimental.  Substantial investment is required in the first instance to develop this kind of business and the season for productivity from that investment is often very short.  Inclusion for VAT purposes will be a deterrent and <Col N="2046" /> will certainly not encourage the further expansion and development that could take place.</P>
      <P>To be successful in providing accommodation for tourists one must be registered with Bord Fáilte and be involved in national and international promotion. The volume of business done by nonregistered categories is extremely limited. It serves as a safety valve when festivals or gatherings of some kind take place.  If such unregistered catgegories come under the same levels of VAT and taxation such people would be discouraged from becoming involved in tourism.  They have proved to be a useful safety valve at times of overcrowding and are very much welcomed by local tourist bodies and organisations.  The inclusion of these for VAT purposes would not be helpful to the expansion of the tourist industry as a whole.</P>

Second, it defers the implementation of the changes in the treatment of hotels and related establishments from 1 July 1991 to 1 January 1992.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is it.  The complaint I got from the tourist industry was not that they were being registered or anything like that but that the operative date was in the middle of the booking season when they would have commitments and bookings already taken. They were making a legitimate case and consequently I made this change to allow them to continue their bookings for the year.  Anybody who registers gets it back, so I cannot see what the major problem is.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That certainly is very helpful because the case being made was that if one was registered one had one's prices fixed for this year and probably had one's holidays sold and could not claim back.  That meets it.</P>
      <P>There are two other issues.  First, when the term &ldquo;registered&rdquo; is being used here it is being used in two senses.  There is ambiguity there and I would like the Minister to clarify the terms because being registered for Bord Fáilte purposes is not the same, I understand, as being registered for VAT.  Would the Minister explain which use of the term he means. If we are talking strictly about registration for VAT, am I right in thinking there is a £15,000 limit on turnover?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a third point that the Minister might clarify for me.  If in a farmhouse or a guesthouse there was an alternative activity which was registered separately for VAT, would it be taken as a separate company and the £15,000 ceiling apply for that element of the turnover of the <Col N="2048" /> family activity of keeping guests or would the whole lot be rolled into one?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>They could certainly operate separate companies if they wished but if they chose not to operate separate companies, then the one ceiling would apply.  It is a matter of how they want to organise their business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In County Wicklow we are trying to develop the tourist industry, not in the traditional way as in Kerry and Mayo and the like.  Nevertheless a great effort is being made.  Can the Minister now tell us if what he is doing means that somebody who has a spare bedroom during the summer months and accommodates a tourist to facilitate the overloaded guesthouse next door will now be liable for VAT?  Not just the 10 per cent would be applied but that house would then become liable for local rates because they are now carrying on a business. I would like the Minister to confirm that such activity will not be discouraged in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not being discouraged in the least.  If somebody has a spare bedroom down in Wicklow and wants to use it on the occasional night or week in the year, unless they reach a ceiling of £15,000 in turnover for that odd bedroom, which would be most unlikely, then no change whatsoever takes place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Should we go along with it?  Some of the new impositions introduced by the Minister are frequently justified by saying we are required under EC law to bring other activity under the VAT net.  I do not think there is any requirement here that self-catering accommodation be brought into the 10 per cent regime.  It is, so to speak, a local decision at the Minister's discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the ordinary bed and breakfast at the moment for which the charge is £10 a night.  This will be adding another £1, a significant increase.  Irish rates on this kind of accommodation compared with, say, Germany will now be higher. <Col N="2049" /> We always think we are very competitive in the tourist industry.  We advocate self catering as one of the most competitive areas and our tourist marketing frequently draws attention to the very high quality of Irish guesthouses and the very good value of the service they provide. That is all true, but it is also true that the 10 per cent imposition on present charges on average will bring us above the rates appertaining in Germany at the moment. With the downturn in the American tourist industry I understood Bord Fáilte's policy was to try to attract in French, Germans and some Italians; continental tourists seem to be the target market now.  It is not an unlimited market; it is price sensitive and we are putting the cost of the accommodation beyond what German families would pay if they went holidaying in equivalent accommodation in, for example, the Black Forest region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an obligation on every member state to remove any areas of distortion of competition within any sector of industry or business. Consequently, it is clear from what I have said that there was a distortion of competition here.  Parts of the industrial sector were at a disadvantage to others, consequently in that context competition is being made fairer.  The playing pitch is being levelled.  The same applies to jockeys who were VAT free up to this time.  The rate in the UK has to be changed also and brought up from zero to whatever the standard rate is to be.  We are taking the first step on that transition road in this year's budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister has done in regard to VAT on services provided by professional jockeys. Members of the Turf Club, the Racing Board and I brought this matter to his attention.  VAT is to be at 12.5 per cent for professional jockeys who provide services to a value in excess of the exemption limit.  I welcome the Minister's amendment, but is VAT to be charged on contracts entered into by professional <Col N="2050" /> jockeys or is it to be extra VAT on professional jockeys fees?  I know the Revenue Commissioners have had meetings with the chief executive of the Turf Club about the operation of this provision. There has been a great deal of to-ing and fro-ing and much writing about the operation of this system and how it is to be administered but have the Revenue Commissioners come forward with a scheme for administering it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I picked up what Deputy McCreevy was saying. Jockeys have to be brought on to standard rate and at the moment the amendment is providing for a transitional rate of 12.5 per cent on professional jockeys fees.  The Deputy and others have represented that jockeys in England, because of the higher registration there for VAT, do not have to register until they have earned £35,000.  They would not have the same opportunity in Ireland to earn £35,000 before they would be registered because the ceiling here is £15,000.  That is why we are taking the transitional step of bringing them in at 12.5 per cent first and moving some time later to standard rate.  They appreciate what we are doing in this area.  I hope that answers the queries raised by Deputy McCreevy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Revenue Commissioners decided with the Racing Board executives how this is to operate? Is it to be just on professional jockeys fees?  There would be only a handful on riding fees alone who would earn in excess of £15,000.  That would mean it would be more expensive to get one of the top jockeys to ride for you than it would to engage one of the rest.  It would create a distortion in the market.  Is it to be only on fees?</P>

The 10 per cent VAT on guesthouses and self-catering accommodation will have an adverse effect on competition.  The prices will not be as competitive as they will be in continental Europe.  It could mean £2.50 extra a night.  In my part of the country a large number of people are involved in the business.  This will bring them into the net of paying local charges and rates.  That could be an extra burden on a very competitive area. I fear this is a regressive step rather than a progressive one.</P>

Live performers are in employment.  That is another example of what we have been talking about in the course of the debate on this Finance Bill.

      <P>It is a new source of revenue which I am sure the Revenue people will be glad to look at.  It is precisely because of competition reasons that this provision was introduced, one sector of the industry was paying VAT while another was not.  Comparisons are being made with southern Germany.  The VAT rate in southern Germany is 14 per cent and it will probably rise in June.  Our VAT rate is lower than that.  It is very hard to accept from my namesake, Deputy Gerry Reynolds, that Leitrim would not be competitive with Germany in this day and age.  Leitrim is one of the more competitive counties in Ireland in relation to tourism but would not have the market which, say, Kerry has.  At present the Bord Fáilte listed guesthouses have to pay VAT while the unlisted guesthouses do not pay VAT.  If somebody does not have a turnover of £15,000 they do not have to register and they do not have to pay VAT.  For those who are in the business in a big way we <Col N="2054" /> are levelling the playing pitch, for those who are in it in a small way and earning less than £15,000 they will not be registered for VAT purposes.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This section deals with group registration for VAT purposes.  It seems to me that subsidiary companies who are trading separately but do not have a very strong relationship with each other could be caught by this provision.  It has even brought to my attention that the Revenue Commissioners already have been suggesting that in circumstances where there are two independent subsidiaries of a company trading separately, if one has a liability for VAT, and the other is owed a VAT rebate, under the proposals here they are not prepared to treat them separately and they are trying to offset the rebate against the liability.  Can the Minister look at this provision because it seems to be causing problems even in advance of being passed into law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That position exists already in companies similar to those mentioned by the Deputy where refunds are withheld.  Recent developments in the commercial area have raised a number of practical issues in relation to group treatment.  These revolve around the application of group treatment where individual groups comprise entities, some of which are engaged wholly or mainly in taxable activities, others only marginally so and others which are completely exempt.  This is particularly so within the financial services sector where within a single group of companies there may be companies carrying out exempt activities such as banking and taxable activities such as leasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Competitive and market requirements <Col N="2055" /> have tended to make it increasingly desirable that enterprises reorganise themselves away from a single legal entity type of corporate structure and create instead, within a single group, a number of different legal entities dealing with particular segments of the market or with specialised operational or support functions within the group, such as the provision of computer services which is notionally taxable.</P>
    <P>These centralised structures are also regarded as being desirable from the point of view of enhancing performance appraisal and management accountability. Each entity operates as a cost and profit centre, charging other members of the group for any services provided.  This development has created demands for the extension of group treatment to financial services groups which are made up of mixtures of entities, some of which might be largely or wholly engaged in taxable activities, others less so or perhaps marginally so and others whose supplies would be totally non-taxable.</P>
    <P>In the absence of group treatment, the provision of services within these groups could notionally expose them to VAT charges at 21 per cent on internal service type transactions, such as the temporary supply of staff or the supply of data processing services.  Group treatment has been provided for since the introduction of VAT in 1972.  The legislative basis in national legislation is provided for in section 8 of the VAT Act.  The corresponding provision in EC laws is Article 4 of the EC6 VAT directive. Initially, group treatment could only be availed of by taxable persons.  The facility was, however, subsequently extended to groups or persons wholly engaged in exempt activities such as insurance companies. The administrative practice has been to disregard, for VAT purposes, supplies or services which would be notionally taxable, provided by members of a group to one another.  This practice was followed where the separate legal entities, within an individual group, had been established primarily for organisational reasons and where inter group <Col N="2056" /> services would not have been taxable if the members of the group had remained a single legal entity.  Accordingly, it is considered that this administrative practice had not given rise to any loss of revenue since in real economic terms there had not been any addition to the VAT base.  The Revenue Commissioners in response to these changing business structures decided to introduce a trial scheme from September 1989.  This scheme modified in the light of experience gained since its introduction is now being given a legislative base.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not have any problem with most of what the Minister has said, my difficulty is more specific.  In the section as framed, section 73, line 25, the definition of those who would be caught by this section is as follows:</P>
      <P>... two or more persons established in the State are closely bound by financial, economic and organisational links...</P>
      <P>That definition appears to be sufficiently wide to catch a trading relationship between two companies which are totally different.  If companies trade with each other they certainly would have financial links, economic links and organisational links so far as one set of people in one company deal on a day to day basis with a set of people in another company.  Where there is no real legislative or establishment connection between two sets of companies, they could still be caught by this provision.  I do not think the Minister envisaged, for example, that a VAT liability in a company could be offset against a VAT rebate due to a trading partner.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 120a.</P>
      <P>In page 76, before section 76, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;76.&mdash;Notwithstanding anything in the Value-Added Tax Acts, tax payable on motor cars imported by disabled persons for their personal use only, shall be zero-rated.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment I am referring to a quadriplegic who is able to obtain a motor vehicle on loan, as distinct from purchase. I wrote to the Minister and I compliment him, the staff of the Revenue Commissioners and the staff of the Minister's Office, for their courtesy in dealing with this matter to date.  However, the matter has been unsuccessful.  The Minister said he is carrying out a review in regard to the <Col N="2058" /> importation of vehicles for disabled drivers and that in view of the ongoing review he is not in a position to make a decision.  I have a file which I will give to the Minister this evening so that he and his officials can examine it.  The person in question was severely injured in a sporting accident.</P>

      <P>The Trevor Jones Trust Fund was set up by a man injured in a sporting accident.  An article in <i>The Daily Mail</i> of Tuesday, 7 November 1989, outlines the details of setting up this trust fund.  The Trevor Jones Trust will lend a vehicle to the individual concerned.  The person in question has no power in his legs, limited power in his right arm, and slight power in his left.  He is totally confined to a wheelchair.  He needs full-time care and attention and must attend at a rehabilitation centre on a regular basis for physiotherapy.  This person has been offered the use of this special car which would cost £22,500.  The design of the car means that the disabled person can drive it without help.  It includes a hydraulic ramp for a wheelchair and is operated automatically.  The special seats enable the driver to swing himself out and transfer to a wheelchair perfectly unaided.</P>
      <P>Section 92 (2) (a) of the Finance Act, 1989, and Statutory Instrument No. 340 of 1989 detail regulations.  The person concerned qualifies under all the regulations which specify:</P>
      <P>(a)  persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</P>
      <P>(b)  persons wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> (c)  persons without both hands or without both arms;</P>
    <P>(d)  persons without one or both legs;</P>
    <P>(e)  persons having the medical conditions of dwarfism......</P>
    <P>The person qualifies in respect of everything but he will never have the finance to purchase this vehicle.  Neither the health board nor anybody else is in a position to finance the purchase of the wheelchair. The trust fund have been very generous in offering this car which can be brought into the country for him.  Since this is a specific car with a specific registration number it will not lead to widescale abuse.  I am only looking for an exemption so that this person can obtain a car or some other facility to make life easier for him.  This is a reasonable request.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the goodwill, and that came across in the correspondence, but will he favourably consider this request for acceptance on Report Stage?  I will facilitate him with regard to any materials I have.  The Treveor Jones Trust have been in touch with a number of people in Ireland about this case.  In fact, the British Embassy were interested because they know of the representations made regarding this matter.  There is a lot of goodwill about and it is probably bureaucracy which is standing in the way. We should make every effort to resolve this problem.  I thank the Minister for his help in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem with this under the present reliefs governed by the regulations to which the Deputy referred.  The reliefs under those regulations depend on the person owning the car, which excludes this case.  This is an issue we can consider under the review which is taking place, rather than in an amendment here.  I assure the Deputy that he will get my full sympathetic support in finding a resolution to this problem. These are circumstances which the House would want to meet if at all possible. The review taking place will involve <Col N="2060" /> the spokespersons from all the Opposition parties.  We introduced these regulations with a consensus and undertook to review them in the same way.  The problem can be sympathetically considered in that way.  That will be my approach.</P>
      <P>Section 114 of this Bill provides for an amendment in anticipation of the review because it was felt that there was a need to meet problems that were arising on the relief of excise duty and VAT for the adaptation of a vehicle.  The full relief will now apply when this Bill is enacted where the cost of adaptation is not less than 20 per cent of the tax exclusive value of the vehicle.  That amendment is covered in other areas.  The case the Deputy raises will be taken into consideration in the review and we will try to find a solution to it.  The only reason the case is outside the regulations is that the person does not own the car.  I do not propose to address this by way of amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the section 114 to which the Minister referred.  I am referring here to a specific agreed document in regard to the car in question.  I will furnish a copy of the document to the Minister.  I received a letter which indicated that time was marching on and it looked as if the prospect of the person in question obtaining the specially adapted vehicle was rapidly dwindling because eventually the charity would give the vehicle to someone else in the UK, if they have not already done so.  The letter reiterated that the request would not cost the country a penny and if the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, really knew about this case he would move mountains to ensure that the red tape was cut.  This is a very specific matter and I was asked to raise it in the House to try to have the red tape cut so that this car will go to a person who has been medically declared a quadriplegic.  In that instance I would very strongly and earnestly request the Minister to accept my amendment.  I would bend over backwards to try to comply with any reasonable amendment the Minister would make.  At the moment <Col N="2061" /> a person suffering from incapacity of that nature has no way of getting out of the house unless there is someone there to help him get in and out of a car.  The Minister is going to leave the matter for another year, and that is a long way down the road for such people.  I urge the Minister to reconsider that issue which would be tied up in a legal document.</P>

I am excluded under EC law and under a VAT Directive from putting anything into legislation that has the effect of a zero-rating.  As I said, I shall approach the matter under regulation.  I shall stick my neck out here to say to all the experts I have here: find a solution to the case. Everybody in the House wants to find a solution, and I have little doubt that with all expertise available a way will be found to refund the money by regulation.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 125:</P>
      <P>In page 77, subsection (1), between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i) meals;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 80 is the Third Schedule in which those items that will carry a VAT rate of 10 per cent are listed.  My amendment includes an additional item, meals. The intention of the amendment is that meals in restaurants and hotels and take-away foods would be charged at a VAT rate of 10 per cent rather than at 12.5 per cent, which seems to be the Minister's intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing the amendment because I understand that since the Minister made his announcement in the budget certain goods and services would carry a VAT rate of 12.5 per cent and would subsequently move up to whatever the standard rate would be after harmonisation.  The EC Commissioner in charge of competition, Madame Scrivener, has recommended for policy in Europe that meals come into the lower VAT range rather than the standard rate. <Col N="2064" /> The decision taken on budget day by the Minister would put Ireland out of line with current intentions for meals in restaurants and hotels across Europe, which would be very serious indeed for an industry as competitive as the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the difference is not a difference between 10 per cent and 12.5 per cent.  The Minister, and, indeed, the Taoiseach on budget night when he took the Financial Resolutions, said that those goods and services that would move from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent this year would in the next two budgets be moved up to carry whatever the final VAT rate was when full harmonisation took place or when the final decisions on approximation were made.  Today at Question Time the Minister suggested that the range would certainly be between 15 per cent and 17 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I take the point that is being made.  We are not talking about bands.  Indeed, the Commissioner in charge of competition has not been talking about bands for a very long time.  The proposal of the Luxembourg Presidency brings the attitude of the political side of discussions in the EC in line with what Madame Scrivener has been saying since she was appointed to succeed Lord Cockfield.  She has been talking about minimum rates all the time. Therefore there will be a minimum rate, whether or not it is reached, of somewhere between 14 per cent and 16 per cent.  At any rate, the 12.5 per cent tax charged on meals will increase to the minimum rate at least, and probably <Col N="2065" /> beyond it, because Ireland would probably be 2 points or 2.5 points higher than the minimum rate.  The rate on meals would probably be about 18 per cent or 19 per cent.  The Minister knows well, and has said it himself, that there is very little distortion of international trade if VAT rates are within about 2.5 per cent of those prevailing at the other side of an international boundary.  If the minimum rate is 16 per cent, the rate in Ireland will probably be 2 points or 2.5 points higher than that.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, at Question Time today the Minister said that the lower minimum rate proposed by the Luxembourg Presidency was 5 per cent.  It seems reasonable that Ireland's 10 per cent rate would have to come down to within 2.5 points of that rate to avoid distortions in trade.  The position might not be the same when discussing VAT on fixed services such as those provided by the building industry, telecommunication services, or the ESB. It is conceivable to hold those services at a higher level because they are not internationally tradeable to the same extent as are mobile goods and services. The provision of meals is so fundamental to the tourist industry that we would be at a serious competitive disadvantage if the standard in European countries in relation to VAT on meals is somewhere between 5 per cent and 8 per cent and ours is between 16 per cent and 19 per cent.  This is not idle speculation.  Very recently the rate of VAT on meals was 25 per cent and in the Government of which Deputy Quinn and I were members, VAT on meals was brought down to 10 per cent.  This measure was not only widely welcomed by the trade but by the tourist industry in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to look at what happened in the tourist industry at that time and in the years following this reduction. The numbers of people employed in the hotel and restaurant industry went up dramatically.  One could argue that, because two things happen at the same time, one does not cause the other &mdash; and it is always hard to establish a cause and effect relationship &mdash; but the fact that VAT was reduced stopped the closure of <Col N="2066" /> hotels and restaurants.  For the next three years there was a very significant increase in employment.</P>
    <P>As we go into the nineties the difficulties of the CAP and the GATT problems will mean that rural Ireland &mdash; indeed all Ireland &mdash; will be depending more and more on a tourist industry which not only generates income but also employment.  The season will have to be extended so that the employment is not merely seasonal.  Fundamental to our tourist industry will be the rate of excise on petrol and drink and the rate of VAT on food.</P>
    <P>Our charges for meals seem to be out of line with those prevailing in other countries.  A family in Ireland can go out to lunch and get good value which compares well with anywhere in Europe; you will get as fine a lunch in this city &mdash; or indeed any town &mdash; as you will anywhere in Europe and probably at a more competitive price.  However, if you go out at night you will get the same menu with a few items added to give a larger choice and a better appearance of value but the cost goes up astronomically.  We do not have the tradition they have in France of family run restaurants which charge a reasonable price at lunch time and much the same price at night.  They do not have a vast jump in price between what you pay in the middle of the day and the evening. There is a differential, but it is not the big jump that exists here.  We are not competitive when it comes to eating out in the evening; the higher cost cannot all be attributed to the cost of the wine on the bill.  VAT rates of 16 per cent, 17 per cent or 18 per cent are a non-runner if we want to develop our tourist industry competitively.  VAT will end up at the figures I gave if we impose a rate of 12.5 per cent this year.  The Minister and the Taoiseach said as much on budget night.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to go ahead with the imposition of 12.5 per cent on meals; he should hold it at 10 per cent.  I am sure there is a modest cost involved but it could not be an astronomical one.  I know that most of the hotels and restaurants about which we are speaking are registered for VAT but, because there is no <Col N="2067" /> VAT on food, they would not be able to reclaim much of what goes into meals.  If the Minister goes ahead in this regard he may be forced by the negotiations in Europe to change his mind next year.  I understand why the Minister took the decision &mdash; he was reducing the standard rate and increasing the 10 per cent band. It was reasonable when doing so to consider all items at 10 per cent but, subsequent to his decision, another one was made in Europe, a decision which has been circulated widely in this House and through the hotel and catering industry. It seems it is the intention of the competition commissioner to press for meals in all European countries to be charged at the lower rate of VAT, somewhere in excess of 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this amendment. I know it will cost something but, in the totality of the budget and taking into account that the Minister has not conceded anything all day that would cost him anything&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like, as forcefully as I can, to appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision in respect of the additional 2.5 per cent in the rate of VAT on food consumed in hotels and restaurants.  When the rate was reduced to 10 per cent from 25 per cent it meant viability and new life to these areas and equalled the returns to the Exchequer which prevailed when the high rate was in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of particular concern at this time because, so far, 1991 has been a most <Col N="2068" /> disappointing year.  Because of the colossal drop in the American tourist market there is grave concern regarding earnings this year.  That area and the decisions being made in Europe in relation to tourist orientated industries will result in a minimum rate of between 5 per cent and 9 per cent.  These targets are in the minds of people engaged in the industry.  At this point the Minister's policy would not only be detrimental to the viability of restaurants and hotels, it would also be in direct conflict with the proposals emanating from the tourist sectors of the European Commission.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to seriously consider having the 2.5 per cent readjusted to maintain viability and to keep our taxation policies in line with what is proposed as a minimum rate in the European Commission.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I also appeal to the Minister to reduce the rate of VAT on meals.  Today in the <i>Irish Independent</i> a survey showed that 60 per cent of our people intend to spend their holidays at home this year.  In the long run, if there is an increase in the number taking home holidays perhaps the loss incurred by dropping the rates of VAT from 12.5 per cent to 10 per cent might turn into a gain because the higher rate would mean that fewer people would eat out.</P>
      <P>As outlined already by Deputies Noonan and Moynihan, the tourist trade is very important and if there is a trend in Europe to impose the lower scale we should fall in line.  We compete worldwide in the tourist industry and we should try to help it.  For that reason, I should like the rate of VAT on meals to remain at 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been approached&mdash; as I suspect other Members in Opposition have been &mdash; by the Irish Hotels Federation who are among the more professional and persuasive lobbyists in the business.  They presented to me, as they did to Deputies Noonan and Browne, a substantial document.  Deputy Noonan was correct to focus on the difficulties we <Col N="2069" /> will face in the long term.  We will face transitional difficulties in the short term but that is usual in any trading regime. They fear that meals, or perhaps the complete hotel package, will be subject to the higher of the two bands the Community is moving towards.  As the Minister said earlier, the rate is likely to be somewhere in the mid-teens.</P>
      <P>The Dublin branch of the Irish Hotels Federation state in a covering letter dated 2 May that Mrs. Schrivener, the EC Commissioner for Taxation, announced on 26 February last that she is in favour of tourism services being subject to the lower band.  These would include all hotel services.  Opposition Deputies do not have access to the information available to Government Ministers but we must clearly establish the status of that assertion.  Does her opinion amount to a formal decision of the Commission and has that decision been ratified or accepted by the harmonisation Council?  If that is so the tourism industry will face the kind of threat outlined by Deputy Noonan.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Moynihan, a former Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications has substantial hands-on experience in this area.  He was brief in his contribution but he spoke to the point. We will not be the only peripheral region of the European Community which will diversify into rural tourism following changes in the Common Agricultural Policy in the next two to three years. Large sections of France, Britain and Spain will do likewise.  If other costs are to converge and harmonise within reason will we have to ensure that our VAT regime will be of the same order.</P>
      <P>I would now like to deal with the transitional arrangements.  Quite frankly, the difficulties we will face in the long term are more serious.  I ask the Minister to indicate what is the status of the assertion made in the Irish Hotels Federation document <i>vis-à-vis</i> the opinion of the EC Commissioner, Mrs. Schrivener.  Is it correct, and if so, has he taken this into account.  To be fair to him, it was made following the budget announced on 30 January.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what has been said on this matter.  Like other Deputies, I received representations from hotel and restaurant interests.  They presented me with a well-thought out and cogent argument in favour of accepting these amendments.  As Deputy Noonan said, meals in Irish hotels in the evening are not competitively price as compared with most continental countries, in particular France.  An increase of 2.5 per cent in the rate of VAT may not sound very much but, as we are all aware, sometimes when we are out for a meal something snaps and we come to the conclusion that it is too expensive.  While £49 for a meal for two, including wine, may be acceptable £50 is not.  That is not logical but then people are not always logical.</P>
      <P>The hotel and restaurant industry is labour intensive.  Given that there are almost 250,000 people unemployed surely we do not want to do anything which would reduce employment in this sector.  There is little doubt that this increase will lead to a small reduction in employment in this sector.  This may be imperceptible but it will happen.  The Minister should not forget that each employee pays PAYE and PRSI.  Instead of contributing to the Exchequer many people will find themselves on the dole queue and being paid by the State to do nothing as a result of the VAT increase. I ask the Minister to accept either of the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to dispose of the idea that the increase of 2.5 per cent in VAT rates is largely responsible for any increase in the prices charged by restaurants.  It is a matter for the restaurants to decide whether their prices should be low or high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the presentation by the Irish Hotels Federation to the various party spokespersons, I met them for a few minutes last Friday when I told them that the statement made by Madame Schrivener, to which they referred, was apparently made to a sub-committee of the European Parliament.  No records of the <Col N="2071" /> meeting of the sub-committee are available. Therefore, I cannot confirm nor deny that the statement was made but if it was, let me make it clear that no proposals have been brought forward by the Commission or Madame Schrivener at any of the meetings that I or my officials attended.  Indeed, Ireland has sought at all discussions to date to have meals subject to the reduced rate but we found ourselves in the minority.</P>
    <P>It will probably be agreed that accommodation should be subject to the reduced rate but, unless Madame Schrivener, the Commission and other member states change their positions, it is most unlikely that food will be subject to the lower rate.  I can confirm for the House that if the position should change I will take a different direction in next year's budget but I do not see this happening at this stage.  I will say no more about it except that is the way the discussions have been going.</P>
    <P>The approach I have adopted to tax approximation is to move downwards.  I moved from a rate of 25 per cent to 23 per cent and 21 per cent this year at a cost of £125 million.  The net difference in spending, having reduced the top rate and increased the 10 per cent rate to 12.5 per cent, is £37.5 million to the consumer. Consequently, there should not be any drop, in overall terms, in the amount of money available to consumers.  I want to confirm that if there is any fall-off that will not be the reason.</P>
    <P>On the question of tax approximation, I have never pretended that it is an <i>a la carte</i> menu even thought we have been criticised in the House during the past few years for not moving towards it.  I have considered this matter to see which services, which are subject to the 10 per cent rate, may have to be moved to a higher rate.  I have started this process. With regard to our competitiveness, the VAT rate in the UK &mdash; Northern Ireland &mdash; is 17.5 per cent while the rate in Denmark is 22.5 per cent.  As far as we are concerned, the tourism industry will make a greater contribution to economic development as a job creator and as a <Col N="2072" /> good earner of foreign revenue.  We will give it every possible assistance but we have to be realistic and consider what we will face in Europe.</P>
    <P>If things should change and take a different turn between now and the next budget, so be it, and we would certainly have another look at it.  The cost of dropping it at this stage would be £15 million and we would be back to where we were if we had to take the two jumps together. We have taken one step and that is the position.  Unless the Commission makes changes that is likely to be the outcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may take up the Minister's last point first.  According to the IHF, the estimated cost of reducing the VAT on food and beverages by 2.5 per cent, the cost of the forfeiture of the 2.5 per cent increase in VAT on the meals component in hotels, is approximately £4 million.  The gap between £4 million and £15 million is clearly not an arithmetic error, and the Minister may wish to clarify this.  However, what is more to the point is that if the IHF are working on assumptions which allow them to reach that conclusion and the Department are working on assumptions that produce the figure the Minister has given, then there is a grave discrepancy on the bases of figures &mdash; unless everybody is using electronic calculators and we are not allowing for arithmetic error.</P>
      <P>This brings me to my second point. There seems to be a large discrepancy in the perception of the Department of Finance and the Minister regarding the overall optimum potential for the tourism industry and the perception of a component of the tourist industry, namely, the Irish Hotels Federation.  They make the point in the document from which I quoted earlier:</P>
      <P>The 1980s Experience:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>VAT rates in the industry were increased rapidly from 10 per cent through the various levels up to 23 per cent, and in fact up to 25 per cent, in the first half of the 1980s.  The effect on the industry was dramatic.  More than 10 per cent of all hotels in the <Col N="2073" /> country closed and went out of business in the four years from 1981 to 1985. This, in turn, resulted in a serious downturn in employment in the industry.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Noonan asked, can we attribute the closure of a great many small country hotels predominantly to variations in VAT rates?  We do not know. The IHF are not saying that is the cause of the closures, but they are saying it is a component of the cause of the closures. If the people to whom the Government, through the Irish Tourism Federation, had given a primary role in promoting tourism and the product of tourism are at such variance with the estimates from the Department of Finance of what is needed to do their task and maintain the figures, which clearly cannot be maintained for a variety of reasons, there is a problem that is bigger than the net problem of getting the VAT rates together, and that is, the difference between the analysis that the Department of Finance are using and that of the major lobby group if such diverse conclusions are being reached.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that as far as the Minister is concerned the statement attributed to Madame Schrivener has no status and as far as the Department of Finance are concerned no formal proposal has come from the Commission and clearly no Council decision has been taken in relation to these matters.  Since that is not correct the consequential arguments fall.</P>
    <P>The Minister used the apposite phrase that we cannot adopt an <i>á la carte</i> approach to this matter and that clearly the Community will determine whether meals are to be categorised in the higher band of VAT rates as distinct from the lower band.  In view of the impact this will have on tourism, particularly in peripheral countries, what is the status of that decision.  Is it finite?  Has the decision firmed up yet?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The components of the normal family holiday are the costs of transport, accommodation, food and drink.  That is about it.  There is a conventional wisdom in this country that Ireland is a great value location for holidays, that things are low priced and one can stay in bed and breakfast houses and go out for meals and that holidays are dearer everywhere else in Europe.  That is not true.  In terms of accommodation it is much cheaper to book into a room in France than it is in Ireland because in France they charge for the room and not per person.  In any small town in France a husband and wife and two teenage children can book accommodation and be charged for only two rooms and the cost will work out a lot cheaper per head than in Ireland.  Indeed, if you go for a meal at night it will cost less because of the system they have of organising their restaurants.  I do not know what their VAT rate is, but there is good value in food to be found in France.  They also have very good value in drink because of the low cost of local wines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if we are comparing ourselves to the UK, our hotel and bed and <Col N="2075" /> breakfast costs are similar.  Their VAT rates are higher because their VAT on meals is 17.5 per cent while at present ours is 10 per cent.  However, the big disadvantage until very recently was the excise rate on petrol and drink.  There is a danger that we are organising ourselves in a way that would be very uncompetitive.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Minister's reply that he would like to see a more vibrant tourist industry, a tourist industry that would play a larger part in our economic development.  He acknowledges our concern about the CAP and the GATT, the reduction in economic activity in rural Ireland that might bring about and the need to replace that activity.  One of the ways to replace economic activity and provide viable jobs in rural Ireland is through developing the tourist industry. Why does the Minister not hold the line in the negotiations in Europe?  I know it is difficult, that every rate is negotiable and that each country has to push its own national interest as strongly as possible, but it does not seem to be a tenable negotiating position to be saying in Europe that meals must remain in the lower band of VAT rates and at the same time in this House making a decision, before the decision is made in Europe, that meals should fall into the higher rate of VAT.  The Minister has already sold out his own case.  There is not much point talking in Europe about meals being in the lower band of VAT rates when the Minister's colleagues around the table will be able to tell him that he did not practice what he preached and that in his last budget he had taken the first step to put meals into the higher rate of VAT.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should reconsider this.  I am surprised at the figure the Minister has given us for the cost of implementing this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">

      <P>Deputy Dukes who has just come into the House brought down VAT on meals from 25 per cent to 10 per cent.  We can argue about the degree to which this had an effect but it had an effect for the better on employment in hotels and restaurants. If the stimulation of the tourist industry is going to be a major plank of economic development of Ireland, increasing the VAT rate to 12.5 per cent &mdash; knowing well that in three years time it will end up at 17 per cent, 18 per cent or 19 per cnet &mdash; is not the way to do this.</P>

To take a general approach, there should not be any reduction in the consumer spend arising out of the increase in VAT on meals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reply to some of the points made by Deputy Quinn about the number of hotels which closed down during that part of the eighties to which he referred.  How many of these hotels closed because of the recession in our economy during that period?  Anyone who tries to suggest that this Government are not fully committed to tourism are not facing up to reality.  We have adopted a new tourism policy which seeks to double the number of visitors coming to this country, increase revenue and provide 25,000 jobs.  We are on target towards achieving these objectives.  Our tourist industry was dealt a death blow by the Gulf War which led to Americans not travelling abroad during that period. The fairly quick end to the war at the end of January gave us a chance of recovering some of that lost revenue.  The tourism season has already started and from what we have heard it will be quite a good season.  Perhaps it will not be as good from the point of view of the number of American tourists visiting here but a lot of business is coming in from Europe.  As I have already said, we will ensure that our VAT rate on meals will be competitive with the EC norm.  Deputy Noonan said that the cost of rooms in France is cheaper than here.  VAT on <Col N="2078" /> rooms in France is 18.6 per cent while it is 10 per cent in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to again make it clear that we cannot find any confirmation of Madame Schrivener's statement.  Nothing has emanated from the Commission and no statement has been made at any of the meetings.  As Deputy Noonan will be aware, the proposals in this area come from the Commission &mdash; they do not originate with the Government.  We are very much in the minority in pursuing the question of VAT on meals.  We have pursued this issue very strenuously.  We will continue our efforts to try to change this proposal but there is no sign of any change at present.  I am merely dealing with the reality as I see it.</P>
    <P>The figure of £15 million incorporates everything.  I suspect that the figure of £4 million given by the hotels' federation, who are very good at lobbying the various political parties, represents their sector of the industry and that the balance is made up from restaurants, cafeterias, take-aways, etc.  They make it look like a small problem from their point of view but, as everyone knows, one cannot draw lines through various sectors of the business. The figure I have given is the correct one.  There is not any great divergence of views on this issue.  As I said, I met the hotels federation for a short while last Friday to tell them that they have circularised everyone on the basis of a statement from Madame Schrivener.  We cannot find any confirmation of this statement; there is certainly no official record of it.  There has been no sign of such thinking emanating from the commission at either the representatives of Ministers level or ministerial level.  We will continue our efforts in that regard between now and the finalisation of that rate.  It may well be finalised under the Luxembourg Presidency.  We will ensure that the Irish tourism industry market remains competitive with EC norms in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, the tourism industry have outlined to him the seriousness of the imposition of this extra 2.5 per cent VAT on meals.  It is all right for the Minister to say that an extra £37 <Col N="2079" /> million will be made available but this industry are facing very severe problems this year.  The Minister referred to the Government's plan for the industry.  This plan was going fine until the 1991 budget when it was decided to curtail the BES scheme and introduce VAT on certain types of accommodation from 1 July this year.  The Minister did a U-turn in regard to the introduction of VAT on accommodation which will not now be introduced until 1 January 1992.</P>
      <P>The industry are losing confidence in the Government's commitment to tourism. A former president of the hotels' federation said to me no later than today that he believes the Government do not want visitors to have meals in hotels and the extra costs incurred by visitors to Ireland are putting holidays here out of the reach of the visitors Bord Fáilte are trying to bring into the country.  The Government should make a further commitment to tourism, which is the major earner for this State.  Unfortunately, the two major U-turns by the Government in regard to tourism over the past four months have done away with much of the confidence which existed in the industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the Gulf War had affected the number of American visitors coming here.  This is only part of the problem.  There is no coherent policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You were in transit.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this proposal.</P>
      <P>He referred to the statement from Brussels.  How is it this information is available to everyone in the industry but it is not available to the people who represent us in Europe?  I ask the Minister to consider the serious consequences these proposals will have on the industry, taking into consideration the cost of holidaying here compared with other European countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the most exaggerated speech I have ever heard about possible repercussions.  The Deputy should not try to blame me for the short-falls which may arise in the tourism industry this year &mdash; I have nothing whatsoever to do with this.  I have done more for the tourism industry in the past three budgets than any Minister for Finance did for a number of years.  Not alone did I not allow an increase in the price of drink, something the people in the business continually complained about, but I reduced VAT by 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the things that matter to the tourism sector as well as to every other sector.  Our unit wage cost has been improved by 18 percentage points and our inflation rate is the lowest in Europe. These are the things, and not the sort of things the Deputies are talking about here, which matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was complimented by the same people the Deputy talks about for making the adjustment in the BES scheme.  Why?  Because we had small operators in the west, in the south-east and the south-west who had contractual commitments to do jobs on their own small hotels and they could not stand the repayment charges to financial institutions.  Because their season is so short the hotels federation came in and pointed out a certain number of these.  There were other big players in the BES that could well stand on their <Col N="2081" /> own feet.  I have no hesitation in saying that neither I nor the Government are in the business of putting small people out of business.  The Deputy can call that a U-turn; he can call it what he likes.  As far as I am concerned I do not mind what he labels it because I will approach anything in a practical manner and I am not in the business of putting small people out of business.  I want them to be able to carry on.</P>

      <P>I will quote the Deputy what he said on the BES when we come to it.  The Deputy will not like to be quoted one bit.  That is the position in relation to the BES.  I went to Kerry and the first hotelier in Killarney stood up and said: &ldquo;Minister, thank you very much because if you had not taken the action you took on budget day the small people like me would have no money from the BES because all the big players would have taken it anyway&rdquo;.

      <P>No.  I make no apologies to the Deputy or anybody else.  The Deputy can name it a U-turn if he likes. I know the small people who were affected by this, people who had contractual positions and would be put out of business, themselves and their families.  I do not think Deputy Rabbitte stands for that either, or maybe he does, because The Workers' Party are trying to change so fast from where they were to where they are.  Maybe the Deputy is in that business.  I do not know but if he is I am not.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to thank the Minister.  It is correct to say, therefore, that farmers who hire contractors, whether tillage contractors or silage contractors, will be liable for an increase in VAT from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  If a farmer is registered for VAT he will receive his rebate at 12.5 per cent.  If the farmer is not registered for VAT he will still have the old level of flat rate rebate.  There is an additional cost increase for the majority of farmers because when they get the Bill from the <Col N="2088" /> contractor the VAT will be increased from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  Is that what the Minister is telling me?  They will not be able to claim it back because they are not registered.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have not made my position clear.  I am not asking about a change in the rebate in the flat rate of VAT.  What I am trying to establish is what happens on the ground. Many farmers are not registered for VAT, some are registered, and the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing a number of them at present.  If the Minister is trying to find a group of people who are very upset at present he should speak to silage contractors and other agricultural contractors.  The VAT rate they will charge to the farmer will be 12.5 per cent so that the farmer will be paying an extra 2.5 per cent on this year's silage. He will not be able to claim it back if he is not registered.  The vast majority of farmers are not registered and the Minister has no intention of changing the flat rate rebate.  That is the position.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like to hear the Minister's comments on stamp duties.  This is more than just an amendment to the Finance Bill.  This is so far reaching that it amounts to almost a new tax.  It is a significant widening of the scope of stamp duty and the tax base. This area did not get much attention on budget day and there has not been much public debate about it.  Up to now, it has been possible to avoid stamp duty on a wide range of documents either by executing them abroad or simply by ignoring the technical liability on documents executed within the State.  While the legal requirement is there, there was not a financial penalty if one ignored the legal requirement.  The payment of duty on most documents has been more or less voluntary and it has been usual to pay it mostly on documents which were needed to obtain registration of title to Irish property, or on documents which might have to be produced in court.  The Finance Bill proposes to change this to make it compulsory to pay duty in 30 days of execution of all documents.  The conditions are that they are executed within the State if they apply to Irish property or if they relate to any matters done in the State or to be done in the State.  The penalties for non-compliance are quite severe &mdash; up to 30 per cent of the unpaid duty, and on top of that there will be an interest payment of 15 per cent per annum of the amount outstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Stamp duty goes on written documents. The documents liable are those which are within the First Schedule of the Stamp Act, 1891.  I have been supplied with a list of them.  Stampable documents include loan agreements, including mortgages, notation agreements, letters of credit and bond and debenture issues at a rate of 0.1 per cent up to a maximum of £500; debt factoring agreements are stamped at a rate of 6 per cent as are securitisation agreements, partition <Col N="2092" /> agreements and declaration of trust on sales; there is stamp duty of 1 per cent on share transfers; 6 per cent on conveyancing of land, on the sale of receiveables, on contract for sale of business, on contract for sale of goodwill, on assignment of trade marks and patents and intellectual property and on creation of options.</P>
    <P>While the items on that list which directly relate to the transfer of property were always part of the law and the stamp duty is compiled with, many of the other items were not and there is now a very significant <i>de facto</i> tax imposition on these measures.  There is an ever growing list of financial products arising from activities in the Financial Services Centre in Shannon and elsewhere which will be liable to stamp duty, for example, swaps and forward rate agreements, financial futures and options, forward currency agreements, caps, floors and collars to use all the technical terms of the financial markets.  It seems that it is technically possible that these will also attract stamp duty.  I would like the Minister to tell us the scope of this.</P>
    <P>I am advised that this could have huge implications for taxpayers particularly in the financial services sector.  Stamp duty is not a tax to which we have given much attention in the past but if it is applied under this section as widely as I am advised it might be, we are not looking at a minor amendment to the imposition of stamp duty but a very far reaching reimplementation of stamp duty to a degree that almost amounts to a new tax.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister confirm that this is an accurate interpretation of the position? Will he tell us what is expected yield from the series of documents which will now have to be stamped to comply with the law?  Will he tell us if it applies to the whole new range of activities which will be backed up by documentation which would require stamps in the financial services industry?  If that is so, will he give us the total expected tax take and the breakdown across the areas I have listed?</P>

      <P>Section 87, together with all other sections up to section 101, contains several provisions which reform the collection and enforcement of stamp duties. It is not a minor amendment; it is a complete reform of stamp duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These duties are governed primarily by the Stamp Act, 1891.  Many of the features of stamp duty are out of place in a modern tax system.  As structured at present, stamp duty is to a great extent a voluntary tax.  It cannot be directly enforced, as can all other taxes.  Enforcement to date has depended upon the fact that an unstamped document cannot be used as evidence in court proceedings and is useless for many purposes such as the registration of title.  These provisions have been reasonably successful in causing the payment of duty on the great majority of stampable documents.  However, the collection and enforcement powers and the structure of the tax as provided in the 1891 Act are inadequate to deal effectively with evasion and avoidance of duty and are a liability for the Revenue Commissioners in administering a tax which has yields of a similar order of magnitude <Col N="2096" /> as corporation tax or income tax under Schedule D.</P>
    <P>The Bill also updates the penalty provisions in respect of stamp duty.  Many of those provisions have not been changed since 1891.  The provisions are designed largely to compensate for the erosion of monetary values since then.  Evasion and avoidance of duty are tackled by specific provision, the overall aim of which in the case of avoidance is to close loopholes and in the case of evasion to increase the risks inherent in such conduct for all taking part to such an extent that these risks are not worth taking.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to a variety of different documents when talking about instruments.  The matter is one for the House to consider, but, perhaps, we should discuss sections 87 and 88 together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 131:</P>
      <P>In page 81, before section 87, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;87.&mdash;Stamp duty shall not be chargeable on&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a licence granted under section 8,9 or 19 of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, or</P>
      <P>(b)  a lease granted under section 13 of that Act, or</P>
      <P>(c)  an instrument for the sale, assignment or transfer of any such licence or lease or any right or interest therein.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The aim of the collection and enforcement provisions for stamp duties contained in the Bill is to improve tax collection through better compliance. The stamp duty legislation which makes stamp duty a voluntary tax dates from 1891 and is very much a product of the Victorian era.  A voluntary tax has no place in a modern taxation system, particularly for a tax that in 1990 yielded £271 million.  The voluntary character of stamp duty has also created several ambiguities that in turn gave rise to practices such as the keeping of documents off-shore. Because stamp duty was not mandatory, the pressure that would otherwise have developed to keep the structure of the tax, and particularly its charging provisions, in line with modern practices and developments was absent.  The proposals in the Bill have now brought these issues into sharper focus.  There is now an opportunity that I intend to avail of to bring clarity and certainty to this area of taxation and to bring the impact of these duties on the financial services sector into line with the realities in the marketplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have for some time pursued a policy of fostering the growth <Col N="2098" /> of an international financial services industry in Ireland and developing the international financial services centre. The Government's commitment to that policy is unambiguous.  Companies are already doing business in that centre and those who have committed themselves to doing so made their decisions on the basis that financial instruments could be sheltered from stamp duty.  It would not be practical or reasonable to alter that situation.</P>
    <P>The international financial services industry operates generally on very low margins.  The industry is very mobile. Competition in the industry is intense, not just between different companies but also between different countries.  Given the very tight margins in the industry, and its mobility, stamp duty liabilities, financial transactions and instruments would seriously undermine the competitiveness of Ireland as a place in which to do such business.  Accordingly, it is my intention that the financial services industry, both in the international financial services centre and in the country generally, will not under a revised stamp duty regime be obliged to pay duties on financial instruments which, in practice, they have not been obliged to pay to date. The purpose of the amendment is to give statutory effect to this intention.</P>
    <P>However, because of the technical complexity of the instruments and the rapid pace of innovation within the industry, it would be very difficult to do this by way of specific exemptions in the primary legislation.  The difficulty arises because stamp duty is a tax on legal documents or instruments, not on transactions.  Not only do the industry engage in a wide range of transactions, but the types of instruments used are continually changing. Indeed, rapid product innovation is a vital feature of this industry.</P>
    <P>Careful preparation of the legislation is required to deal with this situation and to preserve the existing tax base while ensuring that the instruments which are currently untaxed on a <i>de facto</i> basis will remain so legally under the new legislative framework.  I consider that the power of the Minister of the day to make <Col N="2099" /> orders relating to stamp duty, as provided for in this amendment, is the appropriate mechanism.  Following the enactment of this amendment, officials from my Department and the Revenue Commissioners will have detailed consultation with the finacial services industry to flesh out in the form of relieving orders, the commitment which I have given here.  I will then make the necessary order before 1 November 1991.</P>
    <P>None of the provisions in the Bill relating to the enforcement and collection of stamp duty will come into effect until that date.  The process of consultation will be ongoing so that the duty regime can be tailored to take account of the evolution of the financial services industry.  As proposed, this provision strikes an appropriate balance between the need to respond quickly and flexibly to perceived negative effects of taxation and the ultimate responsibility of the Oireachtas for all legislative matters, including taxation. The provision in subsection (2) limits the power to make orders.</P>
    <P>Instruments over which a Minister would have discretion represent only a tiny proportion of total stamp duty yield. The instruments which can be the subject of ministerial orders yielded less than £1 million in 1990.  The Minister will not have any power to amend, by order, the legislation affecting the main sources of the stamp duty yield, such as the duty on land and houses.</P>
    <P>In addition, subsection (5) provides that any orders made must be laid before this House.  To further safeguard the role of the Oireachtas in legislative matters any orders made must be ratified subsequently by the Oireachtas, effectively in the next Finance Act, otherwise they would cease to have effect.  This amendment is a considered response to the detailed consultations which officials have had with representatives of the financial services industry.  It does not in any way relieve that industry of an existing taxation burden; it creates a mechanism where the <i>status quo</i> can be given to a coherent, legislative basis and where the stamp duty regime can subsequently <Col N="2100" /> be adjusted to take account of subsequent innovations in the financial services industry.</P>

      <P>I thought I had a temperature, it is not very nice when you are here all day.  Amendment No. 131 would, if enacted, exempt from stamp duty any subsequent transfer on the sale of leases and licences issued for the purpose of oil exploration.  This exemption will not lead to any revenue losses.  It is not the practice at present to pay stamp duty on such transfers.  Transfers to date have been executed abroad, thus escaping the charge of stamp duty.  Under the revised collection and enforcement provisions contained in this Bill, this will no longer be possible.  As a result, the transfer of leases and licences, or any interest in them, will be subject to duty of up to 6 per cent of the sums paid.</P>
      <P>As a very high cost, high risk industry, oil exploration needs to attract investors and one way in which this is achieved is by the sale of part of the rights and interests conferred by a lease or a licence to explore for oil.  Stamp duty at 6 per cent would act as a significant disincentive for such investment.  Because of this Government's commitment to the development of this industry and the fact that the exemption would merely preserve the <i>status quo</i> in this area, I proposed this amendment.</P>

    <P>In page 81, line 22, after &ldquo;is hereby <Col N="2102" /> amended&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;as respects instruments executed on or after the 1st day of November, 1991,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 87 of the Bill places the collection and enforcement of stamp duties on the same footing as other taxes.  Other sections of the Bill follow through on that changed basis for stamp duty collection and enforcement by setting out who is accountable for paying tax, by revising interest and other penalties for late payment and evasion and by giving powers of investigation to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of stamp duties.</P>
    <P>On publication of the Bill, one of the concerns expressed by many interested individuals and bodies was the potential in the Bill as drafted for some provisions to have retrospective effect, to which Deputy Rabbitte referred a few months ago.  I want to remove any doubt about this.  The provisions of the Bill relating to the changed basis for stamp duty, collection and enforcement, revised interest and penalty provisions and the revised powers of investigation will apply only to instruments executed after 1 November 1991.  These amendments have been tabled to achieve this amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree with most of the Minister's arguments but I ask him to again recite how he sees the checks and balances and the involvement of the House.

    <P>
      <Col N="2105" /> The following motion was moved by Deputy J. Bruton on Tuesday, 21 May 1991:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, appalled that in each of the last two months in succession new all-time records were reached in the Register of Unemployment, despite the fact that emigration in the latest four years of 136,000 was almost double the 71,000 who emigrated in the preceding four years; noting that unemployment, now standing at 19.7 per cent of the workforce is the highest by far in the EC and more than double the EC average, calls for the establishment of an all-party committee on job creation with responsibility to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  carry out as speedily as possible an audit of all Government activity to indentify and propose changes to any schemes which discourage, or fail adequately to encourage, the creation or seeking of employment and to recommend such steps as it considers appropriate to improve the climate for the creation and maintenance of jobs;</P>
    <P>(2)  propose specific initiatives that can be taken to promote the creation of viable jobs.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. a1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>acknowledges the contribution which the partnership between the Government and the principal economic and social interests in our society has made, reaffirms its belief in the strategy outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as the way to develop a modern, efficient and competitive economy which will generate growth and jobs and share the benefits equitably, points to the success of this strategy in creating 70,000 new private <Col N="2106" /> sector jobs in three years and has confidence in the new area-based response to long term unemployment as the best way of bringing the long term unemployed back into the labour market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment last night I suggested that the first step we should take in seeking to create jobs is to make sure that jobs are protected and that, where possible, there are no further redundancies unless absolutely necessary.  I regret to say that, even though it was a good idea to introduce legislation dealing with redundancy payments, we have now reached the point where profitable companies are shedding jobs.  This is not acceptable given that many people are unemployed.  There is a moral obligation on companies making profits to ensure that they maintain employment.</P>
      <P>Because of the policy pursued by the Government the public service has become a dirty word.  Those who have served the State loyally down through the years now find their jobs under threat. Despite the fact that there is a crying need for extra staff in many services people have been offered early retirement. It is possible that there will be further redundancies in Irish Steel; 1,500 jobs are likely to be lost in An Post and 500 sub-post offices are threatened with closure; Telecom Éireann, despite making massive profits, intend to reduce the number of staff even further; and RTE, despite all the warnings given in this House 12 months ago when the Broadcasting Bill was discussed are likely to make staff redundant.  If the Government are serious about creating jobs they should, as an initial step, stop those companies which are making profits making staff redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the reduction in the inflation rate provided the greatest possible incentive to create jobs.  I listened attentively to what Deputy Bruton had to say.  I did not agree with everything he said &mdash; he made eight points &mdash; but nonetheless he should be complimented for attempting to grapple with this major problem.  Some of his <Col N="2107" /> suggestions however could present us with problems.  The Minister defended the <i>status quo</i> and said that the emigration figure could be as low as 15,000 for the current year.  I would put it the other way around and say that the emigration figure could be as high as 15,000 in the current year.  That is a rather negative approach to adopt.</P>
    <P>The question which was not addressed by Deputy Bruton or the Minister is why those people who have benefited most from the reduction in the rate of inflation have not created jobs.  Neither of them saw a specific role for the CII.  I believe however that if jobs are to be created the CII will have to play a central role.  It would seem also that no one has responsibility to create jobs.  The Minister mentioned several times during the course of his contribution that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> refers to the need to create jobs.  It is stated under the heading &ldquo;Employment as a Priority&rdquo; that modern manufacturing industry needs capital investment to be competitive, to produce new products, to take advantage of technological advances and to increase productivity and that the creation of new jobs is dependent on such investment.</P>
    <P>Why have we not seen such investment? We read in our newspapers each week that Irish multinationals are investing abroad but there is precious little investment at home.  That is outrageous and seems to indicate a lack of confidence in the Irish business sector.  That matter needs to be addressed.  Criticism has been levelled at the foreign-based multinationals but it should be remembered that they account for 40 per cent of jobs in manufacturing industry.  They have been criticised also, and rightly so in some cases, for the manner in which they have repatriated their profits but what is far more damaging is that so-called Irish entrepreneurs have given a vote of no confidence in deciding to invest abroad. That point needs to be brought home forcibly to the business sector.</P>
    <P>There have been cutbacks in every sector.  In the health sector, people have <Col N="2108" /> to endure pain to ensure that the books are balanced.  They are suffering and have to wait for hip operations or heart surgery. Yet, those who have gained most have callously exported their capital to other countries where there is a greater chance of increased profits.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister stated that there is a need for equality in the work-place. One question which needs to be addressed is the question of the European Social Charter.  This country and our neighbours in Britain have been identified as the two member states within the European Community who have not delivered.  If we want our workforce to be content and more productive we need to ensure that they enjoy the same conditions enjoyed by those on mainland Europe.  A survey carried out in Britain proves beyond doubt that both Britain and Ireland have violated the European Social Charter.  It is deplorable that the Minister is reluctant to introduce legislation and have the matter discussed in the House.  If our workforce are happy and content they will be more productive. It is absolutely necessary therefore that we try to achieve the standards required given that we face integration with Europe.  These issues cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, is standing in for the Minister but I would like to address a number of issues raised in the Minister's speech. The Minister stated that the ESB strike is likely to be a disincentive to investment in the country and by so doing, by implication, blamed the workforce.  However, there is another side to the coin.  In the first place this strike should not have taken place.  We were unanimous in this House in saying that the strike should be brought to an end quickly, but from my personal experience with some of the ESB management during the strike, I can say that there was much to be desired.  I had occasion during the strike&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There were two <Col N="2109" /> sides to the dispute and I do not accept that the blame lies solely with the workforce in the ESB.  A strike of that kind certainly cannot be repeated.  We have a <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> on which we are pinning so much hope for industrial peace.  We cannot afford to go outside the guidelines laid down in that programme because if we do it will work to the detriment of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> represents a fundamental change in the approach of both Government and the social partners to the matter of managing our affairs.  A small trading economy cannot prosper with divisive and competing interests.  Through the implementation of the programme, the Government and the social partners have adopted a strategy which will accelerate economic and social progress in the nineties. This strategy is to maintain a low inflation economy with a stable exchange rate which can compete internationally. By entering into a partnership between all the interests concerned, we have put ourselves in the position to transform Irish society in this decade in such a way that we will increase significantly our prosperity and distribute that prosperity more equitably and fairly.</P>
      <P>Fundamental to the successful implementation of the programme and achievement of the benefits it will bring to our society, is that we maintain firm control of our public finances so that there is a steady reduction in the national debt to GNP ratio.  This is an overriding principle of the programme and one which cannot be infringed in the implementation of the programme.  To depart from that principle would plunge the economy back into a spiral of rising inflation and interest rates, lower real incomes, declining standards of living and collapse of the investment we need to create jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we have learned anything over the <Col N="2110" /> past few years, it must be that macro-economic stability is vital to economic progress in a small open economy.  The central objective of macro-economic policy in the programme is to secure and strengthen long term growth potential.</P>
    <P>The improvement in macro-economic conditions since 1987 has been the fundamental reason for the improved performance of industry in terms of output and employment growth.  Industrial enterprises, whether in public or private ownership, which can competitively export or displace imports have been, and will continue to be, the most important engine of Irish economic growth.  One out of every three jobs in the Irish economy is now dependent on manufacturing which spends £10,600 million in the economy each year.</P>
    <P>The primary objective for manufacturing in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is to make the maximum contribution to employment growth and higher living standards in Ireland through building a strong internationally competitive industrial sector. In practical terms, the aim is to create 20,000 new jobs each year of the programme in manufacturing and international services.</P>
    <P>To achieve this goal, the Government will continue to strengthen the indigenous industrial sector, particularly in terms of scale and innovation.  It is essential that we ensure greater integration of industrial activity with other sectors of the economy so that we can increase the Irish value added share of industrial output.</P>
    <P>A major priority in this has to be the development of natural resources which can then serve as a foundation for increased industrial expansion.  We must also seek to achieve a satisfactory regional balance in industrial development.</P>
    <P>The cost of servicing public debt this year will amount to more than £2.4 billion. It will account for between one-quarter and one-third of every £1 collected on tax revenue during the year.  It will, for example, absorb the combined total of all the money collected in VAT, <Col N="2111" /> under the employment and training levy, and motor vehicle duties or more than three-quarters of all expected income tax revenue this year.  Our total national debt still remains significantly higher than GNP.  It is an enormous burden for taxpayers and represents a huge constraint on the Government's ability to undertake economic policies which help to create employment or social policies which provide adequate services for those most in need in our society.  It is for these reasons that the control of public expenditure remains high on the agenda of the Government.</P>
    <P>With a great deal of effort and sacrifice on the part of many we have started to achieve control over public expenditure in recent years.  The ratio of national debt to GNP has been falling steadily and the Government are determined that this process will continue.  A great deal of the burden of adjustment must fall inevitably on programmes involving current expenditure and this involves difficult and painful decisions at times.</P>
    <P>The alternative is, however, an even less attractive proposition.  The experience over a large part of the past ten years, shows clearly that a failure to take in the short term the actions needed to bring public expenditure under control results at a later stage in a need for even more drastic and painful action to bring order to the public finances.  We are today still paying the price in terms of high unemployment and, sometimes, less than adequate social services for the failure to face reality following the oil-price shocks to the world economy in the seventies.</P>
    <P>Control of public finances remains the vital touch-stone of the Government's responsibilities in economic management. How well they do this has a major influence on the confidence of investors in the Irish economy &mdash; a confidence that is restored only by sustained good management practice by the Government over a prolonged period.</P>
    <P>Many commentators have pointed to the fact that interest rates in Ireland in recent years have remained stubbornly higher than those of our narrow-band <Col N="2112" /> EMS partners despite exemplary achievements in the economic fundamentals of productivity inflation, trade surpluses, public expenditure control, and so on.  I share the concern of the business sector and of mortgage holders on this score.  The reality, however, is that we are paying, through higher interest rates, a risk premium for our past failures to manage our economic affairs well.  The longer we continue on the prudent management of the economy achieved in recent years in co-operation with the social partners the greater the increase in credibility achieved and the lower the need for a risk premium in interest rates.</P>
    <P>This trend will be further strengthened by the enactment of the Competition Bill, 1991, which represents a central instrument in the Government's programme to revitalise the economy, to encourage growth and thereby address the most pressing problem facing us all &mdash; unemployment.</P>
    <P>The legislation will bring about a fundamental change in the basic structure of the market place by introducing into it a statutorily protected requirement for competition.  Competition is fundamental to a growing economy.  It is the life blood of an efficient market &mdash; a dynamic regulator without which everyone suffers.  When competition is present, resources are allocated efficiently, innovation and enterprise prosper, and consumer welfare is safeguarded. Without competition firms may become dominant and bleed the economy. Without competition cosy cartels can emerge and share markets to the detriment of consumers and suppliers alike.</P>
    <P>Without competition a dominant market player can abuse his position to prevent new players entering the market place or to undermine successful companies. Without competition stagnation can infect a firm, an industry and the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>The impact of all Government policies on the creation of employment must be central to all our deliberations.  This does not mean that the Government must <Col N="2113" /> adopt a crude, simplistic approach by increasing expenditure on &ldquo;co-called&rdquo; job-creation measures.  If there is one lesson that everyone should have learned in recent years it is that government, <i>per se</i>, does not create sustainable jobs and that attempts to do so on any significant scale are more likely to undermine than support job creation over a period of years.</P>
    <P>If I could point to an example: the Review of Industrial Performance undertaken by the Department of Industry and Commerce for the three year period to the end of 1989 and published last December showed quite clearly that over the period of 1985 to 1989 direct public expenditure on promoting industrial development fell significantly &mdash; by some 29 per cent in real terms.  Over the same period, however, there was a very significant improvement in job creation in the manufacturing sector compared with the previous four year period.</P>
    <P>Our experience over the years shows a poor correlation between direct State expenditure on industrial and promotion and net employment creation.  The conclusion is clear: more State expenditure is not an adequate response to our employment creation problems.  Such an approach may, in fact, be self-defeating if it contributes to an imbalance between Government revenue and expenditure which give rise to borrowing, inflation or interest rate levels which, in turn, undermine the confidence of investors in the management of our economic affairs.</P>
    <P>The achievement of increased employment levels in the traded goods and services sector of the Irish economy depends on demand conditions in both our home and overseas markets and the ability and willingness of Irish-based firms to compete effectively in these markets and to undertake the investment which will enable them to do this.  The willingness of firms to invest in employment creating projects and their ability to compete effectively depends significantly on their confidence in the management of the economy by the Government.  In order to engender and sustain such confidence the Government must avoid policies <Col N="2114" /> involving expenditure which cannot be undertaken without recourse to levels of taxation which stultify effort and enterprise or which require Government borrowing at levels which lay claim to a high proportion of future Government revenues.</P>
    <P>As stressed in the new programme, the development of indigenous industry is a priority.  We must eliminate the barriers to growth and develop the necessary skills in existing areas of perceived weakness. The performance of the medium to large indigenous sector has been very disappointing over recent years.  Falling employment, loss of domestic market share, low profitability and declining levels of investment have characterised these sectors.  If we are to generate jobs and wealth in Ireland, we must build indigenous companies of sufficient quality, scale and strength to win and sustain profitable positions in international markets. This has to be of paramount concern to every individual and company in the country who has chosen to live and work in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Basic entrepreneurial ambition is central to this.  While the State cannot create ambition, it can and will underpin entrepreneurial effort through ensuring a competitive cost structure and a range of State supports designed to supplement the entrepreneurs vision.</P>
    <P>The Government have recognised that there has to be a sharper focusing of the various industrial support measures for indigenous industry.  This has happened over the past three years.  Much greater emphasis has been placed on international competitiveness, strategic development and major incremental growth within companies.  No support is available for marginal investments or in cases where no additional output or employment will result.  The fundamental issue we are now addressing is ensuring that State supports are directed at areas of business weakness, particularly marketing, product development and management. NESC identified the development of greater scale in Irish industry as a critical need in the context of the greater competition arising from <Col N="2115" /> the Single European Market.  The Government share this view and are currently addressing the problem in a number of ways.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the recent Review of Industrial Performance, it is now the case that state supports are being concentrated selectively on those indigenous companies capable of achieving and sustaining positions in international markets. We must help companies grow to the scale necessary to maintain their positions, and this is being done through marketing, product development and management development supports.</P>
    <P>The industrial development agencies now have an operational target to increase by 100 within ten years the number of Irish manufacturing companies having an annual turnover greater than £5 million in real terms over the period.  We are seeking to identify companies with significant growth potential that can benefit from a substantial programme of State supports.  Regrettably, I have to say that the majority of indigenous companies may only have limited potential for significant development because of the nature of their activities or limitations in their capabilities.  It must remain the case that companies cannot expect to be candidates for significant State support unless they are reoriented towards development opportunities or build-up of their capabilities.</P>
    <P>While the Government believe that sustained industrial development requires the development of a strong indigenous sector, and this is a priority under the programme, we also continue to need overseas industry.  This has been a major employer in Ireland and one which has provided modern industrial technology, capital inflows and domestic market opportunities for indigenous industries.  In both cases, we must maximise all the benefits that flow from such industries while ensuring a balanced growth of direct and indirect jobs.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the benefits which have come from overseas industry but we must strive to increase the role these firms <Col N="2116" /> can play in the context of Ireland's industrial development.  It is essential that all potential benefits from overseas firms are maximised.  We will continue to seek overseas industry which will make the maximum direct contribution to the Irish economy in terms of sustained high skilled jobs and net exports, including inputs of local material and services.  We will achieve the maximum value for money through the targeting of resources towards sub-sectors and markets of greatest potential and the differentiation in the incentives package between different categories of project.</P>
    <P>Our job creation needs are such that we must make Ireland attractive to overseas and indigenous industry to locate here and carry out further investment.  A positive cost environment, together with highly qualified human resources, and the extension of the 10 per cent corporate tax rate for manufacturing to the end of the year 2010 represent a significant benefit to industry located here.  Indeed, I would like to take this opportunity to rebut suggestions that the decision to extend the 10 per cent rate was unwise.  This is one of the key elements in allocating overseas investment to Ireland, and would be regarded by many as the most important.  Certainly, the Industrial Development Authority were in no doubt as to the need for the extension and their executives are at the coal face of overseas promotion and know what are the critical factors in winning projects.</P>
    <P>A further cornerstone of the Government's commitment to job creation is the move to relate industrial incentives to the jobs created in firms rather than to capital spending, and this will be continued.  As a result, there has been a reduction in capital grants, and a shift from capital grants to employment grants, marketing and other forms of support.  Grants are assessed and decided on a per-job basis, and capital grants are paid only on achievement of job targets.  This is the factual situation and is being ignored by people who continue to call for changes that are already in place.  Accelerated capital allowances will be reduced to 25 per cent from April 1991 and eliminated <Col N="2117" /> in April 1992, and other tax provisions, such as the 10 per cent incentive tax rate, the BES and section 84, have been tightened up.</P>
    <P>The shift in industrial aids to meet the needs of indigenous industry will also continue.  Exchequer expenditure on the marketing programmes supported by the EC Structural Funds will more than double by 1993 from £14.7 million in 1989.  Similar expenditure on science and technology programmes will total over £100 million in the same period compared to £15.8 million in 1989.</P>
    <P>My responsibilities for science and technology have a direct bearing on creating advanced factor conditions and infrastructure resources.  Such factors and resources facilitate and sustain the creation of high productivity jobs in advanced sectors and segments of industry. There is a need for our industry and entrepreneurs to constantly upgrade their skills, processes, products, marketing focus and competitive advantages.  There is no standing still.  It is those high productivity branches of activity that give high incomes.  High incomes for individuals translate into high national income and to general prosperity, but that can only happen if Irish companies upgrade and aim to be advanced, sophisticated and thoroughly professional providers of goods and services.</P>
    <P>I am very keen to use every opportunity, including this debate, to impress on Irish business the need for standards. ISO 9000, in particular, is a basis, a resource for industry.  It will become a basic qualification without which one will find it difficult to supply the rising standards and expectations of a growing number of European buyers.  Allow me to use this forum, as I have used many another, to call on industry to install quality standards and, in particular, to install ISO 9000.</P>
    <P>Irish firms, generally smaller than their counterparts in any industry elsewhere in Europe, must improve their process technology, product technology and service to customers.  Through programmes for advanced technology in, for example, <Col N="2118" /> software or through building a more supportive infrastructure for our Irish electronics firms we can help them to upgrade and innovate to stay ahead.  There are programmes for biotechnology, power electronics, optoelectronics also.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland must never become complacent about our competitive advantages in European or global markets. Low order advantages, like labour costs or natural resources, are a <i>sine qua non.</i> If we did not have them we simply could not compete.  However, they are not enough.</P>
    <P>Competitiveness, and the capacity to expand and grow, is won at the level of individual firms and industries.  Policy is assisting them to build their competitiveness by upgrading their technology. They must adapt and enhance their position by gaining high order competitive advantages that superior knowhow confers.  Then their position becomes more secure and provides a sounder basis for growth.</P>
    <P>As I stated, the new job targets for manufacturing and international services in the period of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will be 20,000 a year.  The achievement of these targets will require: continuing stability in the economic environment and cost competitiveness throughout the industrial and services sectors; a positive external environment for our exports; and a co-operative response from firms, employees and the various State agencies involved in supporting developments.</P>
    <P>The overall jobs target in manufacturing and international services for the period of the programme remains at 60,000.  We must recognise that recession in the UK and US may retard developments and attention was drawn to this factor in the programme itself.  Because of this there may be fluctuations around the planned annual job target of 20,000. This does not in any way diminish our determination to achieve the 60,000 job target.  We will achieve this and hopefully more.</P>
    <P>The achievement of this target will be facilitated by the introduction of a number of new measures such as: a wider <Col N="2119" /> use of employment grants as the means of channelling State aid into developing firms; the exploration of new segments in the internationally-traded services sector, examples of which are audio visual sevices, entertainment services and education and training; addressing specific manpower needs in the provision of additional third-level places; the development of land suitable for industrial development; and maintaining pressure on the EC Commission to carry out a rigorous examination of State aid schemes throughout the Community, particularly those in central regions which have the effect of negativing the regional aids operated in Ireland at significant cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as stated in the programme, an Industrial Policy Forum involving the social partners and relevant Government Departments has been established to examine industrial policy issues such as those adverted to by the social partners in NESC, including implementation of measures for indigenous industry and the achievement of the maximum return from the industry budget.</P>
    <P>It is more than apparent from these actions that the Government remain firmly committed to developing a vibrant industrial sector within Ireland which can contribute to the growth in national wealth and employment opportunities. Since 1986, the economy has expanded rapidly, growing by about 5 per cent in both 1989 and 1990.  Such strong growth, back-to-back, over the two year period has not been achieved for more than a decade.  Much more importantly, this achievement was not accompanied by spiralling inflation, a burgeoning balance of payments deficit, a sliding exchange rate, and a soaring debt/GNP ratio.  Quite the contrary; in this period of expansion, those financial fundamentals all improved.</P>
    <P>Ireland's inflation rate has now become firmly established as one of the lowest in the world.  Our exchange rate remains steady within the EMS.  Our balance of payments position has been transformed <Col N="2120" /> from one of deficit to healthy surplus. Most significantly, the upward drift in the debt/GNP ratio was first halted, and then set firmly on a downward path.</P>
    <P>We must constantly bear in mind the four key elements of this strategy and recall their essential purposes.  The fundamental outcome must be that the strategy results in an improvement in the competitiveness of the economy.  The four key elements are: restoring stability to the public finances; committing ourselves to a stable exchange rate; devising sensible arrangements in relation to incomes and other domestic costs; and structural reform of the economy, particularly in relation to taxation.  These will remain central to Government economic policy and will be pursued relentlessly.</P>
    <P>I subscribe fully to the need to make competition policy an important instrument of our industrial development policies. If Irish indigenous firms are protected from the cold wind of competition on the domestic market it is most unlikely that they will be able to secure new markets or maintain existing ones in an international trading environment where the barriers to trade and to competition are being removed.  As I highlighted earlier, the proposed new Competition Act will make a significant contribution to the creation of a more innovative successful and competitive sector in Ireland.</P>
    <P>With the ending of the Gulf War, the outlook for the manufacturing sector appears to be improving.  The IDA expects the level of new first-time job creation to be broadly in line with expectations. Implementation of projects approved in recent years is progressing well.  While, the after-effects of the Gulf War, coupled with the continuing recession in the UK and US means that the net employment growth of recent years is unlikely to be repeated this year, the volume of manufacturing output is projected to maintain the growth level of 5 per cent achieved in 1990.  Manufacturing export volume growth is predicted to be 5 per cent compared with a level of 7.5 per cent in 1990.</P>
    <P>Prospects in key sectors are now <Col N="2121" /> recovering.  There is renewed interest in electronics, with a high level of site visits from the US.  Electronics exports are expected to grow by 6 per cent in 1991. The software sector continues to perform well and exports are projected to continue to grow, though not as rapidly as in 1990.  Growth in output and exports of pharmaceuticals are expected to be broadly in line with 1990 levels of 2 per cent and 6.5 per cent respectively.  The prospects for a small and medium sized indigenous sector are still dominated by the impact of the recession in the UK and the low level of domestic demand conditions.  In the agribusiness sector the continuing rationalisation will inevitably mean further job losses during 1991.</P>
    <P>ESRI forecasts the growth in real GNP at 2 per cent in 1991.  The OECD forecasts a higher rate of 2.2 per cent.  Both forecasts are broadly in line with the Government's own estimate of 2.25 per cent real GNP growth.  A growth rate of 2 per cent in 1991 would place Ireland slightly above the EC and OECD average for the year.  However, this growth rate may not be sufficient to generate a significant increase in employment.</P>
    <P>The essential point I must get across is that there never was a magic wand which could be waved to generate economic developments, wealth and employment. These must come from the efforts of all in the economy working together to maximise mutual benefit.  The Government and the Social Partners fully subscribed to this philosophy in the most tangible way possible by agreeing the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>I would like to give the balance of my time to Deputy Michael Martin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate.  While there may be some degree of consensus in this House that unemployment should be the primary issue on the political and economic agenda, I sometimes wonder whether that consensus exists in society at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must instill in people that the creation of jobs should be our number one <Col N="2122" /> priority.  I make that point in the context of the growing phenomenon in Irish society to polarise those who are totally against new projects and those who are for the new projects whether they relate to tourism, agriculture or industry.  If it was indelibly imprinted in people's minds that unemployment was the primary issue then people at local government level, political level and throughout the community would ask themselves how to make a project a reality when it comes before them.  They would ask themselves how they can minimise potential damage to the environment resulting from the project.  That should be the philosophy, and not the one whereby people are instinctively against a project for various reasons some of which are selfish and where many of the objectors have secure jobs themselves.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating jobs for the sake of jobs.  We need a change of attitude, a change of mentality so that when projects come before us that can take people off the dole queues, add to productivity in the community and lead to economic growth we will be asking ourselves how we can come together and come to a harmonious agreement on how to make these projects a reality.</P>
    <P>The whole unemployment problem cannot be satisfactorily addressed on a long term basis unless we are committed to sustained investment in education, training and re-training.  There will not be sustained economic growth or employment creation without continued investment in education at primary, secondary and third levels.  The critical area in unemployment is the number of young people who leave school far too early without proper skills and training.  The great number of people who have difficulty in gaining employment throughout their lives are those who have left the school system too early.</P>

      <P>The last speaker raised a number of interesting points which I might have time to address later in my contribution.  To reduce the problem of unemployment in Ireland by way of better education and a change of attitude to projects is narrowing the focus far too much.  There are occasions when projects are opposed for reasons which perhaps are selfish on the part of those whose amenities may be infringed, but there is always a need for all of us to be vigilant about industrial projects in particular which can have a devastating effect on not just the immediate environment where people live but on the general environment.  We have been far too cavalier in the past in allowing the pollution of our atmosphere and our soil by careless entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>There are thousands of well educated people in Ireland without jobs.  I accept entirely the need to maintain our education system in the best possible shape and to ensure that all our children reach the highest possible educational achievements they are capable of.  I realise the Deputy's time was short but in addressing those two points I think the focus was to narrow.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael proposal has too narrow a focus also.  It is interesting to see the extent to which the Fine Gael prescription is almost a mirror image of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat prescription.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion seeks that Dáil Éireann calls for the establishment of an all party committee on job creation with responsibility among other things &ldquo;to recommend such steps as it considers appropriate to improve the climate for the creation and maintenance of jobs; &ldquo;I thought we had long since left behind this climatology of industrial policy, particularly since in the past three years it has been shown that the so-called climate which has been created has not resulted in a decline in unemployment. It certainly has not stemmed <Col N="2124" /> the increase in unemployment nor has it stemmed the increase in emigration.  The figures the Minister referred to for inflation and profitability, the figures the Minister for Labour can produce about the absence of strikes over the last number of years, the very careful way in which the trade union movement have argued for wage increases and accepted wage increases way below what many would believe were the entitlement, have all brought about what had been argued was the correct climate for job creation. As we have seen, the reality is that unemployment continues to rise dramatically and emigration is still a factor of life despite the fact that speakers on the Government side claim it will be down to around 15,000 this year.  That is 15,000 families who are losing people to Britain and the US mainly.  That is a failure of Government policy and can be put down to nothing else.</P>
    <P>I and my party colleagues have put down an amendment to the Fine Gael motion which deletes reference to climate and seeks to establish a situation where a Dáil committee would carry out an assessment of the second triennial report on industrial performance, propose changes where necessary in industrial policy, including measures to develop indigenous industry, develop a strategic plan with clear objectives and relevant structures, and direct limited resources at key target areas in a disciplined and scientific manner.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Dáil committee proposed by the Fine Gael Party be established. Again I do not think it is the beginning and end of the story.  Dáil committees of themselves produce very little but reports and even those rarely manage to get on the floor of this House for debate.  However, it is important that the House on a joint basis address the question of unemployment in a serious way.  There is no more critical social and economic problem facing this country than unemployment, yet it is hard to think of a problem that has received less attention from this Government.  This is the administration who told us job creation would be the major priority of the <Col N="2125" /> new Government.  They said it was the major priority, not a major priority, not one of a series of major priorities but the major priority; so they declared in their Programme for Government.  This then is the administration who have allowed unemployment to increase by almost 30,000 in the past year alone.  The latest figure of 247,991 represents 19 per cent of the labour force; almost one in every five of those officially registered as available for work is on the dole.  We know these figures are deliberately understated by the exclusion of the 9,000 unemployed people on the pre-retirement allowance scheme and the pre-retirement credits scheme.</P>
    <P>If the live register was compiled in the same way as it was two years ago the official unemployment figure would be more than 257,000.  If the tens of thousands who are on what are often phoney training courses were included in the unemployment figure it would be closer to 300,000.  If the tens of thousands of women who work in the home and would willingly work outside the home if there was an opportunity for them to do so were included the unemployment figure would be closer to half a million rather than the official 247,000.  This is all without quoting or considering the 200,000 people who have emigrated during the past decade.</P>
    <P>When we discuss this question of unemployment figures we find that the way in which the figures are doctored are interesting.  In a recent newspaper report David Nally, who claimed the Government were covering up the increase in the unemployment figures, pointed out that in a survey of unemployment exchanges he found the reasons being given by Government for the rise in unemployment were spurious.  The Government listed various things such as the Gulf crisis, part-time working in Waterford Glass, school staff signing on for Easter holidays, the ESB strike and special temporary layoffs.  None of the explanations attributed any part of the rise to an underlying slowing down in the economy.  This reporter pointed out that an economist with NCB Stockbrokers, <Col N="2126" /> Dermot O'Brien, said that there is solid evidence of such slow-down.  The reporter also pointed out that the manager of a labour exchange in Leinster pointed out to him that the new unemployed in that exchange are made up as follows: those who have finished a social employment scheme, approximately 30 per cent; returned emigrants, approximately 10 per cent; and redundancies, mainly in the computer business, combined with random factors, around 60 per cent.  None of the factors which the Government have adduced as being those which account for the rise in unemployment is borne out by the managers of the labour exchanges who deal with the people who come to them seeking their unemployment assistance.  The record on unemployment has been the greatest possible indictment of all those Governments which held power over the past decade.  Unemployment has not been below 100,000 since 1980 and has never been less than 200,000 since 1984. The long term unemployed, many of whom have been without work for four or five years and the hundreds of thousands who have been forced to emigrate during the past decade because of unemployment will be forgiven if they are less than fully convinced by the conversion of Deputy Bruton and Fine Gael to the cause of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>During the term of office of the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition, in which Deputy Bruton was a very influential figure, unemployment leaped by almost 50,000. There was no one more dismissive of the unemployed or of anyone who criticised the Government's neglect of them than Deputy Bruton.  It is interesting to note the comments of the Irish National Organisation on the Unemployed who produced a bulletin in May 1991.  They conducted a study of the six point plan which the Fine Gael Party put forward to deal with unemployment and who built the six point plan as six solid proposals. The comment of the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, an organisation supported by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, was: &ldquo;unemployment top priority, say, Fine Gael; <Col N="2127" /> the six solid proposals turn out to be quite shaky.&rdquo;  They proceeded to take each point, one by one, and effectively undermine them and point out that they would mean nothing in the long run in dealing with the question of unemployment.  I do not propose to go into the document in detail, but the record is there.  I received the document in the post and I am sure every Member of the Fine Gael Party also received it.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that there is a very serious credibilty gap with regard to the Fine Gael Party and their attitude to the unemployed.  The level of unemployment over the first four months averaged at almost 245,000; this is about 17,000 per month more than had been allowed for in the January budget.  If the figures continue at this level the budgetary arithmetic will just collapse.  The cost to the State of this level of unemployment is phenomenal &mdash; £553 million for unemployment assistance, a further £26 million for those on the pre-retirement scheme and £100 million for pay related unemployment benefit.  But this is only part of the cost.  The average amount of tax paid by the PAYE workers last year was just over £3,100.  On the basis of this figure, if the 245,000 unemployed were put to work, it would bring in an additional £735 million.  This means that the direct cost to the Exchequer, in terms of social welfare payments and income tax foregone, is around £1,400 million per year.</P>
    <P>To this must be added the indirect costs &mdash; the loss of indirect tax revenue through reduced purchasing power, the loss of local authority rents through the differential rents system, the cost to the State through extra health charges arising from the effects of unemployment etc. The total cost of unemployment to State is almost certainly more than £2,000 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The financial element is only part of the cost.  Of even more significance is the human and social cost, the broken families, the lives destroyed and talents wasted by the scourge of unemployment. The abandonment by successive Governments of the unemployed is reaping a <Col N="2128" /> bitter harvest of poverty, crime, vandalism and social alienation.  This is especially so in urban areas where unemployment is demoralising and destroying entire communities.</P>
    <P>Despite the extent of the problem, there is little evidence of any new thinking in the Fine Gael motion or, indeed, in the Government motion before us which seeks to put the long term unemployed back to work as the apparent solution to the problem.  In the Fine Gael motion we are back to the &ldquo;climatology&rdquo; school of economics.  They talk again about improving the climate for job creation. The economic climate has been as near as it could be to perfect over the past few years with relatively low inflation, plenty of highly skilled workers and generous grants and tax reliefs, yet we got little or nothing in return in terms of job creation. There is more chance of a rain dance producing rain than &ldquo;the right climate&rdquo; producing private sector jobs in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The report on urban poverty in Ireland, presented to a Combat Poverty Conference on Monday last, showed that a rising tide does not raise all boats.  One of the authors of the report, Professor David Donnison of Glasgow University, said that part of the problem was that Ireland's economic growth was due to the activities of the multinationals, which were not labour intensive, had few local links and tended to send profits abroad. &ldquo;Little of what they do filters through to the rest of the economy,&rdquo; he said.  Unless we begin to address this problem, all the all party committees in the world will make no difference to the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Before we can make progress, we must accept that existing policies have failed and that changes are necessary.  We must accept that an industrial policy capable of realising full employment must be based on a core of exporting industries whose revenues will be spent within the Irish economy, thereby supporting a comprehensive range of sub-supply industries and support services, in addition to general consumer-oriented industries and services.</P>
    <P>In a document which The Workers' <Col N="2129" /> Party produced in the past six months or so, entitled &ldquo;A Framework for Industrial Development&rdquo; we made that point specifically.  The document went on to cover a whole range of other areas which I hope to have time to deal with at least briefly.  I would not hope to cover the whole document because it runs to 50 pages in all.  However, there are a number of key points which should be read into the record.  It was pointed out by Professor Donnison at the Combat Poverty Conference that foreign firms have very limited material or service linkages with the Irish economy, locate very few high level technological or management functions here and export most of their profits from Ireland.  The potential for improving this situation is very limited.</P>
    <P>Native firms for the most part lack the organisational scale and technological base to successfully penetrate export markets on a sustained basis.  Government policies which emphasise cost reductions fail to address these fundamental deficiencies.  A much more interventionist policy is required which would focus on industrial sectors with export growth potential and concentrate on developing strong Irish based firms in these sectors along with essential support firms producing material and service inputs.</P>
    <P>A concentrated and co-ordinated national effort is required to create the necessary industrial structures and accordingly one of our proposals is to establish a national industrial development council comprising representatives of the Oireachtas and the social interests &mdash; the employers, the trade unions and the farmers &mdash; in order to identify key sectoral objectives and obtain cross-community support for the achievement of those objectives.  These objectives would constitute a national industrial development plan, a rolling plan incorporating both long and medium-term objectives, updated on a continuing basis.  This is an extension of the Fine Gael idea, which is primarily a committee of the House. Following the deliberations of such a <Col N="2130" /> committee we would like to see the establishment of the forum I have mentioned which would incorporate Members of the Oireachtas but would also incorporate other interests concerned with the elimination of unemployment in Ireland. There is a whole range of other proposals in the document which I do not propose to deal with in detail now.  However, there is another aspect I wish to refer to before I conclude, that is no matter how well intentioned the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is or the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was, a strategy solely based on consideration of national concern is too narrow a focus. We are members of the European Community. Geographically at least, we are on the periphery of that Community and we have a small population.  We have received considerable amounts of Structural Funds which have gone to develop infrastructure in one way or another, some would argue effectively and others would argue that it has not been effective. Against that, we have a European industrial policy which is non-interventionist, which by and large takes the same approach as the Irish Government and to a large extent the Fine Gael Party agree with.  They believe that the market on its own must be allowed to generate jobs or not, depending on the opportunities available for investment.</P>
    <P>The theory is that if we provide the infrastructure in Ireland through the Structural Funds, the market will provide the jobs because the climate or the infrastructure has been provided which attracts the investment.  Studies at European level have shown that that is not happening.  It is certainly not happening here.  Studies have shown in relation to regional and CAP funding that the gap between the rich and poor in Europe has not been narrowed.  They have also shown that after 1992 the position will get worse.</P>
    <P>What I seek to impress on the Government tonight is that there is an urgent need for the Irish Government to argue strongly in Europe for a radical change in European industrial policy to ensure <Col N="2131" /> that there is active intervention to encourage investment in places like Ireland.  Ireland is not the only place in Europe which needs it.  Otherwise all of the Structural Funds one likes can be pumped into Ireland and it will not create jobs because the nature of the market is that investment will be attracted to the centre, to where the most lucrative returns are available.  Clearly capital in Europe and outside Europe indicates that the centre is not in Ireland at present.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for us to address that issue in the context of 1992 and in the context of economic and monetary union.  It is pointless crying afterwards that we did not realise that this would be the effect of what we are doing. The evidence is there that economically peripheral areas like Ireland, unless there is an active interventionist policy will not benefit from the open market which we are being told will solve all the problems. It is significant that the Cecchini report which examined this question of the benefits of the Single Market did not look at Ireland.  That was a significant omission. To my knowledge specific study has not been made in relation to how the Single Market will affect Ireland.  That is an area where there is need for urgent attention.</P>
    <P>I do not accept this theory of a climate being the solution to unemployment in Ireland.  I welcome the idea of an all-party Dáil committee to look at the problem of job creation but there is need for a wider body, which would include Members of the Oireachtas and various people involved in industry, to look specifically at the various issues to which I have referred.  There is an urgent need to address the European dimension to the problems that face this country with regard to unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion, as originally moved by Fine Gael, proposes as a response to the serious unemployment problem the establishment of an all-party committee on job creation.  That proposition, weak as it is, has been supported by other parties.  I have no doubt that the <Col N="2132" /> idea of reviewing or auditing the operations of various employment creation schemes, incentives and policy is a good one.  Such a review procedure is in effect built into the operation of industrial policy here.  If such a review procedure is not part of our ongoing industrial policy, then the IDA, SFADCo, CTT, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Finance are not doing their jobs.  That has not been suggested, so I suggest that that is not the case.  The reality is that while an ongoing audit of policy effectiveness is undoubtedly a good idea, nothing that has been said by the proposers of the motion, or by the supporters of the motion, comes anywhere close to providing a persuasive argument that a Dáil committee is even remotely appropriate to the task of addressing the unemployment problem or addressing the task of the audit of those policies that is needed.</P>
      <P>At present and for the last ten to 15 years we have had a variety of Oireachtas committees.  Some of those committees are charged with review tasks.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies review the operations of the commercial State-sponsored bodies in the context of their published reports.  In recent times, particularly in the last two years, we have pushed the parameters in which that committee operate out considerably.  In spite of the fact that we have had legal opinions that we may be exceeding our remit we have looked into areas where committee members believed we should look.  The Committee of Public Accounts is another Committee who review public expenditure. They are a hard working committee with an active chairman and active members.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities review a mountain of draft regulations, directives and so on that flow from Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of Oireachtas committees put in long hours and dedicate a great amount of energy to their task yet it cannot be said with any degree of truth that committees achieve any major impact in this House.  Indeed, the House <Col N="2133" /> shows something approaching disdain for the committees, judging by the impact the reports of the committees have had on our deliberations, not just in the last four or five years, but over the last ten or 15 years.  The time we failed to devote to consideration of the reports of the committees that sat over the last ten to 15 years approaches a scandal and these committees have grossly inadequate resources to get on with their task.  To suggest against this background that something meaningful or positive can be achieved by an ongoing review or audit of the myriad policies for job creation and industrial development is to expect rather too much.</P>
    <P>The promoters of the original motion are as aware as I that the task which their motion proposes to fulfil is widely inappropriate for any committee of this House.  They are as aware as I of the poor record of this House in handling committees and they are equally aware that all the talk in the world in the committee rooms of this House will not produce a single job.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the motion in the name of the Minister for Labour is positive. It focuses on the positive part played by the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The PESP and its predecessor, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in spite of the criticisms levelled by the Opposition parties, particularly, in the case of the PESP, by Fine Gael, are examples of meaningful initiatives to combat the scourge of unemployment. These initiatives also go a long way towards involving everyone in the employment area &mdash; workers, unions, farmers, industrialists, various social interests and the Government &mdash; in the process of employment creation and review.  In spite of all that Deputy De Rossa has said, and I do not doubt his sincerity for a moment, the only basis on which to create long-term, viable jobs is to create an economy in which investment can flourish.  It has become somewhat fashionable in recent times to refer to that as climatology.</P>
    <P>The alternative approach, the naked State interventionist approach &mdash; an <Col N="2134" /> approach to which Deputy De Rossa was very close at one time but one from which he has drawn apart in more recent years &mdash; has failed manifestly.  It has failed more obviously than has the approach that is generally speaking, supported by the major parties in the House.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have for many years been attempting to create an economy in which investment can flourish and jobs can be created.  More specifically, we have been attempting to do that since returning to office in 1987.  Throughout the past four years economic growth in Ireland has exceeded the EC average.  While the external indicators are not good this year, with a major war in the Gulf, with wide scale economic slumps in trading partner countries and with a general lack of confidence, all the signs indicate that Ireland will reach its economic target growth while keeping the public finances broadly in check.</P>
    <P>I was mystified by Deputy De Rossa's suggestion that the recent events in the Gulf could be simply ignored.  He suggested that those events were not contributory factors to the difficulties in bringing jobs on stream.  I admit that one of the great frustrations in Ireland's economic policies, not just this year but in the past four years, has been that while we have achieved quite remarkable results in a number of economic indicators &mdash; Deputy De Rossa acknowledged that, and I welcome his acknowledgement &mdash; that has not transferred into jobs. However, to suggest, as Deputy De Rossa has done and this is the basis of his analysis that events such as the Gulf War are minor issues and have nothing to do with the creation of jobs shows a certain paucity of focus in the development of ideas for creating jobs.</P>
    <P>Reports published in the past 24 hours by the OECD and the ESRI confound some of the Jeremiahs of the Dublin financial circles who have of late been vying with each other to prove that economics is, indeed, a gloomy science and that Ireland Incorporated is heading once again for the rocks, if it is not already there.</P>
    <P>The improvements have already been <Col N="2135" /> put before the House but, at the risk of raising a few hackles, I will mention one or two of them again.  The GNP ratio has been reduced significantly in the past four years, from 131 per cent in 1987 to 110 per cent or less, and we are approaching a ratio of 1:1.  Interest rates, a related factor, are also much more healthy now than they were four years ago.  When my party came back to power in 1987 interest rates were very substantially higher than those in the United Kingdom &mdash; no doubt I shall be corrected if I am wrong, but I think they were 4 per cent higher than the United Kingdom rates.  In the past two years interest rates here have been substantially lower than in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Labour pointed out last night, the differential between German and Irish interest rates has been cut even more spectacularly by 8 per cent. In spite of the improvements, I would be the first to say that there is still room for improvement in interest rates.  I believe such improvement to be critical if Ireland is to have the confidence that will produce the investment that will lead to jobs.  I for one firmly believe that real interest rate levels in this country, interest rates relative to the inflation rate, are still much too high and that our financial institutions, and in particular our Central Bank, could afford to lower them.</P>

      <P>If you would allow me to conclude, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I was about to analyse some problems with specific policies but that will have to wait for another day.  It is regrettable that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not here, because one of the points I wanted to make is that a more active role should be played by the Minister, by the IDA and by the new Environmental Protection Agency, when it comes on stream in the promotion and creation of an environment in which the people can trust <Col N="2136" /> industrial policies and proposals. However, in deference to your ruling, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I shall conclude, although I believe I had rather less time than I should have had.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with some sadness to the speeches delivered on the motion by the Minister for Labour yesterday evening and by the Minister for Science and Technology this evening.  I did not listen with any great surprise or sadness to the contribution made by Deputy Roche, but I noticed that it was a little more mellow than is usually the case.  I suspect that, despite the external facade of comfort with the current level of unemployment and the current jobs crisis, Deputy Roche in a more secret and less public moment might admit that he himself has some reservations about Government policy in this area.</P>
      <P>The Government appear incapable of considering new initiatives to tackle our growing unemployment crisis and is incapable of recognising that the strategy adopted by them to date has failed. Unemployment currently stands at 256,000 if one includes within the figures those artificially removed from the job list statistics who are currently on pre-retirement benefits.  If one added to that number those who have emigrated during the lifetime of the Government the figure would be more than 350,000.  At the commencement of this year, the Government's own budgetary projections anticipated the unemployment figure to be 228,000 maximum.  Four months later there are 28,000 more people jobless than the Government expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The touchstone to determine the success of the Government's economic policy is based not on simply mathematical calculations of growth, balance of payments surpluses or on maintaining low inflation, but on whether the policies being implemented are creating the jobs <Col N="2137" /> that will allow our people go back to work.  Sadly, they are not.</P>
    <P>The Government's entire policy approach to job creation is contained in the strategy outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as it itself acknowledges in its own motion. The sad fact is that, despite all of the ballyhoo and hype, the programme has lost its fizz.  In job creation it has fallen flat.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is a little like a sponge-cake with icing on top.  Its main content is a wage agreement.  Its references to unemployment and job creation are like the coloured hundreds and thousands that are sprinkled over the icing to encourage children to interest themselves in the cake &mdash; decorative but of no consequence; all glitter but no substance.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> strategy is based on an assumption &mdash; and the two Ministers who have spoken in the debate have reiterated the assumption &mdash; that if wage certainty and industrial harmony are achieved, employment will increase automatically. There is no doubt that economic stability is essential to industrial success, but economic stability of itself &mdash; and in this context I agree with Deputy De Rossa &mdash; will not create jobs or provide the level of job growth that is so badly required. While I agree with Deputy de Rossa in that particular comment, I do not agree with his analysis of the resolution of the problems.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> recites like a mantra &ldquo;that the creation of employment and the consequent reduction of unemployment and involuntary emigration is a primary policy objective of Government&rdquo;.  Yet when it comes to addressing that objective the plan tragically and sadly lacks innovation and imagination.  When it comes to addressing our job needs the Government, in the plan, effectively throw in the towel.</P>
    <P>We are told that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will create 20,000 new jobs a year.  Even if this target is met, which is extremely doubtful on <Col N="2138" /> current Government policies, it ensures a net increase in jobless throughout the lifetime of the plan &mdash; not a decrease.  A decrease can only be achieved by continuing large scale emigration.  During each of the three years the plan covers, the demographic trends establish that there will be more young people coming on the jobs market than the new jobs it is hoped to create.  Indeed, recently a Government spokesperson acknowledged that instead of 20,000 new net jobs being created this year there will be fewer than 8,000.</P>
    <P>The latest figures published by NESC establish that in each of the years ending June 1991 and 1992 there will be over 25,000 young people leaving education and looking for jobs; for the year ending June 1993 the number will be over 24,000.</P>
    <P>As I already said, unemployment currently stands at 256,000.  At the plan's most optimistic forecast of job creation the numbers unemployed in two years' time will stand at 300,000.  The plan does not address, or even consider in its assumptions job losses that will occur through company failures, rationalisation programmes such as the controversial ones currently proposed by Telecom Éireann and An Post through company mechanisation and rationalisation; nor does it take into account increases in the labour force which will result from Irish emigrants returning home due to the slow-down in neighbouring economies.</P>
    <P>Emigration during the Government's lifetime &mdash; and indeed during the previous Fianna Fáil minority Government's lifetime &mdash; drew a curtain across their failure to tackle the jobs crisis and covered up our true level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>For example, there was a net migration out of Ireland of 31,000 people in 1989, 46,000 in 1988 and 32,000 in 1987.  The Government spokesperson who rather sourly explained away the upward surge in our unemployment figures recently as being due to the unexpected return during the first quarter of this year of some of our emigrants, was happy to proclaim success for the Government on <Col N="2139" /> the jobs front when the forced departure of thousands of our young people seeking jobs abroad reduced the numbers signing on the dole at home.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael welcomed the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in so far as it provided for industrial harmony. We criticised it, however &mdash; and were the only party to vote against it in the Dáil &mdash; because, despite all the high flowing phrases, it failed abysmally to tackle our jobs crisis.  It merely paid lip service to the unemployed.  It failed to address employment blockages that derive from legislation and Government policy or from stances taken by some of the social partners.  We looked at its most optimistic promises and noted it fell far short of what had to be achieved.  We recognised that the jobs needed would not be created. We recognised the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to be a programme for continued unemployment and involuntary emigration and, sadly, we were right.  Sadly, no other political party saw the writing on the wall and realised the implications of the plan.</P>
    <P>Since the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> came into being, the numbers of jobless have relentlessly risen month after month.  Each month we have been offered a new explanation.  The Government have blamed continuing rises in unemployment on the bad weather, returned emigrants, the Gulf crisis, the ESB strike, part-time working in Waterford Glass, even school staff signing on over the Easter break.  Each time the monthly figures are announced such glib and superficial explanations for them are repeated on RTE news bulletins as if they were true and profound insights. They are then followed by cries of anguish from the parties of the Left, the Labour Party and The Workers' Party, condemning the Government and calling on them to do this, that and the other. Neither of these parties remembers that the rise in the jobless is a consequence of a plan they supported in this House.  The monthly rise in the jobless is not only the natural consequence of the Government's economic strategy, it is part of the <Col N="2140" /> strategy of the Labour Party or Deputy Dick Spring's Tralee strategy and The Workers' Party or Proinsias De Rossa's Brussels follies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This evening we had to listen to Deputy De Rossa talking about unemployment and prescribing for this economy the type of centralised economic planning which is now so discredited in Eastern Europe.  He bemoaned the fact that the Fine Gael Party had not adopted the type of policies which Deputy De Rossa, unsuccessfully, attempted to jettison at his recent Árd Fheis.</P>
      <P>The Government entered into the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> hoping that continued emigration would continue to conceal the absence of a coherent approach to job creation.  The safety valve of emigration had saved them for four years but the consequences of the British recession and the reduction of job opportunities abroad have now come home to roost.</P>
      <P>To create jobs we need to tackle the major structural problems in our economy and to take a series of new initiatives as a matter of urgency.  It is not enough to merely recite an intention to take initiatives; what is required is a recognition of the fact that we have a national jobs crisis and that urgent action, not parliamentary rhetoric, must be taken to resolve it.  There is at present an eerie complacency and lethargy in the Government's approach.  If the action required necessitates changes in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> then it is incumbent on the Government, with the social partners, to undertake a review and a revision of that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If further budgetary initiatives are required, then let the Government take the necessary action before this House goes into recess for the summer months. Among the initiatives required are the following: major tax reform to reduce average and marginal tax rates on earned income; tax and social security systems <Col N="2141" /> should be integrated to remove poverty traps and employment disincentives; there is a need for a graduated single means test for all allowances that are currently means tested; there should be a shift in the allocation of resources from the attraction of mobile foreign investment and towards the development of the indigenous sector; and selectivity should be the primary characteristic of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>NESC propose that resources should be allocated to addressing the specific competitive disadvantages which indigenous companies confront in competing internationally and I agree with that.  Where foreign investment is sought it should be targeted on companies with high skill requirements and investment should relate to job creation instead of capital spending.  New major initiatives must be taken for the long term unemployed and to tackle youth unemployment.</P>
    <P>At the end of December 1990, 61,588 people under 25 years of age were jobless, over 26 per cent of the total unemployed; 30 per cent of those leaving school without qualifications during the 1988-89 academic year were still seeking their first job one year later.</P>
    <P>In tackling youth unemployment, education is the key.  There is a need to radically alter our education system to encourage or require all young people to remain at school until they complete the full school cycle to leaving certificate level.  For those who are not academically minded, there is a need to provide within our post-primary education system an increased vocational element so that no one leaves school without minimal education standards which equip them for obtaining employment within a reasonable time.  Far too many people leave school at 15 or 16 and are destined to become a statistic within the numbers of the long term unemployed or an emigrant lacking the basic skills to obtain even reasonable employment when they go abroad.  A radical rethink of our education policy is urgently required.  It should become an assumption of Irish society that all young people remain in <Col N="2142" /> education until their 18th year and the necessary fiscal adjustments should be made to provide for this.</P>
    <P>Forty-five per cent of the total registered unemployed are long term unemployed. At the start of this year over 100,000 fell into this category.  As a matter of urgency, special employment measures must be devised for the long term unemployed and NESC's most recent report advocates such a strategy. Such a programme should consist of labour subsidies, direct employment schemes and enterprise schemes.  There is no sign that the Government are prepared to implement this recommendation. Moreover, blockages in existing schemes must be removed.</P>
    <P>There are currently approximately 11,000 employed through FÁS under the social employment scheme, largely through local authorities.  It is a national scandal that the social employment scheme has never been allowed by the local authority unions to function properly in Dublin.  Dublin Corporation have never been allowed to employ a single person under the scheme and currently Dublin County Council are only allowed 140 employees under the scheme.</P>
    <P>At the end of April 1991 there were 78,700 Dubliners registered as unemployed compared to 71,657 in April 1990. In a 12 month period unemployment in Dublin has increased by 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Over one-third of the total numbers of those unemployed in the State are based in Dublin.  It would have been expected that between 3,500 to 4,000 Dubliners would currently be employed through the social employment scheme.  Instead, only 140 are so employed because the Dublin local authorities and the local authority unions cannot reach agreement for the expanded use of the social employment scheme in Dublin.  It is extraordinary that this problem, which has been ongoing for some years, was not addressed in the PESP.  It is just one more example of the tragic inadequacy of the Government's approach and its failure to address the jobs crisis.</P>

      <P>In parts of Dublin there are housing estates where there is 70 per cent adult unemployment.  The future of these people and their families is being sacrificed by an uncaring Government oblivious of their difficulties.  The Government, though the Central Review <Col N="2144" /> Committee, should call an urgent meeting of the committee to take immediate action and to agree arrangements to remove the blockage on the use of the social employment scheme in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The motion tabled by Fine Gael which is before the House this evening notes that the unemployment rate now stands at 19.7 per cent of the workforce, which is by far the highest in the European Community and more than double the EC average.  The Government's record shows that they cannot be trusted or relied upon to take the radical action necessary.  The establishment of an all-party committee on job creation would provide the necessary political focus and dynamic which is unfortunately lacking in Government.  I ask the House to support the motion and to reject the complacent and back-slapping amendment tabled to it by the Government.</P>

In deference to the good working conditions of the Minister's staff and the rest of us, the solution in part to this problem, if I may venture to be so bold as to suggest this, is a price tag of approximately £250,000.  I think this would be a Rolls Royce job for what would reasonably be accepted as a Ford Escort one.  This matter is in the Minister's hands.  With the array of financial experts behind him perhaps the Minister can establish what savings can be made, the job creation component attached to it, the precise paragraph within the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> under which it can be located and report to us tomorrow morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to clarify a point about the new power he is taking to make an order regarding rates of duty.  I take the point that the amendment incorporates a section to say that no order shall be made for the purpose of increasing any of the rates of duty. However, it would be open to the Minister to retain the rates of duty but to vary the bands.  In other words, if a certain rate applied in a sale of up to, say, £30,000, could the Minister reduce that and provide that the rate would only apply up to £20,000?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  I wonder if that is really intended.  If it is I would have serious reservations about it because that, in effect, is the imposition of a tax.  It preserves the rate but it would increase the stamp duty payable in a particular case if the Minister, by order, brought back the band that was chargeable in that case.  That is the imposition of revenue and that has traditionally been the preserve of Dáil Éireann on a Finance Bill.  It is a very serious and a major step that is being introduced here to enable the Minister for Finance alone, by order, to increase the duty that would be payable in a particular case other than has already been determined previously by Dáil Éireann.</P>

Maybe that is what is intended.  I think, with respect, that that is what is intended.  It was not intended to introduce a provision there that would enable the Minister, by order, to increase actual revenue, but the real effect of it is that that could be.

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 136.</P>
      <P>In page 84, lines 12 and 13, to delete &ldquo;, or any statement to which subsection (2) relates,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments is to focus the provisions relating to negligence and fraud more closely on those actually likely to be responsible.  Section 89 effectively imposes a duty upon parties <Col N="2155" /> to a deed and upon the person who prepares the deed.  They are obliged to act in a bona fide manner and with reasonable care in ensuring that all relevant facts are given to the Revenue Commissioners. Failure to do so could result in prosecution for fraud or negligence.</P>
    <P>The person who prepares a deed is almost invariably a solicitor.  Subsections (4) and (5) of section 89 deem or presume certain conduct to be negligent.  Discussions on the provisions of the Bill have taken place between officials of my Department and of the Revenue Commissioners and representatives of the Incorporated Law Society.  Following on these discussions I am satisfied that deeming or presuming certain conduct to be negligent in the case of solicitors could expose conscientious practitioners to unnecessary expense.  A strict interpretation of the original proposal could oblige them to independently double-check information, such as property valuations, given to them by clients.  It could also lead to unacceptable delays and expense in concluding agreements. Accordingly, these amendments operate to remove solicitors from the provisions of subsections (4) and (5).  Solicitors and anyone else who prepares a deed, however, will continue to be liable to prosecution for fraud or negligence under the more general provisions of subsection (3).  Such people have a duty to ensure that instruments, upon which duty is chargeable are fully and truthfully drawn up.  Subsections (4) and (5) as amended would then apply only to parties to agreements who are clearly in the best position to know all relevant facts.</P>
    <P>It would of course never be the intention to prosecute any person under the provisions as drafted where that person acted in good faith and with due care.  No court would uphold such a prosecution. However, technically such a prosecution might have been brought given the provisions in the Bill as drafted.  Consequently, I propose to add a further subsection, subsection (6), which provides a mechanism where people who are unsure as to certain relevant facts can <Col N="2156" /> express to the Revenue Commissioners their uncertainty and thus avoid negligence or fraud prosecutions.  This provision parallels a similar provision relating to income tax in section 14 (4) of the Finance Act, 1988.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to two subsections of the section but I do not think they are affected greatly by the Minister's amendment.  I draw the Minister's attention to subsection (3) (b) which refers to any person who &ldquo;being employed or concerned in or about the preparation of any instrument, fraudulently or negligently prepares any such instrument,&rdquo; and to subsection (4) which concludes as follows: &ldquo;...as having been negligently done by him.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Concern was expressed not by representatives of the legal profession who were included in the process of consultation, but by the Chartered Institute of Surveyors who would be involved in the preparation of valuation documents, valuations for property and the question of negligence.  The Minister will readily understand it is extremely difficult to get an accurate assessment of value in certain circumstances where there is not a clear market for a particular property.  I am familiar with this from the architectural point of view.  Claims for negligence and fraudulently carrying out instructions on behalf of a client and so on impact upon the cost of professional indemnity insurance and so forth.  Has the Minister's attention been brought to that?  Were representations made to the Department directly about this?  What is the Minister's view on it?</P>

      <P>No.  This is essentially a technical provision affecting the administration of stamp duty.  It gives the Revenue Commissioners powers to raise assessments of duty.  Under the existing law of 1891 the commissioners could only raise assessments when requested to do so by a taxpayer.  This is inconsistent with the concept of a mandatory tax.  The commissioners should have powers to raise assessments, additional assessments or correcting assessments of stamp duties as they can for all other taxes.

This is a major reform of stamp duty procedures.  Perhaps the Minister would consider between now <Col N="2160" /> and Report Stage including a procedure in the text to the effect that over the counter the Revenue would stamp and that any disagreement there might be between the value put on it by the applicant and the value put on it by the Revenue would be a matter to be sorted out subsequently, but that the legal proceeding, which might depend on stamping, could proceed.  A statement of practice would probably do just as well if that is the suggestion that is forthcoming and that would be acceptable.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a technical amendment restating in a different form section 91 of the Bill. That section re-enacted subsection (4) of section 14 of the Stamp Act, 1891, in an expanded form.  The expansion allowed for the use of unstamped instruments in civil proceedings taken by the Revenue Commissioners to recover stamp duty. <Col N="2161" /> However, section 91 of the Bill proposed to re-enact the provision in the 1891 Act which provided for the use of unstamped instruments in criminal proceedings. There was a concern that this was not a matter suitable for a money Bill.  This amendment removes any such concern.</P>

      <P>In general, it is proposed that the provisions of this Bill relating to the collection and enforcement of stamp duty will come into effect from 1 November 1991.  This amendment assumes that, in respect of instruments executed before that date, the new interest provisions will apply to them only with effect from 1 November.  In other words, if an instrument which was executed before 1 November 1991 was presented for stamping in January 1992, interest would be charged at the current rates up to 1 November and at the new rates thereafter. This is the usual practice in other taxes when interest for late payment is varied.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, it seems to me from reading section 92 that the main charging section is subsection (1) of section 15 in the Principal Act.  That appears to be the main charging section.  The effect of amendment No. 143 is to delete section 92 (6). Amendment No. 143 is very differently worded from the proposed new subsection (6).  First, it mentions a new date but, more particularly, the existing subsection (6) states:</P>
      <P>Any instrument executed prior to the passing of the Finance Act 1991, shall, for the purposes of subsection (2),....</P>
      <P>As that section stands it does not apply to subsection (1).  Can the Minister confirm that one of the purposes of his amendment is to ensure that all penalties, interest and so forth, payable in connection with this section are now covered and not merely stamp duty or penalties under subsection (2)?

    <P>The effective date of the provisions of this section 1 November 1991, in order to avoid any retrospective effects.

The Revenue Commissioners must be allowed to use every reasonable means to counter such a practice.  In the <Col N="2164" /> absence of this amendment a taxpayer could claim that the date of execution of an instrument was prior to 1 November 1991.  This claim itself would prevent the Revenue Commissioners from engaging in the kind of detailed investigation which would establish if that date was correct, and which is provided for by section 93 of the Bill.

      <P>I move amendment No. 157:</P>
      <P>In page 90, before section 104 but in Part VI, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;104.&mdash;Section 58 (2) (a) of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976 is hereby amended by the insertion of the following after subsection (2) (a) (ii):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(iii)  a person or a child of a person with whom the disponer is living as man and wife.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to an attempt to include in the area of capital acquisitions tax and gifts the anomalous situation where a couple living as husband and wife, for instance persons who may have obtained a church annulment and had been remarried in the Catholic church, the majority church here, and who would be regarded as husband and wife, would on the untimely death of one or other of the partners find that the maximum amount of money to which the partner was entitled by way of a gift would be £10,700 &mdash;&ldquo;a gift to a stranger in blood,&rdquo; is the rather clinical, weird phrase used. This was first brought to my attention by a constituent and I put down a question on it to the Minister for Finance.  I also raised this in private discussions with the Revenue Commissioners.  I found them to be extremely courteous and very helpful. My constituent gave me a schedule which showed that if the house value was £80,000 and it was jointly owned, £40,000 came as a gift to the surviving partner. He or she would only be tax exempt on £10,700 and there would be a tax liability on the remaining £30,000 so that the person would have to dispose of the house in order to pay the tax benefit.  Is my understanding correct?</P>

We all acknowledge that, whether we like it or not, there is marriage breakdown and many second relationships.  While what may not have been a problem in 1976 when the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act was passed, it is clearly a major problem in 1991.  I would not care to comment on whether Deputy Quinn's amendment is legally watertight, and he assures me it is, but I am sure the Minister could come up with an appropriate wording on Report Stage.  I accept what Deputy Quinn is trying to do.  There have been common law marriages for hundreds of years; there is nothing new about it.  I commend this to the Minister.</P>

      <P>We discussed this last night to some degree.  The amendment as drafted would not cover a case where death occurred as outlined by Deputy Quinn.  This is an area which needs to be worked on.  It is not the practice for tax law to lead the way.  General law should lead the way.  I accept that there is marriage breakdown.  This must be recognised and work must start some time to regulate this area and a Government White Paper will be published towards the latter end of the year.  In the meantime I will ask the Revenue Commissioners to address this problem to see if they can find a solution, taking on board the Murphy judgment and the problems that can arise in property law.  One can conceive certain situations where people could operate on double sets of thresholds that might put them in a more advantageous position than married couples. Areas like that need a lot of teasing out.  It is not an issue for which there is an instant solution.  What I will say to Deputy Quinn and the House is that the Government will start to work on the <Col N="2167" /> matter and it is hoped that much ground will be covered by the time the White Paper on marital breakdown is issued.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I wish to clarify that the same argument put forward last night also applies here, that it is the constitutional obligation of the Government and, consequently, the Revenue Commissioners and the State to support the institution of marriage.  I presume that the Minister has received legal opinion on the matter from the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not now become barrackroom lawyers in relation to the issue, but I wonder whether one could argue that the introduction of the unmarried mother's allowance, introduced by Frank Cluskey and Brendan Corish in the 1970s, could not be construed as taxpayers' money being given to people who had broken one of the vows of marriage and whether it was legally possible for taxpayers' money to be given by way of a social welfare payment on a regular basis to such people.  Surely the constitutional impediment that the Minister was advised to cite in relation to this matter must equally have existed in the 1970s when that measure was introduced. That is the first point to which I should ask the Minister to have regard.  Are the two measures consistent?</P>
      <P>Secondly, I accept that proper practice would be that tax revenue reflect the laws of the land rather than lead.  That is a backward way of doing things.  That is not the primary role or the secondary role, of the Revenue Commissioners in their practice nor of the Department of Finance in the administration of the annual tax legislation, but let me inform the Minister of what the actual practice is.  This is an Irish solution to an Irish problem per excellence &mdash; it is self-certification, it is nod and wink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners, I am informed &mdash; not by them directly, because they would not so say, but by a <Col N="2168" /> number of eminent solicitors who deal with these cases &mdash; have a widow or an unmarried widow, sign an affidavit, albeit falsely, to state that she is the wife of the husband.  No tax liability attaches to that portion because they are &ldquo;not strangers in blood&rdquo;.  With very few exceptions, the Revenue Commissioners get in a set of documents in relation to an estate and will not go behind them.  That has happened and is happening, but it will not happen for some people as against others because of the knowledge of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Worse than that, it leaves open the possibility of the occurrence of incidents such as one that was cited to me in which spite from a first relationship brought to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners the fact that a second relationship was not one of marriage at all.  In that instance a very devout person had acceded to a set of laws that she considered to be superior to the secular laws of this temporary republic as distinct from the eternal Jerusalem.  Much trauma was caused in that instance. Where that leaves the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for Finance I do not really know, but I am saying that with the advance of time and the increasing number of secondary marriages or relationships, the problem will not go away but will get worse.  In addition to the actual practice, the legal advice to people in those circumstances is to take out an insurance bond.  For a sum &mdash; in my case a sum of £11 a month &mdash; one insures against that probability. However, it is an additional cost.  I am a relatively well-paid person and can therefore carry that extra burden, but it is an unnecessary burden and it comes about as a result of the position I have described.  I thought the provision was rather tightly worded and rather well worded. However, I accept the observations of the professionals that it was worded by a poacher as distinct from a gamekeeper, and sometimes the poachers know where some of the best fish hide.  The provision comes up again tomorrow on Report Stage as an amendment but realistically, having regard to the hour, I do not think <Col N="2169" /> that we will be much wiser tomorrow afternoon.</P>
    <P>I appreciate fully the clear support of the Minister.  This is not an ideological issue at this stage but a reality that comes about from the difficulties that exist.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister and his officials to have regard to the other constitutional argument I made on the Murphy case and to the treatment by the Minister for Social Welfare of two adults living together who were deemed for the purposes of the social welfare code to be a married couple and received less money then they would have been entitled to otherwise.  In that position there is the makings of a very nasty and unnecessarily expensive settlement.  Perhaps in this instance a way could be found so that the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance would not have to go out in front of social legislation but could be creative in its interpretation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I take on board all of the points raised by Deputy Quinn. I am well aware of the attitude of the Revenue Commissioners towards cases such as the hardship cases illustrated in the Deputy's earlier examples.  Indeed, they would have the authority to deal with certain cases on a hardship basis.  In the case mentioned by the Deputy the Revenue Commissioners would not have attempted to take possession of the House and have it sold or otherwise. They do approach cases in the light of the circumstances as they know them.  I shall not comment otherwise on what the Deputy said, except to repeat that all of the propositions put will be taken together and considered.  As the Deputy said, Members could not realistically expect anything between now and Report Stage tomorrow afternoon, but work will be carried out and the Government will take into consideration the various points made about social welfare legislation of the 1970s and the way that equates with different legal arguments that come up from time to time, for example, the Murphy case.  The Government will positively look for solutions and not just trot <Col N="2170" /> out the same old arguments that have already been heard.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his undertaking.  I accept fully the constraints that are built into that undertaking and that there is no guarantee that a solution will be found.  Lest I seem to be making a selfish, personalised case, I wish to point out that the incidents to which I refer could by extension include, because of the thresholds and the potential value of property in question, a brother and sister, two brothers living together, and people who are &ldquo;not strangers in blood&rdquo;. The thresholds are different &mdash; it is not £10,700, it is a higher threshold &mdash; but the threshold may nevertheless not be sufficient to meet the total amount of money that transfers.  Perhaps, as in many other cases, an age qualification could be brought in, for example, a charge could be attached to the property so that someone who was 60 years or more would not find, having lived in a family house for all his or her life with an unmarried brother or sister, upon the death of that brother or sister, that the consequential duties and costs oblige him or her to sell the house.  I am given to understand that in some applications, not all, the provision may have a wider effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is absolutely true, and in section 108 the Deputy will see that I have addressed the brother and sister element because the threshold was so low.  The threshold is being raised to £50,000 this year as a more realistic approach to the issue.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 157a:</P>
      <P>In page 90, before section 105, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;105.&mdash;Where a discretionary trust <Col N="2171" /> on which tax has been paid at the appropriate annual rate is broken up, an allowance shall be made in respect of such payments of tax as aforesaid in the assessment of capital acquisitions tax due on such breaking-up.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment was put down and circulated this morning.  It relates to circumstances in which a family have organised their affairs in a discretionary trust, and tax, as we know, is paid on discretionary trusts.  Suppose that tax is paid at the appropriate rate and everything is above board.  As time goes on circumstances change and the trust is broken up.  In assessment of the capital acquisition tax due to the breaking up of the trust, I want an allowance to be made in respect of payments already made when the trust was in place.</P>
    <P>What is happening now on the break up of a trust is that people pay the full capital acquisition tax and no allowance is made for the tax already paid when the trust was in place.  This does not have implications for an enormous number of people but it is very serious double taxation for those to whom it applies.  In particular, where family businesses are organised and assets are put into a discretionary trust to benefit children, when the transfers are being made subsequently, it can lead to a situation where the imposition is so serious as to cause the break-up of family businesses.  I should like to hear the Minister's initial response to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The 3 per cent and 1 per cent discretionary trust taxes were introduced in 1984 and 1986, respectively. The taxes are directed at those trusts which were set up essentially to avoid or indefinitely delay payment of capital acquisitions tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the tax is to compensate the Exchequer for such delay.  If the annual 1 per cent charge is allowed as a credit against the capital acquisitions tax charged on the breaking up of these trusts, then such compensation will be entirely negatived.  Furthermore, the tax <Col N="2172" /> would no longer be a disincentive to taxpayers to set up such trusts which are mainly tax avoidance vehicles.  On the question of the yield to the Exchequer, as some discretionary trusts may have been in existence for many years, the total annual payments could, if credited against the capital acquisitions tax on a break up, entirely wipe out that capital acquisitions tax.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I agree that the measure was introduced to ensure that persons who availed of what is essentially a tax avoidance mechanism would pay tax at some stage.  However, all tax avoidance procedures are entered into with the intention of avoiding tax, that is a truism as well as a cliché.  The only reason for tax avoidance systems is to avoid paying tax.</P>
      <P>Some people set up schemes for tax avoidance reasons at a particular stage in their family life and business and they do not intend them to continue indefinitely or that they would never be broken up. However, in circumstances where it comes to a break-up, there is a serious question of double taxation.  I should like the Minister to re-examine the question as I am sure, over the years, he would have received submissions on the lines to which I referred.  It is an area where a matter could be clarified by examining a particular case and it is difficult across the House to nominate one.  Will the Minister go back on the correspondence in his Department in relation to noteworthy cases where there is a genuine problem, not because people were playing fast and loose with the system, but because of changing circumstances as a family organised their affairs?  Will he look at it in that context?  It is a confined area where particular cases have caused hardship.  People cannot now foresee how they will break up the trust because the penalties will be so severe.</P>

      <P>I accept that trusts will probably not be broken up because it is not feasible to do so as the resources required might not be available.  During <Col N="2173" /> the budget debate this matter also arose and it does not necessarily follow that the way we now impose our taxes is the best way to get the most revenue.  We are in the business of collecting revenue, that was the philosophy behind abolishing the two top rates of capital acquisitions taxes because they were a disincentive, we were not getting the revenue and I believe we will get more revenue the other way.</P>
      <P>I gave an undertaking during the budget debate that I would examine all aspects of capital taxes and I will include this in the review.  I will look back on correspondence in the Department as I am sure there are cases involved.</P>

      <P>This section, and some subsequent sections, are designed to relieve the obligation on some people to pay tax.  We have been saying for many years &mdash; I have been saying it since 1978 &mdash; that the taxes on labour were too high and that taxes on capital were too low. The reduction in income tax and taxes on wages and salaries is essential but, in order to do this, I said that other taxes would have to be brought in.  I was referring to taxes on property, capital acquisitions, capital gains and various company taxes.  I know that the Progressive Democrats took up this cry in the past three or four years.  It became the essential point of their whole economic policy of tax reform and reduction of tax on wages and salaries which would mean an accompanying increase in capital taxes of various kinds.  Where relief from capital taxes is given?  Will the Minister explain what agricultural relief is designed to do?  Who are the people he intends to help?</P>
      <P>The subsections read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  &ldquo;as respects a gift or inheritance <Col N="2174" /> taken on or after the 30th day of January, 1991, have effect as if &lsquo;55 per cent.&rsquo; were substituted for &lsquo;50 per cent.&rsquo; in the definition of &lsquo;agricultural value&rsquo;,&rdquo; and</P>
    <P>(b)  &ldquo;as respects a gift or inheritance taken on or after the passing of this Act, have effect as if &lsquo;80 per cent.&rsquo; were substituted for &lsquo;75 per cent.&rsquo; in the definition of &lsquo;farmer&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum says that the increase from 50 per cent to 55 per cent of the market value of the property means that the relief will be given by reducing the market value of agricultural property by 55 per cent or £200,000, whichever is the lesser.  Will the Minister explain who will benefit from this relief and what is its purpose?  Will he also say what the cost of this relief will be to the Exchequer?  I will be asking similar questions in regard to the next two sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional 5 per cent is some recognition of the additional items now included in capital acquisitions tax so far as the agricultural farming sector is concerned.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that up to last year the thresholds were not even indexed for anybody. Therefore, it is fair to index them for a start and I took that step.  Another large element has come into the capital acquisitions area from the farmers' point of view, for instance, in the dairying sector, where the milk quota pushes up the value of the holding and, consequently, lifts quite substantially the amount of capital acquisitions tax payable.  It is in recognition of the changing circumstances there that the 5 per cent has been introduced.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not told me how much this will cost the Exchequer.  In regard to the milk quota, it is now an extra asset and can be sold at any time while retaining the holding. Therefore, I cannot understand why the fact that there is a milk quota &mdash; an additional asset to a farmer &mdash; means that <Col N="2175" /> relief should be given for it.  I cannot understand the reason relief should be given for the milk quota unless the Minister can say that this is causing hardship to some farmers.</P>

      <P>It is my understanding that large dairy farmers are purchasing milk quotas with the result that they will be given relief.  The explanatory memorandum states that &ldquo;this relief is given by reducing the market value of agricultural property by 55 per cent or £200,000 whichever is the lesser&rdquo;.  Therefore, it is the farmer with a large holding who will be given relief.  I fail to see why they should be given this relief.  The Minister has not indicated that they suffer great hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to have misunderstood me.  We are talking here about capital acquisitions tax, not capital gains tax, and it will not matter how many milk quotas the large farmer buys as the ceiling of £200,000 is being retained.  Therefore, it is the smaller farmer &mdash; the value of whose property may not reach the ceiling of £200,000 &mdash; not the large farmer who will benefit.</P>

      <P>I welcome this change which marks a move in the right direction. However, we need to go further and try to increase the rate of agricultural relief to 75 per cent.  I accept that that would be a big step but we must provide an incentive to farmers to transfer their farms sooner.  Capital acquisitions tax represents a disincentive to many to transfer their land.  As the Minister is aware, farmers only have a few matters <Col N="2176" /> to settle with their families when they transfer land and the young farmer who takes over the land usually has to borrow or sell part of the property to pay this tax.  This places a heavy imposition on him, inhibits development and acts as a discouragement.  This suggestion is worth considering in the future, if we can afford to make the change.  Again, I welcome the change in the Bill but we must try to improve the position in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to do is to look after the small farmers.  Large farmers who have to pay capital acquisitions tax can avail of the following reliefs: first, they can avail of agriculture relief up to the ceiling of £200,000 in addition to relief up to the exemption limit of £161,000 for each child thereafter. I want to protect the small north Kerry farmer and so on and remove him from the net.  If the Deputy has a commitment to rural society, which I think he has, I do not think he would not want to see small farmers having to sell their <Col N="2178" /> holdings to pay capital acquisitions tax. That is the reason I made provision for section 60 policies to allow them cover the cost involved.  I am not interested in large farmers who have their own ways of dealing with the matter but in alleviating the social problems caused for families where holdings are split.  I hope this provision will help and encourage farmers to pass on farms much earlier.  I am sure the Deputy will agree with me.</P>

      <P>It appears that the Minister has gone too far for The Workers' Party and not far enough for Fine Gael which indicates that he must have got the balance just about right.  This legislation has been designed to help the small farmer and that is the reason the ceiling of £200,00 is being retained.  Deputy Mac Giolla suggested that the milk quota was an extra asset, but does he have any idea of what the milk quota is?  The introduction of milk quotas has led to the value of agricultural land in the hands of dairy farmers being reduced.  Deputy Mac Giolla also made the ideological point that in reducing the amount collected in capital acquisitions tax the Minister is limiting his ability to reduce the amount paid by the PAYE sector.  The Minister has said that the total yield from capital acquisition tax, from all sectors, last year was £38 million, approximately 20 per cent of which was paid by the agricultural sector.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Will the Minister comment on section 105 (b)? Everybody has been welcoming the extra relief the Minister is providing even <Col N="2181" /> though it is a small relief.  However, paragraph (b) is a restriction.  Will the Minister explain how the movement from 75 per cent to 80 per cent will work.  It seems that this could seriously hurt small farmers and I do not think that was the Minister's intention.  Up until now somebody could avail of agricultural relief if 75 per cent of their activity was derived from agriculture, now that figure will increase to 80 per cent.  In agricultural activity the land &mdash; and that will include the quota, if a quota applies &mdash; the farm buildings, stock, and plant and machinery for farm work will be included.  However, the house will not be included.  Suppose a farmer has shares in the co-operative, as a great many of them have, and the 10,000 shares now have a monetary value they did not have a couple of years ago, I do not think they would get agricultural relief on that either.  Let us take the example of a small farmer with 60 or 70 acres, and say the land is valued at £130,000.  On top of that he has a tractor and plant and machinery which could be worth another £15,000, as well as farm buildings and stock in addition to the House.  It would not be difficult to envisage that the total estate would be worth £200,000, but the house would be worth £50,000.  Because the non-agricultural portion was worth 25 per cent of the total, agricultural reliefs would not now apply. Then the farmer would be in a very serious position.  He would have an exemption limit of £164,400 and would be paying tax on almost £49,000.  He would pay 20 per cent on the first £10,000 and 30 per cent on the next £30,000-£40,000 approximately.  Very big sums of money are involved.  Things would work out fine if he was better off because the house would not be as big a percentage of the total value, as in the case of a farmer with 100 acres, but for a farmer with 60 to 65 acres, the Minister had opened the trap.</P>

      <P>There is no trap. The reason it does not react against real farmers is that the computation of capital acquisitions tax on a farm with a house on it is treated as agricultural property. However, this gets at the city dweller or business man cum farmer who has a large business interest as part of the total property, and it will certainly affect him.  It will not affect the person who has a good house worth £40,000 or £50,000 on a farm that would be worth somewhat less because, for assessment purposes that is covered under the heading of agriculture land.</P>

      <P>With regard to the same paragraph, I can see cases where people may get a little worried.  Where a farmer decides to change from one type of business to another farm business for example and he dies between selling off all his cows and getting into dry stock or some other farm enterprise where he has to spend the money he got for the cows, the cash could account for more than 20 per cent of the value of his farm and the estate would be caught by this provision. This is what is worrying a lot of people, and not what Deputy Noonan has been speaking about.  These situations might not happen too often but they could <Col N="2183" /> happen and quite a number of people have expressed a worry about this.</P>

      <P>This section proposes to reduce the top rate of inheritance tax from 55 per cent to 40 per cent.  Who will benefit from this reduction and how much will it cost the Exchequer?  I do not want a speech on the matter; I merely want the Minister to give me the answers. What is the purpose of reducing the top rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">

      <P>The Deputy does not want to hear that the cost will be <Col N="2184" /> negligible; he wants figures.  There is no basis for giving the Deputy figures.  All I can say is that the cost will be negligible and that only 2 per cent of the people who paid did so at the top rate.  When one looks at the payments, one can see that high rates of taxation do not necessarily mean that there will be more Exchequer revenue.  We are all interested in getting more Exchequer revenue.</P>

When one looks at the amount brought in by the very high rates which have been in existence for the past 25 years one can see that a new industry has been created in tax planning.  Because it is worth their while to do this, people do not pay the 55 per cent rate.  The system has been tried for 25 years and we have got very little money from it.  I am prepared to introduce lower rates and I believe that in time we will get more Exchequer revenue from these lower rates, which is what the exercise should be all about as far as any Minister for Finance is concerned.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 158:</P>
      <P>In page 91, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The provisions of this section shall apply to gifts as they apply to inheritances.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for bringing in this section this year.  He promised to reduce it last year but did not have enough time between Committee and Report Stages to do so.  I had referred to tragic circumstances where a double transfer occurred when the son to whom an estate had been transferred died tragically and on the reverse transfer to the parent a double tranche of inheritance tax had to be paid.  This amendment is simply to test the Minister to see if he would have any serious objection to applying the same procedure to gift tax also.  Obviously, there would not be tragic circumstances but there would be valid circumstances where a child may want to transfer property to a parent for good social reasons.  The loss of revenue to the Exchequer would be absolutely negligible. It is common throughout the code to apply the same criteria to both inheritance tax and gift tax.  Will the Minister do the entire job or will he consider it overnight and do it tomorrow?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I made one improvement in regard to transfers between brothers and sisters by raising the threshold of £150,000 from its previous unrealistic figure so that a brother or sister will not have to sell his or her house in order to pay this tax.  This is a different issue and deals with a case which arose on Committee Stage of last year's Finance Bill. The case related to a man in County Kilkenny who had transferred all his property to his son, an only child, who was subsequently killed in an accident. Consequently, all the tax would have had to be paid on the double when the land was being transferred back to the father. That is the type of situation dealt with under this section.  We also found further cases and this is why we back dated it.</P>

    <P>(2)  This section shall have effect in relation to gifts and inheritances taken on or after the 26th day of December, 1990.</P>
    <P>Certain securities are exempt from all taxation in the State when in the beneficial ownership of a person who is neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.  Section 57 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, exempts these securities from gift and inheritance taxes when they are taken as a gift or inheritance by a person who is neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.  The exemptions also extended to units of a unit trust scheme registered under the Unit Trusts Act, 1972, whose assets consisted exclusively of these types of securities.  However, as the Unit Trusts Act, 1972 was repealed by the Unit Trusts <Col N="2190" /> Act, 1990, an amendment is required to continue to apply the exemption to units of similar trust schemes authorised by the Unit Trusts Act, 1990.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see all of the Deputies, including the Minister for the Environment, from the Mayo West constituency here.</P>
      <P>I support Government activity to create further manufacturing opportunities in Ballinrobe town.  As public representatives from Mayo West we have invested heavily in the future of our young people in Ballinrobe town by providing a brand new community school which, with all its ancillary facilities, will provide the necessary base for young people to do as they wish in educational terms over the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment is due to open a major water scheme there next week and this in itself will provide a basis for further infrastructural developments and an attractive base for industry to come to Ballinrobe.  Also the local county council have adopted a scheme for development of high impact visual attractive features to many of our towns in the west, including Ballinrobe, and <Col N="2193" /> this is supported unanimously by Mayo County Council.</P>
    <P>Ballinrobe has been hit badly in recent years by various closures.  We had the sale and disposal of the assets of An Foras Talúntais at Creagh with the loss of 35 jobs.  We have had the threatened downgrading of the post office with a further loss of jobs, and the recent closure of a sawmill in the town with a loss of 38 permanent jobs.  In the town at present 264 people are employed between Western Pride Bakery, Jennings Meats, Welsh Kitchens, Silear Factory and Cummins' Supermarket, but the fact remains that 574 people are unemployed, twice as many as there are employed.</P>
    <P>While I support the measures adopted by the Government to date, they are not sufficient.  I am sorry the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not here this evening, but I call on him, as the boss, the man in charge of the IDA, to see to it that as attractive a package as possible is made available to attract potential industrialists to Ballinrobe and provide much needed jobs in an area which has had very high emigration over the years. I do not want to see a situation where the basic infrastructures are in place but the Minister for Industry and Commerce to preside over the economic decimation of a small western town.  I would like a commitment on the record from the Minister of State on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that, together they will see to it, that the IDA are given the necessary resources to deliver jobs to Ballinrobe in whatever measure.  I will give my two remaining minutes to Deputy O'Toole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny for allowing me some of his precious time to speak on this issue.  I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this important matter.  Ballinrobe must now be classified as a black spot area.  Previously, other towns in Mayo had been so classified but Castlebar, for instance, increased job numbers by way of Employment in Baxter Healthcare, Castlebar Cable Products and Johnsons.  At that time the IDA came to Castlebar and went some <Col N="2194" /> of the way to try to provide jobs in that then black spot area, the same applied in Ballina where they were successful in getting a factory which relieved some of the unemployment problem.  The Ballinrobe area is unique in the sense that it lost its railway system some time ago and the agricultural research station in Creagh.  That latter project was to have been replaced by a major tourist facility but that did not happen.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, and I attended a meeting more than 12 months ago where the development association were present.  The need for this provision of jobs was spelled out to the Minister in Ballinrobe on that occasion, and we asked that Ballinrobe be given priority in that regard.  Regrettably the Minister is not here tonight.  I do not know what action he has taken since to help the area.  It behoves him to tell the people of Ballinrobe if he will now declare the area a number one priority.  I have no doubt the IDA will do the job in securing worthwhile industry for the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of significant new overseas projects commenced operations and recruiting in Mayo during 1990.  One of the most significant of these was Henniges Elastomers who, after completing the fit-out of the factory and training the initial key people, have now over 110 in employment in Ballina which is considerably in excess of the original projections.  At Castlebar, as Deputy O'Toole said, Baxter Healthcare embarked on a joint investment programme, with the IDA, of £10 million which will lead to increased job numbers of 480 by 1994 &mdash; already some 450 of these are in place.  The continuing growth in the healthcare industry in the west region is further evidenced by the sustained growth and development at Allergan in Westport and continued improvement in the situation in Hollister Overseas in Ballina.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small industry sector has continued to be a vibrant part of the economy in the west with 48 projects being <Col N="2195" /> approved for IDA support in 1990, 25 of which were in Mayo, representing some 160 prospective new jobs.  Grant assistance to small business was approved across a very broad range of sectors including engineering, pharmaceuticals, consumer goods and crafts with a very good geographical spread throughout the west region.</P>
    <P>In so far as Ballinrobe itself is concerned, the IDA are very keenly aware of the need to generate further employment opportunities in the local economy.  I know that the IDA have been working closely with the Ballinrobe Development Company in an effort to develop employment opportunities in the town.  The IDA co-operated with the development company in the production of their promotional brochure on the town and its facilities.  IDA's project divisions and overseas offices are regularly updated on Ballinrobe and have been supplied with copies of the brochure.</P>
    <P>The IDA Galway regional office have also had a number of meetings with the Ballinrobe Development Company regarding new industrial employment opportunities in the town.</P>
    <P>On 22 February 1991, the IDA arranged a small business promotion at the Lakeland Hotel in Ballinrobe, involving the Mayo County Development Team and the Ballinrobe Development Company.  The promotion was, I believe, reasonably well attended.</P>
    <P>Co-operation between public and private sector groups is simply crucial to all of our industrial development efforts right across the country, I am, therefore, very glad to see such co-operation being developed in Ballinrobe.</P>
    <P>The IDA has currently underway a programme of refurbishment and enhancement of the 21,000 square feet private finance factory in Ballinrobe which has been vacant for some years, including suitable landscaping in the immediate vicinity of the building.  The IDA have also put in place a specially attractive incentive package for new industry to locate in the advance factory.</P>
    <P>All of these developments are clear <Col N="2196" /> evidence of the IDA's and the Government's commitment to Ballinrobe. However, as the IDA have already indicated to the Ballinrobe Development Company, all IDA's commitments count for very little unless there are local entrepreneurs willing to invest in viable manufacturing projects and overseas investors who are willing to consider Ballinrobe as a location for their business.</P>
    <P>The west region as a whole has much to offer in terms of its potential for both manufacturing and other types of employment.  The Deputy can be assured that the IDA will continue to play their part in exploiting this potential in so far as manufacturing and international services employment is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise this matter.  While it may seem that a matter involving a mere 60 pence is not worth having the House sit so late for in the evening, the facts surrounding this affair should be investigated further so that some lessons might be learned from it.  I thank the Minister of State for taking the time to come and listen to what I have to say.</P>
      <P>It is supposed to be a fundamental principle of our legal system that the punishment would fit the crime.  If ever there was a case of the punishment failing to do so it must surely have been that of the 17 year old girl from my constituency who was sentenced to seven days imprisonment for allegedly evading a DART fare of 60p and who spent two days in Mountjoy Prison before the Minister intervened to secure the release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fare evasion is an unacceptable and anti-social activity which needs to be discouraged. I am also aware that the young girl was alleged to have committed a similar offence previously.  However, even allowing for that, a seven day sentence was totally disproportionate for an offence involving 60p.  Such sentencing taken in conjunction with the inconsistency in sentencing policy must simply <Col N="2197" /> undermine public confidence in the courts system.</P>
    <P>I have in the past drawn public attention to cases where courts have treated with incredible leniency, people convicted on drunk driving offences which have led to deaths of totally innocent people.  No later than 26 February last, I referred to two specific cases where people convicted under these circumstances had not received custodial sentences and where there had not been any suggestion of sentencing.</P>
    <P>Are we now to take it that our courts consider the evasion of a fare worth 60p to be a more serious offence than drunk driving leading to death?  We can also compare the treatment of this girl with the treatment of major tax evaders many of whom have been caught evading tax of hundreds of thousands of pounds.  Has anyone ever gone to jail in this country &mdash; even for two days &mdash; for evading tax? Not at all.</P>
    <P>We read in the newspapers last week about how Mr. Goodman's organisation had apparently been able to come to an arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners to write off £4 million of an outstanding tax bill of £8 million.  This case, if anything, would certainly prove that there is one law for the rich and another for everyone else in this country.</P>
    <P>Had this young girl been obliged to serve her full sentence, the cost to the taxpayer of keeping her in jail for a week would have been more than £600, all for 60p.  I do not believe that a custodial sentence for such a trivial amount could ever be justified especially where there were non-custodial alternatives available to the court.  Why was the girl not considered for supervision under the juvenile liaison officers scheme or some other such supervisory scheme?  Why did the court not consider making a community service order which would have required the girl to do some community work such as removing graffiti, or cleaning up the railway station in her area?</P>
    <P>This case emphasises once again the need for some sort of guidelines for our courts when imposing sentences.  I appeal to the Minister to enter into negotiations <Col N="2198" /> with the appropriate judicial authorities to see that they are brought in as soon as possible.  In addition to the judicial considerations and that of the administration of justice generally, there is another problem underlying the difficulties here, that has to do with the proper development of the DART service on the north side of Dublin city.  I appreciate that this is not directly a matter for the Minister of State concerned here but I ask him to bring back to his colleague in Government the facts of this problem which I raised with him in the House previously and where he has indicated that no funds are available.</P>
    <P>It is a remarkable feature of the service on the north side of the city that after 9 p.m. the railway stations are abandoned along this stretch of the line and left unmanned.  People can enter and leave without being required to pay a fare.  That was a factor in these cases.  So long as the north side stations are not properly developed and staffed and as long as the courts go on with what seems to be a lurch and stop attitude to dealing with offenders who come before them, our Minister will be required on another occasion to spring young people, if not adults, from our prisons.  Therefore, I hope action will be taken in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy McCartan would appreciate more than most Members of the House that under the Constitution our judges are independent in the performance of their judicial functions and that, consequently, it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on the circumstances of any individual case in so far as the courts are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the incident raised by Deputy McCartan, on 16 May 1991 a young girl, who was being prosecuted by larnród Éireann in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court for having travelled on a train without having previously paid her rail fare, was remanded to Mountjoy Female Prison.  The following day she was brought before the <Col N="2199" /> court, where she was convicted, fined and sentenced to seven days imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, the Minister for Justice may authorise the temporary release of any prisoner subject to such conditions as he may deem appropriate in the circumstances.  The criteria used in deciding on such releases have been outlined in this House on many occasions in the past and include consideration of the nature of the offence and the safety of the public.</P>
    <P>On being informed of this case, the Minister for Justice had the circumstances carefully examined and having considered all of the issues, he decided to exercise his powers under the Act and grant temporary release to the offender, under specific conditions.  The offender was released from custody on Saturday morning last May 18 1991, the day after her conviction.</P>
    <P>I trust that this decision is to the satisfaction of the girl, her family, Deputy McCartan and the Members of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the horrific attack on the child in England by the American pitbull terrier, I had tabled a Dáil question to the Minister on the question of curbs on these and other dangerous breeds.  No doubt my question will come before the House in the normal way.  However, the situation has changed dramatically in the last few days.  It is for this reason that I attempted to raise the matter on the Adjournment yesterday and succeeded in doing so on the second attempt today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has changed largely as a result of the swift and effective action taken by the British Prime Minister in banning the ownership of these animals, breeding them or their importation into Britain.  While this news, in one sense, is very welcome in that it gives a lead to other countries, it also means that there could be an attempt to flood Ireland with dogs from Britain, and this country may <Col N="2200" /> be used as a back door to gain access to the future British black market.  The possibility of a spill-over from Britain of the most dangerous fighting breeds in the world is an immediate and very real threat.  In view of this, the Minister's belated announcement of very limited measures is both inadequate and unworkable. It is far too little, far too late.</P>
    <P>To explain why the Minister's measures are unworkable, I need only refer to Dublin city alone, where there is a large number of these breeds, particularly the American pitbulls.  The question is, who will implement the new regulations? Dublin Corporation have in their service a mere three hardworking dog wardens. They have not the resources, equipment or manpower to tackle pitbulls, Japanese Tosas, Rhodesian Ridgebacks, Rott-weilers etc.  They are not permitted to use stun guns or phasers and are equipped only with the traditional pole and net. The service costs Dublin Corporation £90,000 per year.  The have requested and have been refused additional funds.  Will the Minister provide extra funds for manpower, equipment etc.?  The Minister rarely provides additional funds to Dublin Corporation for anything.</P>
    <P>Who would the wardens be up against, apart from the vicious animals?  I need hardly say here, that there are many responsible persons who own such animals, and they will, no doubt, co-operate with the new regulations.  However there is another type of owner, and I will give two examples in my own area of the north inner city.  Several months ago Dublin Corporation officials and gardaí attempted to carry out an eviction of a squatter in a city centre flat.  The squatter, a young man, is a drug dealer, who has his neighbours, some of them very elderly, living in fear.  He boasted he would not be evicted, and he was right.  Why?  He has two savage pitbull dogs in the flat and he let them loose.  Needless to say the city officials hastily withdrew.  He is still in his flat with his pitbulls today.</P>
    <P>The second example is of a young individual in his early twenties.  He is the current main heroin pusher in the north <Col N="2201" /> inner city.  He has occupied that reprehensible position for the last year or so. The Garda are making every effort to bring him to justice.  So far they have failed.  One of the many difficulties they face is the very large and vicious rott-weiler this person takes with him when he is at his sickening business.</P>
    <P>Both of these individuals will be immediately recognisable to the Garda even from the general accounts I have given.  Indeed a Garda representative was quoted today as saying that:</P>
    <P>.... These animals are considered to be a weapon by criminals &mdash; there is a clear danger to society which requires us to look again at legislation because these animals can be lethal.</P>
    <P>There are many more examples like the two I mentioned both in the inner city and in the large estates on the periphery of Dublin city and they are increasing in number.  Who will make these people muzzle their animals?  What is needed is the same swift and decisive action that we witnessed in Britain.  These animals must be banned.  Their importation must be banned and those already here must be destroyed.  The Minister is quoted in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> as saying that he will not hesitate to do this if it is warranted.  I trust the Minister will take the opportunity here tonight to explain what he means by &ldquo;if it is warranted&rdquo;. Does this mean he will ban them if there are similar horrific attacks on children as witnessed in Britain?  Does it mean after, and only after, children are savaged and killed?  I hope this is not what the Minister meant.  Let there be no doubt about it, this will happen unless the Minister acts now.</P>
    <P>A Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals spokesperson stated:</P>
    <P>There is now an immediate risk every day that someone here will be attacked and severely injured if not killed.</P>
    <P>These dogs have no innocent function. They are not pets by any stretch of the imagination.  They are for fighting and bred for that alone&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to deal with this matter. At the outset, I acknowledge that there is a serious problem requiring urgent attention.  Certain species of dogs, pitbull terriers being the prime example, have no place in a modern society.  They were bred specifically for the purpose of fighting. They are being used increasingly for the purpose of crime and they are dangerous animals.  I intend to remove the threat posed by these dogs.</P>
      <P>I intend to use the existing powers in the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, to deal with the immediate problem.  I would remind the House that I used the 1986 Act very successfully to deal with such problems with guard dogs, following the savage attack in Tallaght some years ago. I intend to make regulations immediately under the 1986 Act.  These regulations will require pitbull terriers and other dogs which I will identify, to be kept on a leash and to be muzzled at all times in public places.  In short, if one has one of these dogs and wishes to take him out, the dog will have to be muzzled and on a leash. If this is not done, then one faces a stiff fine and the dog is seized.  The courts can also order that a dangerous dog be destroyed.  If these measures are effectively applied, they will remove the immediate threat.</P>
      <P>With this in mind I will, over the next week, contact the authorities and the Dog Warden Service about developing special measures to step up enforcement and in particular, to deal with the pitbull terrier problem.  What I have in mind is a special unit &mdash; a hit squad &mdash; to deal specifically with this problem.</P>
      <P>The third measure I will take will require legislation.  I will come back to this House urgently with a new measure to considerably strengthen existing legislation. That legislation will include a total ban on the ownership, breeding and importation of pitbull terriers.  It will also provide for tighter controls on other types of dogs which represent a potential threat to the public.  The measures I am considering will include registration, licence fees, implants, insurance and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2203" /> I also propose to have discussions with interested parties concerning the precise contents of the legislation.  As I said at the outset, the problem is urgent and the threat posed by certain breeds of dogs is real.  I intend to remove the threat and I will come back to the House with measures to deal comprehensively with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The only orthopaedic hospital in the mid-west region is St. Nessans, Croom, which caters for a population of about 315,000.  Of that population more than 35,000 persons are over 65 years of age and are, therefore, in the high risk category for fracture injuries. Since 1987 one ward has been closed, thus reducing the effective bed complement to fewer than 100 beds.  Each year during the summer months one ward is closed down, so the average bed occupancy is reduced even further.</P>
      <P>Comhairle na Ospidéal recommend a target ratio of one orthopaedic surgeon per 70,000 population.  An extra orthopaedic surgeon was appointed in November last, bringing the staff complement of orthopaedic surgeons to four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board have failed to appoint extra nursing staff to fully support the orthopaedic staff, and I have received complaints that the shortage of nursing staff has put a lot of stress and strain on nurses.  As the Minister knows, older patients place extra <Col N="2204" /> demands on the nursing staff, and in that hospital two-thirds of the patients fall into this category.  For example, one ward has 28 male patients and one nurse and a night porter, and one relief nurse for two wards.  On occasions one older patient could demand most of the attention of one nurse.  Other aspects in relation to the lack of nurses have been brought to my attention, but time constraints prevent me from now informing the Minister of them.</P>
    <P>I compliment the staff of Croom Orthopaedic Hospital, who carry out great work under difficult circumstances. I now call on the Minister to provide extra nursing staff.  In conclusion, I very much appreciate the Minister's being present here tonight to respond.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of nursing staff at Croom orthopaedic hospital is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board in the first instance.  My Department approved a fourth consultant orthopaedic surgeon for Croom hospital last year.  The Department are currently examining the question of approving additional nursing staff at the hospital to support the increased activity due to the appointment of the fourth consultant.  That matter will be discussed between officers of my Department and the Mid-Western Health Board in the near future in the context of the board's allocation for 1991 and my commitment to maintain activity levels during this year at the approved 1990 levels.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I am most concerned to improve orthopaedic services throughout the country, particularly in centres with long waiting lists for these services.  Deputy Finucane would be interested to learn that there was an 18 per cent increase in the number of orthopaedic operations at the orthopaedic hospital in Croom in 1990 as compared to 1989, and I am confident that activity will be maintained at least at the 1990 levels during the current year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to inform the House of a very serious position in the Midland Health Board area following the <Col N="2205" /> butchering of the budget by £1.4 million by the present Minister.</P>
      <P>Many people are suffering severe hardship because of the huge waiting lists for orthopaedic surgery at Tullamore General Hospital.  The situation is intolerable. Urgent action is needed to increase the staff in the Midland Health Board area.  The orthopaedic surgery department at Tullamore Hospital is working round the clock, but the lists and applications for treatment are just too long.</P>
      <P>An interesting statistic reinforces my argument.  The Minister might consider the following figures relating to the ratio between population and orthopaedic surgeons throughout the world: in Sweden the figures are 20,000:1; in the USA, 20,000:1; Canada, 30,000:1; Australia, 32,000:1; New Zealand, 36,000:1; the Netherlands, 42,000:1; Scotland, 48,000:1; and England and Wales, 66,000:1.  In Ireland, as Deputy Finucane said, the recommended figure by Comhairle na Ospidéal &mdash; which has almost reached its target &mdash; is 70,000:1.  If the figures in Ireland are broken down, the ratio for the Eastern Health Board stands at 56,000:1; the North-Western Health Board, 53,000:1; the recommended ratio of the Irish Orthopaedic Institute is 50,000:1.  The Midland Health Board have a population to surgeon ratio of 103,800:1.  That is a damnable disgrace. I ask the Minister to take on board that statistic.  He should be ashamed of himself. He should immediately instruct the Midland Health Board to make the appropriate appointment.  There can be no doubt that the Midland Health Board area has been selected to bear the brunt of ministerial cuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People want to be treated locally.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that a certain amount of operations were performed in Cappagh or in Dublin.  People in the Midland Health Board area deserve a team of surgeons who can perform orthopaedic operations within the Midland Health Board area.  God knows, on the figures I have produced, one surgeon for 103,800 people, having regard to the waiting lists and the severe hardship <Col N="2206" /> caused to elderly people in particular throughout County Laois and County Offaly, I urge the Minister to act, and to act immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In Tullamore there are two consultant orthopaedic surgeons employed in the unit, which has 49 beds. In 1990, 1,134 orthopaedic operations were performed, 121 of those being hip replacement operations.  At present the average waiting time for the hip replacement operation is six to seven months in the Midland Health Board area.  I should like Deputy Flanagan to go to England, Sweden, and every other country he talked about, and see the waiting lists of those who need hip replacement operations. Urgent cases are admitted much more quickly than the six or seven months I mentioned &mdash; usually within one to two months.  Deputy Flanagan did not tell the House that.  That compares reasonably well with the waiting time for hip replacement operations nationally.</P>
      <P>I should also welcome that some orthopaedic operations are carried out elsewhere on patients from the Midland Health Board area.  In 1990 Cappagh Hospital, for example, performed 30 such hip replacement operations.  A total of 859 new out-patients were seen by the Tullamore orthopaedic hospital during 1990.  I might add that patients do not object to going to Cappagh Hospital. There was a 40 per cent increase in the number of hip replacement operations performed at Cappagh Hospital last year over the previous year.</P>

    <P>My Department are currently considering an application from the Midland Health Board to appoint an additional orthopaedic surgeon at Tullamore General Hospital.

      <P>The vexed question of traffic flow and pedestrian movement in Littleton is of long standing.  The village is situated on the heavily trafficked Dublin to Cork main road, and is highly dangerous for pedestrians and drivers. Since 1985 there have been more than 50 serious accidents at this junction.  Several proposals were put forward and rejected by the Department of the Environment. Remedial works carried out have, according to residents, intensified the problems, involving car parking difficulties, poor and inadequate sightline, diminished public accessibility to business premises and extensive flooding of the village.</P>
      <P>Numerous reports and studies have been commissioned during the past eight years at considerable cost, yet agreement on an appropriate course of action cannot be achieved between the council and the Department.  It is irresponsible and a downright scandal to allow the death trap situation to prevail.  The local community are frustrated and angry with inept, faceless bureaucrats who are opposed to all proposals while not having the capacity to put forward their own plans to resolve the problems.  The aggrieved public are jaded with misleading, empty ministerial promises of action and demand that immediate and positive steps be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following representations, the council were informed by letter of 5 April 1991 from the Department of the Environment that the Department did not see any useful purpose being achieved by the attendance of their inspectorate at an on-site meeting to discuss traffic control measures for Littleton village.  The letter also stated that the Department did not favour the use of &ldquo;rumble strips&rdquo; and that it was a matter for the gardaí to enforce <Col N="2208" /> the speed limits that applied to this location.  This response is an insult to local residents who must live with this daily nightmare.  I call on the Minister to exercise his ministerial authority and to instruct his officials to implement a satisfactory proposal without further delay.</P>

      <P>Traffic control measures at Littleton are primarily a matter for Tipperary (North Riding) County Council who, over the last two years, have put in place a number of measures to improve road safety.  These measures, which were financed from State road grants, include the provision and marking of kerbs to narrow and mark out the carriageway; a pedestrian hand rail near shops; double white lines to prevent overtaking; oversized speed limit signs and repeater signs through the village.  I am satisfied that these measures provide a good level of safety, provided road users comply with the law and observe the speed limit.</P>
      <P>The county council have sought approval to have &ldquo;rumble strips&rdquo; on the Dublin-Cork road through Littleton.  I am advised that Littleton would not be a suitable location for the use of these facilities.  The council were advised accordingly in October 1990.</P>
      <P>The county council have requested a major extension of the 40 mph speed limit and this is being considered.  Enforcement of the speed limit is, of course, a matter for the Garda.</P>

      <P>I am speaking on behalf of the people of Dirrha, Listowel, and wish to voice my disapproval at the failure of the Minister to provide a sewerage scheme for that area.  Over 250 people are affected, a total of 40 houses.  There is an unacceptably high concentration of septic tanks in a restricted area, which is an obvious health hazard.  The residents informed me recently that there has been an alarming increase in vermin in the area, which was very much in evidence <Col N="2209" /> during the fine weather of the past two summers.</P>
      <P>The residents are very concerned about the health of their families and the community. They feel abandoned by the Minister as the tender has been with the Department of the Environment since December 1987.  The people of Dirrha have waited since their estate was built in 1954 for a sewerage scheme.  There was a severe outbreak of typhoid in the Dirrha estate and there is always a danger that this could recur.  The residents are very frustrated and militant at present. They feel, with justification, that they have been forgotten by the Department. They have to travel to Listowel along the most dangerous stretch of road in the country, a point which I raised here some time ago.  They have lived without proper sanitary conditions for the past 57 years and it is now time to give them their rights.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister please take these people out of their misery and give them access to the funds available to his Department from the Structural Funds, which will solve the problem once and for all?</P>

      <P>This proposed extension to the Listowel sewerage scheme would serve about 50 houses along the Ballybunion road.  Sewage from these houses is disposed of by means of septic tanks and I understand that these arrangements have not been fully effective.  Kerry County Council have examined a number of options to serve the area and concluded that it should be connected to the main drainage scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern in this matter but, due to the high level of existing commitments on the water and sanitary services programme, I cannot indicate when I will be in a position to finance this scheme.  Deputy Deenihan will appreciate that significant funds are already being provided for high priority schemes in Kerry, including water supply schemes at Dingle, Firies, Scartaglen, Scart reservoir, Dromin water treatment works, Brosna, and sewerage schemes <Col N="2210" /> for Dingle, Tralee, Ballybunion, Kenmare, Killorglin, Caherciveen and Knightstown.</P>
    <P>Water and sanitary service grants totalling £4.4 million have already been allocated to schemes in Kerry in the current year.  This compares to £3.8 million which I provided in 1990 and demonstrates a continuing high level of commitment to water and sewerage schemes in the county.  These allocations show that Kerry is receiving its fair share of the overall capital available.  Nevertheless, I will consider the Deputy's comments in relation to this particular scheme in the light of developments on the implementation and financing of the programme as a whole.  I am conscious of the need in this case.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows from his days in Mayo County Council, when the original Coalition were in power, that we were building 250 houses per annum; we had a proud housing record.  Today there is a national crisis in housing and the general impression in many counties is that Mayo has been the beneficiary of the Minister's largesse. Unfortunately, the figures divulged last Monday at a meeting of Mayo County Council set the record straight.  The housing waiting list is as follows: Achill 15; Balla six; Ballina nine; Ballindine one; Ballinrobe 12; Ballycastle ten; Ballycroy 12; Ballyhaunis 23; Bangor Erris nine; Belmullet 17; Castlebar ten; Charlestown five; Claremorris 19; Crossmolina 16; Foxford 23; Geesala two; Kilkelly seven; Killala 15; Kilmaine two; Kiltimagh four; Knock three; Newport eight; Swinford 22 and Tourmakeady one.  In the rural electoral areas the numbers are as follows: Ballina 40; Castlebar 19; Claremorris 57; Killala 31; Swinford 27 and Westport 39.  The numbers in regard to <Col N="2211" /> urban councils are; Ballina 120; Westport 113 last week and 11 this week and 55 in Castlebar, 14 of them for unmarried mothers.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that there is a major cirsis in Mayo as there are 900 people on the waiting list.  We have a social and moral obligation to provide houses.  Unfortunately, millions have gone elsewhere for less worthy projects. It is an indictment of the Government's social policy and of the Minister as a Mayo man.  Beidh lá eile ag an bPaorach.</P>

      <P>The capital allocation for the traditional local authority housing construction programme in 1991 totalled £45.6 million, an increase of £11.7 million or 35 per cent over the final allocation in 1990.  These allocations will finance the commencement of 1,500 houses and the completion of 1,300 houses in 1991, with a further 1,300 houses in progress at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital allocation for each housing authority was determined on the basis of the competing needs of housing authorities and the total capital available nationally for the programme.  On this basis, the four housing authorities in Mayo received an allocation of £2.08 million for their 1991 programmes.  This is not an unreasonable figure, having regard to all the circumstances. <Col N="2212" /> Of course, needs are not met only by the construction of new local authority houses.  The vacancies which arise in the housing stock must also be taken into account as these add to the number of lettings which are possible.  The Mayo housing authorities had about 70 vacancies in 1990 and, when added to new house completions, allowed for total lettings of about 130 for the year.</P>
    <P>This year the local authority housing construction programme has been complemented by the measures set out in a plan for social housing.  These include a new scheme of assistance for the repair of private houses owned and occupied by persons accepted as being in need of local authority housing.  They also include a scheme under which the housing authority may make a site available, at a nominal price, to certain persons who are prepared to build for themselves.</P>
    <P>The measures in the plan are a comprehensive response to social housing needs and, when fully operational, will result in the provision of about 5,000 units of accommodation each year in addition to the traditional local authority housing programme.  Mayo, in common with the rest of the country, will share in the benefits from these new initiatives.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 23 May 1991.</P>

      <P>It is not clear what the Deputy means when he refers to submissions for funds. If he is referring to the reports received from the working groups in each of the sub-regions prior to the submission of the national development plan to the Commission in March 1989, I would point out that the proposals for aid included in those reports in all cases greatly exceeded the resources that would be available and not all of the proposals were quantified.

      <P>The estimate referred to by the Deputy relates to the International Financial Services Centre at the Custom House Docks and covered all the employment which was expected to arise from the establishment of that centre.  The figure of 7,500 included employment on construction, estimated in the programme to reach a peak of 1,500, as well as ancillary services and other spin-off activities.</P>
      <P>To date the number of new job commitments arising directly in financial services in the centre is 2,600.  Of these, some 750 have already been realised, with the balance due to be realised over the coming few years.  In addition, approximately 500 jobs at the centre have resulted from the transfer of existing operations into it.  To date, the peak number of construction jobs on the site was 1,000.  There is still an amount of construction to be completed and substantial employment on construction work will continue for some years.  Finally, a substantial, though unquantified, number of jobs, especially in legal and accounting firms, has been created in ancillary services in support of the 160 companies which have actually been approved to trade from the centre.</P>
      <P>Comprehensive and up to date data on employment growth in the wider financial services sector are not yet available. However, the information I have indicates that employment in that sector grew throughout the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>Despite difficulties which have faced the international financial services market in the recent past, I am pleased with the progress made by the centre which by any standards represents a major success for this country.  Dublin is now recognised increasingly as an important centre in international financial services and as we continue to develop this highly specialised market and results in terms of employment, trade and spin-off generally are bound to be excellent.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that sufficient safeguards will exist to prevent an increase in the trafficking of cocaine into Ireland in the aftermath of the harmonisation of laws and procedures related to the completion of the Internal Market post-1992.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>All aspects of drug misuse and measures to control trafficking in drugs at national and international level are dealt with in the &ldquo;Government's Strategy to Prevent Drug Misuse&rdquo;, which was launched by my colleague, the Minister for Health, last Monday.</P>
      <P>As regards the customs aspects of this issue, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no evidence of any substantial smuggling of cocaine at present.  Similarly, I am informed that the gardaí are also satisfied that there is no evidence of significant abuse of cocaine in the State.  The customs authorities are, however, fully alive to the danger that Ireland might, in future, be targeted by traffickers in cocaine, either as a supply point for the drug or as an entry point to Europe.</P>
      <P>At present, the Customs Service represent the first line of defence against the illegal importation of controlled drugs, including cocaine, and it will continue to have an important role after 1992.</P>
      <P>Although the completion of the Single Market will see the removal of the present system of customs controls between member states, some checks will, nevertheless, continue to be carried out on goods and persons at internal EC frontiers after 1992 in order to combat drugs smuggling.  In a declaration which it adopted in October 1990, the EC Council recognised that these checks must take account of the expectation of business and travellers for freedom of movement and must, therefore, be unobstrusive, selective and highly targeted on traffic of greatest risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC Council also noted in October 1990 that in order to meet the danger that <Col N="1995" /> illicit trafficking in goods such as drugs will take advantage of the open European Market after 1992, effective control proportionate to the risk must be ensured at a uniformly high technical standard at the Community's external frontier, and co-operation between Customs Services and with other law enforcement agencies must be further strengthened.</P>
    <P>On the customs front, intensive work is going on at present in order to meet these twin objectives.  An expert group setup by the heads of EC Customs Services &mdash; and on which the Revenue Commissioners are represented &mdash; are formulating an overall strategy to improve the effectiveness of customs control at the external frontier.  The group are also assessing the information needs of customs to support the fight against smuggling, as well as possible links with police and immigration information systems. Issues such as technical equipment needs as well as specialist training for customs staff are also under active consideration by the group.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the existing high level of co-operation and mutual assistance between the EC Customs Services to detect and combat drug smuggling will be enhanced.  Regular operations are also carried out by the Customs Services to monitor and exchange information on suspicious movements of air passengers and this monitoring activity is being extended to suspect air freight movements.</P>
    <P>As announced in the &ldquo;Government Strategy to Prevent Drug Abuse&rdquo;, the Revenue Commissioners are currently studying proposals for changes in the law to combat the practice of drug smuggling in the form of ingestion or concealment in body cavities.</P>
    <P>I might add that the Garda authorities are also very aware of the dangers of cocaine abuse and I refer the Deputy to the Official Report of 2 May 1991, Cols. 1989-95 in this regard.  In particular, I would like to point to the work of the TREVI Group in combating drug trafficking, including cocaine.</P>
    <P>A special working group was set up <Col N="1996" /> in 1989 to study the implications of the proposed removal of border controls within the EC at the end of 1992 and the action to be taken to deal with terrorism, illegal drug trafficking and international organised crime.  A programme of action was approved by TREVI Ministers at their meeting in Dublin in June 1990.  The programme of action includes specific measures designated to reinforce and build on existing co-operation in the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking, organised crime and illegal immigration.</P>
    <P>Work on the implementation of these measures is proceeding at an accelerated pace.  A sub-group of TREVI is concerned with organised crime, except terrorism, and is particularly involved in the fight against drug trafficking.  Some specific measures at present being considered by this group include: the setting up of a European Drugs Intelligence Unit, the provision of training for police officers from drug producing and transit countries, the extension of the network of drug liasion officers assigned to other member states and to third countries, and consideration of the measures necessary to strengthen controls at external frontiers before I Janaury 1993.</P>
    <P>I might add that the need to develop and co-ordinate effective measures against drugs was one of the twin themes of the TREVI Presidency held by Ireland in 1990.  The subsequent Italian and Luxembourg Presidencies have ensured that the subject of drugs continues to be kept to the fore.</P>
    <P>I am, accordingly, satisfied that all possible steps are being taken to deal with the problem of illicit drug trafficking, including cocaine trafficking, and that full account is being taken of the particular threats posed in this area by the Internal Market situation.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the legislative basis available to him which allowed him to make regulations in relation to food additives, ingredients, hygiene and various substances such as illegal hormones that are banned from use in food; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers exercised by me as Minister for Agriculture and Food in the areas referred to by the Deputy, are conferred on me by the following Acts:</P>
      <P>Dairy Produce Act, 1924;</P>
      <P>Creamery Act, 1928;</P>
      <P>Milk and Dairies Act, 1935;</P>
      <P>Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930;</P>
      <P>Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act, 1934;</P>
      <P>Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935;</P>
      <P>Abattoirs Act, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dairy Produce Act, 1924; The Creamery Act, 1928 and The Milk and Dairies Act, 1935 set out procedures for the regulation and control, including hygiene aspects, of (a) the production and sale of milk for human consumption and (b) the manufacture of dairy products.  Provision for the application of similar requirements in relation to the <Col N="2004" /> operation of meat export slaughter premises and bacon plants is contained in the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930 and the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935. The operational and hygiene standards applicable to abattoirs slaughtering for the domestic market are contained in regulations made under the Abattoirs Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing the European Communities Act, 1972 empowers me to make regulations, as and when required, for the purpose of implementing EC Directives relating to matters for which I am responsible.  The provisions of the various directives on hormones and residues of other veterinary drugs are being implemented by means of regulations made under that Act in 1988 and 1990.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health avails of a wide range of powers from a number of statutes to ensure control over food additives, ingredients and food hygiene.</P>
    <P>The statutory basis for control exercised by him over the use of food additives is to be found in a series of regulations made under the Health Acts, 1947-70 and the European Communities Act, 1972.  These regulations specify the additives which may be used in food and in some cases restrict the use of specified additives to certain foods up to specific limits.  They are regularly updated to take account of EC Directives.</P>
    <P>In addition the health Acts contain enabling powers for the making of regulations by the Minister for Health to prevent danger to the public health arising from the manufacture, distribution, importation or sale of food and for the making of compositional standards for foods which are of special importance to the public health.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2005" /> The Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950-1989, set out statutory requirements in relation to food hygiene and food premises. They prohibit the sale for human consumption of food which is diseased, contaminated or otherwise unfit for human consumption and provide for the seizure of unfit food and for its destruction. In addition, a scheme of registration of food premises by the health boards is provided for.  Premises registered by my Department under the Acts referred to earlier are exempt from these provisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health is also responsible for the Sale of Food and Drugs Act 1875 under which it is an offence to mix, colour, stain or powder any article of food with any ingredient or material so as to render the article injurious to health, with intent to sell the article in that state, or to sell to the prejudice of the purchaser any article of food which is not of the nature, substance and quality of the article demanded.</P>
    <P>In addition to the broad offences mentioned, the Acts also lay down minimum compositional criteria for milk and certain producers, e.g. cream and butter.</P>
    <P>The statutory controls are enforced by the health boards.  Each health board conducts planned food sampling programmes under which different foods are sampled and analysed on a regular basis for compliance with the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and the various regulations made under the Health Acts.  Where a sample is found not to comply with the law, the analysts issue a certificate on the basis of which prosecution proceedings may be taken by the health board.</P>

      <P>The forestry part of the rural development operational programme involves investments of some £10 million in the following EC approved initiatives: planned recreational forestry; co-operative farm forestry; demonstration farm forests; farm forestry consultations/planning; forest nurseries; and forestry training programmes.  The programme covers the period 1991 to 1993.</P>
      <P>The forestry funds under subprogramme 1 of the rural development operational programme have been earmarked for the above initiatives in agreement with the EC and cannot be used to subvent county councils for repairing rural roads.</P>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the condition of rural roads.  However, this is a matter for the local authorities and the Department of the Environment and £7.8 million has been provided for expenditure on rural roads, including roads serving forests, under subprogramme 3 of the rural development operational programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present conditions for entitlement to retirement and old age (contributory) pension require that a minimum number of contributions must be registered (paid or credited) on behalf <Col N="2008" /> of the claimant from the date of entry into fully insurable employment to the year prior to attaining pensionable age. A minimum yearly average of 24 contributions gives entitlement to the minimum rate of retirement pension.  In the case of old age (contributory) pension the minimum average is 20.</P>
      <P>I have introduced special arrangements for certain groups of people whose record of full insurance was insufficient to qualify for pension.  In October 1988, I provided <i>pro rata</i> pensions for persons with gaps in their insurance records caused by the operation of the former remuneration limit for social insurance.</P>
      <P>From November this year, <i>pro rata</i> pensions will be payable to persons with a mixture of full rate and modified rate social insurance who would otherwise fail to qualify for pension.</P>
      <P>The eligibility conditions for social welfare pensions generally are at present being examined by the National Pensions Board as part of their report on the development of a new national pensions system.  It is expected that this report will be completed this summer.  The contribution conditions for pensions, including the question of <i>pro rata</i> entitlements, will be addressed in that report.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of contributory old age pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from her year of entry into insurance, which ever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department's records show that <Col N="2009" /> the person concerned has a total of 693 reckonable contributions in the relevant period, which, in this case, is from 1953 to 1990.  This total is equivalent to a yearly average of 18 and is, therefore, not sufficient to qualify her for a contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>There is no provision within social welfare legislation to pay the person concerned a reduced rate pension based on her contribution record.</P>
    <P>The eligibility conditions for social welfare pensions generally are at present being examined by the National Pensions Board as part of its report on the development of a new national pensions system. It is expected that this report will be completed this summer.  The contribution conditions for pensions, including the question of <i>pro rata</i> entitlements, will be addressed in that report.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of invalidity pension from 18 July 1985 to 24 January 1990.  On 28 May 1990 an appeals officer decided that, because the person concerned had been working and not observing the rules of behaviour for receipt of invalidity pension, he was not entitled to payment for the period 9 July 1988 to 24 January 1990.  As a result, and overpayment amounting to £4,347 was assessed against him.  In addition, the credited contributions which had been awarded to him in respect of the period 9 July 1988 to 24 January 1990 were cancelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He claimed disability benefit again in November 1990.  His claim was incorrectly awarded as he had a total of only 14 <Col N="2010" /> credited contributions in respect of the 1988-1989 contribution year which governed his claim whereas he required at least 39 contributions in that year to qualify. Consequently, he did not qualify for payment of disability benefit from November 1990 onwards.  A letter explaining the position issued to him on 21 February 1991.  The Department did not seek recovery of the money paid in error from 30 November 1990 to 7 February 1991.</P>
    <P>Further medical evidence has now been submitted in respect of him covering the period from 9 July 1988 onwards. This further medical evidence has no relevance for the period from 9 July 1988, to 24 January 1990, for which it was decided by an appeals officer that the person concerned was working while claiming invalidity pension.  However, it is being accepted for disability benefit purposes for the period from 25 January 1990 onwards, which means that he is being awarded credited contributions for that period.  This does not enable him to qualify for payment because he has still less than 39 contributions in 1988-89 and in 1989-1990.  However his contribution record for 1990-91 will now be sufficient to enable him to qualify for disability benefit from the start of the new benefit year in January 1992 should he be incapable of work then.</P>

      <P>The legislative provisions governing means are contained in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, and in regulations.  The following are the main areas under which means are assessed:</P>
      <P>&mdash;cash income;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;the yearly value of property owned but not personally used or enjoyed, such as capital or house property <Col N="2011" /> or land not personally used by the applicant;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the yearly value of property used or enjoyed, such as a farm or business;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the value of income or property of which the person has deprived him/herself in order to qualify for pension or assistance or payment at a higher rate,</P>
    <P>&mdash;in the case of unemployment assistance, single woman's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance, the value of free board and lodging enjoyed by the applicant.</P>
    <P>While the criteria are broadly similar for all schemes there are nevertheless variations in the manner in which some of the components, principally capital and income from earnings are assessed.  For example the rules of means assessment in the case of widows, lone parents and the elderly are generally more favourable than the rules which apply in the case of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>This year's Social Welfare Act introduced means test improvements whereby income derived from casual employment as a home help is disregarded.  A minimum weekly payment of £5 was also introduced for unemployment assistance claimants whose current entitlement is less than £5 and whose only means is the yearly value of free board and lodging at home.  In addition income arising from the Haemophilia HIV Trust Fund is exempted in the assessment of means.</P>
    <P>The streamlining of means test arrangements could involve modifying some of the concessionary features of the means test which apply in some schemes. It could also require the easing of the more restrictive features of certain other schemes.  The issue, which requires careful consideration, involves significant costs and is currently under review in my Department.</P>

      <P>The payment of half-rate disability benefit for lone parents was discontinued for new claimants only, from January 1988.  No claimant who was in receipt of disability benefit at that time lost their entitlement.</P>
      <P>The half-rate payment was restored from April 1990 and is paid for a maximum of 15 months in respect of new claimants after that date.  There are currently some 2,820 lone parents in receipt of half-rate disability benefit.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the social insurance records of those affected is that while they were working they would have had contributions paid in the normal manner and this would have applied also during weeks of illness in respect of which they received salary from their employers.  Those who submitted medical certificates to the Department, although they were not entitled to disability benefit, were awarded credited contributions which would have ensured no interruption in their social insurance records.</P>

In <Col N="2018" /> 1988, I signed a new agreement with the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) which provided for significant improvements in the relevant compensation entitlements and procedures.  The agreement provides for extension of MIBI compensation to property damage arising on or after 31 December 1992.  This operative date was decided on to phase in the impact of MIBI compensation inprovements on motor insurers (who fund the MIBI) and, consequently, on premia paid by insured motorists and I have no proposals to modify it.</P>

The criteria governing eligibility for ESF funding are set out in detail in the documentation issued to the schools and colleges.  These concern the nature of the training (the course must equip trainees with the skills needed for one or more specific types of occupation in areas which support economic growth/good employment opportunities), the structure of the courses, and the category of trainee to be catered for.  The criteria will vary depending on whether the courses are third level or post-leaving certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Communities (Road Passenger Transport) Regulations, 1991 (S.I. No. 59 of 1991), which gave effect to <Col N="2027" /> Council Directive No. 89/438/EEC on the revised requirements for access to the occupation of road passenger transport operator, came into operation on 21 March 1991.  The main purpose of this directive is to ensure uniformity in meeting the access requirements throughout EC member states.  These requirements are good repute, appropriate financial standing and professional competence.</P>
      <P>The regulations apply to all undertakings entering the occupation of road passenger transport operator from 21 March 1991.  Those who held road passenger certificates before that date will also have to meet the revised requirements but they will have until 30 June 1991 to do so.</P>
      <P>Road passenger operators who were exempted from the requirements of the previous regulations by virtue of having a main occupation other than that of road passenger transport operator will now have to meet the requirements of the new regulations because it would be discriminatory if this exemption were continued.</P>
      <P>I understand that some persons are concerned in case they cannot meet the professional competence requirement by passing the relevant examination before 30 June 1991.  In such event, the requirement can be satisfied by the designation of the holder of a certificate of competence, who is of good repute, to continuously and effectively manage the road passenger transport business.</P>
