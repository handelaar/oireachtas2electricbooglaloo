      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, in respect of the business transacted by the House, if he will arrange for the Minister for Labour to convey in person both to the management of the ESB and to the representatives of the ESB workers now on strike, the united will of the House as expressed here last night?  Will the Taoiseach agree that under the Constitution it is the responsibility of the Government elected by the Dáil to convey on the Dáil's behalf that expression of opinion face to face, to those involved so they will realise how serious is the common intent of all of us here in the Dáil that this extremely damaging dispute be brought to an immediate end?</P>

      <P>It is not particularly in order but, having regard to the national emergency we have to contend with, I hesitate to rule it out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reinforce what has been said, and to request the Minister for Labour to take a personal interest.  Over the last number of years the Minister has adopted a high profile, intervening, quite ably, in industrial difficulties.  This is probably the biggest challenge to the country, and I urge the Taoiseach to encourage the Minister for Labour to intervene personally.  It would appear that with the present deadlock that is absolutely necessary.  Certainly the sounds coming out this morning show no progress has been made and I believe it is the duty of the Minister for Labour to personally meet both sides at this stage to try to bring them together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed this important matter to be adverted to, but I must dissuade my colleagues from attempting to debate the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not intend to debate the issue.  It is not something we can debate, but I think it is correct that we should all express our disappointment at the lack of progress and recognise the seriousness of the situation. It is evident that the pressures of the strike are affecting the negotiations and for that reason I would like to repeat the request to the unions to suspend the strike action and call off the pickets during the negotiations, without prejudice, if no result comes from the negotiations. I recognise that the Minister for <Col N="1163" /> Labour does not want to intervene until all the procedures have been gone through, but I hope he is taking a minute by minute interest in the proceedings and trying to hurry them along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect your ruling, Sir, and I will be very brief by way of reply.  First, I would like to recall that this House, speaking on behalf of all the people through their elected representatives here, yesterday evening called on the workers to resume normal working to enable the dispute to be resolved.  We are all very conscious of the hardship, loss and inconveniences and, indeed, the danger that prevails right through the country affecting all sections of our people and I think we are all convinced that nothing that is at issue in the strike justifies the enormity of what is happening economically, socially and in a humanitarian way throughout the country. I want to assure the House that the Government are in touch with the situation minute by minute.  The Minister for Labour in particular, his staff and people in different agencies are all experienced in this area, and all that experience is being brought to bear on this situation and that will continue to be done.  The Government, if necessary, are prepared to consider further measures.  The strike has been on for the three days now and I hope that some time during the day the message which has been conveyed to all the parties by this House will finally have effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Another matter perhaps, Deputy Bruton:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Taoiseach has just said and this is a personal intervention in this matter which is something new&mdash;I agree with everything he said in regard to the responsibility on all concerned, in particular those who have decided to go on strike, to bring that strike to an end.  However that agreement in no way mitigates the blame that lies on the Government for their negligence for allowing themselves and the <Col N="1164" /> statutory bodies responsible to them to be caught unawares by this development. However, that is something to be discussed another day and should not in any sense take from the unanimity of this House in calling for a resumption of normal working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject any suggestion of negligence on the part of the Government. I deplore that in spite of the co-operative all-party attitude which prevails in this House Deputy Bruton saw fit to make that remark.</P>

      <P>The most startling aspect of this year's budget was the admission by the Minister that unemployment would increase to an average of 228,000 in 1991.  It would appear that, after the publication of the March figures, the Minister will have to revise his estimate dramatically upwards.  I find it extraordinary that the Minister, in the Finance Bill, makes no effort whatsoever to redress the spiralling growth of unemployment, rapidly approaching a figure of 250,000 and which could well be in the region of 300,000 by December 1991.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years our unemployment figures have been artificially depressed by the extraordinarily high level of emigration, particularly to Britain.  Recent economic forecasts across the water are alarming and have a strong bearing on our economic prospects particularly on our rates of unemployment. A survey recently undertaken by the Confederation of British Industry showed that prospects for manufacturing output and employment are the worst since the recession of 1981.  Manufacturing investment is expected to fall by 16 per cent this year.  In addition, it is forecast that 90,000 manufacturing jobs will be lost over the first six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> The outlook for the services sector is no better.  The London Chamber of Commerce predict rising unemployment in this sector, also in accordance with their recent survey.  Obviously Britain will allow unemployment to increase as a means of dampening demand to reduce their inflation figures.  This gloomy outlook will have serious repercussions on our future.  Our high levels of emigration to Britain will ease, with a corresponding increase in our levels of unemployment, but with its attendant range of social evils.  Our Government appear to have a fatalistic attitude to the problem.  They appear to think that creating the right economic climate, in time, will solve the problem, which process will have an incremental effect only and make no major impact on the figures.</P>
    <P>The recent data on the 1990 school leavers are quite alarming showing that nearly 17,000 had either emigrated or were unemployed a year after leaving school, representing 25 per cent of that year's school leavers.  Recent figures show a 23 per cent unemployment rate within the under-25 age group.  I might remind the Minister that is one of the highest within the EC.  I might add that, but for the high rate of emigration within that age group, that figure would be considerably higher.  In the light of that information I request the Minister and the Taoiseach &mdash; this is a repetition of a request I made in the course of my contribution to the budget debate &mdash; to assemble immediately an all-party committee on unemployment involving the social partners, representatives of the unemployed as well as the Conference of Major Religious Superiors.  A fresh, radical approach to this awful problem is warranted before irreversible damage is done to the social fabric of our society. Government response to date has been one of no interest, of allowing economic indicators to dictate their policy on jobs.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer specifically to tax relief and higher education grants.  I am most disappointed that this problem has not been addressed in the Finance Bill. Despite several promises by the Minister <Col N="1172" /> for Education there is no provision in the Bill of any tax relief for parents who must pay for their children's third-level education.  The increasing cost of maintaining students at universities and other colleges is causing severe financial hardship to many parents.  The burden on parents of middle income families who are maintaining students away from home has become intolerable.  For example, a family with three dependent children, whose income is in excess of £15,400 per annum, receive no help whatsoever. Parents who are not entitled to fee subvention or maintenance grants are subjected to enormous financial pressure and, in many cases, must forego their life savings or resort to second mortgages or loans in order to send their children to university or college.  In the main these are middle aged parents who have worked hard over 20 to 25 years and made substantial tax contributions to the State over those years.</P>
    <P>The financial burden on parents is particularly severe when students are required to live away from home in order to pursue their third level studies.  I might give one example of such burden, that of a family in Kerry with three children in receipt of an annual income of £15,400. The oldest child of that family is attending a degree course at the University of Limerick. The course fee amounts to £1,500, the cost of maintenance, books, travel and so on is in the region of £3,500, amounting to a total cost on the parents for one year's education of that child of £5,000.  That cost may be reduced in subsequent years to £4,000, if the student concerned can earn £1,000 by engaging in summer work leaving the total cost to the parents over the four year course in the region of £17,000.  Their financial burden is quite alarming as those costs must be met from income after payment of income tax, mortgage repayments, life assurance premia, VHI contributions, service charges and the other routine costs involved in rearing and maintaining a family.  If two children from such a a family wish to attend college the position becomes almost impossible.</P>
    <P>Many families in that position must <Col N="1173" /> forego the opportunity of a university education for their children and instead, send them to regional technical colleges or to courses at the Dublin Institute of Technology where they can avail of ESF funding.  This is done despite the fact that those children have the ability, aptitude and motivation to attend university.  This trend places additional pressures on regional colleges, in turn leading to an increase in their entry requirements.</P>

      <P>I should like to compare the position of, say, a Kerry family with a similar family living in Newry in Northern Ireland.  Were a child from the Newry family to attend a university course he or she would receive the following annual benefits: course fee, £1,500 and maintenance grant, £2,265 which means that the total benefit to the family would be in the region of £3,765.  Whereas the corresponding Kerry family face an annual outlay of £4,000, the Newry family <Col N="1174" /> receive £3,765.  It is quite obvious from that comparison that the student grant system, and support for families in meeting higher education costs, is infinitely better in Northern Ireland than in the South.  Clearly our education grants system needs a radical review.</P>

      <P>First, we should allow parents to offset course fees against their tax liability at the standard rate.  Second, we should revise the grant scheme immediately so that eligibility for fees and maintenance is assessed on residual income as in the case of Northern Ireland.  In the Republic eligibility is assessed on reckonable income which is gross income less superannuation contributions.  Residual income is gross less payment of mortgage interests, payment to pension schemes and superannuation and half the amount of life assurance premia.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be putting down amendments on Committee Stage to put those proposals into effect.  I welcome the improvement in the tax bands for PAYE workers and the self-employed. I compliment the Government on this <Col N="1175" /> achievement.  It is probably their major achievement since they took office.  Certainly we have a long way to go as regards introducing an equitable tax system but this Government are moving in the right direction.  However, I would like to refer briefly to income tax on farming and to certain anomalies that appear in the Bill. For example, section 23 provides that expenditure on pollution control, in order to qualify for accelerated capital allowances, must be incurred before 1 April 1993.  The scheme of investment aid for the control of farmyard pollution is a five year programme ending on 31 December 1993.  While no final dates have been fixed by the Department of Agriculture and Food for approval and completion of grant-aided works it is certain that farmers will have all or most of 1993 to complete grant-aided work under this scheme.  I suggest, and perhaps a note will be taken of this, that section 23 be amended to read &ldquo;31 December 1993&rdquo; as the latest date for incurring qualifying expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new EC milk hygiene regulations will require substantial new investment on some farms.  The Government have agreed under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that a submission for EC grant aid will be lodged. The nature of the investment required under the new EC regulations is similar to expenditure necessitated for pollution control measures.  Therefore, the provisions to give effect to the 50 per cent accellerated allowance relief should extend to expenditure incurred in upgrading dairy farm facilities as required by the new EC regulations.  For a family farm with a taxable income the non-availability of the expenditure on extra quotas, as a deductible expense, results in many cases in farmers having an income, for tax purposes, in excess of the low income exemption threshold.  Where marginal relief applies the farmer will have incurred 52 per cent tax on income and will then have to pay for the extra quota out of his after-tax income.  I suggest to the Minister that he consider a <Col N="1176" /> provision in this Bill to allow expenditure on extra quotas as a deductible expense.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to capital acquisitions tax.  I welcome the improvement suggested in section 104 in relation to capital acquisitions tax.  However, the whole area of capital acquisitions tax and stamp duty should be reviewed especially in relation to the transfer of the family farm.  I suggest that the transfer of a typical family farm from father to son or daughter should be exempt from capital acquisitions tax.  Also, the high level of stamp duty is a major obstacle to the transfer of farms and to land mobility in general.  Stamp duty should be abolished for the transfer of farms to young people under the age of 35 years and who have the green certificate.  If this is not possible, and if it would result in the loss of too much income for the Exchequer, we should at least, go back to the 1 per cent stamp duty level which operated prior to 1982.</P>
    <P>I would point out that many farmers are unable to transfer their farms to their family at present because of the imposition of a cruel system of capital acquisitions tax and stamp duty.  As a result farms are not being passed on to sons or daughters who, in many cases, are better motivated and willing to work hard on the family farm for life.  If the farms are not passed on to them early in life they lose their motivation and interest and, in many cases, leave farming.  It is very important for the continuation of the family farm in Ireland that capital acquisitions tax and stamp duty be reviewed. We are very anxious to keep young people on the family farm.  This is a major obstacle and it must be faced.  A number of farmers either have to sell parts or borrow large sums of money from the banks to pay capital acquisitions tax and stamp duty.  This money could go into developing the farm and family settlements. The bottom line is that if one wants to transfer one's farm, one has to go into debt.  That is probably the greatest disincentive of all.</P>
    <P>A number of farm organisations have <Col N="1177" /> sought to have the special PAYE allowance extended to farmers.  I am disappointed that the Government have not seen fit to do this to date.  However, if it is not possible to do this I call on the Minister to raise the lower income threshold for farmers and self-employed people to compensate for the non-availability of the special PAYE allowance to this sector.  That would be a major boost especially for the smaller farmer.  At a time when small farmers are being forced off the land or to surrender their milk quotas we should not put any additional impositions on them.  Unfortunately, the imposition of taxation on lower income farmers is another major obstacle to farmers continuing on the land.  Indeed, it is a major disincentive.  Farmers want to pay tax, they know they have to pay tax, they are responsible people but if we are to keep the small farmer on the land we must have an acceptable tax regime. I suggest that the lower income threshold be raised to compensate for the absence of the special PAYE allowance for this sector.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred in detail to the proposed urban renewal scheme for the Temple Bar area in Dublin.  I welcome that announcement.  If this part of Dublin is improved and upgraded it will enhance the appearance of the city.  My experience from travelling around several cities in Europe and the US is that inner Dublin has much to offer but unfortunately it is in continual decline.  If we want to attract tourists into that city we must make it more attractive and we must have clean street scapes.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Minister, and the Government, that there has been positive discrimination towards the major urban centres in regard to the urban renewal scheme.  I am disappointed that larger provincial towns have not benefited from this scheme to date.  Indeed, in my own county of Kerry only a small portion of Tralee has benefited.  Vast parts of the town, formerly the business centre, are left to decay due to the absence of urban renewal type incentives. Also 19th century towns like Castleisland and Listowel could benefit <Col N="1178" /> considerably from this scheme or some form of it.  It may not give the same tax reliefs in the major urban areas but there should be some incentive for urban renewal in these towns.  At a time when we are talking about peripherality and trying to keep people in the west and outside Dublin, I am disappointed that this obvious discrimination exists.  I suggest that consideration should be given to extending the scheme, maybe in a different form, to more centres throughout the country so that they can benefit from it.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to a matter I did not mention when addressing the problem of unemployment, that is, the social employment schemes which are the responsibility of the Minister present.  At the moment in Kerry over 100 schemes with the potential of employing over 300 people are held up in the Department of Labour.  They should be released as soon as possible and funds provided so that the 320 people or so who could benefit can be taken off the dole queues.</P>
    <P>Overall, the introduction of this Finance Bill is not really a major event. There is very little new in the Bill apart from the proposal for the Temple Bar area and the revision of the BES proposed in the budget.  No effort is made in the Bill to address the spiralling growth of unemployment despite the fact that the Minister admitted to that growth in his budget speech.  I had expected that there would be some incentive, perhaps in the form of tax relief, for employers to take on more people.</P>
    <P>Basically the Finance Bill is, as the Minister said in the past &ldquo;steady as we go; do not get too excited about the spiralling levels of unemployment.&rdquo;  The hope is that because our macro-economy looks all right at the moment this in turn will create the climate for job creation.  Personally I feel this is not going to happen and at the end of this year we will have a major problem in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very substantial Bill and one about which we could talk at great <Col N="1179" /> length, but given the time available I will just deal with a few issues.</P>
      <P>The Government's economic strategy set out in the 1987 <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> laid the groundwork for the exceptional performance of the Irish economy in the period since then. The new measures agreed with the social partners in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will further consolidate and build on the progress made to date.  The pace and extent of our economic recovery is a tribute to the workers of Ireland.  Through pay restraint they have lowered inflation and paved the way for the general upturn in the economy and for the increase in employment. Living standards have improved as a result and successive income tax reductions have significantly increased real take-home pay.  High nominal pay increases mean nothing when they are outpaced by inflation.  The spiral of rising prices which so harassed people trying to manage family budgets is now ended.</P>
      <P>On the business front, our performance in fostering further investment and employment growth has outstripped that of our nearest neighbour.  Inflation now stands at 2.6 per cent, and is continuing to decline.  This compares with over 8 per cent in the UK.  Wage inflation is less than 5 per cent against 9.25 per cent in the UK.  Interest rates here have fallen to 10.75 per cent so that costs to business here of raising finance are considerably less than that of their British counterparts, where the interest rate is in excess of 12 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now had four years of growth, averaging 4 per cent.  Our objective is to continue that growth.  Low rates of interest and inflation, and a stable exchange rate will maintain a high rate of investment and these must be our priorities.  Even in this most difficult year we will maintain a growth rate of 2.25 per cent while most economies are in recession.  Ireland is now seen internationally as an attractive investment location.  The US Department of Commerce has recently identified Ireland as the most profitable location in Europe. <Col N="1180" /> Their experience is that the average rate of return of US companies in Ireland is four times the EC average.  The measures in this Finance Bill will enhance our position. Foreign industry can invest here in the knowledge that they are gaining access to an economic market of 340 million people, which will provide a high rate of return on capital.  The 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for manufacturing industry which has been extended to the year 2010 compares with an average rate of 39 per cent in the EC.</P>
    <P>We are well placed because of our greatly improved economic standing to receive a major inflow of new investment. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will attract this investment by creating a stable environment in which industry can prosper.  Industry needs to prosper and we need the extra jobs. Apart from the international dimension, this Bill contains a number of measures to support community based job creation projects.  Section 34 of the Bill relaxes the conditions under which dividends received by companies in the State from their foreign subsidiaries are relieved from corporation tax.  This measure is specifically designed to enhance job creation.</P>
    <P>Section 33 of the Finance Bill extends to 31 March 1992, the period during which a donation to the Trust for Community Initiatives made by a company may be treated for tax purposes as a trading expense.  The trust provides startup capital for projects which will create jobs in areas of high unemployment.  It is of great benefit to those who may have a good idea for job creation but who do not have the equity or track record which a bank or lending institution would require before providing funding.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the area-based strategy for the long term unemployed. Our response to the problem of long term unemployment outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> may well come to be recognised as one of the most fundamental changes brought about by the programme.  We are establishing a new integrated partnership between the local community and public <Col N="1181" /> agencies to remedy the social deprivation that exists in many black spot areas of high unemployment.  This strategy will ensure that the long term unemployed have the opportunity of training, work experience and second chance education leading to qualifications and, therefore, a greater real possibility of a job. Arrangements are now well in hand to give effect to the proposals.  Twelve pilot locations have been selected: Dublin inner city, Tallaght, Coolock-Darndale, Finglas, Ballymun, Cork north city, Limerick city, Dundalk, north Mayo, south Kerry, west Waterford and south-west Wexford.  Local companies limited by guarantee, will be established to co-ordinate the response in the pilot areas.  The companies will be representative of local community interests, public agencies and social partners.  It is intended that the local companies will be operational at the beginning of May.  In many ways the strategy mirrors that of the nationwide Community Development Programme which we introduced in 1990.  Under that programme grants are being made to locally based projects to equip and staff resource centres.  These are a focal point for community development in disadvantaged urban and rural areas.  The expertise gained by local interests in community development will ensure the successful implementation of the new strategy.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains important new measures to improve the financial position of pensioners and to help the bereaved.  A special allowance is being introduced to help families financially at a time of bereavement.  This will apply to widowed parents and qualifying children who are bereaved on or after 6 April 1991.  The allowance, which will apply for three years, will be: £1,500 in the first year; £1,000 in the second year; and £500 in the third year.  In addition, I introduced a new measure this year to give families on social welfare financial help at a time of bereavement.  Under the new Social Welfare Act, we will pay the full social welfare payment for six weeks after the death of a spouse or child.  These are two <Col N="1182" /> important measures, one in relation to tax and the other to social welfare.</P>
    <P>The extension of the adult dependant payments will apply to all those in receipt of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short and long term unemployment assistance, injury benefit and supplementary welfare allowance.  The six weeks extension of the child dependant allowance will apply to all short and long term social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that a person aged 55 years or more who inherits a house or part of a house from a brother or sister will be entitled to a special relief from inheritance tax if they have lived in the house for five years prior to the owner's death.  The effect of this relief will be to reduce the survivor's liability for capital acquisitions tax.  For taxation purposes only, the value of the house will be reduced by 50 per cent or £50,000, whichever is less.  This provision does not affect the real market value of the house.</P>
    <P>Dwellings with a market value up to £43,000 will be completely exempted from capital acquisitions tax.  There will be tax savings where the value is above the figure.  Where a half share of the house inherited, no capital acquisitions tax will arise where its market value does not exceed £86,000.  These are very important measures for pensioners and those aged 55 years or more.</P>
    <P>Suitable housing for elderly people and the provision of options for people who, because of their age are no longer comfortable at home, are issues which I have taken up in my capacity as Minister for Social Welfare.  Many elderly persons are living in houses which have been their homes for many years, but which are no longer suited to their needs and which they are no longer in a position to maintain. Although they may be able to find alternative accommodation which is more suited to their needs or have the opportunity to avail of sheltered housing, they face the dilemma that, if they sell their homes, they may lose all or part of their old age pensions.  This arises because the capital realised on the sale of the house will fall to be assessed as <Col N="1183" /> means under the rules for assessing capital for non-contributory pension purposes. Faced with this situation many elderly persons may hold on to their homes, perhaps eventually ending up in hospital or in institutionalised care instead of living out their lives in comfortable circumstances in the community.</P>
    <P>Next month I will make regulations exempting the proceeds from the sale of a pensioner's home in such circumstances from the means test.  The necessary discussions with the Department of Health and Environment are now completed.</P>
    <P>In recent years the range of benefits for pensioners has grown enormously. There are a myriad of schemes and fringe benefits now available to retired people. Deputies will be familiar with the free travel, free electricity scheme and free TV licence, but there are also a range of tax benefits and health board and local authority schemes for pensioners.  We are recognised as a people for the extent of our commitment to providing for the elderly. This is a reflection of the priorities set by the Irish people.  As we move into the new society of the nineties we plan to ensure that retired workers will continue to be a priority.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that pensioners are fully taking up all that they are entitled to and indeed they should also be encouraged to arrange their affairs to ensure that they maximise their entitlements. I am now making arrangements to introduce a specialist information and advice service for pensioners.  We make payments to over 310,000 pensioners each week.  Our expenditure on pensions is running at £950 million a year or 33 per cent of the total social welfare budget. The new service will help pensioners to improve their standard of living in retirement by assisting them to maximise the benefits to them under State and other services.</P>
    <P>Pensioners are known to be the most assiduous of savers but many people do not make the most of their savings because they do not fully understand how the means tests or the tax system work. In some cases pensioners have been <Col N="1184" /> known to put themselves at risk of robbery because they are afraid to lodge their money in a financial institution.  The new service is intended to dispel such fears.  The emphasis will be on encouraging people to apply for all their entitlements and to arrange their affairs to suit their own situation.</P>
    <P>The pensioners' advice service will in particular: explain basic entitlements and how they are affected by savings/ investments and assets such as property; explain <i>pro-rata</i> pensions and pensions for people who worked outside Ireland; provide basic tax information affecting pensioners; explain what type of expert financial information is available from outside agencies; and provide information and referral for advice, if required, on household budgeting and money management.  It will not recommend particular investments or institutions or make investment for pensioners.  Neither will it recommend particular courses of action to pensioners but will provide the information on which decisions can be made.</P>
    <P>We have already extended the range of information on social welfare topics of particular interest to pensioners.  An information leaflet about savings introduced a few years ago was very well received.  Our most recent guide, which deals with occupational pensions, is being reprinted because of high demand.  It was a total sell out.</P>
    <P>The new service will co-ordinate all the existing information available for pensioners. It will identify particular financial issues of importance to pensioners.  For example, the effects of disposing of assets such as a smallholding or savings or a private house are topics of concern to many people as they get older and cannot manage.</P>
    <P>This service will give pensioners the confidence to make the best use of their savings for their own benefit by reassuring them about their entitlements, dispelling any misunderstandings about the effects of savings on entitlements and providing practical information about where they can go for advice about their savings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> New technology has made possible major improvements in the way in which information can be disseminated but older people can benefit greatly from a highly personalised face-to-face service. Developments such as pensions for former emigrants under reciprocal agreements with countries outside the EC or changes in the means test which allow the sale of a private house to be disregarded in certain circumstances can best be explained at personal interviews.</P>
    <P>The new service will be locally based within my Department's information service but with a headquarters-based coordinator who will specialise in financial issues affecting pensioners.  The new service will be piloted in a number of centres around the country.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that we are localising our services to the greatest extent possible while at the same time introducing the most modern technology. As part of this development we hope to give a better service locally and one of the groups that will particularly benefit from this is the pensioners.</P>
    <P>Occupational pensions have an increasingly important role in supplementing the incomes of retired people.  Last December I formally set up the Pensions Board to supervise the implementation of the Pensions Act, 1990.  Deputies will be glad to know that it is making rapid progress with its work and with the recruitment of staff.  The Act provides that the administrative expenses of the board are to be financed in full by fees payable by occupational pension schemes.  It is my intention and that of the Government that the fees should be used only for the purpose of meeting necessary administrative expenses.  I have made it clear to the board that we want to keep the expenses to what is necessary so that the charges are minimal.</P>
    <P>The fees will be collected by the Board itself and the whole procedure will be entirely separated from my own Department's financial arrangements.  I have asked the board, as a priority, to advise me on the level of fee and the basis for <Col N="1186" /> levying it.  I expect to receive their recommendations within the next two weeks.  I will then be in a position to make an announcement on the matter so that schemes will have adequate notice to enable them to make the necessary financial provision.  The board intends to have arrangements for the registration of schemes and the collection of fees in place by September at the latest.</P>
    <P>As the Board has been established as a body corporate it would in the normal course be subject to corporation tax. However, this would in effect give rise to a form of double taxation.  Schemes would be required under the Pensions Act to pay fees to finance the board's activities.  There could then be a liability on the board to pay corporation tax on any surplus of fee income at year end. This surplus could instead be used to reduce the fees payable the following year.  I am pleased to say that specific provision has been made in section 35 of this Finance Bill to exempt the Pensions Board from corporation tax.  This is a clear indication to employers and employees, who finance occupational pension schemes, that the Government have no intention of imposing any additional burdens on schemes over and above what is required to finance the essential administrative expenses of the Pensions Board.</P>
    <P>This Government's policy of decentralising Civil Service functions has been a major success.  It provides a welcome boost for local economies and increases the demand for housing, goods and services in the areas concerned.  This in turn leads to the creation of jobs.  My own Department have played a major part in that process through the relocation of the Pensions Services Office to Sligo in 1989 and the recent transfer of Child Benefit and Treatment Benefits Sections to Letterkenny. There are now over three hundred and fifty Social Welfare staff in the Pensions Services Office in Sligo.  Salaries alone will inject over £2.7 million per annum into the local economy of Sligo town and surrounding regions of south Donegal, Mayo and Leitrim.  The relocation of 172 staff of my Department to <Col N="1187" /> Letterkenny has increased the income of the town and its environs by £1.8 million annually.  Almost half the junior staff involved in both moves were recruited locally.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank and congratulate management, staff and unions on the smooth and professional transfer of these major functions to Sligo and Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>While continuing our strategy of sound economic management we are also making substantial progress, despite international uncertainties, in key areas like the reduction of taxes, greater social equity and welfare improvements.  The improvement in the public finances achieved under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> made possible substantial income tax reductions and increases in social welfare payments. These increases were ahead of the rate of inflation each year.</P>
    <P>In my travels in other countries, seeing their economic depression, even if it is only mild depression at this stage, they are very envious of what has been achieved by the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> here and of the prospects for the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> As a result those at work and those who depend on social welfare and their families gained in real terms over the last three years.  This contrasted sharply with the period prior to 1987 when most people lost out.  We recognise that those on social welfare benefits, particularly those with large families, deserve as our economy grows to share in the rising living standards of the community as a whole.  The social welfare commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will ensure that that objective is met.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister for Finance has got the balance right in this Finance Bill.  In addition to keeping the economy on the sound path which the partners in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> have set out, the Bill takes some of the first steps to implement improvements. This Bill begins that and will deliver what we all want to see, that is, employment for the many returning <Col N="1188" /> emigrants &mdash; because there are thousands of emigrants returning to Ireland at this time and depending on Ireland for their future.  There are thousands of people unemployed who likewise depend on us. I have pleasure in commending this Bill to the House as a very important instrument in the overall strategy.</P>

      <P>I want to highlight some of the problems experienced by people who give employment and bring revenue into the Exchequer.  I should like to highlight difficulties some employers face.  One man who came to me to talk about his problems had learned his skills in England at no expense to this country, had come back and given of his time, energy and money to provide employment here.  This man who is doing major work for a semi-State company has to pay his PRSI and PAYE contributions at the end of every month.  Yet, for some strange reason, the semi-State company he is working for think it is in order to pay him for his work at the end of three months.  When this man was subjected to rat-a-tats from the Revenue Commissioners about the delay in the payment of his contributions he had to borrow £100,000 to keep the sheriff off his back.  This should not be allowed to happen.</P>
      <P>I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister asking him if he would compel semi-State companies to pay such people on time.  If there is a rule that employers have to pay their contributions at the end of every month why do semi-State companies, who are an arm of the Government, not have to pay these people every month also?  Why should legitimate traders who have a good record find sheriffs at their doors while cowboy outfits who charge cheap prices and employ people who are on the dole do not?  While some of those cowboy outfits have met their comeuppance, many more owe the Revenue Commissioners a fortune.  There should be a much more flexible arrangement for the payment of PRSI and PAYE contributions by employers.  It is crazy that the first option of the Revenue Commissioners is to send out a sheriff once employers are late in paying their contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the problems being <Col N="1190" /> experienced by an employer who works for a very important company who are in the news at present.  This company have decided that the handiest way to pay their bills is when the job is completed.  This man is in the same position as the man to whom I referred previously but he did not have to borrow money from the bank. However, because he was late in making his contributions for two months he got bills for £345 and £575 for interest on late payments of PAYE and PRSI.  The company for which this man worked only paid him when the job was almost completed and he had to borrow money to pay the Revenue Commissioners.  That man was due a repayment on VAT from the Revenue Commissioners and it was not paid on time.  However, he got no interest on the money he was due.</P>
    <P>It is a contradiction if an employer who is a little late in paying his PAYE and PRSI contributions at the end of the month should have to pay interest on what he owes to the Government while they do not have to pay interest on what they owe him in VAT repayments.  Even though the Revenue Commissioners were about six months behind in making this repayment on VAT to this man, he will get no interest on the money he was owed.  To use another seanfhocal, what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander in these days of equality.  I ask the Minister to look at the inequities of this system where interest can be charged on the amount owed by an employer when he is late in making his payments while the Revenue Commissioners do not have to pay interest if they are late in making refunds.  While I am not blaming the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; we make the rules &mdash; they could be a little more flexible and not send out sheriffs straight away, which seems to be the easy option.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another factor which is of concern to employers.  The Revenue Commissioners seem to have a very poor record in transferring money which is paid.  The man to whom I referred earlier paid his money through the bank in February but last week he received a letter which said that a sheriff would call on him if he did not pay this money.  It is <Col N="1191" /> absurd that this can happen in the computer age.</P>
    <P>I too was a ciaróg when I employed one person for a fortnight in June 1989. As I learned very quickly, the frustration experienced by employers is enough to drive them out of business.  I had more forms to fill in than Michael Smurfit. When I explained to the Revenue Commissioners that I only wanted to employ this person for a fortnight they accepted this and said I would be cut off by the computer on 30 June 1989.  However, for some strange reason, the computer must have got a flu &mdash; it did not take that message.  I then received another form asking me about my returns, the number of people I employed, what I paid them and so on.  I again explained the position to them and they apologised.  However, when I returned home last week I found a note from a tax inspector from Kilkenny who said he had called and would be grateful if I would ring him.  When I rang this man I kept as calm as I could and informed him that I had already cleared up the matter.  Perhaps that man had to call to bigger fish in my area then me but there is something wrong when such mistakes can occur at that level.</P>
    <P>There is so much red tape here that we are getting tied up in knots.  I should like to compliment the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, who is present in the House for getting rid of much of the red tape he inherited and for simplifying the social welfare system.  It might be no harm if one of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers was given a new post of &ldquo;Minister for Cutting Our Red Tape&rdquo;. People are frustrated with all the red tape.  I know a widow who had enough trouble after the death of her husband without having to worry about receipts for an extension which had been built to her house.  She had no interest in this matter.  Because she does not have any VAT receipts, neither hell nor high water will enable her to get her a grant for this work, even with the help of the Ombudsman. It is obvious the house was built and the extension added on &mdash; an inspector has only to visit the house to see this. <Col N="1192" /> Houses down the country, do not grow overnight like mushrooms, materials have to be bought and the houses have to be built.  A Minister who would have responsibility for cutting out much of this red tape could do a marvellous job.  The Minister for Finance should look at the workings of the Revenue Commissioners, simplify the system and give them a human touch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Perhaps they could send people other than sheriffs out to talk to people who owe them money.  It is ironic that the cowboy operators can cod Revenue and go into liquidation while legitimate traders cannot.  I know of a genuine firm who had to compete with a cowboy operation which went to the wall.  The Revenue Commissioners were hounding that cowboy operation for a much bigger sum than they were hounding my client for.  I do not know where the balance lies.  I accept that the Revenue Commissioners have to chase the money but they should be able to ask firms what is wrong when they are late in making their monthly payments instead of using the mallet straight away.  I know a businessman who was wondering if he should sell his business and live happily ever after.  A balance has to be struck so that we do not drive people who are carrying risks and giving employment around the bend and cause them to give up their ventures.</P>
      <P>As I said, things are not what they might seem.  In his speech the Minister forecast economic growth of 2.5 per cent. I am not so sure that that target will be reached.  In my town for the first time in a long time workers are being let go.  It is a sign of the times.  From talking to business people I know that things are not going as well as the PR of this Government maintains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few days ago I had a chat with a business man who employs about 150 people.  It is a good company competing in Europe but he told me that the last six months had been very bad.  I know there <Col N="1193" /> is deflation in Europe but I will be very surprised if we can continue having growth here because all the signs are that we are slowing down.  When we see long established firms letting workers go simply because they no longer have the market, we are slightly in trouble and &ldquo;ní mar síltear bítear&rdquo;.  As William Shakespear said &ldquo;There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.&rdquo;  The Minister projects a great image of confidence and that is good for the nation, I suppose, but there must be realism at the back of it.  Perhaps we will be able to compete, but it is doubtful.</P>
    <P>Education is one of those areas in life where many people who should know better think it is a luxury that we could do without and that because they cannot see something like a box or a motor car at the end of the day, nothing has happened. The Minister for Finance must deal with all Departments but I appeal to him to seriously consider the importance of employing remedial teachers in all areas of school life, particularly at primary level because a good start is very important. Career guidance teachers are very important at second level.  Students are in a dilemma about what subjects they should choose and what they should put on their CAO form.  Career guidance teachers could help here; they are a very important part of school life.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education will say that her budget is the biggest ever for education, but if one takes inflation and normal wage increases into account the budget must increase every year.  The increase might not make an improvement but might simply be maintaining the <i>status quo.</i> The present dilemma with the ESB strike will be only chicken feed compared to the result if teachers get frustrated and work to rule, that is, not doing unpaid work in relation to games, concerts and so on.  If teachers decide to do only what they are paid for, the country will suffer.  In the long run teachers are the unseen and often unappreciated moulders of posterity.  We cannot compensate somebody for that sort of work. In Finance Bills, education should be <Col N="1194" /> seen for what it is &mdash; an invisible asset but a very practical and necessary asset.</P>
    <P>We have make believe about emigration and unemployment.  Our unemployment figures were going nicely when people were ignoring the fact that emigration figures were soaring.  If at the end of March we have 242,800 people unemployed, it is nothing short of scandalous.  That is an increase of 10,000 since the budget was introduced two months ago.  One of the reasons given for this rise in unemployment is that emigration stopped and the people who came home at Christmas did not return abroad to oblige us.</P>
    <P>No amount of bluffing will get away from the fact that we are not making any impact on unemployment although it is a major problem on which we must impact. The figures projected are not even correct. There is a new scheme where people over the age of 58 are not registered any more on the unemployment register.  We have a figure for emigration which could be up to 40,000.  If those figures were taken into account we would be heading for a figure of 300,000 unemployed, and that is just not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the Government's overall economic strategy and said that it was based on lower public borrowing, improved competitiveness, strict adherence to our obligations and so on and that these in turn resulted in higher unemployment and a rate of economic growth which is one of the highest in the EC.  I am always fascinated by these figures.  They seem to come out of nowhere.</P>
    <P>The labour force survey was carried out very casually.  There has been a gradual tightening up in this labour force survey.  I am talking from experience. They suddenly found that there were far more people employed than heretofore, just because the collection of statistics became more efficient.  I have very serious doubts about the figures of rising employment we get from Ministers every so often.  Why is there a rise in unemployment if we have such massive emigration and jobs are being created?  This <Col N="1195" /> is another piece of make believe, another bit of PR.</P>
    <P>The Minister said our policy on improving benefits for those on social welfare was being maintained.  A percentage has been given that will nearly keep up with inflation, if we do not include the VAT increases and so on. Deputy J. O'Keeffe introduced an excellent carer's allowance on foot of an amendment to last year's Finance Bill. This is an allowance that should be given to those who are looking after the elderly. Who can get it?  It is beautiful concept. The other day I visited a woman whose husband works very hard for £80 a week, she looks after her sister and brother who are both mentally handicapped.  This woman was turned down for the carer's allowance, although the two people she is looking after should be in hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say the policy of improving benefits for those on social welfare is being maintained, but the position is twice as bad.  The carer's allowance was used as a propaganda exercise last year from January to October when the application forms became available.  The Minister on my own local radio told us about the carer's allowance and I was worn out with people asking me how to get it.  The scheme was announced in January but the forms did not arrive until October.  The Government got almost 12 months' propaganda from it and then, when it came into play, the numbers who could benefit were minimal.  That is a pity.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister reaffirmed our medium term objective of progressively reducing the debt/GNP ratio towards 100 per cent by 1993.  If, at this stage, we have borrowed £39 million over the projected full year's borrowing, that poses a question which even a confident Minister might have to face.  If we borrowed £499 million in the first three months and we expect to borrow £460 million in the whole year, we are in trouble.  We will have to play poker or do some bluffing somewhere along the line.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that given the particular uncertainties which are a feature <Col N="1196" /> of 1991 it was bound to be difficult to evaluate the overall budgetary picture until a good part of the year would have passed but that nevertheless the Government would monitor the evolving situation very closely and would not hesitate to do what they think necessary.  Does this mean that we will have to wait until after the local elections for the Minister to say that things are going wrong; in other words, will the tone be confident, will we be told that everything is grand and we will be fine but, as soon as the elections are over, will a mini-budget be introduced?</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I wish the country well but at the same time we have to face reality.</P>
      <P>I would like to make reference to the amount allocated to the Department of the Environment.  We face two great problems at present: the first is the problem of our roads and the other is the problem of potholes to which the Taoiseach, much to his shame, referred today. It appears that the Minister lost out in the battle to get money.  Like a good school master, he called in the engineers to find out why they were not spending the money allocated for road repairs.  I am not here to speak on behalf of the county engineers but I have no doubt if they had been given sufficient funds during the years for county roads they would have done a very good job.  As a member of Carlow County Council I said it is a gross insult for any Minister for the Environment to pretend that the engineers have this money in their back pockets and are not prepared to spend it. There is no doubt that if we had not received money from Europe for our national primary roads nothing would have been done in regard to our county roads.  The problem is that we neglected those roads and no money was allocated for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Maurice Doyle yesterday commented that it is great we are improving <Col N="1197" /> our infrastructure to get our goods out of the country but it should be remembered that there is two-way traffic on roads. Once we have improved our roads immensely, foreign operators will be able to transport their goods here and compete with us.  Therefore improving our roads will not remove our difficulties.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme has been discussed <i>ad infinitum.</i> I will not go into the details of the scheme but &ldquo;tax foregone&rdquo; is an interesting phrase.  On budget night the Taoiseach defended the proposed changes but suddenly there has been a change and the figures no longer amount to tax foregone.</P>
    <P>The urban renewal scheme has done a lot for towns but the emphasis should be on the word &ldquo;renewal&rdquo;.  I do not think that it was ever the intention that the scheme should be used to open up new businesses.  It is also a pity that greater emphasis was not put on housing.  A town can only take a certain amount of business and unless there is an increase in employment in an area, new businesses will only take business from existing enterprises.  I doubt very much that those who invest in this scheme will get a great return for their money.  The scheme would be of benefit if houses were being built for the elderly in town centres but it seems that many shops are being built for which the builders, who can avail of tax incentives, can charge very high rents. The people renting these properties will find it very difficult to survive.  If they survive, the older businesses will not or <i>vice versa.</i> It is great that one is able to come into a town to announce that a few million pounds has been granted but the result may not be nearly as good.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance for making improvements to the inheritance tax system.  While it is difficult to get this system right, I compliment the Minister in particular for removing an anomaly which arose in a case where a father left land to his son who then returned to the land.  He also addressed the question of insurance policies which were regarded as assets.  I ask him to keep up the good work as young farmers need to be given a start.  At present only the <Col N="1198" /> house and lands are exempt and I would ask him to consider exempting stock and machinery.</P>
    <P>Young people need a lot of encouragement to go into farming given that we do not know what is going to happen in the GATT talks or in Europe.  If it appeared that nothing was going to go wrong and everything was booming there would not be a dark cloud on the horizon and all would be fine but the reality is quite different.  I hope that things are not as bad as they appear but we should not discourage young people from going into farming.  A young farmer could well do without having to borrow £25,000 to £30,000 to pay off a tax bill before starting to farm.  If he could borrow that amount to construct sheds, buy machinery or set up a milking parlour, then at least he would be helping himself.  While the threshold has been increased in line with inflation, this is not enough.  Young farmers should be given a guarantee that they will not have to borrow money.  I could say more on that topic but I think the Minister is going about it in the right way. While young farmers will not be satisfied I hope the Minister will take some of my suggestions on board next year.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister, in preparing the budget next year, to remove some of the anomalies in the third level grant scheme.  It is a bone of contention that PAYE workers have no hope of getting third level grants for their children while others who appear to be better off seem to be able to get them.  That matter has to be tackled.</P>
    <P>I stated at the outset &ldquo;ní mar síltear bítear&rdquo;.  It appears that the position is not as good as the Taoiseach and the Government would have us believe.  The economy is slowing down.  Perhaps the Minister's forecast is correct but it is my hope the picture is not as bad as it appears.  There is far too much propaganda about employment and a lack of realism about unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have tackled in the budget the high cost of employing a person, because if employers are not encouraged to take on extra employees then we will get nowhere.  If we do not <Col N="1199" /> get the employment figures right we are destroying a young nation of people who are emigrating and giving their talents to other countries.  I have no objection to people going abroad if they want to, but it is pathetic to watch people from the west, as we saw in a Christmas TV programme, leaving against their will simply because we are not making the changes here that would encourage employment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Finance Bill, 1991.  I listened intently to what Deputy Browne had to say and I and others on this side of the House should regard as a compliment the fact that Deputy Browne made very little reference to the provisions of the Finance Bill but talked about everything else under the sun.  I also acknowledge the fact that he complimented the Minister on a number of changes he has made not only this year but in previous years in relation to such things as inheritance tax.</P>

      <P>Some of the Deputy's own people have criticised the Minister on the self-assessment details in this Bill and in the last two Bills.  Self-assessment is one way of getting rid of much of the red tape the Deputy was talking about. Most people, particularly in business, would say the self-assessment system is working well, given the fact that it is not being treated like capital gains tax.  That too will be of major benefit to people in business in particular.</P>

    <P>Deputy Browne mentioned the sheriffs system and the way they operate with a <Col N="1200" /> mallet.  I would remind Deputy Browne that it was his Government at the end of the 1982-87 period, who introduced the sheriffs system.  Not only did they introduce it, but they brought in people without advertising the jobs.</P>

      <P>The Deputy mentioned the country roads system.  Everyone acknowledges that county roads are not what they should be, but the Minister for the Environment in 1988 decided to implement a three year programme spending £150 million in 1988, 1989 and 1990, upgrading our county roads.  That money was spent and an extra £15 million was spent last year.  For the Deputy's information, a sum of £63 million will be spent this year on county roads.  That contrasts very starkly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I listened intently to Deputy Rabbitte and, while it might make great listening, his attitude and that of The Workers' Party is totally simplistic. I suppose that comes from the fact that they know that as a party it is unlikely that they will form a Government in the near future.  In order to provide jobs the economy must be growing and the economy is now in growth pattern, contrasting <Col N="1202" /> very definitely with the period from the early eighties up to 1987.</P>
      <P>On the return of Fianna Fáil to power in 1987 the word &ldquo;confidence&rdquo; that we hear so much about came back into the economy and had a major role to play in the growth pattern.  Our inflation rate now is one of the lowest in the EC and that has to have an effect on job creation. While I accept what Deputy Browne says in relation to unemployment figures rising, that trend is caused because emigrants are now returning home because the prospect of getting jobs here is better now than they were since there is a recession in the UK and the US.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The job creation statistics are there for all to see; they are prepared by indepenent people to prove the economy is creating jobs.  The fact is people are returning.</P>
      <P>I would like to speak in some detail on the harmonisation of VAT and excise duties come 1992.  The Minister in all his Budget Statements has made much of the fact that when 1992 comes he will have to get his taxes and excise duty harmonised. Excise duty will go after 1992 and the Minister is well aware that that will have grave implications in the Border areas.  If excise duty is abolished overnight and VAT rates are harmonised with those across the Border, there will be major job losses in the public sector, and particularly in the private sector.  This has been highlighted over the past number of years, and particularly over the past number of months, and people in those areas are very worried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am reading from a number of figures I have been handed.  In Dundalk and district 150 Customs and Excise staff are employed and in Castleblayney approximately 14 are employed.  In that area alone there are 164 staff who are unsure they will still have jobs on 1 January 1993.  The customs clearance industry has grown up as a result of the barriers we are trying to do away with.  About 150 people in that sector are employed in the <Col N="1203" /> Dundalk region alone; come 1 January 1993 if what we are told takes place, some alternative arrangements will have to be made for the redeployment or re-employment in both the public and private sectors. As regards this document I have in relation to the Customs and Excise officials at the customs posts, the wages they earn amount to about £2.85 million a year and this goes into the local economy. Dundalk has a 30 per cent rate of unemployment, well over the national avarage, and would be badly hit by such a loss of revenue.  It is incumbent on the Minister and the Government to ensure that alternative employment is available for both the Customs and Excise officials and the customs clearance people.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance on his recent visit to Dundalk where he addressed a function on this subject.  He also spent time afterwards discussing the matter with every sector involved.  Some concrete suggestions were made and many people have complimented the Minister on his approach.</P>
    <P>The age profile of those employed in the Customs and Excise service is an important factor.  Eighteen per cent are under the age of 30, 46 per cent are aged between 30 and 40 and 26 per cent are between 40 and 50.  Many of those people would not find employment in private industry if they were to be let go or accept redundancy.  The Minister suggested that they should themselves make suggestions to the Department of Finance as to their re-employment, preferably within the Dundalk area.  One answer would be a decentralised office in Dundalk which could provide employment for them.</P>
    <P>When the decentralisation scheme was put in place in 1980 the Department designated for Dundalk was the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  We left office in 1982 and as a result of an ideological stance against decentralisation, the incoming Fine Gael-Labour Government did not proceed with the programme.  It was not reactivated until we returned to office in 1987.  Sections of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were to have been relocated to Dundalk and <Col N="1204" /> Waterford but in 1983 the then Government split the Department and set up two semi-State bodies, An Post and Telecom Éireann.  An Post are totally unwilling, and probably unable because of financial constraints, to decentralise to Dundalk. The Government are investigating the possibility of assigning another Department to Dundalk and I would ask the Minister to expedite that matter.  A decentralised office of a Government Department would be ideal for soaking up the jobs that will be lost by Customs staff in places like Carrickarnon and the Newry Road station at Dundalk.</P>
    <P>The customs clearance agents are in a different category.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that we are debating the Finance Bill.  I have given the Deputy a lot of latitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the Finance Bill.  The Minister has stated that the thrust of the Bill is to try to harmonise taxes.  Tax harmonisation has huge implications. The position of customs clearance agents is worse than that of Customs and Excise officers because they are in the private sector.  The Minister indicated in Dundalk that he would be quite willing to set up a task force to investigate the possibility of further employment for these people, about 150 or 160 of whom face the possibility of redundancy.</P>
      <P>This Government have been criticised by some Members opposite as not being aware of the problems of Border areas. The Minister for Health, who is in the House, is well aware of the position.  The budget speech was peppered with references to the Border areas.  Reference was made to cross-frontier employees, people who are employed across the Border in Newry or Armagh but resident in the Republic.  The Minister for Finance has acknowledged the anomaly by giving them the £800 PAYE allowance which previously they did not receive.  He took on board representations by me and other Border Deputies.  That is one recognition of the Border scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other is the implementation of the <Col N="1205" /> new 24-hour rule.  I can unashamedly say that the 48-hour rule put the town of Dundalk back on its feet, having suffered massive haemorrhaging during the 1980s. The service sector in the town can at least make a living now.  The introduction of a 24-hour rule, with the consent of the Commission, will help.  As a result of the recession in the UK and VAT reductions here, the scene on the Border is not as drastic as it used to be and there is not a great desire to travel from the Republic to the North.  There are far more bargains in the Republic than in Newry.</P>
    <P>The amendments to the BES scheme are welcome and I do not accept the criticisms from The Workers' Party.  A simplistic approach does not assist.  If we do not have growth in the economy we cannot create jobs.  This is an area where there is growth and the Government have to accept that by building up an infrastructure for tourism, allowing hotels to build extensions and so on, we are creating jobs.</P>
    <P>CERT, the hotel management and training body, are looking for recruits. Most of the people who participate in these courses are employed at the end of the day.  I compliment the Minister on his action in that regard.  I made representations to him in relation to a number of problems that arose as a result of the guillotining of the scheme in the budget.  The Minister has adopted a realistic approach asking people, caught in that trap, to produce a contract in order to prove that they had set expansion procedures in motion.  Of course there are people still excluded from its provisions but most of them would have to accept that they had not gone sufficiently down the line to prove that they had been availing of it.</P>
    <P>The recent VAT reductions in the United Kingdom have been a help to Border areas.  Coupled with the reduction in VAT here, from its earlier level of 25 per cent to 21 per cent, this means that the differential between North and South &mdash;which impinges directly on my home town &mdash; is not now as great.  I am aware that it is the Minister's wish between now and 1992 to reduce the VAT rate to as <Col N="1206" /> near as makes no difference between the United Kingdom, the North and the South which can only be beneficial in my area.</P>
    <P>People may tend to criticise the increases in road tax announced in the budget.  I was interested to hear recent suggestions by the Leader of the main Opposition party, Deputy John Bruton, in regard to the road fund tax when he contended that that tax should go directly to local authorities enabling them to put money into roads.  He did not say from where the Government would be able to recoup the money they would not receive were it to go directly to local authorities. Deputy Bruton's approach was completely ill-considered.  He appears to take an awful lot on himself, despite the fact that he is surrounded by so many spokespersons capable of advising him properly.</P>
    <P>The changes in stamp duty included in the Finance Bill are welcome.  I know that to date the late payment of stamp duty has not been helpful, causing people engaging in property transactions much difficulty.  The penalty clauses that obtained to date were somewhat injudicious and did not leave any room for manoeuvre.  The changes to be implemented under the provisions of this Bill will render the position of people liable to the payment of stamp duty easier.  Stamp duty now constitutes a major outlay on the part of people engaging in property transactions.  The section dealing with the under-statement of values of property <i>vis-à-vis</i> stamp duty &mdash; when such property is the subject of a gift &mdash; is to be welcomed also because it would appear there has been some laxity on the part of the Revenue Commisioners in this regard.  Henceforth, once people are aware that these provisions exist, that they will be penalised for advancing an under-value, there will be more realistic values put on such properties.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there is a review taking place of the disabled drivers' scheme.  I would ask him to examine the possibility of amending the regulations in regard to eligibility for that scheme.  I have had a number of people come into my clinic seeking this concession, for <Col N="1207" /> example, people who have the use of one arm only, who have not been included in its provisions which is most anomalous. Obviously, because of their disability, they are not in a position to drive a normal car with gears, manoeuvre the steering wheel and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in his budget statement and introductory remarks on this Bill &mdash; as did the Minister for Social Welfare in the course of his contribution &mdash; referred to the fact that, under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government have initiated 12 pilot projects for a locally based response to long term unemployment.  I am, indeed, glad the Government saw fit to include the town of Dundalk in one of those pilot projects.  No doubt the town of Dundalk was chosen because of its very high unemployment rate of over 30 per cent.  I know meetings are taking place between local interested groups to set up a company in the town.  Many of the people unemployed in Dundalk have been out of work since many of the major factories in the area went out of business in the late seventies and early eighties. These will be middle-aged people who are unemployable unless retrained. Unfortunately, to date emphasis has been placed on the younger unemployed and not sufficient on the middle aged group.</P>
    <P>In section 33 the Minister proposes extending the tax relief on company donations to the Trust for Community Initiatives, formed as a result of suggestions on the part of a number of business people, if not at the behest of the Minister, that such trust be established to help individuals who are unemployed to set up small businesses.  The Trust for Community Initiatives is working well in my area, a number of people having applied for funding.  I must compliment the major player in that trust, Mr. Neil McCann of the FII, from Dundalk, who contributed a sizeable amount of money to the trust, thereby enabling unemployed people, who would not have the wherewithal or who would be unable to get a loan from a bank to set up a small business.  The <Col N="1208" /> provisions of that trust have fitted into that slot, allowing some of these people to set up small businesses.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill constitutes another step in an integrated approach to putting our economy back on the rails after years of neglect.  That is evident from all the figures produced by independent commentators. This can only be beneficial as far as employment is concerned.  Jobs are being created, people are returning from abroad, and hopefully, with increased growth in our economy, there will be jobs for those who return in addition to those leaving school.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of the very grave budgetary problems this year I am most surprised at the Minister's decision to give further concessions to the business sector by extending the provisions of the business expansion scheme for an additional two years.  As the House will be aware, it had been intended that the provisions of that scheme would be terminated this year, a proposition with which the Green Party would agree.  The business expansion scheme was a notorious loophole enabling high rate taxpayers to avoid paying their fair share of tax.  As already mentioned in my budget contribution the Green Party do not find income tax a very satisfactory form of taxation.  However, as long as it exists we must ensure that both tax avoidance and tax evasion are eliminated.  The purpose of the BES scheme was supposed to be the encouragement of job creation to reduce the appalling scandal of 250,000 people out of work and the continuing drain of emigration.  The reality is that the scheme has had the main effect of feathering the nest of speculators and get-rich-quick merchants.  The employment created by these schemes has been minimal in relation to the revenue foregone. The Minister in his review of the scheme has identified 4,250 additional jobs in companies involved in the scheme at a cost of £74 million in tax foregone and IDA grants.  The cost works out at £17,411 for each job created.  This is an enormous sum.  How many of these <Col N="1209" /> people have permanent jobs?  I would like the Minister to give an undertaking in the House to carry out a survey in, say, five years' time of the 347 companies involved to see how many of these jobs are still in existence.  It is only then the full cost of State aid can be calculated.</P>
      <P>The Green Party have consistently maintained that grants to industry should be limited to small, preferably Irish owned, industry in labour-intensive areas.  While deploring the extension of this scheme for a further two years I welcome the changes in the scheme announced in the Bill.  If the Minister has money to give away &mdash; which he has not &mdash; it would be much better spent on a reduction in employers' PRSI which, as the Minister and everyone here must realise, is a tax on labour.  Anything more ludicrous at a time of such high unemployment is hard to visualise.</P>
      <P>If we look at the income tax situation we find the cracks are showing at the seams between the Coalition partners.  In an effort to try to reach the target of a standard rate of 25 per cent by 1993 the Government have reduced the existing standard rate of 30 per cent to a new rate of 29 per cent.  So far as we have an income tax system the Green Party have consistently maintained that the way towards modest tax reform would be to concentrate on increased exemption limits to take the poor out of the tax net altogether and to give allowance relief at the standard rate only, which would make the tax system more progressive.  I admit the Government have increased exemption limits but they are still too low.  The minimum exemption limit should be £4,000 for a single person and £8,000 for a married couple as against £3,400 and £6,800, respectively, provided in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I note that the rent allowance for elderly people has been increased, perhaps, in response to my amendment to the 1990 Finance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note also that section 23 relief &mdash; relief covering concessions to landlords on the provision of rented accommodation &mdash; has been extended for a further year.  This relief is similar to BES and should be abolished forthwith.  At <Col N="1210" /> the very minimum the Minister should give an undertaking not to renew this relief next year.  The House will recall that this concession was originally introduced as a temporary measure as far back as the 1981 Finance Act.</P>
    <P>The bank levy has been retained at the ludicrously low figure of £25 million.  This figure should be increased substantially. I welcome the further reduction in life assurance relief which is another form of tax avoidance.  The complete abolition of this relief would make a contribution towards widening the tax base.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not responded to my suggestions last year that the PAYE-PRSI allowance should be granted to business, professional people and farmers in addition to being allowed to employees.  There is no longer any excuse for differentiating between two classes of earned income.  Incidentally, I would refer once again to the discrimination against small family business due to the non allowance of PAYE-PRSI allowance to members of the family working in the business.  The reason for this apparently is, that payment of wages to family members is a tax avoidance device.  I call on the Minister to remove this obnoxious provision which is a slight on the integrity of small business people.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the full cost of VHI premiums to cover treatment at the Blackrock Clinic and the Mater Private Hospital is still being allowed.</P>
    <P>I suggest the reintroduction of children's allowance at £300 per annum for all taxpayers in view of the grossly inadequate amount provided for in the Social Welfare Act in respect of child benefit.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer once again to the inequity of the withholding tax on professional fees.  This represents unfair treatment of professional people and professional firms and I am sure it is unconstitutional. For the reasons outlined above and the many other shortcomings in the Bill I will be opposing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us is a further indication of the Government's commitment to preserve and enhance confidence in the <Col N="1211" /> national economy.  There has been further tax reform and the Government are honouring their commitment to ease the burden on the taxpayer.  Earlier, Deputy Ahern referred to a number of the beneficial effects of the Finance Bill, particularly in the Border counties.  I agree with what Deputy Ahern said because if we cast our minds back to 1987 and the serious situation that existed in the economy at the Border towns as a result of people crossing the Border to do their shopping, we now see a complete reversal of that situation.  First of all, there was the 48 hour rule introduced by a former Minister for Finance Mr. Ray MacSharry, which had a beneficial effect. Because we had the time to build up our economy here and, indeed, did so when other economies in Europe were suffering, we are now in a position to compete with the Northern side of the Border.  In 1987 the difference in VAT rates in the North and the South was 10 per cent, it is 3½ per cent today.  That is an indication of the good work done by the Government in getting our economy right.  The benefits of the improved economy are not confined to the Border areas but are felt throughout the State.</P>
      <P>The health services cannot be immune from the Government's financial strategy. It is fair to say that the health services met the challenge presented to them in that they maintained a high quality of service and at the same time met the necessary financial targets laid down.  It is a tribute to all the staff working in the health services that they maintain such a high quality service, something which is is recognised not alone in Ireland but throughout the world.  The nature of health services is changing because of new developing technology.  That in itself is a challenge and although we like every other country in the world have to live within a finite resource, the manner in which the challenge has been met is very encouraging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his introductory remarks the Minister said that 1991 would be a difficult year and, of course, we have recognised that in the health services.  Indeed, the <Col N="1212" /> Government have always recognised the difficulties in managing the health service and in meeting the needs of the people. This year we are receiving 22 per cent of Exchequer funding as against 18.7 per cent in 1987.  The allocation to health boards and voluntary hospitals represents an increase of 7 per cent over 1990.  Of course, I accept that much of the increase &mdash;£108 million &mdash; goes on additional pay, and nobody objects to that because the staff are entitled to be remunerated and their work recognised.</P>
    <P>A major element in the policy is improved efficiency.  The Fox and Kennedy studies will assist in giving greater direction to the efficiency measures.  At present Noel Fox, management consultant, and two Assistant Secretaries in my Department are spearheading the efficiency measures throughout the service. Again, it is encouraging to see the enthusiasm at local level, in health boards, voluntary hospitals and voluntary organisations, to meet the efficiency measures which are so essential in ensuring that we maintain a proper financial strategy here.</P>
    <P>We all think of health boards as providers of health services, but it is no harm now and again to remind ourselves of their economic impact, of the large force they are in their respective regions.  They are a major business organisation, as it were.  Practically every health board are by far the largest employer, they have the largest transport fleet and the largest catering organisation.  This is important in that it puts them in a key position to be very competitive in the prices they pay for goods and services.  This again leads to greater efficiency.  I would add that we are about to establish a performance audit unit in the Department of Health which will monitor efficiency measures and see how they might be improved and enhanced.</P>
    <P>In a debate here on 26 February last, as reported at Volume 405, column 1662-78 of the Official Report, I dealt in some detail with the services.  I will not go into them in detail today except to make a passing reference to the fact that we said at that stage that the required number <Col N="1213" /> of acute hospital beds is approximately 12,000.  We maintained that number of beds throughout the latter half of 1989 and right through 1990 and we intend to maintain that number throughout 1991, apart from the normal seasonal closures which are always associated with hospital services.  I was a houseman in a hospital 30 years ago and at that time a whole corridor was closed.  It amuses me in some ways, and saddens me in others, to hear people referring to a normal holiday seasonal closure as a cut back.  It is certainly not a cutback.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are providing money for a major hospital in Kilkenny. In the Deputy's health board area we are building a massive hospital in Ardkeen in Waterford and another major hospital in Wexford, not to talk of the work at the other end of the country, in Sligo, Cavan and Mullingar.  I could talk all day about the major developments in the four years since I became Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area that stretches the financial resources of the health boards is the demand led schemes, the community drugs schemes and the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  Health boards are obliged statutorily to pay for those services.  They have no control over the number of people who will benefit.  It is a matter for the doctors to prescribe <Col N="1214" /> whatever drugs are necessary for the population.  If an epidemic occurs leading to an increase in the amount of drugs required health boards are obliged to meet the cost.  If that cost goes beyond what the health board have allowed, in order to pay the extra cost other areas of the service may be impinged upon.  This year there has been another major development in that the Government have decided to create a special subhead for these accounts to ensure that they will not impinge on others.  Indeed, we will be better able to monitor the demand for drugs and also for the disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>Another important change due to take place on 1 June is the change in eligibility. This is something that, as the House knows, was recommended by the commission on funding and NESC and was requested by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  That, in effect, will mean that all patients will be entitled to free consultant services in a public bed in a public ward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be phased in over time.  Naturally it would not be possible to bring it in overnight.  It will ensure that there will be an increased number of public beds available for public patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be quite simple because private patients will no longer be allowed occupy public beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>How many private beds are there in public hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In theory under the present arrangement there is no reason why every bed could not be occupied by private patients.  There is no law against that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The public patient cannot get in, not to talk of the private patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We monitor the system and that does not happen.  In future beds <Col N="1215" /> designated for public patients will be occupied by public patients only, except of course for emergency treatment.  If an accident comes into a hospital obviously the person involved will be given the first bed available.  For elective work in future public beds will be available for public patients only.  If we take, for example, hip replacement operations there is no reason at present why a person who needs a hip replacement cannot occupy a public bed and pay the surgeon.  It has been alleged that there may be queue jumping. That does not happen to any great extent but the fact that there is a perception that it does happen is a good reason why beds should be designated, why public beds should be available for public patients and private beds for private patients.  The new change will ensure that public beds will be designated and that only public patients will be allowed into those beds except in an emergency.  On the other hand private beds will be designated for private patients.  As I said, this measure will be phased in over time because, obviously, the requirements will differ in different hospitals in terms of the number of public and private beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister prohibit the redesignation of public beds?  That is the plan in some health board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The plan is to designate a certain number of public and private beds.  I am satisfied that that will increase the total number of public beds available in the service.  In future private beds will have to be self-supporting.  If there is a demand for more private beds it will be a matter for the VHI to enter an arrangement with the hospitals to finance further bed development.  If there is a bigger demand obviously that is something the VHI will be able to cope with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Social and Economic Progress</i> it was also pointed out that private practice will exist side by side with public practice.  We have an integrated system of public-private mix which has served us well since the foundation of <Col N="1216" /> the State and the Government recognise that in the budget and the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>There has been no change in the tax relief available to people who pay their premium to the VHI.  As the House is aware, negotiations are in progress with the consultants about a number of issues following the report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration.  They are discussing the question of pay, account-ability and a managerial role for consultants which is very important. Eligibility is included in those discussions and I am hopeful that they will be brought to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister keep us informed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we will keep the Deputy informed.  The Government strategy for the next seven years is outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and, of course, as Minister for Health, I am pleased with the emphasis on developments in the health service.  Indeed, it is as a result of good Government management over the last four years that the Government were able to announce, through the programme, quite substantial developments which will take place during that seven year period.  There will be a major additional investment over the seven years which will be targeted at community and primary health care.  I will not go into the reasons for this but, world-wide, the emphasis is on these areas.  The objective is that health services should be available to the lowest level of complexity appropriate to the person's need.</P>
      <P>Over the seven years there will be an investment of £100 million capital for community based facilities; there will also be a progressively increasing amount of current expenditure, up to £90 million more in the seventh year compared to what is spent in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of community services &mdash; or indeed in some instances the substitute community services &mdash; for long stay residential care is not a cheap option. In many ways it costs just as much to ensure that you have the necessary staff <Col N="1217" /> available.  Of course the House is aware that last year we spent an extra £5 million, which was allocated in the budget, on the elderly.  This year the sum of £5 million was repeated and a further sum of £3 million has been allocated to enhance the services for the elderly.  This will help the support services, public health nurses, home helps, twilight nursing &mdash; a new service &mdash; the provision of day centres, long stay places where necessary and general support for the elderly and their carers.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2 million was allocated in the budget for the mentally handicapped in 1990 which was repeated in the original allocation this year with a further £1 million announced in this year's budget which was helped to provide a whole range of new services for the mentally handicapped. I will soon be announcing the number of new places which will be provided as a result of the extra money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The same applies to the physically handicapped.  In the seven-year programme there will be a major development of services for the physically handicapped and I am sure everybody in the House agrees that we need more speech therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.  All Members will agree that money is not always the reason for not being able to recruit these people as some of these disciplines are in very short supply.  I am in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Education, as to how we can ensure that more people are trained in these very important disciplines.</P>
      <P>In the Finance Bill the Minister referred to the very important disabled drivers' scheme and he introduced very worthwhile improvements in the scheme two years ago.  This year he introduced further improvements; he said that he is reviewing the scheme and, naturally, my Department will be in consultation with him about it.  We provided an extra £3 million last year for the dental service and we are providing another £3 million this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> Everybody will agree that there has been a substantial improvement in the dental services which is continuing this year.  Nobody disputes that more needs to be done, there is no point saying that all the problems are solved.  They are not and, indeed, as I have often said, a Minister for Health who thought he had all the problems solved should not be in office.  However, the substantial improvement envisaged in the seven year programme will certainly help.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach appointed my colleague in the Department, Deputy Flood, Minister of State, to co-ordinate all the childcare services.  This is a very worthwhile job and I am sure that everybody in the House will agree that the Minister of State, from the first day, took his duties very seriously and has done a splendid amount of work in that whole area.</P>
    <P>One of the areas about which we must be concerned is child abuse.  In 1982 there were 37 confirmed cases and in 1989 there were 1,300 confirmed cases of child abuse, including 500 cases of child sexual abuse.  Shortly after I came to office I established two new units to investigate, manage and treat children suffering from child abuse.  There is one unit in Temple Street and one in Crumlin; these are multi-discipline units with social workers, psychologists, paediatricians and backup psychiatric support where necessary. We also issued new guidelines for the investigation and management of children suffering child abuse.  The multidiscipline approach is very important in ensuring that a number of disciplines are involved because it is very important that the diagnosis is accurate and that mistakes are not made.</P>
    <P>We have also funded each of the health boards to ensure that they have their own facilities for the investigation and management of children who suffer child abuse and an extra sum of £1 million was provided in the budget for the childcare services.  A substantial amount of that money will be allocated to the health boards for the provision of a number of social workers, particularly to look at areas of deprivation and disadvantage. The plight of the young homeless is one <Col N="1219" /> such area and substantial work has been done, including new hostels being provided in Ballymun and Tallaght.  A number of new hostels will be built.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the misuse of drugs.  Obviously, an inter-departmental approach is necessary to combat this serious problem.  It is important to state that this week the Government approved a new national strategy to prevent drug abuse.  The strategy is based on recommendations of the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse which I reconstituted last year and which will provide a co-ordinated and integrated framework to deal effectively with the demand and supply aspects of drug abuse and drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>The key provisions of the strategy are the co-ordination of services at national, regional and area levels; the development of a community-based response to reduce the demand for drugs and for the treatment and rehabilitation of drug abusers; the development of drug education programmes for schools, teacher-training colleges and third level colleges; the extension of service training for teachers on drug related matters; the co-ordination of services for AIDs and for drug misusers; a strengthening of the legislative framework to deal with illicit drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs to the community; and the establishment of a national data base which will provide general data on the prevalence and incidence of drug abuse.  I would hope to publish the strategy in a few weeks.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an indication of the Government's policy to ensure that we continue to maintain a healthy economy.  At present, compared to 1987, we have the lowest inflation in Europe, much lower interest rates than we had, increasing employment and, above all, confidence in our economy and tax reforms which were promised by Government which improve the position of the taxpayers in the State.  It is only by having a healthy economy, it is only by providing the necessary finance through our own work and our own resources, that we can <Col N="1220" /> develop our social services to the extent that all of us would wish to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly delighted to hear the Minister for Health enunciate a policy of fiscal rectitude and acknowledge that it is important to have a healthy financial climate in the country in order to instill confidence in our economy.  I wish he had taken the same line when he was in Opposition between 1982 and 1987.  If he had the country would certainly be much better off today financially than it is.</P>
      <P>Despite the acknowledged improvements that have taken place and which I hope will continue, there have been a number of slippages in recent times. Whether it is a matter of coincidence or not, every time the Taoiseach and Deputy O'Malley is in Cabinet together, the financial situation in the country comes under threat because, in recent times, we appear to be running the risk of increasing borrowing again, and that is something I thought we had got away from.  I thought all sides of the House had agreed that progress should be made towards eliminating the Exchequer borrowing requirement as soon as possible. I hope the fears being expressed today are unfounded.</P>
      <P>In order to keep the financial and budgetary figures on the rails, in line with the budget speech made by the Minister for Finance some weeks ago, I expect that the Minister for Finance will have no option but to introduce a mini-budget some time after the local elections to ensure that our finances are kept on target and that the confidence necessary to build up the economy and keep interest rates and inflation as low as possible are implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is fast becoming a divided society.  That is regrettable.  That process must be arrested and reversed.  If it is not we run the risk of being one State with two societies politically and socially pitted against each other.  Already there are dangers of division in Irish society. There are very strong feelings of alienation and frustration among unemplyed people, among our young people and <Col N="1221" /> among people who cannot get housing. These are some examples of the wrong direction Government policy is taking.</P>
    <P>In areas like health, education, and agriculture people who have are able to get the service they require but those who have not have difficulty getting access to their entitlements.  If we are to progress as a nation, the strong and the weak must move forward together and economic advancement must not be bought at the expense of social deprivation and division. Our first priority in this House must, therefore, be to ensure that those who are economically weakest can truly consider themselves part of the social consensus.  To achieve this we must inevitably reform our tax and social welfare systems.  We have talked long enough about it but we have not achieved very much.</P>
    <P>Today's system is neither efficient nor effective because it contains too many anomalies.  These arise from the operation of a set of different thresholds to determine eligibility for different benefits or services.  In some circumstances small changes in income levels can result in very large changes in the levels of entitlement. The operation of thresholds in this way creates serious disincentives to enterprise and effort.  It gives rise to feelings of resentment and alienation.</P>
    <P>Some people see their family circumstances worsen considerably even though they are making strong personal efforts to improve their own circumstances. A move to overtime or a change to shift work can remove entitlement to a medical card.  Where there is illness in the family this brings about a substantial disimprovement in living standards. There are people in full-time employment whose incomes are only marginally above the eligibility limits for a medical card.  The look at the situation of their neighbour and conclude that they and their families would be better off if they were unemployed.</P>
    <P>These are some examples of the real world and of the anomalies that must be addressed but are not addressed in the Finance Bill, 1991.  There are parents of children attending third level colleges <Col N="1222" /> who are experiencing real hardship at the moment, particularly if they have more than one student at college.  We all know the huge sacrifices that are required and that are being made by parents of children who are going to college.  The aim of these parents is to ensure that their children get a good education at the least possible expense to themselves.  There is a huge financial drain on parents who are trying to achieve the best possible education for their family.  These families need a break.  This can be achieved by fine-tuning the tax system to reward people who want to do what is best for their families, who want to give their children the best possible education to ensure that they realise their full potential in the world of work thereafter.</P>
    <P>The tax and social welfare system as we know it today has become a myriad of anomalies and distortions resulting in huge poverty traps.  As legislators we have to tackle this.  The elimination of these anomalies and traps will remove the feelings of injustice, discrimination and alienation that I have referred to and restore the spirit of enterprise and belief in the value of effort.  It is clearly desirable to simplify the tax code and the social welfare code while meeting real needs.  We must eliminate the mechanisms that encourage fraud and abuse of the system.</P>
    <P>Some politicians believe that they can lose votes by their failure to tackle the black economy and the abuses of the social welfare system.  How many of us, on a daily basis, encounter people who are working and procuring benefits from the social welfare system at the same time?  We have failed as legislators to correct this matter.  The Government have failed to take the necessary political action to stamp out this discrimination against people who are at work and people who are genuine recipients of social welfare.  The people who are upset at people defrauding the social welfare system, the people who are working and drawing unemployment benefit and assistance at the same time, are social welfare recipients themselves and do not want to see their neighbour defrauding <Col N="1223" /> the social welfare system while he or she must be satisfied with the basic social welfare payment or with almost half their salary taken at source because of the luxury of doing a good week's work.  A system of tax and social welfare must be devised to restore the incentive to work rather than penalise people for their effort, that will simplify the administrative machinery that is creating a bureaucratic nightmare for employers and that will eliminate the obstacles to the expansion of employment and reduce the incentive to enter the black economy.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have on many occasions proposed that the best way to do this is through an all-party committee working towards the reform of the income tax and social welfare systems.  It is abundantly clear to all of us that no substantial reforms can take place in these areas without all-party agreement.  Any proposals for reform run the risk of being sabotaged by the vested interests involved.  Tax reform is not just about meeting the objective of reducing the standard or high rates of tax, which seems to be the popular view of the Government. Unless there is all-party agreement on the issue of tax reform, movement will be slow and the barriers to growth and employment will continue to exist and absorb the energy of the nation.</P>
    <P>The Government should be honest with the general public in regard to tax reliefs applicable in the tax code.  It would appear from recent media reports of statements by their Chairman, Mr. McDowell, that the Progressive Democrats are in favour of the abolition of all possible reliefs so that the top rate of tax can be reduced to 40 per cent.  Is this the objective of the Minister for Finance? Perhaps he will clarify his position in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Government, in particular, the Fianna Fáil Party, have reduced mortgage relief at a time of high interest rates. The reduction in life assurance relief has rendered the concept of endownment mortgages practically useless.  Fianna Fáil promised to abolish the deposit interest retention tax on return to Government <Col N="1224" /> in 1987 but instead the Government have extended the scope of this tax.</P>
    <P>The Government have been dishonest in relation to the treatment of PRSI for farmers and the self-employed in so far as it is now regarded as an extra tax on all those aged 56 years and over.  It is ridiculous in the extreme for the Government to be deducting finance from members of the public while at the same time they are telling them they will get no benefits at the end of the contribution period.  Why can the Government not introduce a system whereby even a partial contributory pension can be paid to those people in line with the contributions they have paid.  Alternatively, they could extend the contribution period so that the self-employed will qualify for a full contributory pension.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes announced by the Minister for Finance to the business expansion scheme.  Obviously, the financial interests of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats changed the minds of the legislators in this regard. This is not an unusual interference in the mechanisms of Government.</P>
    <P>I want to express my gratitude to the Minister for Finance for including section 107 in relation to inheritance tax.  During the course of a debate in 1990 I pointed out to the Minister that there was a huge anomaly in respect of the transfer of lands from a father to his son or daughter and that if a son or daughter pre-deceased his or her parents only £10,000 relief was applicable in respect of the transfer of the property back to the parents.  I raised this issue because I was aware of a particular case.  I am pleased the Minister for Finance has, as promised, introduced the appropriate provisions so that this anomaly can be eliminated.  I assure the Minister that this amendment to the inheritance tax code will be welcomed by all those whom it affects.  It will take a huge financial burden off those people at a time when they can ill afford major financial headaches.</P>
    <P>I welcome the continuation of section 23 reliefs for farmers who are carrying out important works for the control of pollution.  I ask the Government to look <Col N="1225" /> very seriously at the problems being experienced by farm development offices which do not have funds to pay the expenses of their employees who go out to inspect work.  That needs to be done in regard to the control of farmyard pollution. It is ridiculous to have employees of the Department of Agriculture and Food engaged in administrative work in their offices while farmers cannot proceed with the necessary work until an inspection is carried out.  I appeal to the Government to resolve this problem as soon as possible so that the valuable work of controlling farmyard pollution can continue.</P>
    <P>The agricultural community have received very bad press about the pollution of streams.  I want to assure the House that the farming community in my area of County Kilkenny have invested substantial resources to improve farmyard facilities for the control of effluent. This work is regularly monitored by the local authority with tremendous success. Substantial progress has been made in this area over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the further improvements announced in regard to the treatment of widows.  However, I do not believe the Minister has gone far enough in the context of our tax and social welfare codes in recognising the unique position of widows and widowers.  When one looks at our existing tax and social welfare codes one would think that widows and widowers were never married.  The State should recognise once and for all the trauma experienced by people when their partners die.  They should give recognition to the financial problems experienced by widows and widowers at that time by treating them as married people in our tax and social welfare codes.  This would show tremendous maturity and a humanitarian resolve on the part of the State.</P>
    <P>The public relations exercise being carried out by the Government gives the impression that our economy is going well and everything is rosy and perfect. However, we should remember that interest rates are 4 percentage points higher than they were in 1987 and that <Col N="1226" /> our level of unemployment is still high &mdash; the Minister stated it will continue to grow.  The people we meet in our daily routine speak about the huge financial pressures on families and the difficulties they experience in trying to make ends meet.  The Government seem to be giving the impression that those problems do not exist.  This is why I want to refer to a number of problems about which the Government may not be aware.</P>
    <P>In 1989 the Taoiseach said he was not aware of the crisis in the health services. The Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, who spoke about the huge improvements in the health services must not have told the Taoiseach about the problems in the health services in the lead up to the 1989 general election.  Apart from the debacle in relation to haemophiliacs there were many other problems in the health area at that time.  The Taoiseach became acutely aware of these problems when his party lost seats in several constituencies. His party will lose more seats in the local elections if they do not address some other problems.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is one of those problems, health is another.  In spite of the assurances given by the Minister for Health today, the waiting lists are not getting any shorter.  The extension of public hospital care to everyone will only exacerbate this appalling problem.</P>
    <P>Another problem is the rampant crime in urban areas and the inadequate Garda resources to deal with this.  As Deputy Browne knows from his contacts in Wexford &mdash; there are farmers in County Wexford &mdash; there are problems in agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> They are all good farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The changes proposed in the Common Agricultural Policy and the GATT negotiations will result in people in rural communities experiencing genuine hardship.  The Government have given the impression that they can do nothing about this in domestic policy and that it all depends on Commissioner Mac-Sharry in Europe.  However, when Deputy Austin Deasy was Minister for <Col N="1227" /> Agriculture he got £200 million of European money in working capital at 5 per cent interest to help Irish farmers.  He also introduced a reduced interest subsidy to help people in financial difficulties. Every time Joe Rea, the former leader of the IFA &mdash; I hope the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will forgive me for referring to somebody outside the House &mdash; stood up to speak about the bad weather he got a fodder voucher.  Those domestic solutions to financial problems were introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition.  In spite of the fact that a drop in farm incomes of 27 per cent has been the order of the day over the past two years the Government have not put forward any solutions to this problem.</P>
      <P>The problems in regard to our roads also need to be addressed.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, was quoted, out of context, as saying he would fill every pothole over the next three weeks.  It has been suggested by one or two Deputies that he was up quite late that night.  Some of the motor tax revenue that comes to local authorities should be retained by them.  It would give autonomy to local councils to make essential decisions to improve the lot of rural areas and to improve county roads. We have here a Minister for the Environment who is so intent on urban renewal that he will go down in history as the Minister for rural decay.</P>
      <P>There is an appalling crisis in housing. In Kilkenny there are 550 people waiting for housing with the prospect of only 20 houses starting in 1991 and the Minister says there is not a housing crisis.  Perhaps the Minister for the Environment is unaware that there is a housing crisis and he should be told about it by some of his friends on the Government benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national lottery has done important work in assisting communities, in providing sporting, recreational and amenity facilities and in funding voluntary organisations.  However, public representatives are inundated with requests from voluntary organisations for funding and one cannot but notice the <Col N="1228" /> flourishing number of voluntary organisations fund raising on the streets both day and night.  On the establishment of the national lottery we were told that it would do away with the need for fund raising on the streets.  This is not the case. The national lottery has developed into another slush fund supported by the Progressive Democrats who cried crocodile tears about the distribution of funds in the lead up to the last election but who have not done anything in Government to reform the system of allocating these funds.  Just like the Minister for the Environment they have put their hands in the till and distributed money at the behest of their Government colleagues. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are presiding over the decimation of services in rural Ireland.  Services are being withdrawn from rural Ireland and we are seeing the return of government of the Pale.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Government were unaware of many rural problems in the run-up to the last election.  This Finance Bill gives us an opportunity to make them aware and they will be made more aware when their local candidates go knocking on the doors in the local elections looking for votes.  The Government seem to think that everything is going well and that everything is rosy in the garden but that impression will be dispelled when reality comes home to them during the local elections, and the real issues of the day will then assume greater importance than seeking an Irish solution to an Irish problem by amendments relating to a social issue that has been threatened on the agenda in the coming weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome some of the announcements made by the Minister in the Finance Bill.  The Minister this year, as in previous years, has continued on a course which will benefit the people and the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Hogan one would think that the Fianna Fáil Government should have all the answers.  When the Coalition Government were in office from 1982 to 1987 they did not seem to <Col N="1229" /> have any of the answers.  The Minister and the Government generally have done a very good job over the last few years to ensure a better standard of living for the people.  Despite the difficulties that are expected to arise in 1991 I hope that will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>In relation to the black economy, politicians tend to be hypocritical.  I doubt if any politician can stand up here and say that he did not make representations on behalf of people who were disallowed unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance because of allegations about working and signing on.  When a person is disallowed he immediately goes to the politician whingeing and crying and complaining that the family do not have an income and more often than not we politicians go back to the Department or to the Minister and seek to have the social welfare payment restored.  We pay lip service to the problem, but politicians generally, perhaps because of the political system where if one politician will not oblige, another will, will make strong representations to have the payment restored.  It is time for us to give total support to a social welfare officer in making these tough decisions where there is a genuine case against a person in relation to working and signing on.</P>
    <P>It is good to see that interest rates have come down by ½ per cent.  I would question whether or not interest rates are coming down quickly enough.  I question the role of banks and building societies and their reluctance to reduce interest rates when they were announced.  When interest rates were reduced by one quarter of 1 per cent they said that they could not pass it on to their clients as it would cost too much and would not be of major benefit.  If interest rates had gone up by one quarter of 1 per cent the banks and building societies would have found every reason to increase interest rates for business people, farmers or mortgage holders. The Minister for Finance must take on the banks and the building societies and ensure that all reductions are passed on immediately.  Even small reductions help families with high mortgages who are trying to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> Interest rates generally are far too high.  I am baffled that the farmers who are well organised are allowing themselves to be ripped off by the banks and the lending agencies.  The farming organisations and people dealing with banks generally should get together and hammer out deals to benefit themselves. Interest rates are crippling farming as are the other problems in day-to-day farming activities.</P>
    <P>The banks have a very mean attitude in relation to charges for cheque books, lodgments and so on.  One has to pay to bank here.  The Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and any other Minister with a role to play in banking and financial institutions should examine the reason for exorbitant charges and restrict the charges which are being introduced by the banks on a weekly basis.  At the moment if a person applies to a council for a loan he must supply a letter of refusal from a building society or a bank.  In my constituency and probably in every other constituency the banks are charging a sum of £5 for a letter of refusal for a person on low income. They rip off their customers and make exorbitant profits in the process.  I hope the Minister will take the banks and lending institutions on to ensure they give their customers a fair deal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan referred to the Fine Gael policy on roads and suggested that the moneys raised in motor tax should be used to maintain our roads.  That suggestion has been considered on a number of occasions since I became a Member of this House but I wonder if the Deputies opposite know just how much money is collected in motor tax in each county and how the figures compare with the grants allocated by central Government.  It is my information that the amount of money collected in motor tax in County Wexford falls far short of the amount allocated by the Department of the Environment for the upkeep of our roads.  I, for one, hope that we are not going to be told by the Department of the Environment that the money raised in motor tax should be used to maintain our roads as it falls far short of the amount required.  I also hope the <Col N="1231" /> Minister will increase the amount of money available for the upkeep of county roads and will not suggest that the money raised on motor tax should be used as this would to be no one's advantage.</P>
    <P>Earlier the Minister for Health referred to the policies he has adopted. The Nursing Homes Bill was recently passed by the House and I would like to see a number of the sections of that Bill, particularly the sections dealing with subvented beds, implemented before the end of the year.  Due to the closure of a number of hospitals in recent years we have lost a number of such beds.  I welcome the fact that the regulations have been changed so that the person's means will now be taken into account.  Up to now a certain number of beds in a nursing home or hospital were subvented.  There is no doubt that the scheme has been abused in the past but this system should be fairer.  I also hope that subventions will only be paid in respect of nursing homes which meet the standards laid down in legislation as there are many nursing homes around the country where the facilities leave much to be desired.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance to consider introducing a tax allowance which people who have children in third level education could avail of.  While a substantial number qualify for scholarships, grants or ESF funding, a number of families find themselves above the income limits with the result that they have to borrow from a bank or other lending institution if they wish to send their children to third level education. This will prove to be a major burden if they have to send more than one child to third level education at any one time. Some incentive is needed and I do not think it would cost the Exchequer an enormous amount to introduce a tax allowance which such families could avail of.  I ask the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education to examine this matter to see if such an allowance could be introduced.</P>
    <P>I am aware of one family back home who had six children attending university <Col N="1232" /> at the one time.  This family found themselves above the income limit and consequently unable to qualify for any grant, even though they paid one third or more of their income in taxation.  The parents showed tremendous resolve in sending their children who have now qualified in different areas to university.  Such a family need some incentive and the taxation system immediately springs to mind.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is still the biggest problem facing this country.  Far too many of our young talented people find themselves on the dole, in low paid jobs or they have to emigrate.  The taxpayer has spent a fortune educating those young people and in many ways it is a scandal that they are now in Boston, New York, London or EC countries.  We need to look at this problem in a very temperate way and work together to find a solution.</P>
    <P>I come from the county with the second highest rate of unemployment in the country.  Some people may find this strange as County Wexford is regarded as a rich agricultural county.  Unfortunately, many agriculture related industries have collapsed and gone to the wall because their managements failed to modernise and diversify.  When times were good people moved from such industries and we now find that the unemployment rate stands at 23 or 24 per cent.</P>
    <P>Some Governments forgot County Wexford existed.  Certainly, the Industrial Development Authority have no interest in County Wexford.  We have sent deputation after deputation to meet them to highlight the fact that the county is a black spot but no action has been taken; neither do the Department of Industry and Commerce have any interest in the county.  An advance factory was completed three of four months ago in Enniscorthy and despite repeated requests by politicians and the local council no industry has been found for that factory.</P>
    <P>At times I get frustrated and wonder what I am doing here at all given the high rate of unemployment in the county.  I have to put it on record that I am totally <Col N="1233" /> dissatisfied with the efforts of the Industrial Development Authority, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and other Government agencies to create employment in County Wexford.  I will just have to adopt a stronger attitude in the interests of the unemployed because for far too long we have accepted that something would happen but to date nothing has.  The time has come to raise the roof to ensure that we get our fair share of the national cake.  It appears that industries are being opened all over the country, but no one seems to have an interest in County Wexford.  The people of Wexford deserve better.</P>
    <P>The urban renewal scheme has proved to be very successful in some towns, particularly Wexford town where a new shopping complex, with Dunnes Stores as the flag ship, has been developed.  I would like to see this scheme extended to smaller towns like Enniscorthy, Gorey and New Ross.  There is a crying need for redevelopment of old streets and shopping centres which are in decline.  I hope at some stage in 1991 or early 1992 that this scheme, which initially was introduced in the cities and extended to the major towns, will be extended further to smaller towns.  I come from Enniscorthy and Deputy Yates and I have been making representations for quite some time for urban renewal in that area.  I hope that will be sanctioned within the next week.</P>
    <P>I agree with previous speakers on this side of the House that the provisions for disabled drivers are a little restrictive.  I understand the Minister for Finance is to examine this.  A person is disabled in my opinion if he or she has only one arm or no use in one arm or hand.  The provision should be relaxed and grants made available to people with any disability.  That will not cost the Exchequer an enormous amount of money but it will make life much easier for people who are physically handicapped and want to participate in normal day to day activities requiring the use of a car.  I know the Minister is a compassionate man and that he will look at this.</P>
    <P>In 1987, for the first time in 20 years, <Col N="1234" /> there was a reduction in the income tax bands.  This has continued over the last three years and by 1993 we will have a lower income tax rate of 25 per cent and a higher rate somewhere between 40 per cent and 45 per cent.  For many years taxation of the ordinary PAYE worker increased under different Governments and it is welcome to see it going in the other direction, downwards.  I hope the people who have paid the major share of taxation during that 20 years, the PAYE workers, will benefit as the economy changes direction.  They carried the burden and it is only right that the benefit should pass back to them.  I hope we will soon see tax at reasonable rates which will give an incentive to people working to earn what will provide a decent standard of living for them and their families.</P>
    <P>Many people are not paying their fair share of taxation and it is the responsibility of the Minister to ensure such people are pursued and that any outstanding taxes due to the Revenue Commissioners are collected as quickly as possible.  I do not care whether the Minister has to give an interest amnesty to people who owe tax be it PRSI, inheritance tax or whatever; the important thing is to get in the capital.  If an inducement has to be offered to people to pay, so be it.  It is important that revenue is brought into the Exchequer as quickly as possible so that it can contribute towards improvement where improvement is needed.</P>
    <P>What will happen to Customs and Excise staff after 1992?  We hear much talk about the Single European Market and the benefits for this country with the opening up of markets.  That is good, but it is important that people working in Customs and Excise in places like Rosslare do not lose their entitlements and that their right to alternative work is protected. We have a tremendous staff at Rosslare harbour who have a great record in drug detection and carrying out their duties generally.  It is important that they know well in advance if there is to be an allocation of new work to existing staff, if there will be redeployment involving relocation of Customs and Excise offices and if there is to be early retirement or a <Col N="1235" /> proper redundancy package for people who may not want to relocate or travel away from their present base.  All the options I have mentioned should be outlined to Custom and Excise staff to permit the introduction of phased changes in staffing resulting from the Single Market on 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>We should not close up Customs and Excise &mdash; I know that will not happen &mdash; and run away from the problem.  There is a great unknown beyond 1993 and a great uncertainty.  Major decisions have yet to be made by the Government on Ireland's admission to the Single Market. There will be problems about illegal importation of drugs and people wanting to bring in foreign cars, a matter which can still cause problems.  Adequate staff should be retained to deal with the problems. Racketeers and cowboys will always try to circumvent the regulations and laws and it is important that adequate staff are at our ports to ensure that our citizens are protected.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance on the role he has played over the last three years in ensuring that the economy is developed for the betterment of our people.  He often says, &ldquo;Steady as she goes&rdquo;.  I ask him to take a special interest in the problem of unemployment and continue to ensure that the tax rate continues on a downward spiral for the benefit of the people working and who need an incentive to continue to work.  The Minister for Finance has a human side and is very capable of providing services that will be in the best interests of the people.  It is to be hoped that as our economy develops more jobs will be created and the country will be a better place for all of us in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>A Finance Bill is complex legislation giving as it does legitimacy to the provisions of the budget.  Speakers from all sides in their contributions covered most aspects of Irish life and how they see developments.  I am not sure that the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government are clear in their own minds as to the kind of country we <Col N="1236" /> can expect to have in the closing years of this century.  This Finance Bill is being processed through the House at a time when unemployment is at an unprecedented level and there is great pressure on business, through job creation incentives and attractions, to employ people rather than machines.  It behoves all parties to put forward constructive suggestions as to how matters can be improved.</P>
      <P>I compliment Mr. Peter Brooke on his initiatives in regard to Northern Ireland. Serving as I do as a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Association, it has been brought to our attention in dealing with British MPs that there is a great deal of difficulty and confusion abroad concerning the perception of Ireland, England and Northern Ireland.  The Minister for Finance could well be introducing a different sort of Finance Bill if substantial progress were to be made at the Brooke talks.  Such progress would allow any Government to project Ireland abroad as an island where it would be attractive to work, offering incentives to set up businesses.  There would be a perception of peace rather than war.  I trust that the Government in their input on behalf of us all will help to achieve some measure of progress.</P>
      <P>We debated a motion yesterday relating to the power strike which is imposing a huge cost on the country.  I have just listened to the chief executive of the IDA speaking of his shame that the power system in his own office was not operational when he was attempting to encourage senior Japanese bankers to invest here.  I hope common sense will prevail and that work at the power station will resume immediately.  If difficulties must be sorted out by negotiation afterwards, so be it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A whole range of difficulties faces our country.  We must ask whether the Government are living up to their responsibilities, especially in regard to the emigration problem.  Is it fair that literally thousands of our young people are being condemned to involuntary emigration? Where is the concern of the Government to cope with that problem? <Col N="1237" /> Have they shown the ability to do so?  It is advisable for qualified young people voluntarily to go abroad to acquire experience but the thousands who are forced into involuntary emigration are not being catered for in this Finance Bill. There are increases to the various voluntary organisations, but the problem is only being tinkered with.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of job creation schemes. The work experience programme operated by AnCO was abused by some employers who treated young people as slave labour.  However, it had some value in that it provided a measure of experience for young people.  When they attend for interviews now they are caught in a catch-22 position in that they are qualified for the job but do not have experience of work practices.  Major corporations and firms claim that the selection of their personnel is critical to the quality of the workforce.  Thousands of young people are condemned to go abroad to get experience.  There is need for a replacement work experience scheme under the auspices of FÁS which would allow employers to give qualified people a measure of experience so that ultimately they would succeed in acquiring permanent positions.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of frustration among young people who do not succeed at interviews, despite preparing themselves well, at some expense to their parents.  Often they receive stereotype replies the following day simply informing them that they have been unsuccessful. When they inquire as to the weakness in their presentation they are not told.  When young people are turned away, perhaps for very minor reasons, they should be told why.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for Health speaking about the health services and of course he mentioned all the good points. I recognise that he has a very difficult brief in a very sensitive area.  The pumping of more millions into the health service would not of itself solve all its problems.  It is fair to say that the Minister visited the general hospital in Castlebar in the company of the Minister for the Environment and then chairman of the <Col N="1238" /> Western Health Board, Senator Doherty.  He gave a specific commitment that phase 2 of that hospital project would go ahead, but nothing has happened since.  All that is outstanding is six months technical drawing which would not involve any capital expenditure this year.  There are difficulties in the running of the hospital in the absence of phase 2. It is fair to call for the honouring of public commitments given by senior Ministers. I call on the Minister for Health to authorise the six months technical work for phase 2 of the hospital so that it can be favourably considered for inclusion in the 1992 budget.</P>
    <P>In recent months we have witnessed the deliberate procrastination on the part of the Government in attempting to face up to serious economic and social issues, for instance, the awaited NESC report with regard to the An Post proposals which will be most interesting.  It is very obvious that Ministerial intervention in this case has put the problem on the long finger until after the more immediate assessment of Government at the local elections.  Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat members, who will have to deal with this in terms of the social responsibility of the Minister in this area, are well aware of the fundamental change which will be wrought in rural areas through the provision of 500,000 roadside boxes, the regrading of post offices, closure of sub-post offices and so on.  This is of critical importance to very many people who benefited from a service over many years.  Nonetheless it is being put on the long finger by the Government.</P>
    <P>Looking at the position of Aer Lingus we find that many of their aircraft are quite old and in need of replacement but that Aer Lingus are not sufficiently profitable to purchase new aircraft.  In addition, there is the ongoing controversy and difficulty about whether Aer Lingus should over-fly Shannon and fly directly to Dublin.  Our Acting Chairman, Deputy Doyle, has been involved in this matter, as have most Members of the House.  It is a problem that must be confronted, particularly in terms of replacement of the Aer Lingus fleet.  If there is <Col N="1239" /> no money available at present to replace these ageing aircraft, then one can legitimately pose the question: from where will the requisite finance become available and by what means?</P>
    <P>From an EC directive we learn that the Commission intend to proceed with the development of 10,000 kilometres of new rail lines in Europe, the improvement of several more thousand kilometres of lines, to be accompanied by a quality of train that will compete, in many cases, not with roads but with airlines in that they will be capable of speeds of up to 250 kilometres per hour.  We are faced here with the continuous prospect of degrading or regrading of our rail service. Recently leaked documents, while I do not accept altogether their validity, tended to suggest that the rail services to Galway, Westport and Sligo would be terminated completely.  That is just not feasible.  Within the tourism area the Government have given Bord Fáilte a directive to double tourism within five years.  If we are to be a Mecca for quality tourism in the future we must remember that internal access to various parts of the country always has been by rail.  I should hate to think there would be any attempt at a deliberate running down of those rail services.  With the removal of station masters and the abolition of freight depots it would appear that that is the approach of Íarnród Éireann.  I prefer to think that the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, would honour his social responsibility and continue to examine the subsidy made available to Íarnród Éireann alongside their proposals for the continuation and development of otheir services in the future.</P>
    <P>Those are some matters the Government have decided to long-finger and not deal with in the immediate future. However, we must remember that these problems will recur in a never-ending circle.</P>
    <P>Apart from all of that there are the proposed changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and the forthcoming additional round of GATT talks which <Col N="1240" /> will change forever the concept of agriculture in rural areas as we have known it.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to a matter requiring clarification in our laws.  The House will be aware that the Government and the Minister for Finance always take a share of mining royalties from various companies.  There has been national publicity given to mining proposals in the west.  Mayo County Council have adopted a county development plan referring specifically to the fact that no mining of minerals will be allowed in certain areas under the relevant Minerals Act.  Does this mean that the Minister for Energy, with responsibility for the development of our mineral resources, must accept that a local authority can contend that his responsibility is no longer relevant in terms of the development of certain of our mineral resources?</P>
    <P>There must be clarification of this issue.  If all local authorities nationwide were to adopt the same attitude it could lead to a serious decline in our mineral resources.  I quite understand the difficulties in the public perception of the traditional kinds of mining.  While technology has changed enormously and legitimate fears about such issues can be expressed, there has to be an element of natural justice in all of this.  If the methods of application for mining leases and the granting of mining licences are to be adhered to, everybody must have their say before the Minister becomes the final arbiter.  There is need for clarification of the law in terms of who has responsibility for this type of mining development with its consequent impact on employment and the nation's finances generally.</P>
    <P>In reply to recent parliamentary questions I tabled to the Minister for Education in respect of remedial teachers she said that, under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, she had received approval to appoint 80 additional remedial teachers within the period of that programme.  Over the past 25 years we have developed a reasonably efficient and, in some cases, excellent level of service for handicapped children, <Col N="1241" /> that is in terms of aiding their backwardness, overcoming their learning difficulties and so on, experienced by the moderate or mildly handicapped.  There would appear to be a strong tendency now to transfer such children from special schools to the normal community schools.  I accept that there is much validity in that theory, that it would be more advantageous to have children with learning difficulties integrated in a normal school with their peers who do not encounter similar difficulties.  But if that trend is not backed up by the provision of speech therapists, physiotherapists and other specialist people &mdash; in other words a massive injection of financial resources to allow those handicapped children reach their maximum learning potential &mdash; we will be condemning them to a life of enforced ignorance.</P>
    <P>If that trend is to be followed it behoves the Government and the Minister to ensure that sufficient resources, in terms of specialised personnel capable of dealing with all of these specialised problems, are made available to cater for such children. The creation of 80 additional remedial teacher posts over the period of this programme is a mere pittance.  There is clear need for remedial teachers in every parish in the country.  I am quite sure that all Members of this House receive numerous representations from parents and teachers about handicapped children.  If that trend is to be followed by the Minister for Education it behoves her colleague, the Minister for Finance, and the Cabinet in general &mdash; that is if we are to cherish all the children of the nation equally as is our constitutional responsibility &mdash; to make these extra facilities available for handicapped children.</P>
    <P>Pollution has been mentioned by a number of speakers, one aspect of which deserves mention.  It is fair to say that the agricultural community have made valiant efforts in the last number of years to cope with the effluent problem and to clean up the place.  The Minister for Finance should seriously consider grant-aiding, even to a small degree, the provision of silage wrappers and balers.  This <Col N="1242" /> would do away with a huge element of pollution in the conventional way and the farming community, many of whom are dealing with bad land and unsuitable sites, would be attracted to this concept. Even a small percentage grant would result in a substantial saving over a number of years in terms of having to deal with pollution.  In that context the countryside, and we are proud to have natural facilities which can lead to high quality tourism, in many cases is being destroyed by thousands of tonnes of litter.  It is amazing that people will drive several miles before they dump their rubbish. It should be a social sin to destroy our environment by this kind of pollution. There is a clear need for a strong education programme both in our schools and in our homes to ensure that the countryside is not destroyed in this way. We have a strong tourist potential but it must be developed in a planned and coordinated way.</P>
    <P>The present Mayoman of the Year, a well known archaeologist, is developing the oldest stone-age site in the world. That project has been assessed by the Taoiseach and grant-aided due to his interest, and I thank him for it.  Many other voluntary projects have to compete on shoe string budgets and these could lead to related economic activity in an area such as north Mayo.  Twenty miles from where the Ceide Fields project is being developed, a social employment scheme together with other minor financial assistance schemes are trying to develop a major golf course, a hotel complex and so on.  On the east coast private developments whether it be Straffan House of Mount Juliet, which are capable of attracting funding of the order of £6 million and £10 million, will cater for the other end of the corporate scale.  If we are to develop our tourism facilities then we have to do it in a related economic fashion.  One project leads to another and they should all be encouraged and given the best possible assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Brennan, in reply to a question to me recently, said <Col N="1243" /> he was willing to meet the operators of multi-channel television systems throughout the country.  Several hundreds of thousands of Irish homes now receive multi-channel viewing by the deflector system.  The Government propose to impose further charges on these people and an annual charge by the introduction of the MMDS system.  I am glad to note that the Minister said he is prepared to meet with the operators of those interested in multi-channel services.  It behoves those people to ensure that when they do meet him, they are in a position to provide him with a set of criteria and objectives and a running method together with a cost structure which would enable him to say that we can leave well enough alone here provided it is monitored and acceptable to the vast majority of people. I welcome this move and hope this problem can be dealt with by common sense. If conditions and certain strictures are applied to the present deflector operators, the vast majority of people outside the Pale who now receive multi-channel services through deflector systems will be quite happy.  The MMDS system does not operate in rural Ireland.  Hundreds of thousands of people who receive multi-channel services at present are happy with what they have.</P>
    <P>A certain arrogance appears to be creeping into some Departments.  I am aware that my own county council made several formal approaches to Ministers for deputations to deal with matters ranging from storm damage, to road improvements to the provision of third level courses and so on.  All these requests were formally acknowledged by the Ministers concerned at least 12 months ago and no deputation has yet been arranged. It is possible for a deputation from an island community to be met at the drop of a hat.  Where local authorities make formal declarations to Ministers that they would like to meet them about various matters, they should be honoured as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, will ensure that the recommendations which are to be put <Col N="1244" /> by the British-Irish Association to their counterparts and to both Governments for further funding and facilities for our emirgrants will be met as far as possible. The Progressive Democrats element of the Government appear to have some heartaches about backing the Government, and the chairman of that party makes his remarks known constantly about how the Government are not moving fast enough for them, but you are either in this game or you are not, and if the Progressive Democrats cannot stand the heat they have the answer.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that this Government would press on and take note of what is said here by various speakers &mdash; it is not possible to deliver everything in a short time &mdash; but it is necessary to work constantly at the perception of our country as an attractive place in which to work and live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the last remarks made by Deputy Kenny I hope to address that subject at some length later.  I compliment the Minister for Finance on introducing the Finance Bill before the House: I cannot recall whether it is his third or his fourth.  Nevertheless, I am on firmer ground congratulating him on his outstanding successful record of economic management since his arrival at the Department in 1988.  It must be recalled that that success was achieved against a very difficult background.  On the economic front we had an almost unsustainable national debt as a result of four years of mismanagement since 1982. The Minister also has to operate within the constraints of the legal necessity to bring our tax laws into line with those of our European partners because of our accession to the Single Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite those difficulties and constraints, the record of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, and both Governments of which he was a member, is truly outstanding.  That is not just my opinion, it is not just the opinion of local commentators, it is acknowledged worldwide. The record of successive Governments since a Fianna Fáil Minister came back to the Department of Finance in <Col N="1245" /> 1987 has been the envy of the entire European Community.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will recall, in 1989 we changed the scheme to try to help early school leavers and the long term unemployed.  At that stage we tried to move away from just an economic aim to encourage employers to recruit the disadvantaged groups.  We increased the number of weeks for which employers received payment from 24 to 39 and adjusted the payments for the longer-term unemployed.  With the recruitment drive that followed the number increased but has gone back again to the previous plateau.  I am still uncertain as regards the numbers involved.  This is a matter that requires continuing consideration. There is not a great interest by some employers in the scheme but others use it all the time.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that over 100,000 people are now on the live register for one year or more and in some cases for over three years, is the Minister satisfied that a direct intervention mechanism such as the employment incentive scheme which is directly available to him succeeds in taking from the live register only 1,500 people or fewer?  Has the Minister any plans in this regard to deal with the problem of the long term unemployed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of intervention schemes are used.  This scheme is a direct subsidy to employers.  It operates on the basis that for 39 weeks an employer receives £60 a week if he takes on a long term unemployed person.  Last year we started a number of new schemes through FÁS targeting 1,000 firms, but the number of employers who use the scheme is still disappointing.  Recently we have been trying to see precisely what attractions we can provide to get employers to use what is from their point of view a good scheme.  Numerous schemes have been used over the years but it is still very difficult to generate enough activity in this area.  However, we are trying to improve the scheme.  It is disappointing that even though employers receive £60 per week when they employ a long term unemployed person, they still opt to take somebody straight from the school system and thereby receive no subsidy at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 9 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The funding available for the social employment scheme in 1991 is £67 million approximately comprising £58 million approximately Exchequer resources and EC assistance of £9 million.  This level of funding will allow an average of 10,700 participants on the scheme each week during the year of whom over 10,000 will be new people starting in 1991.  This level of funding is evidence of the Government's commitment to the long term unemployed and there are no plans to provide further funding this year.</P>
      <P>The scheme is the principal manpower intervention to assist older long term unemployed persons.  I have no plans to change the eligibility conditions of the scheme to allow participation by persons aged between 20 and 25 as this could only be done at the expense of those whom the scheme was designed to assist.</P>
      <P>I have already advised the House that I intend to carry out a review of the allowances payable under the scheme later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that the Minister concentrated on the question of funding. Is he aware that to some extent the purpose of the scheme is being undermined by the fact that in the highest unemployment areas there seems to be the lowest uptake of the scheme?  For example, is the Minister aware that as a proportion of the live register there is an uptake of 11.1 per cent in the midlands region and over 8 per cent in the western region but in the area of Dublin West and Kildare the uptake is just over 3 per cent? Does the Minister consider that this disproportionate uptake as a proportion of the live register in some of the areas <Col N="1249" /> where unemployment is most endemic is a cause for a review of the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke about the review I was talking primarily about the operation of the scheme in terms of the age of participants.  The quota is worked out on the basis of a percentage of the live register.  The discrepancy arises in that a greater number of areas used the local authority social employment schemes from the outset.  There have been a number of changes in the allocation to each region based on who used the local authority schemes, and that has created discrepancies.  In the last few years I have made a number of adjustments to those schemes.  For example, Cork and Waterford opted out and we transferred their quotas to other areas.  It is true that some of the areas of highest unemployment are not getting the higher quota.  That is based on the fact that when they had a higher quota they did not take it up.  In the last year or so we adjusted the figures on a quarterly basis if it seemed that the full annual quota would not be taken up.  I think that is the best way to operate the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that some of the areas of highest unemployment were not taking up the higher quota when they had it.  Does that not confirm that it is the older, more established communities that are best capable of taking advantage of a scheme like this? When you look at an area like Dublin West, some of which I happen coincidentally to represent, where the communities are new and the infrastructure that exists in other parts of the country does not exist there, that is being further disadvantaged by the fact that it does not have the mechanisms to avail of schemes like this.  Has the Minister any intention of reviewing the rates that people who participate in these schemes can claim arising from the fact that that also seems to be an obstacle to participation in certain cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the second part of the question, we will again review <Col N="1250" /> the rates this year.  We had a number of debates at various Question Times about adult and child dependants.  Over the last two years we have moved from a position where about 17 per cent would have had only one dependant &mdash; or none &mdash; to one where 48 per cent have dependants.  The scheme has worked well because it was targeted more to the long term unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The £11 per child is an incentive.  Before this there was no child allowance and a person would lose money on social welfare.  However, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of older, long term unemployed who could not benefit from the scheme unless they were single.  In relation to the new integrated area and company schemes, the lack of a sponsor in areas of high unemployment militates against using the numbers.  It is very difficult at times to organise a sponsor even given the builtin services in the scheme.  However, using the new company base, there is no reason for them not being able to use the quota; FÁS are involved in the national co-ordination group for companies and they should be able to help.  I am glad FÁS are involved because some people have been able to hog the system as a result of the non-compliance of some local authorities in the scheme which went on for a number of years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 10 and 30 together.  Last year I established a task force on child care services for working parents to advise me on the potential for early practical action to develop a number of prototypes of child care services appropriate to Irish conditions.  The task force are also to identify measures other than child care services which can be pursued by employers and workers to help workers combine family responsibilities and career.</P>
      <P>The task force submitted an interim report to me some time ago recommending that their membership should be extended to include a representative each from the Federation of Irish Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This has been done and I expect a final report shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will no doubt be aware of the important advance made in respect of the <Col N="1252" /> public service on this matter under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> It has been agreed that child care facilities will be provided on the basis of the State providing the physical space and staff paying the running costs.  Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> it has been agreed that the Government will continue to encourage the provision on a progressive basis, of child care services for workers in the public service.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government's role in relation to child care services in the private sector is to stimulate the development of such services by employers individually and collectively including partnerships between public authorities and employers, and by private sector organisations rather than actually to provide the services.  I expert the task force to make recommendations in this area.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the questions of provision of child care facilities by employers and flexible working arrangements, career breaks and other such schemes are appropriate matters for negotiation between the social partners.</P>
    <P>For my part I have emphasised to FÁS the importance of training programmes to facilitate entry and reintegration of women into the labour market and I have focused more and more in recent times on training in the new technologies and the non-traditional areas, in this way reducing the barriers to women's access to the labour market.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that some financial assistance may become available from the Community very soon for the provision of child care facilities which operate in conjunction with the provision of training for women and the creation of small businesses and co-operatives by women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply and I hope some of the recommendations can be implemented at an early date.  Will the Minister accept that a major change of attitude is required on the part of employers in this area?  Is he aware of the grave difficulties which arise for many women in regard to prospective employers, and indeed the Department <Col N="1253" /> of Social Welfare, because they are asked at interviews how many children they have and who will mind them if they are successful in getting a job?  Will the Minister also accept that those questions would not be asked of a man applying for the same job or, indeed, for social welfare benefits?  What will the Minister do to try to change that attitude?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken many times on the need for a change in attitudes. However, in the last 12 months the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federation of Irish Employers have issued positive action programmes and have been endeavouring to promote such a concept with employers.  We debated this matter last year in the House but there was very little action by the organisations. A number of companies are now establishing crèches in the workplace and have brought in more flexible arrangements for career breaks.  However, I admit that a minority of companies are involved and I agree with the Deputy that much more needs to be done.  I should also like to refer to the European schemes under which there is an opportunity to get funding, particularly in relation to people who wish to get back into the workplace.  If they are training there is provision for funding, which will dramatically help them.  The FÁS back to work schemes for women have been highly successful and the same applies to the participation of women in training programmes.  There has been a dramatic increase in participation by women over the last five years.</P>

      <P>In relation to the establishment of crèches in the workplace, will the Minister say what success he has had in relation to other Government Departments? We should set a good example in this regard.  There is a large staff in Leinster House, including a high percentage of married women.  Perhaps the best example the Minister could give is to establish a crèche in the building since it is his responsibility to provide the space.  The same applies to semi-State bodies and local authorities and if this was done perhaps it would give the lead to the private sector since they always follow the public sector in these matters. What progress has been made?</P>

I agree with him that they are very successful indeed from the level of participation and the reports on how interesting they are.

      <P>I do not have the figures. I particularly spoke about the back to work course, not the others.  The ordinary training scheme is not that brilliant but the one designed for going back to work is extremely good.  Normally the people who take that course are women who have worked for a great number of years, are married and have reared a family or are in the process of rearing a family and come back.  One could argue that they would have the qualifications but the figures on that are remarkably high and the demand to go on that course is remarkably high: it is not as high as the normal training courses.</P>

      <P>In respect of Question No. 30 which the Minister has encompassed in his reply, he did not make any reference to whether it is intended to expand the membership of the task force. I am not sure how many people comprise the task force as it stands.  Arising from the Minister's remark about the success of the back to work schemes for women, is he aware that a number of those schemes collapsed some four or five months ago, one to my certain knowledge because the instructors who were temporary employees were disemployed.  As a result of that one group of women, 14 people, had done half the course and some five or six months later there has been no attempt to get them together to complete the course.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputies is set out in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of redundancies notified to my Department in the first quarter of 1991 was 4,343 compared with 3,503 for the corresponding period in 1990. This increase may be explained by the notification by a number of firms of significant <Col N="1258" /> redundancies in the early part of this year.  In general terms, these redundancies could be said to be attributable to factors such as the global recession, rationalisation, loss of markets and the temporary dislocation of business due to the Gulf crisis.  It will be noted, however, that the average figure for notified redundancies in the first quarter of the years 1989-91 &mdash; 3,947 &mdash; represents a drop of more than a third on the average figure for the corresponding periods in the years 1985-88-6,208.</P>

    <P>The above figures relate to notifications of proposed redundancies under the Redundancy Payments Acts and not to actual redundancies.  They do not, therefore, include certain categories of employees which do not come within the scope of the Redundancy Payments Acts; employees with less than two years' eligible service with an employer, employees who are under 16 years of age or who have reached the qualifying age of old age pension, or employees who work less than 18 hours per week.</P>

      <P>The question of analysing returned emigrants in the live register is another matter.  The figures are an increase on last year.  I have the list of companies.  In the first part of the year, particularly the first six weeks and even more particularly in the two or three weeks after the commencement of the Gulf crisis, a number of firms notified the Department of redundancies.  The figures are always notified as redundancies but for the purposes of comparison I take it that they were subsequently made redundant because that is the only fair comparison one can make.  A high number of those jobs were in the computer area. They would include the workers in Digital and Packard.  There was a high number of those in the first six weeks.  I would be hopeful that that trend will not continue.  Last year we had the lowest number of redundancies since 1969 or 1970, just over 13,000.  It would be hard to equal that again, but I do not see <Col N="1259" /> any massive increase in the figures for industries for the months of March or April.</P>

      <P>There is a social welfare figure for those on three day weeks.  The redundancies occurred very much in the computer area.  I suppose there were reasons for that.  Digital, Packard and Wang were the big companies.  The computer industry, both in the last quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year has shown a high fall out.  It did not go across the board.  There is no estimate of unnotified redundancies.</P>

      <P>The Ballymun Job Centre was set up in 1986 with assistance from the Youth Employment Agency and other State and private agencies.  On its establishment in 1988, FÁS took over responsibility for the YEA element of the centre's funding.</P>

    <P>Accompanied by FÁS and departmental officials, I met a deputation from the centre in February last for a general <Col N="1260" /> discussion on the centre's operations. Ballymun is one of the pilot areas selected under the integrated areas programme introduced under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It will be a matter for the Central Review Committee for that programme together with FÁS to decide what role the job centre might play in the company to be set up to manage the Ballymun pilot project.</P>

      <P>I was not involved in the establishment of the centre.  It was set up in 1986 and Fine Gael, who were in Government at that time, were involved in the initial funding.  I will continue to support the centre which is in an area of particularly high unemployment. This centre which undertakes an active part in the local community is one of the job centres which has impressed me.  The Jesuit Order, who work and live in the area, and business people in town are actively involved in the centre.  While the centre is doing a good job, we have to ensure that its work is integrated into the schemes being run by FÁS.  I have no difficulty with the centre which I believe will play a major role in new company.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>In line with a commitment under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> I have considered the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Worker Participation. The major recommendation of the committee related to the introduction of worker participation in the private sector and while there was a majority in favour of enabling legislation a minority favoured a voluntary approach.  In the absence of consensus I do not feel that the legislative approach would be appropriate.</P>
      <P>On the basis of discussions which I had with the ICTU and the FIE it was agreed that the question of worker participation in the private sector might best be progressed by way of discussions between both sides under the Employer-Labour Conference.  These discussions are ongoing and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> includes a commitment to the publication of an FIE-ICTU joint declaration on employee involvement in the private sector shortly. I hope this initiative will encourage the development of employee involvement throughout the private sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the recent decision by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to privatise the Sugar Company has done more to discourage worker participation in the private sector than anything else in that he would not allow the continuation of worker-directors in the new company, Greencore?  That decision must have been a headline to the private sector to turn their faces against any possible move towards participation by workers at the highest level.</P>

      <P>Worker-directors will remain part of that company but I think, having been involved in the discussions, they believe that they will not be involved <Col N="1262" /> in the main action.  I am very anxious to promote co-operation and partnership between the FIE and ICTU in the private sector so as to encourage worker participation. Even though these discussions are ongoing, the joint declaration will produce models and systems of worker participation which will work.  Some of these models and systems are already in existence in the private sector but others are not.  I do not think I have any need to tell Deputy Kavanagh that the private sector do not agree with full board participation. There are a number of other models in the public sector.  I extended the number of agencies with full board participation and brought in 38 State institutions which have sub-board structures. That is the policy I have pursued.</P>

      <P>Hopefully we will reach that question.  Having regard to the very poor performance in recent years of worker participation in the private sector, may I ask the Minister if he considers it wise to rule out the legislative approach?  Does all the evidence not point in the direction that unless legislative action is taken by the Government it is unlikely that, on a voluntary basis, there will be any significant stepping up of worker participation, which I believe most enlightened countries in Europe consider to be a valuable contribution to economic growth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This would not be the best week to support the concept of worker-directors. However, leaving that short term issue aside, I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that there are a number of very good models on the European scene.  Depending on what is contained in the joint declaration, we will probably make more progress if we continue with our present approach.  Both the FIE and ICTU put a lot of work into this issue at <Col N="1263" /> senior level at the Basil Chubb Conference.</P>
      <P>While I do not want to prejudice the joint declaration, I believe that if we introduce legislation in this area we will run the risk of having two board meetings for every board.  I have spoken to my colleagues in the Social Affairs Council and they told me this has happened in other countries.  I do not think that is the way to progress.  If the joint declaration is substantial and workable we should try that for a while.  I have been a great advocate of sub-board level participation. I know from experience that it is far better to have sub-board participation first, to make that work and then go on to full board participation. This is better than going the other way around as the other system is fraught with difficulties.</P>

      <P>Following the completion of an inquiry into an application by the Irish Distributive and Administrative Trade Union and the Irish National Union of Vintners, Grocers and Allied Trades Assistants, the Labour Court made an Establishment Order setting up a Joint Labour Committee for the Retail, Grocery and Allied Trades, with effect from 2 April 1991.  The Labour Court has sought nominations for appointment to the committee from the trade unions and employer bodies, and I am in the process of appointing an independent chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once established, the committee will draw up proposals for fixing rates of pay and the conditions of employment for the workers concerned and when these proposals have been ratified by the Labour Court through the making of an <Col N="1264" /> Employment Regulation Order they become statutory minimum pay and statutory conditions of employment for the workers concerned.  It is estimated that there are 28,000 workers employed in the sectors covered by the new Joint Labour Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister to enlighten the House further on the scope of the new Joint Labour Committee? For example, can he assure the House that the corner shop, where there has been a great deal of exploitation of low paid labour, sometimes related to the family enterprise allowance scheme, is included within the scope of this order? Is he satisfied that his Department will have available to them the manpower to enforce this order when it becomes operative?  Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to welcome this decision.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his support for this decision.  With regard to the areas covered, I have a long list of these which I can make available to the Deputy.  The reason I am anxious to establish the committee at an early date is that this is a new area and this committee will be different to the other Joint Labour Committees.  Both the Irish Distributive and Administrative Trade Union and the Irish National Union of Vintners, Grocers and Allied Trades Assistants made submissions on the workings of the committee.  It was agreed that once the committee are established a task force should be set up to draw up proposals on the employment regulations order which will lay down the minimum pay and statutory conditions of employment for the workers concerned.  The procedures which the Joint Labour Committee and the Labour Court must follow when making the Employment Regulation Order are set out in the Industrial Relations Act. It is estimated from the 1988 census of services that about 28,000 workers will be covered by the Joint Labour Committee for the Retail, Grocery and Allied Trades.  That will take in all the areas.  The objective of the census <Col N="1265" /> is to cover everyone so it will cover the areas the Deputy raised.</P>

In the case of one area there is a bar-grocery arrangement, where obviously one side is included and the other is not.  Will the Minister let us have the list he has, so that we can see what is involved as this is not simply a grocer's but other activities take place there.</P>

I would welcome suggestions on the list to ensure that it covers the full 1988 census as we are only setting up the committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The comprehensive package of measures for employment creation announced by me on 27 September 1989 took account of the Government's commitment to initiate special measures in urban disadvantaged areas as outlined in the <i>Programme for Government.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress to date in the implementation of these measures is as follows: Up to 29 March 1991, over 1,700 persons from urban disadvantaged areas have been recruited under the social employment scheme since September, 1989; £500,000 was provided from national lottery funds in 1990 to provide assistance towards the cost of materials for community youth training programme projects in urban disadvantaged areas.  The allocation was <Col N="1266" /> spent in 1990 on 26 CYTP projects in the urban disadvantaged areas; a special programme for older long term unemployed who left school without qualifications was initiated on a pilot basis.  To date, some 100 older early school leavers have been trained in community training workshops with the aid of specially designed curricula, where appropriate; grants of up to £20,000 have been made available under the community enterprise programme towards the cost of establishing workspaces in disadvantaged areas generally; FÁS are taking a lead role in organising and encouraging community projects and in getting sponsors for Teamwork, SES, CYTP in the disadvantaged areas.  FÁS are encouraging local groups to undertake projects by liaising with community leaders, promoting projects through local media and giving resources for training in project management skills.</P>
    <P>The package also included a number of other measures which will benefit disadvantaged persons generally including payment of a training bonus of £10 per week to trainees with dependants and revamping and redirecting the employment incentive scheme towards the long term unemployed, early school leavers and other disadvantaged persons and increasing the overall grant available to employers to recruit additional workers.</P>
    <P>The package also provided for a change in the payment system under the enterprise scheme where the weekly payment would be increased and paid over a shorter period in order to give greater assistance at the start up phase of the enterprise.  The training bonus and the increased payments under the enterprise scheme and the employment incentive scheme have been payable since 30 October 1989.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the provision of detailed information on particular measures would be a day to day matter for FÁS.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for an integrated approach to implement a community response in <Col N="1267" /> particular areas to long term unemployment. The programme specifies that the approach will be piloted in both urban and rural areas in 1991 and on the basis of a satisfactory review, models will be progressively extended nationwide by 1994 as resources become available from a growing economy.  As the Deputy will be aware, 12 locations have already been selected for the pilot projects and it is hoped to have the local companies operational by the beginning of May.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that while all he read out sounds quite plausible and looks well on paper, having regard to the scale of the problem of unemployment in disadvantaged urban areas, it really is only scratching the surface? Is he aware of the alienation in this city in those pockets of endemic unemployment where vandalism and petty crime is rife at the moment?  Is he aware of the recent report of the chief welfare officer of Dublin Corporation?  Having regard to that complex, difficult, lasting problem, does he agree that the measures he has just read into the record are inadequate to cope with what is the most serious social problem confronting our society?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asked me for an update on the programmes and I have given it.  Enough is never done.  I am familiar with the problems involved as I represent a number of the areas with the highest unemployment in the country. When it comes to crime, unfortunately areas of my constituency manage to come No. 1 on the scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various integrated schemes are being run by FÁS and in many of these areas the only activity is the FÁS schemes. The new area based companies which we are setting up are based on 18 people, six from employers, six from trade unions and six from the local community to try to promote training, enterprise, skills and advancement into real jobs.  This is the way to go.  We are making slow progress but I do not agree with the Deputy that <Col N="1268" /> what is happening is not useful.  The new area based schemes are badly needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>How long will these pilot projects last if they are found to be successful, and can they be regarded as of general application because every town and village has disadvantaged areas?  Surely these areas can look forward to the general application of the scheme if it is successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The advantage of the system is the integration of the substantial amounts of State funds which go into these areas in one form or another. We have not had integration in order to gain results.  The administrative costs of the company will be paid and the company will operate with its own staff and secretariat which will be answerable to the national committee.  All the statutory and voluntary agencies in an area will work on one criterion instead of, as we had, three organisations in the one area trying in different ways to build the same type of community centre.  I cannot say if the company system will work but it is forcing an identification of the problems and the integration of the resources to try to tackle the problem which, as Deputy Rabbitte said, is very serious in certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that the Minister is trying to do something about this but does he not agree that the scale of the problem is so great that there are huge areas of this city which have become &ldquo;no go&rdquo; areas for the gardaí, priests, social workers and so on and that what is needed rather than bland prescriptions and pilot projects is a major dynamic crash programme to tackle the problem immediately?  The problem is of frightening proportions and as Deputy Rabbitte says there seems to be a subculture of crime that needs urgent remedial action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about any of the areas being &ldquo;no go&rdquo; for some of the categories mentioned, but there is no part of my area which is &ldquo;no go&rdquo; for <Col N="1269" /> me.  The problem is not that bad.  There is high unemployment and social deprivation and there are distinct disadvantages in some areas.  It is traditional in some areas.  This must be tackled in an integrated way.  I do not say that the schemes to which I referred will eliminate all the problems, but they help.  The community workshop scheme is particularly useful because the people trained in such workshops tend to find jobs.  What we need to do is redirect money towards schemes which will be of help in taking people out of traps.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>At my request FÁS undertook a review of the current apprenticeship system and subsequently made recommendations to me on a proposed new system based on standards reached rather than time served.</P>
      <P>The main recommendations are now contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> negotiated between Government and the social partners.</P>
      <P>Funding arrangements have still to be finalised.  Paragraph 126 of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for the funding for the new system to be discussed by the Government with the trade union and employer organisations in the Central Review Committee of that programme.  These discussions are now in progress.</P>
      <P>I have asked FÁS to complete the non-funding arrangements for the new system as quickly as possible so that it can be introduced as soon as the funding arragements are agreed.  Implementation of the proposed new system will be a day to day matter for FÁS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking the initiative and revamping <Col N="1270" /> the system.  What I would like to know is whether the new system will be in operation for the apprentices currently being recruited.  It is a scandal that in recent years some of the finest talent in this country ended up in builders' yards in Great Britain because they were unable to take part in apprenticeship courses here.  Indeed, some apprenticeship courses were undersubscribed because employers did not have the money to sponsor apprentices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the Deputy's interest in this matter which he has followed closely and thank him for his support.  The intention is to have this system operating in as many areas as possible as quickly as possible.  As I mentioned in the House some months ago&mdash; perhaps the position is not as bad now&mdash; the funding arrangements have still to be finalised.  If it is not possible for employers to pay a levy to meet the cost of training apprentices &mdash; this now appears to be a lost cause &mdash; it is only reasonable that those sectors which mainly use apprentices should pay one.  I am trying to make progress on this matter.  There is no doubt that there is a number of people who would find employment in this country if they could take part in apprenticeship schemes.  It is only right therefore that employers should make a contribution towards the cost, not the full amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that it will now be possible for a person to get on a scheme without being sponsored by an employer?  Some people who get top marks in aptitude tests and at interviews are missing out because they cannot get a sponsor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  We are trying to eliminate this bias in the system as a result of which those in the know rather than those with ability get places. We are also trying to move away from the traditional system, under which a person served as an apprentice for a number of years, to a new system based on standards achieved rather than time served.</P>

      <P>As I said in my initial reply, discussions on most of the main points have been concluded.  However, the funding arrangements have still to be finalised.  I stated in reply to Deputy Higgins that we hope to have the system in place in as many areas as possible by the start of the next academic year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very anxious to do this.  However, it should be said that there is strong resistance to change in some sectors; I will not say which ones.  On the best advice available to me, those fears are ill-founded.  The scheme of apprenticeships in this country is probably the most narrow in all of Europe; the schemes in other countries are much broader.  We should avail of this opportunity to expand the schemes but I cannot say if the new system will be in operation by September, given the resistance to this move.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>Twelve pilot areas have been selected on the basis of recommendations made by the Central Review Committee to participate in the area-based response to long term unemployment outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> These are: Dublin Inner City, Tallaght, Coolock/Darndale, Finglas, Ballymun, Cork North City, Limerick City, Dundalk, North Mayo, South Kerry, West Waterford and South West Wexford.</P>
      <P>A national level team representative of the employer organisations, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, FÁS, the Departments of Education, Social Welfare and the Taoiseach has been established to organise the project and to monitor and co-ordinate the activities of individual local companies.  This team, which will report to the Central Review Committee, will operate initially on a whole-time basis.  The team is at present engaged in a series of meetings with representatives of local communities and other interests, including the unemployed, from the selected areas with a view to hearing their views on the formation of local companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local companies will be companies limited by guarantee and representative of local community interests, public agencies and the social partners &mdash; six each.  Representatives of the public agencies and the social partners will be locally based or related as far as possible.  In the recent budget £500,000 was made available to provide for the staffing of the local companies in 1991.  As indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> a specific budget will be prepared by the relevant public authorities <Col N="1273" /> for each participating local area.  This budget will flow from a local action plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Could it possibly be that the Minister has not included any part of Country Wicklow in the list?  Many areas of the county, such as Arklow, have witnessed the departure of major industries during the past ten years and I cannot imagine the rate of unemployment in the areas listed measuring up to the rate of unemployment in Country Wicklow.  Given that Country Wicklow has one of the highest rates of unemployment outside of Dublin, the Minister should, in all fairness, consider including the country in the list.  If we have to be the thirteenth, so be it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>At present in areas where there is high unemployment many State agencies are involved &mdash; for example FÁS, the Departments of Education and the Environment and the local authorities.  The statutory agencies, the social partners and local community leaders, such as employment centres, will form part of the company and work to a fixed plan.  They will try to co-ordinate the various schemes and to involve employers in the locality or region in the company to find jobs for those participating in schemes.  That us just a quick assessment of what they are doing.  The company would initially develop a plan of the area, the demographics, the geo-graphics, unemployment of the area, the social difficulties, and then work with the agencies if they are there.  If they are not there now they will be there.  They will try to identify what they can do and to resolve some of the difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea is interesting <Col N="1274" /> and deserves a trial.  I did not say the various schemes the Minister read out were not useful; I said they were only scratching the surface.  In respect of these pilots, presumably the leadership of the co-ordination will be critical.  Does the Minister really think that allocating £0.5 million to 12 companies, if I heard him correctly, in other words £50,000 for staffing per company, is adequate to make any impact on the scale of the problem we have been talking about?  These are areas of unemployment that go over 60 per cent in some cases and that have terrible endemic social problems.  Really there is such alienation that people have given up hope of getting back into the workforce and are expecting and anticipating a response from private sector employers in the area and so on.  Is £50,000 sufficient to have the kind of staffing calibre that will elicit that response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of that £0.5 million will probably go in to the national committee. The State agencies then will have to second and fund individual members of staff.  The national team are comprised of just six people and are representative of the Irish Resource Development Trust, some people nominated by the ICTU who are involved actively in the unemployed centre, one individual from the Kildare centre for the unemployed, one of the senior FÁS people involved in such schemes, a person from the VECs, co-ordinator of the Central Review Committee and officials of the Department of Social Welfare.  Most of the administration of the £0.5 million will go into their activities, and the companies on the ground will then be able to approach the State companies for their funding.  No, I do not believe £0.5 million would be sufficient.  When we were negotiating at budget time £0.5 million was put into the Estimates to get the national committee under way.  It will take far more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not answer Deputy Kavanagh earlier on the pilot areas.  The idea would be to run these for seven months and review them towards the end of the year. From my experience of these training <Col N="1275" /> centres I imagine there will be teething problems in getting the schemes co-ordinated and working properly and identifying clearly what we are trying to do. In the initial period, maybe the first year or 18 months, there could be switching around of what we are trying to do, but there is a great role for public representatives and community leaders generally. The concept came from the programmes and from the views of a number of people.  Its success will be based on the amount of effort put in at all levels including the State Departments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by the Employment Equality Agency in their submission to the Commission on the Status of Women regarding FÁS activity in the area of training for women. I am satisfied, however, that FÁS have made significant progress in this area through their positive action programme in favour of women which has as one of its aims to encourage women to take up the full range of training opportunities available to them with particular emphasis being placed on participation by women in non-traditional areas.  Women are taking a greater share of FÁS training places than ever before.  Their participation has increased from 34 per cent some years ago to over 41 per cent now of all those completing training in 1990. I understand that FÁS are in the process of finalising an updated action programme for the period 1991-92 which will <Col N="1278" /> provide the basis for further progress in this area.</P>

      <Quest>if he intends to introduce any amendments to the Industrial Relations Act, 1989, in the light of the experience of employees of a company (details supplied) in Dublin 11 where the employers sought and received a High Court injunction which restricted the employees' ability to pursue their dispute and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The company involved in this dispute sought a High Court injunction in February last to prevent the picketing of its premises and also to restrain the union from inducing its members in other employments to breach commercial contracts by refusing to handle the company's products.  The High Court found the picket to be lawful but granted an interlocutory injunction against the inducement.  I understand that the unions concerned may test the issue in a full hearing of the High Court.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Relations Act, 1990 did not change the law in relation to breaches of commercial contracts and an injunction along the lines obtained in this case could have been obtained prior to the enactment of the Act.  In 1981 the Supreme Court granted an injunction to prevent the type of action in the Talbot case and in considering such applications the courts will always have to take into account the rights and obligations of all the parties involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not my intention to amend the Industrial Relations Act as it is my belief that it represents a balance, taking account of the rights and interests of both employers and trade unions.  To extend the Act to cover the inducement of breaches of commercial contracts would in my view be inappropriate and could place the immunities in the legislation in <Col N="1281" /> danger of being found to be unconstitutional.</P>

The dispute was rendered ineffectual by the securing of the interlocutory injunction to which the Minister refers.  While it is correct to say that it could have been secured under the old legislation, that was very rarely done.  The Talbot case was an exception.  It is regrettable that this legitimate trade dispute involving workers who were being paid in such a miserly fashion was rendered ineffective.

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reiterate my admiration for the Minister for Finance who has achieved outstanding success since his appointment to that Department in 1988, particularly in view of the background against which he had to operate and the constraints imposed on him by our forthcoming accession to the Single European Market.</P>
      <P>I must admit to a degree of confusion as to where the Opposition parties stand. Speakers from the Labour Party and The Workers' Party have been going into paroxysms of rage about the Minister's minor revival of the BES.  On the other hand, Fine Gael Deputies have worked themselves up to a high degree of indignation that the pre-budget position should have been departed from.  From these confusions and contradictions, it has clearly emerged that the Opposition parties are hopelessly divided in their fundamental approach to the economy, just as they were divided when they were in Government between 1982 and 1987.  It was that division which led to paralysis at the top level of economic management and caused many of the difficulties with which Fianna Fáil had to contend on coming into office in 1987.  As Deputy Martin suggested yesterday, there has been much false criticism but very few specifics.</P>
      <P>The main criticism of the Finance Bill is that the Minister is fiddling around with the tax bands and tax rates.  I want to put on record the actual effect of this Finance Bill on income tax.  The provisions of this Finance Bill will reduce the marginal rate of tax of nearly 700,000 taxpayers.  They will exempt 18,000 taxpayers with 23,000 children from liability to tax altogether and bring an additional 26,500 taxpayers, with 36,000 children, within the ambit of marginal relief.  This is the third consecutive year in which the Minister has substantially increased the exemption limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put the provisions of this Finance Bill in the context of what this Minister has done since assuming office three years ago.  Over the past three years the Minister has increased the general exemption limits by over 25 per cent.  In <Col N="1312" /> fact, the increase of 25 per cent applies only when a married couple or single person claims such exemption limit.  In the case of a married couple with three children the exemption limit has been increased by 44 per cent over the past three years.  In the case of a married couple with five children the exemption limit has been increased by over 60 per cent, again over the past three years.  Is that fiddling?</P>
    <P>In relation to tax rates, the standard rate of tax has been reduced in excess of 17 per cent over the past three years, the top rate having been reduced by over 10 per cent.  I do not know how anybody can describe that as mere fiddling.  In relation to the tax bands I might point out that the standard tax band has been extended over 40 per cent over the past three years which means that a progressively smaller proportion of taxpayers come within the higher tax rates.  People can describe that as mere fiddling around if they wish but they will forgive me if I take an entirely different interpretation.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill also contain a number of special measures with which the Minister has become synonymous in the public mind, sensitive measures, no great amount of votes in them, but directed to areas of need within the community. For instance, I welcome the innovation where a widow is entitled to claim an extra allowance of £1,500 in the year of her husband's decease.  There are those who would argue that that allowance should remain at the same level in the three years immediately following her bereavement.  I agree with the Minister's approach and the manner in which this allowance is being given.  If the allowance was maintained at a similar level over three years there would be a sudden cutoff giving rise to economic hardship and much explanation on the part of politicians to their constituents.  The allowance is being given on the recognition of the unusual financial hardship suffered by many widows on the death of their partners.  That allowance will be reduced to £1,000 in the following tax year and further reduced to £500 in the third tax year; in other words, the allowance <Col N="1313" /> granted to alleviate the immediate hardship when a widow's partner dies is reduced gradually.  I contend that is the proper way to do it and refute any criticism of the Minister for having done so in that manner.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the extension of rent relief for people of 55 years and over. Perhaps the Minister would clarify whether this relief applies to local authority tenants as well as those in private rented accommodation.  If it does not apply to local authority tenants, those people unfortunate enough to be in local authority accommodation over age 55 &mdash; and there are a good many of them in my constituency &mdash; would appear to be discriminated against unfairly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It applies to private rented accommodation only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Minister's innovation in the disabled driver's scheme I would ask him to re-examine the relevant section of this Bill to ensure that people who are disabled, in the commonly accepted sense of the word, qualify. There is a distinction to be drawn between a person who is disabled and another who is totally incapacitated.  The allowance would appear to be directed more at the latter and should include the former.  Because of his record in this area I know the Minister will be prepared to take a sympathetic look at that allowance.</P>
      <P>When one combines the substantial increases granted in the income tax exemption limits with the improvements announced by the Minister for Social Welfare in the family income supplement, it becomes clear that the Government are aware of the problems pertaining to what is commonly called the poverty trap and are making genuine, determined efforts to tackle that problem</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put one technical point to the Minister in relation to marginal relief. Would it be possible to grant marginal relief automatically to taxpayers who will be entitled to it?  I have come across many cases of people who would clearly be <Col N="1314" /> entitled to marginal relief &mdash; even bearing in mind the statutory increase in their social welfare entitlement &mdash; not granted such marginal relief but simply granted their tax-free allowances.  When they approach their local politician or whoever, their tax free allowances are adjusted, from which date marginal relief is applicable.  It is my fear that, through lack of knowledge about how the marginal relief system is operated &mdash; and it is a complicated system for somebody who knows nothing about income tax &mdash; people may be losing out.  I can understand the Minister's difficulties in this regard because, granting marginal relief in advance requires the Minister to foretell what will be a person's income for the ensuing income tax year.</P>
    <P>We had a similar debate in relation to the family income supplement on the Social Welfare Bill when the Labour Party pressed hard for the automatic granting of the family income supplement to certain workers when the same difficulty pertained.  It is virtually impossible to grant this allowance since one cannot foretell what will be a person's income for the coming year.  It must be remembered that it is a person's net income, after payment of certain overheads and expenditure, that renders them eligible for the family income supplement.  In the course of that debate Deputy Stagg suggested he could write a computer programme for the Department of Social Welfare which would enable them to automatically grant the family income supplement. Perhaps he would apply his skills to writing a computer programme for the Department of Finance to enable them grant marginal relief in advance. I do not know what type of computer programme that would be, but, if Deputy Stagg can write a computer programme which would foretell the future, then he has the potential of becoming a very rich man indeed, though being a socialist, perhaps he is not interested.</P>
    <P>There are some politicians going around this country like medieval town criers criticising the Minister for Finance on the slow pace of tax reform, by which they mean, of course, income tax <Col N="1315" /> reduction.  Some of those people are Members of this House and some are former Members who were not able to retain their seats, which is testimony to their political ability.  Those people are voicing their views in the media and at public meetings about 40 per cent and 25 per cent rates of income tax as though those two rates were some sort of holy grail which, once achieved, would mean all our problems would disappear into the mist whereas nothing could be further from the truth.  That argument is an illusion and is dishonest.</P>
    <P>With the benefit of figures supplied by the Department of Finance and a biro I could produce, on the back of an envelope, a 40 per cent and 25 per cent tax regime for the Minister for Finance yielding the same revenue from income taxation as obtains at present.  One could do it by fiddling around with the bands and allowances.  There is nothing magic about those two rates of tax.  What is important is that the Minister has been determined to maintain fiscal rectitude and/or budgetary discipline.  The confidence which had to be renurtured from 1987 onwards, since maintained by stringent fiscal measures on the part of the Government, is the cornerstone to the recovery of our economy.  We must preserve that confidence by maintaining that fiscal rectitude, budgetary discipline, call it what you will.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is the Government have made substantial progress toward reducing the crucial ratio between debt and gross national product.  That process must continue particularly in the light of the worsening international economic scene.  Nobody wants to revert to the bleak summer and winter of 1986 when despondency and despair were the order of the day, when there was not a penny being put into our economy, when virtually everything had ground to a standstill.  Substantial progress has been made, recognised by all independent commentators with no Fianna Fáil or Government connections, who have no axe to grind.  I might cite a recent report of O Riada Stockbrokers, of a Mr. <Col N="1316" /> McLoughlin of that firm &mdash; I think reported in yesterday's newspapers &mdash; which backed Government strategy to the hilt.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether those people who criticise the Minister for Finance, including those outside this House, would direct their minds to the consequences for this country if that carefully nurtured confidence, acquired so painfully over the past four years, suddenly evaporated, as it would assuredly, if the national debt slipped out of control again because of premature reductions in taxation.  What would be the consequences for the levels of taxation, interest rates and jobs?  What would be the consequences for the unemployed and the underprivileged?  I can assure those people that the consequences would be immediate and horrendous. We hear much talk about people preserving their identity.  I am all in favour of people preserving their identity; I am a nationalist, I believe in the identity of nations; I am anti-racist, I believe in the identity of every human individual and, by extension, I believe in the identity of political parties.  By all means preserve identity but do not seek to do it at the expense of the national interest or the people outside this House who have elected a Government to govern and who expect that Government to do the right thing for the economy and serve the national interest.</P>
    <P>In relation to capital gains tax I welcome the extension of the self assessment system to that tax.  It will improve the flow of revenue to the Exchequer and will get around a pretty undesirable situation which operates under the present system of assessment of capital gains tax.  When somebody sells property for a gain, in many cases only a national gain, he receives a communication from the Revenue Commissioners, three, four or five years down the road informing him to submit a return for capital gains tax purposes. In my experience this has caused a great deal of anxiety and anguish, not to mention expense, to taxpayers who often have no capital gains tax to pay.</P>
    <P>Under the new system of self assessment the onus is on the taxpayer to <Col N="1317" /> submit his capital gains tax return.  He must pay his preliminary tax on 1 November in the year following the year of assessment in which the gain is made and the balance of the capital gains tax three months later.  This is eminently more acceptable than the present system.  It will increase the flow of revenue to the Exchequer from the capital gains tax system and avoid a great deal of anguish, anxiety and expense for taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the relief which the Minister is introducing from capital gains tax on the disposal of business assets outside the family.  Representations have been made to the Minister by myself and, I am sure by others, about the problems which this provision has caused and the fact that it has not been increased.  Not only has the Minister responded generously to our representations, he has increased the allowance fourfold to £200,000 and I thank him for it.  He has introduced also a provision which will get around a particular problem &mdash; where there are very few votes &mdash; which causes severe hardship.  In order to qualify under this section of the capital gains tax provisions a person need no longer be a full-time working director for ten years, he need only be a full-time working director for five years of the ten years running up to the time in which the asset is disposed of.  That five year period need not be the period ending on the date of disposal of the asset.  That provision has caused hardship in individual cases.  I am aware of instances where working directors in a company became ill, they stayed on as directors but were interpreted by Revenue as not being working directors because they were not actively participating in the management of the business. They wanted to see whether they would recover their health sufficiently to go back into the business but in many cases that did not happen.  Eventually, when they sold their business they were held not to have been a full-time working director for ten years immediately preceding the date of sale of the asset.  The Revenue interpreted that provision in a nasty and inhumanitarian way.  I am <Col N="1318" /> delighted we are bringing in a provision to remedy that</P>
    <P>I welcome the reforms in the Bill in relation to capital acquisitions tax.  The top rate of capital acquisitions tax is reduced to 40 per cent.  When Deputy Dukes introduced the accumulation system of capital acquisitions tax in 1986 I argued at that time, from the Opposition benches, that that would prove confiscatory in many cases and that has proved to be the case.  The Minister has taken a dramatic step to take the confiscatory element out by reducing the top rate to 40 per cent.  He has increased the agricultural relief to 55 per cent but, because the price of farm land has not increased for many years, the cap of £200,000 remains.  That is only right and logical.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the provision to increase the test of what is a farmer from 75 per cent to 80 per cent.  It is not unreasonable to assume that if at least 75 per cent of somebody's assets consist of farming assets such as stock, machinery, and land they are almost invariably a full-time farmer.  I do not see the point in increasing the provision to 80 per cent. However, I do see a danger in it.  There are many cases where people who acquire property have no income bearing assets. If the value of property is artificially depressed, and if the value of those non-income bearing assets is momentarily artificially high, it may take the donee in that case out of the ambit of agricultural relief.  That could cause hardship in individual cases.  I ask the Minister to look again at that provision.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the capital acquisitions tax legislation whereby a person can avail of an insurance policy in relation to <i>inter vivos</i> dispositions is being introduced. That is only right, fair, logical and in harmony with the remainder of the capital acquisitions tax system.  Heretofore, that facility was afforded only to people who took an inheritance rather than a gift.  It is entirely logical that it should be extended to gifts.  In fact, it was illogical that it did not apply to gifts because the rate of gift tax is 25 per cent &mdash; only 75 per cent of what the rate of inheritance tax would be.  The supposed <Col N="1319" /> motivation of that differential was to encourage people to transfer property by way of gift rather than by way of inheritance. The extension of the insurance policy facility to gifts is entirely logical and in harmony with the differential in the rate of tax between gifts and inheritances.</P>
    <P>There has been much Opposition criticism of the changes in the business expansion scheme.  Certainly, the Minister made an announcement in relation to his intentions concerning the business expansion scheme in the budget.  The provisions in the Finance Bill are somewhat different. He has retreated somewhat &mdash; not very far &mdash; from his declared intentions at the time of the budget.  Budgets are not written on stone.  It would be a poor Minister for Finance who would come to the House in January, announce certain tax proposals and then say to the Department of Finance: &ldquo;go away and draft those proposals exactly as I announced them, we are not going to listen to or entertain any arguments, submissions or suggestions regardless of how reasonable or logical they may be.&rdquo;  A Minister for Finance who would act in that manner certainly would not have any respect and he would not deserve it.</P>
    <P>The budget announced by the Minister is not a bargaining counter but people are entitled to make reasonable and logical submissions on what will be in the Finance Bill when that has been signalled, as it is every year, in the budget speech. The difficulties we have had, and the slight embarrassment suffered in relation to the business expansion scheme, exposes a fundamental flaw in our income tax system.  Governments introduce tax allowances, and particular incentive schemes, in Finance Bills not just to be popular or for some altruistic motive but to direct investment to certain areas of the economy.  We have found, as has been found in Britain and continental countries, that sometimes people abuse those incentive schemes and use them for purposes for which they were never intended.  They use them to minimise their own taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> Part of that problem would be solved if we were to debate the Finance Bill properly in Committee.  I understand that in the United Kingdom a technical Finance Bill is introduced which is debated at length in committee.  If that were done here &mdash; I know of no constitutional or legal reason why it could not be done &mdash; many of the problems would be met and solved in advance.  I met people on the day after the business expansion scheme was put into law who pointed out to me ways of getting around it and ways in which it could be used which would have horrified the Minister and his officials.</P>
    <P>There is another way, in the present state of tax law in this country, of solving the problems of people using incentive schemes for purposes for which they were not intended and for which they should not be used.  There is a substantial anti-avoidance provision in the Finance Act, 1990, which has not yet been used, according to the information available to me.  Under that provision the Revenue Commissioners can send to a person a directive in relation to any scheme which they feel has no substantial benefit other than to avoid tax, and the onus will be on the taxpayer to prove that his attention is other than primarily tax avoidance.  If he cannot establish that to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners or ultimately the appeal commissioners, the scheme becomes null and void and there are penalties and disincentives built into it.  If the Minister were to direct the Revenue Commissioners to use that power more widely there would be much less abuse and we could freely bring in incentive schemes which would not have to have 12 or 13 pages of technical legislation to prevent people from abusing them.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme has been, by and large, successful.  The Minister referred at some length in his contribution to a survey carried out on the effects of the business expansion scheme, but of course it is impossible to calculate exactly how many jobs flow from any tax scheme.  That depends on other factors such as the climate of confidence in the economy, the state of the national <Col N="1321" /> finances and so on.  Deputy Rabbitte was very harsh in his criticism of the Minister for reviving the business expansion scheme albeit in a much watered-down state.  Deputy Rabbitte said that his concern is for PAYE workers.  Who does he think gives jobs to those PAYE workers? This is largely a private enterprise economy. If the experience of the Soviet Union and other economies in Eastern Europe since the Second World War has taught us anything it must be &mdash; although the message does not yet seem to have penetrated through to The Workers' Party &mdash; that the command economy structure does not work.  Economies work when people are given incentives to take risks, invest and create real jobs.</P>
    <P>The situation has arisen whereby The Workers' Party and people of the Left tend to focus on certain constituencies or certain sectors within the economy. There is no perception of the broad picture and no attempt to perceive or present it.  The broad picture is that many people who to my knowledge have availed of the provisions of the business expansion scheme are people who took risks and borrowed money.  Many of those people had to sign personal guarantees for banks and other financial institutions. If the schemes in which they are involved go wrong many of the people stand to lose their homes.  Nobody, least of all myself, is going to pretend that those people are taking risks for patriotic or altruistic motives.  Any economy that wants to grow and develop and create jobs depends on such people and such people must be encouraged to some extent at least to take risks.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme has been watered down considerably.  The total amount a company can raise is being reduced by 80 per cent, from £2.5 million to £500,000.  Certain asset-backed operations are being excluded from the scheme and this is only right and logical The original objective of the business expansion scheme was to direct investment into smaller riskier companies.  The exclusion of asset-backed businesses will achieve precisely this because it will improve 100 fold the chances of small <Col N="1322" /> riskier companies raising business expansion finance now that the larger asset-backed safer operations can no longer avail of it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Finance Bill represents a continuation of the Government's policy of careful and responsible economic management.  There are a few technical points that I want to bring to the Minister's attention on Committee Stage, but subject to that I have no hesitation in commending the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank all the Deputies who have contributed to the debate and to respond as comprehensively as I can in the time available to the major issues which were raised. Other points relating to individual sections of the Bill can be discussed in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In their contributions to this debate a number of Deputies, including both Deputy Noonan and Deputy Quinn, have Deputy Noonan and Deputy Quinn, have attempted to argue that the 1991 budget is no reliable basis for these allegations. It is exactly three months since the budget tragets were set.  I set out fully at that time the assumptions and forecasts that had been made in drawing up the budget. While some events since then have been more disappointing than hoped for, especially in relation to the live register figures, the budgetary strategy remains fundamentally sound.  As I made clear at budget time, there were unusual difficulties about this year's forecasts.  These concerned mainly the international situation but could be aggravated by a failure to keep to responsible policies at home.  The Government are determined to play their part in keeping to a steady course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated on a number of occasions, most recently in my opening <Col N="1323" /> speech on Second Stage last Tuesday, growth is likely to slow down markedly this year compared with 1989 and 1990, mainly because of weaker growth in Ireland's export markets.  This will inevitably have an adverse impact on domestic demand here at home.  We took this into account in formulating our budget targets and projected that our growth rate in 1991 would be less than half that in 1990.</P>
    <P>There have been some questions about our overall growth prospects for this year. I would have to say that there is very little by way of hard data in relation to 1991 at present.  Certainly, it is too early yet to draw firm pointers from tax returns to date.  Firstly, the PESP and budget related increases in disposable incomes have yet to come through; secondly, the year to year change in tax yields for the first quarter must be adjusted for the reduction in tax rates in the 1990 budget; thirdly, the January retail sales figures indicated continuation of strong growth in non-garage retail sales but a substantial year-to-year decline in vehicle sales.  This was not unexpected, given the Gulf crisis. It remains to be seen whether vehicle sales will recover as the year goes on and as the uncertainty, particularly regarding investment and tourism prospects, associated with the Gulf crisis diminishes.</P>
    <P>It has to be acknowledged that since January the short term outlook for the important British economy has weakened. In his budget statement on 19 March the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer forecast a fall of 2 per cent in UK GDP this year.  The previous forecast, made by his predecessor last November, was for a rise of ½ per cent. The principal effect of the slower growth abroad combined with the effect on emigration of a weaker labour market in the UK and the US has been higher unemployment here &mdash; the figures here are estimated in some quarters as ranging between 16,000 and 18,000 &mdash; despite, and I should stress this point, the further rise in employment.  As Minister for Finance, I may have to provide for a somewhat higher average live register figure, <Col N="1324" /> perhaps 10,000 to 12,000 more, than provided for in the budget.  This would imply that we will inevitably have to keep a tight rein on other spending in order to meet our budgetary targets.</P>
    <P>The pattern of tax revenue in the first quarter was broadly as expected.  We always anticipated that receipts would be sluggish over the first half of the year. But consumer spending should recover as confidence returns and disposable incomes benefit from the PESP and other increases and from the recent reductions in interest rates.</P>
    <P>The slowdown in economic growth this year should not blind us to the tremendous progress we have made in recent years in improving the economic fundamentals. With lower public borrowing and inflation, and with strengthened competitiveness, we are much better placed than more developed economies to cope with the less favourable international environment.  In recent years our economic growth rate has bettered that of our trading partners.  I remain confident that this year too we can achieve substantial output growth &mdash; as good as, if not better than, the EC average.  We are also well-placed to extract maximum benefit from the recovery, when it comes.</P>
    <P>This position of strength, of course, assumes that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will make a strong contribution to the stability of the economic climate at home.  The current ESB dispute, were it to continue, could introduce an element of risk to our economic fundamentals, and I am sure that I reflect the views of all sides of this House when I say that a speedy return to work is imperative for the wellbeing of our economy and for our credibility abroad.</P>
    <P>I said in the budget speech that if any of the various imponderables should develop unfavourably this year, the Government would not be slow to take whatever action is needed.  That remains the position.</P>
    <P>The use of the proceeds of sale of State assets was also raised in the debate.  I have gone over this ground many times before.  We are dealing here with capital <Col N="1325" /> receipts.  I cannot accept that the proceeds of sale of shares or of other assets should be treated as having any bearing on the current budget deficit except to the extent that debt servicing costs, which are met on the current budget, reflect the reduced borrowing on the capital side of the equation where the realisation of these assets are accounted for as a component of Exchequer capital resources. As such, there will of course be an impact on the Exchequer borrowing requirement; but, as I indicated very clearly in my Budget Statement, the expected proceeds from the Irish Life disposal have not been allowed for in the budget target EBR and the underlying EBR will be readily and transparently identifiable.</P>
    <P>While on the topic of the sale of State assets, Deputy Quinn mentioned an interview which I gave on RTE radio on Sunday last.  If he was listening he would have heard me say that the question of the sale of the ICC was under examination and that the possibility of selling the ACC in a year or two was also a live option.</P>
    <P>As far as the sale of other, more substantial, bodies is concerned, there are no specific proposals in this regard before the Government at present.  However, the matter will be considered in the coming months in the context of the programme of asset sales which I announced last year and which I also mentioned in the interview.</P>
    <P>Turning now to interest rates, I can assure Deputy Quinn that there is no lack of trust between myself and my Department on the one hand and the Central Bank on the other.  I am satisfied with the existing statutory arrangements governing interest rates.  I made my position very clear on this as late as last Thursday when replying to a question from Deputy Pat Rabbitte.  Let me repeat: I believe the fact that the Central Bank has statutory responsibility for monetary policy has served us well and I am not in favour of changing that position.</P>
    <P>The operation of market forces under the supervision of the Central Bank has, in general, proved satisfactory.  There is <Col N="1326" /> no conflict between the role of the Central Bank and the fact that on one occasion recently I felt it necessary to express disappointment that a reduction in deposit rates had been notified by a building society without a similar reduction in lending rates.  As the House will be aware this situation was quickly corrected by the building society in question.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i> suggested that I could insist that the margin between deposit rates and lending rates be cut right across the spectrum of interest rates.  However, he then asks for more intense competition.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that his proposal that I intervene to insist that margins be reduced is hardly consistent with the encouragement of competition based on market forces.  As the Deputy is aware, there has been a significant increase in the amount of competition among Irish financial institutions in recent years and the margins enjoyed by banks have been narrowing.  The recent building society and Trustee Savings Bank Acts have further increased the scope for competition between financial institutions.</P>
    <P>As I told the House last Thursday in reply to a question from Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i> I am informed by the Central Bank that real interest rates in Ireland, as measured by the prime lending rate deflated by consumer prices, are not the highest in the EC.</P>
    <P>Personal lending rates of course move in line with the prime rate.  For example, Irish prime lending rates, in inflation adjusted terms, are lower than those in Denmark and Belgium and are approximately the same as those in Germany and the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>As regards fiscal measures, the House will be well aware of the very considerable progress already been made in reducing the EBR and the debt as a percentage of GNP.  The Government are committed to building on this progress and reducing the debt/GNP ratio towards 100 per cent by 1993 and, as part of this, to achieve broad balance in the current budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1327" /> There have also been accusations that we are making little progress on tax reform.  In fact, of course, substantial progress has been made.  As I pointed out in my opening address on the Bill, in recent years the general exemption limits have been increased by nearly 25 per cent, and in some cases by over 60 per cent when the child addition is taken into account.  The standard rate has been cut by over one-sixth and the top rate by over one-tenth, while the standard band has been extended by over 40 per cent.  If these advances are only juggling, as described by Deputy Rabbitte, then I am sure the PAYE sector would welcome more of it.</P>
    <P>In this context I would like to take up the point made by several Deputies that what really matters is the level at which the higher rates are reached.  They said this as though the Government had been doing nothing about it.  In fact of course we have.  The standard band was extended by £1,000 for a single person in 1988 and by £400 in both 1989 and 1990 and is being extended by a further £200 in this year's Finance Bill.  These figures were of course doubled for married couples. This makes an increase of more than 40 per cent over the level of the 1986-87 standard band.  Compare the performance in earlier years: the 1984, 1985 and 1986 increases totalled just £700 for a single person.  In addition, I would have to make the point that where taxpayers reach the top rate of tax the level of that top rate obviously concerns them.  We have reduced that top rate by 6 per cent in the past three years.  This too will have had its impact on the tax position of single people, about which Deputies were expressing concern.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i> also suggested the introduction of a reduced, commencement rate of tax.  I could remind him that he was a member of the Government which abolished the 25 per cent reduced rate of tax which applied to the initial tranche of income before 1984-85. But I certainly agree with him that our standard rate of tax &mdash; which is the <Col N="1328" /> initial rate of tax faced by taxpayers generally &mdash; is too high.  That is why we have been reducing the standard rate, and why we propose to go on reducing it, to 25 per cent in 1993.</P>
    <P>We have made substantial progress on income tax in recent years because we have set ourselves achievable goals and moved steadily towards them each year. There has been talk in recent days outside this House of very dramatic changes in income tax and PRSI, of reducing tax rates to 25 per cent and 40 per cent and incorporating employee PRSI and levies into these rates.  I will make no comment on these on this occasion except to give the costs, and the costs speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>Reducing the standard rate to 25 per cent cut, with a standard band covering single employees at the average industrial wage and a single higher rate of 40 per cent, would cost some £600 million in 1991-92 terms.  Employee PRSI and levies are expected to yield some £690 million in 1991: given the loss of yield, it is impossible to see how they could be incorporated into tax rates of 25 per cent and 40 per cent.  Where would the loss of yield &mdash; in total £1,290 million &mdash; be made up from in any one year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I also noted with interest the remarks made by Deputies with regard to the business expansion scheme.  I would repeat that the changes in this scheme provided for in the Bill are necessary and desirable to control its cost and to refocus it on smaller, riskier projects. That is why asset-backed sectors such as shipping, hotels and self-catering accommodation were excluded from the scheme and why I am reducing the company limit from 2.5 million to £0.5 million. That is why I am also proposing measures to counter the use of multiple companies and to prevent the on-lending of BES funds to subsidiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that I introduced transitional arrangements to cater for companies <Col N="1329" /> which had entered into contractual commitments in writing on or before budget day.  This applies to only a limited number of companies whose future could be put in jeopardy.  This was portrayed by Deputy Rabbitte as a major climbdown: it is nothing of the sort.  These transitional arrangements expire on 31 August and the exclusion of shipping, hotels, guesthouses, and self-catering accommodation and the new company limit of £500,000 will remain.  That is the position, and that will continue to be the position.  In any event, Deputy Rabbitte's concern with the budget changes would be more convincing if he had actually voted for them: in fact, he and his party abstained.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte seemed to allege that the BES was a tax break only for the rich. It is true that wealthy people avail of the relief, it is, after all, intended to generate capital for risk ventures, and wealthy people do avail of it.  But the relief is not confined to them: PAYE workers can and do avail of it, and the only minimum in the BES scheme is that the taxpayer investing directly in a company must invest at least £200.  In any event, this year I introduced a lifetime cap on the amount an individual can invest under the scheme; again Deputy Rabbitte's concern would be more convincing if he had supported this principle of a lifetime cap which would ensure that the rich did not over use it, but in fact on budget night he particularly picked it out as an example, he said, of double think on my part.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan and others raised several issues in relation to urban renewal, and to the special incentives being provided for Temple Bar.  There will be an opportunity to deal with the detail of the specific measures at greater length on Committee Stage, and I propose to cover only some general points at this stage.</P>
    <P>In listening to what Deputy Noonan had to say about the development of Temple Bar, I have to say that I am disappointed at his approach.  The fact is that in this Bill refurbishment in Temple Bar will be put on the same basis as new building for the first time ever.  Up to now the incentive on a new building was on <Col N="1330" /> the entire building whereas the incentive for refurbishment concerned only the cost of the refurbishment.  Since refurbishment is the key to the sensitive development of Temple Bar, an objective with which I hope the Deputy agrees, the incentives in the Bill are not excessive. The Deputy should also note that the application of the incentive is selective and will require the approval of Temple Bar Renewal Ltd., a company chaired by the Lord Mayor of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The development of Temple Bar will provide much needed jobs both in the construction and in the operational stages and again I trust that this is something Deputy Noonan will support.  I know that Temple Bar Properties Ltd., the development company, will have a special person employed to liaise with the local community and in particular to ensure that training is put in place to achieve the highest number of jobs for that local community in the development of Temple Bar.</P>
    <P>The Temple Bar Area reliefs provided for in Chapter VII of the Bill are being given in unique circumstances and for a very specific purpose.  Dublin has been given the signal honour of being designated European City of Culture in 1991.  In addition to the various activities and events being undertaken in the city to mark the occasion, the Government have chosen the conservation and refurbishment of the Temple Bar area as its flagship project.</P>
    <P>The needs of the area require a specific set of incentives and these have been carefully devised after a lot of consideration and following advice received from expert groups.  The worthy nature of this project has also been recognised by the European Commission which has agreed to part-fund new pedestrian links, landscaping, street lighting and street furniture for the area.  Deputy Noonan may rest assured that Temple Bar will be no Centre Point &mdash; it will attract a lot of activity, both in its refurbishment phase, and thereafter as a vibrant and thriving community.  I would also emphasise that the special set of incentives covers not only business activities &mdash; and these will <Col N="1331" /> have to be of an appropriate nature &mdash; but also the residential sector.  They are determinedly aimed at achieving the right `mix' in Temple Bar, at enhancing its attractiveness, and maintaining an enduring and unique area in the heart of the city.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed concern at the accountability of the organisational arrangements for Temple Bar.  I would like to make two particular points. Temple Bar Renewal Ltd, is chaired by the Lord Mayor of Dublin and its decisions for and against approval will be tabled before both Houses of the Oireachtas, and Temple Bar Properties Ltd. will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the need for a wider debate on Temple Bar arrangements. A further Bill will be published shortly on the development, including in particular the granting of a State guarantee for the powers of Temple Bar Properties Ltd. and the giving of special authority to Temple Bar Renewal Ltd. in its key role of supervising and approving the standards of refurbishment and construction works, and thereby allowing access to the special incentives.  Deputies will, therefore, have an opportunity to deal with issues arising from that Bill, and from the development of Temple Bar generally, at that time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan made some general comments on urban renewal which I should like to address briefly.  The Deputy said that the urban renewal scheme has been less successful in Dublin than in the other county boroughs.  The figures on the volume of investment do not support this.  In Dublin, as at end-December last, private sector projects involving investment of over £211 million are either completed, in progress or in planning.  The Deputy claimed that the areas first designated for urban renewal have been successful while the later designations have not.  The actual picture is that while there are differences between the various areas, the overall position is encouraging.  In the nine provincial centres designated in 1988, developments <Col N="1332" /> valued at £65 million have either been completed, are in progress or are planned. In the eight provincial centres designated only last May, private sector projects involving investment of over £37 million have already been similarly generated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan complained about schemes where tax incentives in designated area projects can be written off against all income rather than just rental income.  He also complained about the restrictions on capital allowances proposed in section 22 of the Bill.  The two views seem to be incompatible.  The Deputy will be aware that it was the Government of which he was a member which introduced the write-offs against all income in the urban renewal scheme. The Deputy is worried that buildings developed in the designated areas will lie idle and empty for years.  This has not happened to date and there is no reason to assume that it will happen now.  The double-rent allowance which is available will ensure that buildings are tenanted at an early date.  Section 21 of the Bill will assist this process even further.  Finally, the situation in Limerick is not as bleak as painted by Deputy Noonan.  A £30 million development is planned in one of the new areas designated last May. Consultants have been engaged to prepare an action plan for the development of the newly-designated area at large, and Limerick Corporation is confident from its discussions with developers, landowners and the Harbour Commissioners, that this area will be successful in attracting development.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke about section 22 on unitisation schemes, and I was asked for further clarification about it.  I want to completely refute any suggestion that the section was deliberately worded in an ambiguous and complex way so that arrangements could be devised to circumvent its general objective. The section, in brief, does two things: it effectively counteracts the unintended use of capital allowances through certain property investment schemes, while permitting the normal type of joint <Col N="1333" /> investment in property which has taken place within the last five years.</P>
    <P>Thus, the section disallows the set-off of capital allowances on buildings against the total income of a taxpayer where the building concerned is acquired through a scheme designed to, as Deputy Quinn describes it, parcel out substantial tax benefits to a large number of individuals. That type of scheme was never intended to qualify for the relief involved.  I have gone back as far as 1986 and searched all the papers concerning the urban renewal programme that was introduced then and the position today is the same as it was then.</P>
    <P>As some Deputies may no doubt be aware, there has been a practice in the past for small groups of individuals to come together with a view to the purchase of a building which qualifies for capital allowances.  As it was not desirable that this traditional type of investment should be disqualified, it was necessary to exclude such investments from the scope of the section.  This is achieved by excluding this common practice for investment in buildings in the period 1986 to 1991.  To be excluded from the scope of the restrictions, the Revenue Commissioners must be of the opinion that the schemes were commomly used in that period and that people investing in such schemes qualified for set-off of capital allowances against other income. The Revenue Commissioners will have regard to the manner in which participants share in the building and the number of persons participating.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should emphasise that the major objection to the unitisation schemes was the substantial up-front Exchequer cost involved in 1991 and subsequent years.  The traditional type of schemes in contrast do not give rise to such a cost because both the expenditure involved and the amount of tax offset in Year 1 are very much smaller.</P>
    <P>In his remarks on the overall VAT reduction in the budget and Finance Bill, Deputy Noonan seemed to imply that a detailed distribution analysis of the effects would lead to the conclusion that <Col N="1334" /> the less-well-off will not share in the general benefit to consumers.  It is obvious that under any expenditure tax those who spend most will pay most and, consequently, relief granted must, by definition, give the bigger cash benefit to those with the greatest initial purchasing power.  What matters, of course, is how the cost-of-living of various groups is affected.  I would simply make two further points in this regard.  First, the reduction in the standard rate will reduce the cost of a wide range of products which are purchased by people at all consumer levels, for example, soaps, toothpastes, washing powders, disinfectants and food products such as biscuits, sweets and confectionery. Indeed, I am sure that these figure very prominently in the shopping baskets of low-income families.  Secondly, very many of the services which were affected by the selective increase in the 10 per cent rate are quite clearly of a discretionary character, for example, meals in restaurants and hotels, entertainment and certain personal services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan inquired about my attitude to EC indirect tax developments and specifically about whether I favoured approximation of such taxes over harmonisation, by which, I assume he really means equalisation of tax rates.  Clearly, within a completed internal market, a uniform level of taxation on products across member states wouild best achieve the desired aim of eliminating tax-based competitive distortions.  However, as that scenario is not achievable in the short to medium-term given the wide rate disparities which currently exist, member states are likely to settle for the less ambitious target of approximation; in other words, there will probably be an agreement to converge indirect tax rates to the stage where the remaining differentials between neighbouring member states are narrowed to the point where they are insufficient to create an incentive to engage in cross-Border shopping.  In short, a configuration of rate approximation sufficient to eliminate trade and revenue distortions is in prospect for the period immediately after 1992 when <Col N="1335" /> border controls related to fiscal purposes will be abolished.</P>
    <P>If overall circumstances were otherwise, I would have no difficulty in proposing the equalisation of our indirect tax rates with those of the UK; in fact, if circumstances permitted it, there would be no reason why our rates should not go below those of our neighbour thereby reversing the long-standing incentive to shop in the North.  However, we must be realistic.  The plain fact of the matter is that our budgetary circumstances preclude this type of flamboyant action.  In addition, we have accorded great priority to reducing our acknowledged too high levels of personal taxation in order to encourage initiative and reward enterprise &mdash; a strategy indeed advocated by all Opposition parties.  Prudent management of the public finances could not accommodate a programme of major direct and indirect tax cuts in such circumstances. I consider it is more appropriate to seek to bring our indirect tax rates within the couple or so percentage points necessary to avoid trade diversions arising from fiscally motivated shopping trips.  I would also point out that price differences between member states are often attributable to factors other than differences in tax rates.  I have in mind differences in distribution costs and traders' margins.  One of the benefits of the completed single market is expected to be the narrowing of such differences in the face of the greater competition involved.</P>
    <P>Deputies also made the accusation that the Bill does not broaden the tax base. This is not the case.  The Bill, like the three previous Finance Acts, contains svarious measures which widen the tax base and counter tax loopholes as well as other measures which will significantly improve tax assessment and collection and thereby increase taxation revenue. For example, in this Bill in the case of income tax, there are major restrictions in the business expansion scheme and a <Col N="1336" /> reduction in life assurance premium relief, while sections 19 and 22 are directed against abuses of the tax reliefs for the designated areas.  In the case of corporation tax, there are restrictions in the scope of section 84 loans.  Turning to VAT, the base is being widened to include veterinary services, certain types of accommodation and certain non-postal services of An Post.  Self-assessment is being introduced for capital gains tax and this change will yield an estimated £9 million in 1991.  Stamp duty is being made a compulsory tax, which will widen the base and increase the yield.  Finally, new enforcement measures are being introduced for capital acquisitions tax which will improve tax collection in this area.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to thank Deputies for their contributions.  I will expand further on the points they have raised on Committee Stage when I will also deal with the question raised by Deputy Quinn in regard to tax credits. The Deputy's proposition seeks to make our system more progressive and I think everyone will agree that it is too progressive. That is why the Government have embarked on their present route to tax reform and tax reduction.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Capital Radio (Dublin) Dispute.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The industrial dispute involving news staff at Capital Radio has understandably been overshadowed by the strike at the ESB but the issues raised are nonetheless very important.  I want to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise the matter and to thank the Minister for Labour for coming into the House to listen to what I have to say on that matter.</P>
      <P>In many respects the dispute at Capital Radio is symptomatic of the more general industrial relations problems being experienced in commercial radio stations all over the country.  While the dispute at Century Radio has now been settled &mdash; although it is hard to see how that station can maintain the quality and extent of its news coverage with the loss of three senior journalists &mdash; there is a number of potential disputes in local stations which are likely to erupt unless action is taken to improve industrial relations procedures in the sector.</P>
      <P>Many of these disputes have arisen from arbitrary decisions taken by station proprietors to dismiss journalists or change their working conditions.  In the case of Capital Radio unilateral changes were introduced by the management which would have resulted in the letting go of four of the nine journalists employed. On Friday last, at the time when the proposed lay-offs were under dispute, the management dismissed another one of the journalists who was then Acting Head of News, Joyce Jackson.</P>
      <P>Because of the industrial dispute Capital Radio have not been meeting the requirements specified in the Radio and Television Act, 1988, that 20 per cent of air time should be devoted to news and current affairs matters.  To add to the seriousness of the matter, on Tuesday last the station management removed virtually all the equipment used in the collation of news.  Typewriters, telephones and FAX machines were removed without warning, a step which indicated that the management were going to disregard their legal obligations regarding news and current affairs coverage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret to say that attempts made by me and other party spokespersons in the House to involve the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Brennan, in this matter failed. Private Notice Questions and requests to raise matters on the Adjournment were rejected on the grounds that the Minister maintained he had no responsibility in this area.  Therefore we have had to resort to an important and significant device, labour relations, in an attempt to secure some discussion in the Chamber on this matter.  It should not be forgotten that we were concerned to ensure, having passed <Col N="1341" /> the Broadcasting Bill last year, that a proper news service was provided; but we cannot, apparently, debate that matter because the Minister for Communications has very cleverly denied responsibility.</P>
    <P>Many of the difficulties being faced by radio stations at present arise from the attempts of proprietors to wriggle out of commitments, given when seeking licences, to maintain high standards in their news and current affairs programmes. Some of the submissions made at that time to the Independent Radio and Television Commission bear little relationship to the programmes many of the stations are now carrying.  Station owners, devoid of vision and imagination, are trying to blame the requirement of 20 per cent news and current affairs for their failure to attract forecasted audience levels while the real reason is their own inept programming. The experience of RTE and many stations around the country is that good quality news and current affairs programmes, especially local news programmes, are an asset in attracting listeners.</P>
    <P>The attitude of many station managers to staff is deplorable.  They have ridden roughshod over established labour relations procedures and have acted in a manner which is reminiscent of the worse days of pirate radio.  The dispute at Capital Radio is to be considered by the Labour Relations Commission in the morning.  I hope they will actively seek a solution to the dispute, take a broader view of the problem and use the powers available under section 25 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1989, to prepare a code of practice for industrial relations in the independent radio sector.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope the Minister will join with me in appealing to the management of Capital Radio to reinstate the Deputy Head of News, Joyce Jackson, and to enter into meaningful negotiations with the union.  The managing director of Capital Radio, Mr. Michael Hogan, is a well known supporter of Fianna Fáil and has on many occasions placed on public record&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Nine full time staff are employed at the station.  As the Deputy outlined in detail, two journalists in the newsroom were informed recently that their contracts would not be renewed when they expired on 19 April.  The National Union of Journalists expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed non-renewal of their contracts and, having failed to resolve the issue at local level, they served strike notice which was due to expire on Friday, 26 April.  A conciliation conference under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission has been arranged for tomorrow.  I hope these discussions will lead to a resolution of the dispute.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to make reference to the issues which do not come within my remit but I would like to assure Deputy McCartan that I am anxious to see good industrial relations in the area of commerce and trade and the Labour Relations Commission will consider the points raised by him.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy said, a number of disputes have arisen in recent months which in the main have arisen from the fact that when the stations were set up one year contracts were signed.  I want to reassure the Deputy that the commission naturally will try to find a solution to the dispute tomorrow when they consider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me this opportunity to raise this very important issue this evening and thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to respond.  The number of attacks on elderly people has increased in recent times and this unacceptable and despicable practice must be stamped out.  All the resources of the Garda Síochána must be utilised so that our senior citizens are allowed to live in safety and security.</P>
      <P>There has always been a traditional respect for the elderly, but recent events in urban and rural areas are a source of serious concern for public representatives, the Garda Síochána and community leaders.  Old people living alone are now afraid to open the door, particularly at night.  There are ruthless thugs who think nothing of viciously assaulting these vulnerable people.  These attacks are now becoming prevalent throughout the country.  For instance, in my city of Cork this week an 81 year old woman was mugged in broad daylight in the grounds of a church.  Very often these attacks are motivated by robbery and, while in many cases the amounts of money stolen are small, these attacks leave an indelible scar, physically and mentally, on the victims.  Very often these attacks can trigger off a deterioration in health for many of our senior citizens and in some cases that has proved fatal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These attacks are vicious and cowardly and must be condemned outright.  I would like to pay tribute to the gardaí involved with Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert.  They are playing a major role in trying to alleviate the fear many of our old people experience.  The system of a register which some Garda stations carry out where the elderly living alone are recorded and checked from time to time is very good.  This is being carried out at my local Garda station at Gurranebraher, Cork, and is proving very effective.  Many of our elderly are reluctant to instal a telephone due to the initial installation cost and maybe it is time the <Col N="1344" /> Department of Social Welfare looked seriously at the feasibility of providing this service for the old living alone and on fixed incomes.</P>
    <P>While Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert are at the development stage, there is now a very valid reason to see that extra resources are made available urgently to make sure all our elderly are properly protected from the crimninal element who prey on these vulnerable people.  There is also responsibility on the general public to make sure they are protected.  Very many of these people have contributed down the years to this nation.  They have raised their families, paid their taxes and worked hard for this country.  The least we can give them now is security, comfort and peace of mind in their declining years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Attacks on any members of our society are unacceptable but there is something particularly malicious and evil about attacks on helpless and elderly people.  When these crimes are reported through the media not only do they profoundly affect the victims themselves who have their sense of security destroyed and their right to enjoy their latter years in peace taken from them, but they have a domino effect on the entire community.  Elderly friends and neighbours of these victims quite often fear for their own personal safety and this can create anxiety all round.  It should be an inviolable principle of any caring society that the more vulnerable among us be protected.  Attacks on the elderly must be one of the most abhorrent of criminal activities to have emerged in recent years, and no right minded person can fail to feel outraged at the thought that such atrocities can occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the winter of 1984 the problem of attacks on the elderly first emerged. Quick and effective action by the Garda resulted in many of those responsible being apprehended and being brought to justice.  Because of the seriousness of these attacks the Garda put into operation a number of measures specifically <Col N="1345" /> designed to tackle the problem.  These included mobile patrolling of areas deemed to be at special risk, paying particular attention to post offices on days when old age pensioners are paid out and manning checkpoints to carry out spot checks on any suspect cars.  Members of the force also visit elderly people who might be at risk both in urban and rural areas.  The Garda advise them of ways to improve their own personal safety and the security of their homes.</P>
    <P>The Garda also work closely with a number of voluntary agencies who work with the elderly such as Muintir Na Tíre who organise a very successful Community Alert scheme.  This involves members of the community maintaining contact with elderly people and bringing to the notice of the gardaí any suspicious or unusual circumstances.  The Garda are convinced Community Alert plays a vital role in preventing attacks on the elderly.</P>
    <P>The community relations section of the Garda Síochána have also become actively involved in promoting these schemes and this promotion has proved to be successful.  The number of schemes now operating around the country has increased from 185 in 1989 to the present level of 274.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that these measures are proving to be effective.  The 1990 level of recorded attacks on elderly people was only a fraction of the level recorded in 1984 when the problem was at its peak. The Garda also assure me they will continue to monitor the situation very closely and further measures will be considered if these are deemed to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Despite their obvious commitment to and concern for the elderly members of our society, the Garda cannot provide them with round the clock protection. Every member of society must play his or her role in this regard.  We should all remember to keep a watchful eye on our elderly people, to be good neighbours and to alert the Garda to any suspicious activities which might have the effect of putting an elderly neighbour at risk.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that the Minister for Justice is constantly monitoring the situation and is appraising it at <Col N="1346" /> the moment and I am very confident that during the year he will be able to put into action in co-operation with the Garda Síochána a new, revamped scheme that will help to give better protection to the elderly members of our society.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister of State for coming here this evening.  This appeal is in response to the AIM Group for Family Law Reform who have written to everybody in this House this week.  They are facing a great financial crisis and will have to close down. This centre is operated by voluntary workers.  It has been in existence for 20 years and has helped thousands of individuals caught in marriage breakdown. In the past year alone they saw 2,000 people, 80 per cent of whom were women and half of those 80 per cent were mothers working in the home without income.  They come to that centre in desperation, they are stressed and confused, they could be battered or deserted wives, and they get immediate, person to person help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Down the years this group have had only sporadic funding.  They have been most uncertain of funding but they are now desperate because they have not pursued funding at an official level.  This organisation advise and inform those caught in the awful marriage breakdown trap.  These people cannot afford to go to solicitors and cannot get legal aid because of the difficulty in getting to the centres and then the long waiting lists.  Many of them are women who end up going to the family court representing themselves, getting barring orders without legal representation and going in to get maintenance orders without representation, <Col N="1347" /> and they are equipped only with the good, clear information they get from the AIM centre.</P>

      <P>AIM group are a very essential part of the necessary network of help and support that has grown up in this society because services such as civil legal aid can just not cope.  Today I am glad to say there is more money available to groups like this than there was 20 years ago.  When they were first set up they got absolutely no funding.  The problem for this group is that they are not, strictly speaking, community based.  This may be true in official terms, but they operate to the advantage of the whole community, the whole country.</P>
      <P>There has been a dramatic increase in the number of marriage breakdown cases.  While I am glad the Government are taking the realistic step of publishing a White Paper on the matter, I appeal to the Minister to give the minimum funding needed to AIM Group to ensure they can continue with the valuable and very necessary work they are doing.  They open every morning, have a 24 hour answering service, all with only a part-time worker, and they have clear, concise information leaflets which are available free.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to recognise the needs of this group and to help them immediately.</P>

      <P>I join with my colleague Deputy Fennell in appealing to both Ministers present.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, is taking the Adjournment Debate on this issue but this is basically a Justice issue.  As Deputy Fennell said, the AIM Group are a voluntary group.  They provide a service which, if it was not provided on a voluntary basis, would have to be provided by some other agency.  Their annual running costs are in the region of £13,000.  It is nothing short of a public scandal that <Col N="1348" /> they had to run cake sales and other such events to try to get together the minimum amount to provide this service to over 2,000 people last year.  As Deputy Fennell said, they provide very valuable information to those who find themselves in traumatic situations and do not know where to go.  Eighty per cent of the clients who contact AIM are referred to other agencies.  Of these 60 per cent are referred to solicitors, law centres or the courts, 20 per cent are referred for counselling and 12 per cent referred to mediation.  This is a very valuable first stage service provided by a group of voluntary workers who, at their own expense, take courses in counselling and so on in order to help the public.  The minimum that State should do is make certain that they have decent premises from which to operate and sufficient resources to pay the salary of a permanent worker to administer the service. The volunteers want to continue on that basis.  They are not looking for payment for the enormous amount of time they spend helping others.  I appeal to the Minister of State to provide an ample level of funding for this service.</P>

    <P>In 1989 my Department allocated a grant of £10,000 to them from national lottery funds towards the cost of the marriage counselling service which they provided. This is the element of their service most closely allied to the health area.  As there are a number of other organisations such as the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and Marriage Counselling Service Limited whose primary function is to provide counselling services in this area, the moneys allocated in 1990 were <Col N="1349" /> channelled towards those agencies and I regret that it was not possible to make a grant to the AIM group.  I understand, however, that the Eastern Health Board have recently approved a grant to them of £2,500.  My Department have also received an application from them for funding for 1991, which is currently being considered.  I will be in touch with them as soon as a decision has been made.</P>
    <P>I would be very happy to arrange for officials from my Department to meet with members of the group if they wish to contact my office.  That will be done immediately.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear two-minute statements on matters appropriate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance. I propose to call on Deputy Allen in respect of three matters and Deputy Hogan in respect of two matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The first issue is the plight of the people of East Timor who have suffered prolonged oppression.  I am asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs to raise at the United Nations or at the European Council of Foreign Ministers the plight of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>East Timor lies off Indonesia about 600 miles from Australia.  It is a former Portuguese colony which was invaded in 1975 by the army of General Suharto of Indonesia, who is still in power.  There was very little protest by the international community.  Sixteen years later with 200,000 people dead &mdash; about one third of the population of East Timor &mdash; a war of extermination is still going on.  The international community have done very <Col N="1350" /> little to bring about a peaceful solution. When will the international community turn their attention to the crime against humanity which is being committed there?  Journalists have been excluded from the island and the Red Cross were expelled some years ago.  With the cessation of hostilities in Iraq and the plight of the Kurds being attended to, I hope that the people who were so rightly vociferous in their condemnation of the treatment of the Kurds will turn their attention to the appalling carnage among the East Timor people, amounting as it does to genocide.</P>
    <P>I have had a special interest in Nicaragua over the years.  With the normalisation of affairs in Nicaragua and in view of the national consensus reached between the Chamorra Government and the Sandanistas, arising from the general election last year, will the Minister consider, through the appropriate international fora, increasing technological and financial aid for the people of Nicarague who have suffered decades of war and hunger?</P>
    <P>I had the privilege of visiting Nicaragua in 1985 for the elections there, and last year I represented this Parliament as an observer at the elections.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the Sandanista regime have accepted the democratic voice of the people and have reached a national consensus with the Chamorra Government.  The damage to property and to industrial installations, as well as the damage inflicted on the friendly, open people of Nicaragua by the US economic blockade, must be put right.  As much positive attention must be given to the plight of the people as when the Sandanistas were in power.  It is a country full of rich natural resources with major potential, but it needs help after the oppression of the last two decades.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The plight of the people of East Timor is one which continues to be of great concern to us all. This concern is mirrored by that of our partners in the twelve member states of the European Community.  As recently <Col N="1351" /> as 27 February the issue of East Timor was raised by Ireland and its partners in the Twelve at the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.  The Presidency, on behalf of the Twelve, adverted to the reports which have been reaching us that human rights abuses, including long and short term imprisonments, ill-treatment, torture and killings, continue to be inflicted on the inhabitants of East Timor. We wish to see a just, overall solution to the problems of East Timor which is acceptable internationally and which complies with the principles of the United Nations Charter, including respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
      <P>Ireland believes that the political issues related to East Timor are best resolved in the negotiations between the countries directly concerned &mdash; Portugal and Indonesia &mdash; under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.  The Secretary-General has been given a mandate by the General Assembly to facilitate a comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question of East Timor and to conduct consultations with all the parties concerned.  Ireland fully supports the Secretary-General in this endeavour.  We wish to see these negotiations succeed in order that the legitimate interests of the population of East Timor can be fully safeguarded.</P>
      <P>In the meantime Ireland and its partners in the Twelve will continue to monitor developments in East Timor, in particular the human rights situation prevailing there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second question, the Government welcome and strongly support the efforts to promote national reconciliation and harmony, which have been undertaken to date by both the Government of Nicaragua and the main Sandanista opposition movement.  These efforts were consolidated in the concertation agreements reached last October between the Nicaraguan Government and employers and workers organisations to consolidate democracy and promote stability and economic and <Col N="1352" /> social development.  I hope that this process of co-operation and constructive dialogue between Government and Opposition in Nicaragua will continue and will serve as a useful example to help strengthen the democratic process throughout Central America as a whole.</P>
    <P>The favourable political developments now occurring in Nicaragua offer some encouragement that the major economic and social problems which that country faces can now be effectively tackled.  It is important to recognise, however, the scale of the economic problems with which Nicaragua is faced, in particular a very considerable balance-of-payments deficit compounded by a serious debt problem.  While effective action is obviously needed to deal with these problems the danger is that the particular adjustment policies required contain within them the potential to undo much of the progress which has been achieved in the political arena through exacerbating social tensions, for example.</P>
    <P>The international community as a whole recognises this danger and has indicated its willingness to take account of the serious economic circumstances of Nicaragua in preparing its aid programmes. A donors' conference on Nicaragua is currently meeting under the aegis of the World Bank.  Hopefully this will soon produce definite proposals aimed at mobilising considerable amounts of economic aid in support of Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>The European Community, like other international donors, also recognises the difficult economic problems which Nicaragua faces and the scale of the challenge which will be involved in resolving them. To that end, the European Community decided last year to establish a special export development fund to benefit both Honduras and Nicaragua, another Central American country which is experiencing severe balance-of-payments problems.  The agreement formally establishing this fund was signed, at the recent San José conference of EC and Central American Ministers in Managua, which the Minister for Foreign Affairs attended on behalf of our Government.  This fund will be used to boost the export capacity <Col N="1353" /> of both countries and should greatly contribute to both increasing Nicaragua's foreign earnings and generally furthering its economic development.</P>
    <P>In addition to the special measures which it has taken the Community also provides considerable amounts of aid to Nicaragua each year within the framework of general Community aid to Asia and Latin America.  This aid encompasses financial and technical aid as well as emergency and food aid.  Nicaragua has been the largest single recipient among Central American countries of Community aid in recent years.  In 1990 the Community provided 48.5 million ECU &mdash; 37.4 million punts &mdash; in aid to Nicaragua which was 7 million ECU more than was provided to all the other Central American countries combined. The Community in 1990 also sought to ensure a more even distribution among the different categories of aid provided to Nicaragua with financial and technical aid accounting for over 21 million ECU of the total.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that Nicaragua should benefit considerably from the new guidelines agreed last December by the Community on providing aid to Asian and Latin American countries.  These new guidelines provide for a qualitative improvement in the Community's relations with such countries, not least through a virtual doubling of the levels of aid which have been provided up to now.  This will result in a substantial increase in the overall level of Community aid to Nicaragua which has been provided up to now.  The Community are also committed to supporting Central American countries in their efforts to promote economic integration within the region, a process which should indirectly benefit Nicaragua through allowing it to participate on better terms in regional trade.</P>
    <P>From what I have described, therefore, it can be seen that international efforts are being intensified to assist with the economic reconstruction of Nicaragua. Ireland fully supports these efforts and accepts that increased levels of aid will need to be made available to Nicaragua <Col N="1354" /> if its economic and political future is to be assured.  We will continue to close monitor the situation in Nicaragua and not lose any opportunity which might be presented to press for additional support where it is required.</P>

      <P>I now call on Deputy Allen to make a two minute statement addressed to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Voluntary groups throughout the country who purchase medical equipment with moneys collected by way of public subscription are being forced to pay VAT on that equipment at 12.5 per cent.  One organisation in Cork city &mdash; ACT &mdash; who raise funds for equipment for cancer treatment are extremely concerned, because on equipment bought for over £1 million to date they have had to pay almost £150,000 &mdash; in other words, they are being taxed for doing the Government's job because they are providing equipment the Government have failed to provide for the health services in that hospital.  That story can be repeated throughout the country.</P>
      <P>We are being told that the Government are restricted by EC law from waiving Government taxes.  I should like to know from the Minister this evening what is the law?  How is it that voluntary organisations in Great Britain and Northern Ireland have a zero tax rating while ours has arisen from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent because of recent increases?</P>
      <P>Three countries within the EC have zero tax rating.  As we know, Ireland has zero tax rating for food.  The United Kingdom have zero tax rating for charities who provide vital funds and equipment for hospitals.  Portugal also have zero tax rating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must not reply to the effect that he is being prevented from exempting such equipment from tax by European laws.  I cannot see on record any action having been taken against the United Kingdom or Portugal for having a zero rating.  The Government should give a commitment to such organisations throughout the country because they are <Col N="1355" /> fulfilling a vital role within the community. The present VAT rate of 12.5 per cent on such equipment is punitive and acts as a major disincentive to such organisations.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the Minister this evening spoke about reducing the standard rates of VAT on soaps, toothpastes, washing powders, disinfectants, biscuits, sweets and confectionery while at the same time increasing the VAT rate on medical equipment so vital for our health services which have been effected enormously by Government cutbacks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware of the position.  I do not know why he persists in asking this question when he knows what is the answer &mdash; it is on the record, having been answered so often in the past.</P>
      <P>Medical equipment, instruments and appliances are generally liable at the standard rate of VAT, which I reduced to 21 per cent on 1 March 1991.  As I explained to the Deputy and other Deputies on previous occasions, I cannot remove VAT from hospital equipment irrespective of how it is financed.  This is because the introduction &mdash; and perhaps the Deputy would listen to it for the last time please &mdash; of new VAT zero rates or exemptions is prohibited under EC VAT law.  Therefore, it is not legally permissible for me to respond to the Deputy's request.</P>
      <P>I might add there would also be a difficulty in re-classifying medical equipment at the 10 per cent or 12.5 per cent rates.  This would be incompatible with the 1992 tax approximation proposals which envisage standard rating of these items generally.  As the Deputy will be aware, it is probable that the post-1992 standard rate will be in the range of 14 per cent to 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am glad to say that agreements reached at Community level on the rates and structures of VAT to apply after 1992 should not affect the existing refund scheme for donated medical equipment.  This provides for a refund <Col N="1356" /> of VAT to voluntary fund-raisers of the monetary difference between the standard and 10 per cent VAT rates on qualifying equipment.  This scheme was established in recognition of the valuable work done by voluntary fund-raising groups who raise significant amounts of money to finance purchases of specialised health equipment.</P>
    <P>In framing the terms of the refund scheme it was necessary to ensure that the objectives of fund raisers were accurately targeted.  That is why qualifying purchases have to be the subject of a recommendation by the Minister for Health that, having regard to the requirements of the health service, a VAT refund would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Setting a lower limit of £20,000, exclusive of VAT, on the cost of qualifying equipment represents an attempt to strike a balance between the demands of fund-raising groups, the needs of the health service and the administrative cost of operating the scheme.  Having regard to these considerations I believe a reasonable balance is being achieved.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House, I should say the Revenue Commissioners have refunded over £600,000 under the terms of the scheme since it was initiated by us in 1987.  The fact that zero rates exit in Ireland and in other countries does not permit anybody to introduce a new element into zero VAT rating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1984 the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Finance, Deputy O'Kennedy, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, promised that Fianna Fáil would remove VAT on hurleys if returned to Government. Of course, like other election promises at the time the mechanism to implement this promise could not be found afterwards.  Hurling, as the Ceann <Col N="1357" /> Comhairle will know, is the Irish national sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">

      <P>Especially in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a sport that is uniquely Irish.  The cost of hurleys is increasingly becoming a financial burden on GAA and camogie clubs to the detriment of promoting the sport.  I am aware of one club in my county of Kilkenny which spent up to £7,000 in 1990 on hurley sticks alone.  That is scandalous when one considers that the GAA was always considered by the Fianna Fáil Party as part of our national spirit and our national culture.  I look forward to the Minister's reply in view of commitments given in relation to this many times in Opposition but not yet fulfilled in Government.  No other sport has to incur such expenditure as the game of hurling because the costs involved are unique to the game and are unavoidable because of the nature of the game.</P>
      <P>In my opinion there was a political sideline cut against the Government led by Dr. Garret FitzGerald particularly when one considers that the ball has been dropped many times since then.  It was upsetting to me, and to many other people, that the GAA authorities went so far in taking on board this Fianna Fáil promise that they found it necessary to withdraw tickets to an All-Ireland hurling final in 1985 to the Taoiseach and the Cabinet of the day.  Unfortunately, we have heard nothing since then from the GAA or from Fianna Fáil who promised a refund of VAT.  Many young people are willing to play our national game but may not be able to do so because of the cost of hurleys.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the same situation exists here as exists in relation to the topic raised in the previous question. I can appreciate the Deputy's concern but I have to point out to him, as I did in reply to the last question, that I am not in a position to remove VAT from hurleys. The deciding factor in this regard is that the introduction of a new VAT zero rate <Col N="1358" /> or exemptions is prohibited by EC law. That is the law and Deputies cannot expect me to break the law.  For this reason, all of my predecessors over the last decade have had to reject similar requests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That was when the Deputy was in the Seanad.  Of course, the whole question of VAT rating at this juncture has to be looked at in the context of the 1992 tax approximation.  Measures taken between now and the end of 1992 must be consistent with the framework that is emerging for the new VAT system when tax borders are abolished.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that the intention is that there would be a basic two-rate VAT structure.  This will comprise of a reduced rate, probably in the range of 4 per cent to 9 per cent, and a standard rate, probably between 14 per cent and 20 per cent.  Member states are anxious that the scope of the reduced rating should be as restrictive as possible mainly for budgetary reasons.  In order to achieve this they are trying to settle on a list of essential goods and services for which reduced rating would be appropriate. No sports equipment of any kind has been considered for inclusion on the list.  In the circumstances, it is unlikely that it would be possible to get Community agreement for reduced ratings of hurleys after 1992.  Without such agreement, we have no basis for unilateral action.  The only way we can succeed is by unanimous agreement in the whole tax area.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that hurleys will have benefited from the reductions in the standard rate from 25 per cent to 21 per cent over the last two years.  In addition, the GAA is in receipt of both current and capital grants from the Departments of Education and the Environment to assist them in their well deserved activities, that is helping to continue our traditions and customs in every parish in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I now wish to raise the issue of the necessity of decentralising the National Museum to Kilkenny city. The Minister will be aware of the importance of tourism to a city like Kilkenny and the fact that we attract a tremendous number of visitors to the city annually.  I am aware also that the National Museum are considering the possibility of decentralising some of the material which at present cannot be displayed in our National Museum in Dublin because of lack of space and that regional centres are being examined for the purpose of displaying material at regional level.</P>
      <P>At present Kilkenny Castle is undergoing tremendous reconstruction work and I compliment the Minister, and the Taoiseach in particular, for this development. I would be grateful if favourable consideration could be given by the Government to relocating much of the museum material that is not being displayed to Kilkenny Castle or to Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The city of Kilkenny is renowned for its artifacts, its history and its cultural spirit.  It could become a focal point for <Col N="1360" /> the south-east region for the development of the tourist industry and also for the displaying of museum material in that area.  I am concerned that artifacts and items of regional interest be put on display in this decentralised location.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the Taoiseach has indicated in the past that he would be happy for groups or organisations from outside Dublin to approach the National Museum with a view to locating certain exhibits in their areas, and that, provided the Director and his technical staff could be satisfied as to professional standards of security and environmental protection, these requests would be fully considered by the National Museum.  The Taoiseach also said, of course, that there would be no question of breaking up the national collections.</P>
      <P>It has not been decided if the Office of Public Works would have any role to play in such a process.  If it is decided that they do in fact have a role, the matter will be fully addressed at that stage.</P>

      <P>Each community school is in <Col N="1298" /> receipt of an annual financial allocation made up of pay and non-pay.  The pay element is allocated for the purposes of payment of non-teaching staff, teacher substitution and payment of teachers who are employed at the part-time rate.  The non-pay allocation is designed to meet the day to day running costs.</P>
      <P>The amount apportioned each community school each year in relation to pay is an estimate.  This estimate is based on the number of approved non-teaching staff, part-time teaching staff, etc.  Estimates of pay requirements as furnished by the school are also looked at.  Should it subsequently be found that the estimate is inadequate additional funding for pay will be provided by the Department.</P>
      <P>In relation to non-pay, each school is given a cash allocation.  This allocation is drawn up by the Department based on estimates furnished by the school.  A number of other factors are also taken into account in arriving at the amount of the allocation, viz:&mdash; age of school building, size of school, etc.  Schools are required to stay within their authorised non-pay allocation.</P>

      <P>Permanent and temporary wholetime teachers and eligible part-time teachers in community schools are paid direct by my Department.  The financial allocation, broken into (a) other pay (i.e. clerical and maintenance staff and part-time teachers, including substitution) and (b) non-pay, for each community school for the years 1989 and 1990 together with the proposed allocations for 1991 from Subhead E of Vote 28 are set out in following tabular statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial allocations for the years <Col N="1299" /> 1986, 1987 and 1988 are not readily available. It is proposed, however, to furnish the Deputy with this information shortly.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should note that the amount allocated in non-pay in 1989 included special grants for junior certificate resource grant (issued to all schools); vocational leaving certificate grant (14 schools); junior certificate technology programme (five schools).</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that a reserve is kept each year by the Department for additional funding for emergencies arising in the schools during the course of the year.  The 1991 allocations would not yet reflect moneys issued for emergencies.</P>
    <P>Five of the schools listed opened in September 1990 and their allocations for that year were based on requirements for four months only.</P>

      <P>The leaving certificate vocational programme (LCVP), introduced in September 1989 with support from the European Social Fund, provides a two-year vocational training programme giving each participant a strong <Col N="1303" /> grounding in a specific technological area (two subjects from construction, engineering and technical drawing), Irish, a modern continental language, and work experience/simulation in the chosen employment area.  Participants study at least one other subject from the approved list but if mathematics is chosen, they are required to take the computer studies programme which is at present optional within the leaving certificate syllabus. The programme has a strong technological base which is emphasised through project work undertaken in the technological subjects taken.</P>
      <P>A figure of 2,714 participants joined the programme in 1989 and will be sitting the leaving certificate examination this year.  It is estimated that in the current year there are of the order of 6,000 pupils taking part in the LCVP two-year cycle. Of the LCVP students who will sit the leaving certificate examination in 1991, it is estimated that 70 per cent will take at least one science subject.  A similar percentage, i.e. 70 per cent of all leaving certificate students attending school, will take at least one science subject in the 1991 examination.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the home/school/community liaison pilot projects scheme which my Department introduced last year.  A list showing the areas in Dublin where this scheme operates at present follows.  It is proposed to extend the scheme this year and this matter is being examined at present as a matter of urgency.  The schools in the Aughrim Street Parish will form part of this examination.  I hope to <Col N="1304" /> have further information in this regard in the near future.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is aware that the schools in question are already participating in the disadvantaged areas scheme and as part of this scheme benefit from a home/school/community liaison grant.</P>

      <Quest>if she has received proposals from community groups in Maynooth, County Kildare, for the provision of a sports complex, including a swimming pool, adjacent to the local post-primary school; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that these facilities, if provided, will be shared between the school and the general public in the area; if her attention has further been drawn to the fact that a local contribution can be made available in the event of grant aid being provided from the proceeds of the national lottery in respect of such a proposal; and if she will make a statement on the matter outlining whether funds will be made available for such works in the current year or in 1992 within the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</Quest>

      <P>An application was received in 1987 under my Department's capital grant scheme for the provision of recreational facilities from Maynooth Community Council for funding towards the cost of a sports complex.  However, due to the large number of applications <Col N="1308" /> received at the time under this scheme it was not possible to allocate a grant to the project.</P>
      <P>Following a Government decision in late 1989 the capital grant scheme was amalgamated with the amenity grants scheme operated by the Department of the Environment.  Under the new arrangements grants are now allocated by the Minister for the Environment to projects recommended by local authorities which are also responsible for processing the applications.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the application submitted by Maynooth Community Council was forwarded to Kildare County Council in January 1990 for their consideration under these new arrangements.</P>
