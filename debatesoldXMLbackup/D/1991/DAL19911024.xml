      <P>In view of the fact that apparently the Central Bank did not supply information to the High Court inspectors and claimed that they had legal authority so to do, and in view of the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has indicated that the law in question has to be changed, can the Taoiseach indicate when, and by what Minister, the proposal will come to change the law to ensure that High Court inspectors appointed to examine the Greencore, or indeed any other, case will have access to information in the hands of the Central Bank as well as all other official agencies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I submit to you, Sir, with respect, that this is promised legislation although admittedly the Minister did not have an opportunity to promise it in the House yesterday.  It is promised legislation on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I should like to know what are the intentions of the Government in regard to that matter, one of considerable urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister for Industry and Commerce said yesterday was that if legislation was needed it would be introduced.  I want to assure the House that the Government will make sure that these inspectors are facilitated in every possible way, and that there will be no restriction of any kind put on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly &mdash; and I appreciate the latitude you are allowing me, Sir &mdash; the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that if the Central Bank's refusal to supply this information to the Greencore inspectors was statutory then legislation would have to be introduced. May I inquire why it is that apparently the Government do not know at this stage whether the Central Bank's refusal was or was not statutory.  Surely that is a determinable fact that the Government ought now to know and, therefore, be in a position to decide now whether legislation is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a technical, legal matter whether legislation will be required.  My own view is that it will not be required, but whether it is or not I assure the House again that the inspectors appointed by the Minister will be given every necessary authority and facility to carry out their job thoroughly and completely.</P>

      <P>I can understand the lack of awareness on the part of the Taoiseach. Obviously he is more concerned at present with the passing of the baton. On Wednesday the Taoiseach said in this House that the Government were considering whether the Minister for Finance would be instructing his representative at the meeting of Greencore next week to ascertain whether they had confidence in the board of Greencore.  Have the Government considered that matter and taken a decision?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There were five separate inquiries promised in this House into Greencore.  The two under the remit of the Minister for Industry and Commerce seem to be making significant progress and the internal inquiry ordered by the board of Greencore has reported.

    <Title>Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1991    [Seanad]:    Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1659" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been speaking on the last occasion about the incidence of pollution in Lough Derg and the delays in setting up and commissioning the proper authorities to investigate the incidents which had been taking place.  I should have acknowledged that the Minister had set up the environment research unit who, together with Teagasc, are investigating it.  Some work was undertaken in the spring and summer of this year. Information should have been published about the sources of pollution affecting the lake.  International fishing competitions had to be cancelled there because of algae growth.  Delays in this area are raising doubts about the effectiveness of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Perhaps the Minister can take powers to require the authority undertaking the work of this nature to publish interim reports giving a preliminary identification of the sources of pollution. Further examination at Lough Derg has been postponed until next summer, which means that we will not have a full report for two or three years.  There is an opportunity to promote speedier investigation of pollution outbreaks so that they can be brought to the attention of the wrong-doers and the public much more quickly.</P>
      <P>The agency will have the ability to draw up guidelines for environment impact statements.  The agency may also assist a competent authority in the assessment of environment impact statements and may comment on them as the Minister would require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agency must be consulted before a decision is made to exempt a development from EIA requirements.  There has been confusion because of the exemption clause.  Some of this difficulty has arisen from the regulations published by the EC with regard to environmental impact. They regard anything under £5 million as <Col N="1660" /> exempt from particular kinds of environmental impact assessments.  In my constituency there has been major difficulty as to whether developments under £5 million are exempt from the EIA.  This has been the claim made by the Office of Public Works.  They have claimed exemption and officers in the Commission in Brussels have intimated that it will be necessary to do a full study on this matter.</P>
    <P>All of the confusion has led to what I can only describe as great difficulty on the ground in the area where the proposed development is to take place.  I have no problem with the proposal to site the interpretative centre at Mullaghmore. However, as the work will be undertaken in what one would describe as virgin territory some kind of assessment has to be carried out.  Our law in this area is very weak.  Our Departments of State are able to proceed with developments without engaging in any consultation &mdash; they may engage in consultation with local authorities. I believe Government Departments are easily swayed by the word &ldquo;consult&rdquo;.  The local authority in County Clare are vigilant about such issues as pollution, environmental control, planning and development.  They have a very good track record in that regard. However, local authority officers are totally frustrated by the exemption laws. They have been placed in a hands off position in regard to the Mullaghmore development.  I do not think that is a very good atmosphere in which to propose developments.  I am not saying that there have been clashes between the respective officials but I appeal to the Minister to review the exemption law in regard to local authorities.  As long as the law allows the Office of Public Works and other Departments of State to engage in planning, construct buildings and carry out other improvements in counties without consultation with the relevant local authority there will always be great difficulty.</P>
    <P>I look forward with interest to the introduction by the Minister of regulations on environmental impact assessments and to hearing how she will direct the agency to compile these guidelines.  I <Col N="1661" /> hope she will take into account the need to limit the exemptions so that there will be greater public accountability and greater liaison between the people working on the ground and the Departments located in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to refer to the conference on the environment which will be held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.  I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister yesterday seeking information about Ireland's representation at that meeting and the preparations being made here for it.  One of the problems in this regard is that there are no up to date reports on the conference which was already attended.  We need to educate the public on what is going on in this area.  I know that some people believe a new industry is being created as a result of environmental problems and the Green issue, with the publication of numerous papers and glossy magazines on the subject. There is much interest in this conference. If the debate on the Bill takes longer than expected, will the Minister publish information on Ireland's position in regard to the issues which are likely to arise at the conference in Rio de Janeiro and say whether we will be given an opportunity to debate some of these matters in this House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the Bill it is only fair to say that I do so with a guarded vision of what it may or may not do so far as our environment is concerned. I say that mainly because I believe we have a duty to protect our environment and to ensure that we strike a proper balance between environmental protection and industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think everyone agrees that our environment needs to be protected.  There has been a growing awareness over the past few years of the need for environmental protection.  We are lucky in that we have probably the best environment in Europe.  This may be due to the fact that we live on the periphery of Europe and are an island nation.  However, because of this we are duty bound to protect our environment.  We must look at what can <Col N="1662" /> be done by individuals and by the community in general in that respect.</P>
    <P>Environmental protection comes under a number of headings&mdash;protection of our natural environment, protection of our environment from industrial developments and the effects circumstances beyond our control are having on our environment.  The task of environmental protection has been carried out by a number of agences over the past few years, for example, the fishery boards who were environmental protectors because of the work they carried out.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the operation of the fishery boards in the context of the proposed changes which will be brought about by the Bill it is imperative that we learn from the mistakes which may have been made by them.  This is imperative for a number of reasons.  The issue of inconsistency between the various fishery boards needs to be addressed sooner rather than later.  Accountability is another issue which needs to be addressed in this context.  This is necessary in view of the fact that the proposed Environmental Protection Agency will be set up on a regional basis.</P>
    <P>I have the height of respect for many of the people who operate our fishery boards.  However, the big stick has been used unnecessarily in some cases to the extent that our environment has not been protected and no work has been carried out in this regard.  The policy pursued by some fishery boards of prosecuting people for very minimal offences which are genuine accidents also needs to be looked at in the context of this legislation.  I know people in my constituency who have been prosecuted by the fishery boards for offences which I believe were of a very marginal nature. If a farmer's silage effluent tank overflows and he deals with the problem before it reaches any water course, should he be prosecuted when he has done no damage to the environment. This has happened and it is wrong.</P>
    <P>We all have a duty to protect our environment and farmers have probably more <Col N="1663" /> responsibility in this area, than have any other section of our community.  Yet in some cases farmers have been prosecuted and have had to pay hefty fines and enormous legal expenses for the cost of the prosecution.  It is wrong that legal expenses of £600, £700 or as high as £1,000 can be trotted out for District Court cases which are indefendable because of the state of the fishery regulations. Unless there is a reason for a long investigation and much legal work, it is wrong for a person to be told that the cost of legal proceedings in a fisheries case can amount to between £700 and £1,000.  That should be redressed.</P>
    <P>Where continued pollution occurs without any effort being made to remedy the problem the perpetrators of such acts should not be dealt with leniently by the law and everybody accepts that.  Where people make an honest effort to improve the position and where the difference between carrying out the works and continued employment becomes marginal we are then heading into a very dangerous area.  If the pollution is not of a toxic nature and is not causing major problems a respectable length of time should be permitted to allow the problems to be dealt with.  Whatever State agency aid is available should be given to these companies to try to rectify the problem rather than, as happens in many cases, the company owners being hounded out of existence. In many cases the net result is that rather than deal with pollutant by means of proper treatment works, it is dumped in the hours after midnight into some stream or lake.  It is a damning indictment of us that we allow such things to happen in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The problem of emissions is caused by industries and we have to examine it. There should be proper assessment of all industries to see what effect emissions may have on the environment.  I often wonder whether the necessary work is put into environmental impact assessments which are carried out prior to planning permissions being granted.  The sector of the community likely to be hardest hit and put under most pressure after <Col N="1664" /> the passage of this Bill is the agricultural community.  We all know that agriculture is an industry that does not have too much spare cash, to put it mildly.  Many small farmers find that the cost of dealing with effluent and slurry problems goes beyond their financial capabilities.  While grants are available there is a need for a type of slow moving &mdash; I do not mean terminally slow in the sense that one would be given five or ten years to carry out works &mdash; process taking up to five years to carry out remedial works.  That cannot be objected to, so long as no major problems arise during that time.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that farming is now becoming intense.  When we compare our system of farming with that of our continental neighbours we see it is probably at the start-up stage.  We should learn from the problems farmers in Holland and Germany experience.  We have a duty as legislators to see to it that our agriculture develops along a co-ordinated and definite line in the years ahead and that our environment is not threatened.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that samples are taken in the presence of the farmer, industrialist or those alleged to have caused the pollution.  The reason I say that is that if a person is charged with drunken driving a sample of blood or urine must be taken in the presence of a garda and a medical doctor.  Under the fisheries legislation, samples may be taken by any fisheries officer without a witness being present.  It will have to be made clear that the alleged offenders must be given a sample of the polluted water for private analysis, if they so wish.  Further, when samples are taken an independent person should be present.  The accused person is entitled to be present when the sample is taken.  He or she is entitled to know that the sample is genuine.  I hope the Minister of State addresses that issue before the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>A number of EC directives on environmental protection has not yet been implemented by this country.  We cannot seek a derogation because we failed to implement them.  That has resulted in many attacks on our environment recently.  We failed to implement EC <Col N="1665" /> Directive 667/90 and that should be examined by the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>We should look also at the proposed regional system.  While regional systems are good we must bear in mind that no two regions are the same.  In this legislation, the regions should not cross county boundaries as happens with the fisheries boards.  This is not the best way to implement these provisions.  The reason I say that is simple.  Local authorities, as planning authorities, should always be within one region so far as this legislation is concerned.  The accountability of regional managers must be addresed.  While it is proposed that the agency should be autonomous there must be accountability because we saw recently that people who were let out in their own little boat became little Ayatollahs, often not in the best interests of the State or of the community.  We should ensure that the central board is in a position at all times to make available, on request, to the public or to Members of this House, any information sought unlike the present situation where fisheries boards are not accountable to Members of this House or, from what I can gather, to the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>The appointment of agency members should be looked at.  There is little use in appointing people to boards such as this who are not capable of dealing with environmental problems.  We do not want another bureaucracy set up in the regions with little Ayatollahs who will try to keep information away from the general public, the members of the Oireachtas and the Minister of the day. I suggest each local authority should have at least one member on the regional board and the local authority should appoint an elected member.</P>
    <P>European standards on environmental protection are questionable when compared with our standards.  I appeal to the Minister of State to campaign for common environmental standards to be maintained especially by our near neighbour, the UK.  I do no need to elaborate on my reasons for saying that.  We have <Col N="1666" /> all seen the problems with regard to Sellafield; the east coast seems to be under threat from Sellafield.  We must make sure that we are made fully aware of any problems that may arise in the UK nuclear stations.</P>
    <P>The wisest decision ever taken here was not to have nuclear power stations. What we have in its place may not in the long term prove to be environmentally friendly when we take into account the acid rain which results from emissions from Moneypoint.  The use of smaller stations might have been more in the interest of the country.  If we had continued that policy we might have fewer environmental problems.  More and more power seems to be generated in Moneypoint but perhaps even at this late stage we might consider the possibility of putting more hydro stations in place because they were at least totally environmentally friendly in most cases.</P>
    <P>Many of our waterways are being polluted today and we are not all without guilt in this area.  Many defective sewage treatment works are discharging effluent into the rivers.  It is imperative to speed up the programme that has been commenced to dealing with effective sewage treatment plants.  A recent report on the quality of drinking water should be urgently considered because in some cases our drinking water is not of the quality desired.  We should be able to treat some of the problems, but an error can have severe consequences for communities in relation to defective water supply.</P>
    <P>We must consider as well the pollution being caused by afforestation.  Rivers and lakes are beginning to lose fish life because the shedding of sitka spruce needles into the water cause an acid when they decay.  We should look at this matter in the context of forest development.  A lot of land can best be used for afforestation purposes but when heavily subsidising land to be forested, we should consider how it affects local communities, farming and the environment generally.  These questions must be tackled sooner rather than later. <Col N="1667" /> We need new regulations with regard to planting near watercourses.  The regulations should ensure that we do not have the sort of problems that are now beginning to appear in the West of Ireland with regard to pollution from forestry. Planning permission and environmental impact assessments are necessary before any plantation in excess of ten hectares can be planted.  The present regulation is in respect of 200 hectares.  The number of applicants Coillte Teoranta receive for aid for plantations of 200 hectares or more is very limited.  In view of the need to do something about this problem I hope we will deal with it sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>It has not been proved that I am incorrect in believing that toxic waste is being dumped in landfill sites here.  That is damning and dangerous.  It appears that certain counties are prepared to allow this to continue despite it having been brought to their notice by public representatives. I wrote a complaint to a county manager recently about dumping and three months later I still have not received a reply.  It is time the Department of the Environment looked at the amount of illegal dumping taking place in a county adjacent to this city &mdash; and it is not County Dublin.  It is time landfill sites were properly supervised.  We have a duty to protect the environment and to see that those who are responsible for administering environment protection laws, weak as they are at the moment, enforce them.</P>
    <P>People outside of the gates of the House yesterday protested against the establishment of an incinerator in Derry. I sympathise with them.  Unless we can be assured that the operation of an incinerator in Derry will be beyond reproach we must show our abhorrence of it.  The operation of incinerators by non-State agencies will not be in the best interests of the community.  If the proposed incinerator is erected in Derry we should be able to monitor it, and we should have every right to carry out any examination necessary to protect the citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1668" /> While I welcome this Bill there is an urgent need to re-assess many of the things we are talking about.  If we implemented the laws as they stand, there might not be a need for this great crusade with regard to Green politics here.  We have had Green politics in all parties for the past 20 to 25 years.  Every Member of this House could declare himself a supporter of the Green movement. We have a duty to ourselves and to our people to protect the environment.  Once this Bill is passed I hope the rights of all citizens will be firmly protected, that a citizen will be allowed the right to defend himself against an assessment by a relevant officer, that the farming community and industry will be treated fairly and that those who are not directly involved in either sector will be fully protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted this Bill is before the House but I have to say immediately that it is very sad indeed, and in a real sense it is a tragedy, that we did not have this debate two years ago when a far more robust Bill was brought before the House by my colleague, Deputy Alan Shatter, which was voted down by the present Government, including the present Minister of State, who did not seem to take the view at the time that there was in that Bill a framework on which this debate could take place and on which we might have made progress.  I am even sadder that on looking through this Bill I find it has very much the same inspiration as Deputy Shatter's Bill but lacks some of the stronger elements included in that Bill which would have enabled us to achieve the objectives the Minister of State is now setting out to achieve more quickly and satisfactorily and with greater clarity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a sad comment on the way parliamentary politics operate here, in particular by the Government, that two years later we are dealing with an issue which we could have properly dealt with at the end of 1989.  There seems to be a great tendency in this debate on all sides and in all sections of the public to adopt <Col N="1669" /> the classic pose of Nero who fiddled while Rome burned.  I intend to say a little more about that, but the talk about protecting individual rights &mdash; all of it legitimate &mdash; seems to operate on the assumption that in some way the environment and the atmosphere which surround us are renewable resources.  They are not.  I have gleaned from all the reading I have done on the technical side and from the experts at conferences that we had better wake up to the fact that the atmosphere around our planet and the physical environment of our planet are not renewable resources, they do not regenerate themselves. What we and the western industrialised countries, in particular, are doing is nothing more, nothing less, than using up finite resources at a rate which is only tending to increase.</P>
    <P>If we look at it from that point of view, I think I would be justified in saying that we have not yet connected with the importance of this argument or, in our minds or hearts, with the problem of the protection of the environment, not to speak of the improvement of our environment. One of the dangers in a debate like this is that we use terms such as &ldquo;protection&rdquo; and &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; interchangeably whereas they are not interchangeable, they are two different things. In reality what we are talking about in this Bill and what will be talked about at the conference in Brazil next year is not the improvement of our environment; at the very best what we will be talking about is slowing down the rate of decay and the rate at which we are destroying the environment which surrounds us. That all sounds Cassandra-like and pessimistic, but it is a fact.  All the measures we are taking in this Bill &mdash; I am not blaming the Minister of State for this, the blame goes much wider than that &mdash; are to stop our environment getting worse at the present rate, they will not improve our environment compared with what we see today.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say also that there is still an air of what I would call self-satisfaction in Ireland about our environment.  It shows itself in different ways.  Deputy Ellis inadvertently showed some aspects a few <Col N="1670" /> moments ago.  He wanted a series of reliefs for those who are accused of what he regards as minor infringements of our environmental codes, he wants people to have the right to have independent samples taken and to know that a sample taken from water on their farm or effluent from their industry can be double checked by them.  That is a perfectly legitimate request to make but what it turns into in practice is another series of obstacles to stop us polluting our environment and making it worse as quickly as we are and to allow us to stick out our chests and say that we have managed to strike the proper balance between protection of the environment and protection of individual rights.  The single central idea we all have to get hold of is that if we do not seriously protect our environment, the individual right to life of all of us and of millions and billions yet to be born, will be going to hell in a wheelbarrow very rapidly.  That is the simple fact we have not concentrated on yet.</P>
    <P>Again, I saw this a couple of years ago when our local authorities began to take more seriously than they had up to then, the business of ensuring that agriculture does not pollute our watercourses anymore than we think it has to.  It is probably not very useful in a debate like this but we should start from the fact that all human life and human activity pollutes the environment.  That may be too radical or too revolutionary a view to take, but it is a fact.</P>
    <P>I talked to some groups of farmers when the local authorities started a campaign to ensure that our watercourses were properly maintained and protected according to our likes at the time.  One of the things which inevitably cropped up was the spillage or the arrival, by whatever means, of animal effluent in our watercourses.  We all know that when cattle drink they defecate in our watercourses. There is not much we can do about that but people got very indignant when it seemed there were servants of local authorities who had not realised that.  One farmer said to me after he had an argument with a member of the staff of the local authority that the latter had <Col N="1671" /> expressed himself in very colourful terms about the standards they had to apply.  I would not permit myself for a moment, Sir, to say exactly what he said to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the gist of it was the following: if God had meant to prevent birds defecating into watercourses he would have put their cloacal orifices on their backs.  This shows that we do not like a concern with the environment to get in the way of what we are doing; we do not like having to tailor what we do and the way we run our businesses or our farms in a way which is going to be friendly to the environment.</P>
      <P>I find there is great deal of smugness about these problems.  If it is true, as many of us claim it is day in day out on a ritualistic basis, that we have a nice, grand, clean and green environment, it is not due to anything we have done; it is due primarily to the fact that there are only 3.5 million of us in this State and five million of us on this island, and we are far less industrialised than most of our neighbours.  I do not accept for one moment the proposition that if we had anything like the density of population or the density of industrial activity as the United Kingdom we would necessarily be any better than they are in protecting our environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State showed aspects of this smugness in introducing the Bill in the House last Tuesday.  She gave the figures &mdash; offhand I do not have them &mdash; about the number of amendments to this Bill which were accepted in the Seanad. Some time ago I went to the trouble of going through the Bill as passed by the Seanad and the Bill as initiated and it is fair to say that the vast majority of amendments accepted in the Seanad were of a technical nature.  They are not fundamental in terms of any policy change, they are not fundamental in altering anything in the Bill or in rectifying any of what I regard as deficiencies in it.  The amendments were necessary <Col N="1672" /> and wise but all very technical amendments which, while they may have done much for the Bill in parliamentary and administrative terms, have not done much for it in terms of making it a better instrument to prevent the further deterioration of our environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State was guilty of this kind of smugness we cultivate about our clean, green environment.  In her speech she talked about &ldquo;a natural resource which will never be exhausted if we take care of it&rdquo;.  She said that the decisions we make in future about what type of development we want will have to take this into account.  I will quote the really dangerous part:</P>
    <P>Much of our recent economic recovery can be attributed to industries which are dependent on a clean environment, for example, food, agriculture, electronics and tourism.</P>
    <P>There is more but that is the gist of the Minister's remarks in that connection.  I do not wish to be offensive but I regard that as nothing more than ritualistic claptrap to divert attention from the real issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned all the clean industries, such as electronics.  There is an article in the current edition of <i>World Link</i> by a Mr. John A. Bohn, President of Moody's Investor Service about the effect of environmental action programmes on the credit rating of firms.  He looks at the costs they will have to meet to get their act cleaned up and what effect that will have on their credit rating, their stock market position and so on.  He refered to costs and said:</P>
    <P>The greatest risks are faced by firms in which hazardous waste or particulate matter are generated during normal operations.  These include the chemical, rubber and plastics, petroleum, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, heavy manufacturing, steel, mining, electronics and electrical equipment industries.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the food and electronics industries &mdash; and the others to which the Minister referred with <Col N="1673" /> approval in this ritualistic claptrap &mdash; are ones which like to come into a clean environment but we cannot be sure that they will leave a clean environment after them.  I intend to come back to that matter because the electronics industry, like the food industry, is capable of having some fairly nasty stings in its tail. As long as we keep perpetuating this nonsense, that by our great effort we have a clean, green environment in this lovely little country of ours and that we need these clean industries, we are walking ourselves straight into trouble.  The real danger is that it infects &mdash; and affects &mdash; the way we approach the drafting of a Bill like this which will be central to the future in regard to what we do, not to improve our environment but just to stop it getting worse at the kind of rate at which it has been deteriorating for the last 20 years or more.</P>
    <P>We know, of course, that the food industry which may like to have a clean environment to start with can &mdash; and does &mdash; pollute our environment.  We have problems with effluent, with the treatment of raw materials, the use and treatment of offals and with smell, a matter which is not dealt with in the Bill.  I will come back to it later.  We can see umpteen examples of it all round the country; there has been a problem with part of our food industry chain as a result of the BSE scare.  It is now no longer economic, because there is no demand for it, to manufacture meat and bone-meal from carcases.  Meat and bone-meal was made not only from the offal and the bones of animals killed in our meat factories, it was made from the carcases of casualty animals, the ones which died on farms for all kinds of different reasons, those which were knocked down by cars or which broke legs falling into ditches and so on.</P>
    <P>There is now no market for meat and bone-meal.  What is happening?  Increasingly, all round the country, those carcases are simply being dumped.  In the good cases a pit is dug, the carcase is thrown in, maybe a bit of lime is put on top of it and it is covered.  In the bad cases &mdash; and there have been quite a few <Col N="1674" /> over the last year or so &mdash; in a corner of a field one will find five or six bullocks or a few sheep which have been thrown there because nowadays there is no knacker picking up the carcases and bringing them to the meat and bone-meal plant.  It very clearly shows the danger, the minute the economic shoe pinches here concern for the environment goes out the window pretty fast.  There is no reason in that context for the kind of smugness that says this is a grand little country, lovely and green and lovely and clean.</P>
    <P>The Minister cited the electronics industry as one which has a place in this grand, green, clean little environment.  Is the Minister of State giving any consideration to what happens to the waste from the electronics industry?  The industry produce very interesting ones, all kinds of rare metals, heavy metals of some kind and metals which do not degrade easily.  They are not biodegradable, they must be disposed of because, with the best will in the world, the technology in that industry, although very well advanced, cannot eliminate the problem of waste completely.  What happens to the solvents used?  What happens to the waste from all these processes which etch these marvellous circuits?  We must deal with that problem and there is no point in trying to pretend that the electronics industry is an unambiguously clean one and the kind we need here.</P>
    <P>Another area about which we hear a great deal of ritualistic claptrap is our tourism sector.  We have all heard the stories &mdash; we repeat them <i>ad nauseam,</i> mostly to ourselves, because we cannot attract Americans and others in big enough numbers &mdash; probably apocryphal about the German tourists who love coming here because they can go for a walk in the rain.  Their plastic raincoats are not corroded by the acid rain and they think it is wonderful that their jackets are not holed or streaked.  We think this is wonderful, that they will all flock here to wear the rain-jackets without getting them corroded.  Are we doing much about it?  I wonder.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1675" /> I travel round this country on a regular basis and I hope to continue doing so for a long time.  If you keep your eyes open, what do you find?  Atrocious visual pollution, I am not even talking about the built environment but what we see dumped in the most unlikely places. There is an area of bog near where I live.  I live in the heart of the countryside although there will be a major bypass a couple of hundred yards from me in a few years when the Minister for the Environment gets around to giving the money to Kildare County Council to get on with the job.</P>
    <P>There is an area of bog near my home, totalling about 800 acres, and beside it there are about 500 or 600 acres of forestry plantation, coniferous plantation of the kind Deputy Ellis was rightly concerned about.  Beyond that again there is another large stretch of bog.  This is a great country &mdash; that area should long ago have been classified as a disadvantaged area but this Government cannot get around to doing that.</P>
    <P>That is a place where I like to walk. The bog area is used for summer grazing on a commonage basis.  It is extraordinary to see the rapidity with which that environment is deteriorating.  Over the last winter, for example, I found substantial quantities of rubbish dumped there.  One can find there all those items typical of those that can be found all over the country, the new plastic oil cans, plastic containers in which heavy duty oil is sold for lubricating farm machinery or trucks, bits of lorry cabs, ubiquitous fertiliser bags, bits of exhaust pipes and so on.  They are brought out to these bogs because they can be dumped in the furze bushes where the neighbours cannot see them.  It is easier to do that than to go to the local authority and get an agreement with whoever is running the local landfill site to take these materials from you.</P>
    <P>The same is happening in the Dublin mountains less than 12 miles from here. In one part of the Wicklow mountains, beside Lough Dan, it is proposed to open a nature park or a park of some kind that would be preserved.  That is a lovely area, <Col N="1676" /> and I am concerned that people are talking about opening an interpretative centre there.  Most people who go there do not need an interpretative centre to tell them that what they are looking at is precious.  Beside that &mdash; I have this on very good authority from people who go there from time to time &mdash; if one turns off the main road and goes as far as the bog where people still cut turf, where my father cut turf during the war, when I was young, one can find dumped all kinds of scrap metal, not just the kind of scrap metal from dealers but that which results from fabricating things with metal.  There are metal shavings and long coils of metal wire made from a metal working process. There is clear evidence that people are bringing stuff there to burn, and I find that appalling.  On my way home if I look across from the Naas Road to the Dublin mountains I can sometimes see a fire burning.  At one time I thought people were burning furze but it is more likely to be some obnoxious stuff which is brought out there by those who cannot be bothered to use the ordinary landfill sites to get rid of that kind of rubbish.</P>
    <P>That is happening in a highly scenic area less than 12 miles from here, in circumstances where it is visible to the public, and it just keeps happening.  That is the grand, green, clean little country we live in.  We do not have the mental culture to do what really needs to be done, to keep our environment from being polluted.  Have we the mentality to deal with that?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>A case arose recently in Naas&mdash;indeed it is still going on &mdash; of contamination of a local water supply.  People became ill and did not know what was going on.  It was rumoured that there was a problem with the water supply from the Sunday's Well source but the first reaction from the local authority was to deny that. Gradually it became more and more apparent that there was a problem with the water supply, and the supply was disconnected.  In that case there was a gradual release of incomplete information and advice to the people.  Meanwhile the problem was getting worse and more and more people were becoming <Col N="1677" /> ill.  Some of them were applying the old remedies that people apply when their children get stomach upsets.  People in the affected areas of the town whose children were getting ill, vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea, wondered what to give them to settle their stomachs.  One of the sovereign remedies for an upset tummy is flat 7-Up, and it can be flattened by adding water to it.  Consequently, unsuspecting parents were giving their children 7-Up mixed with this contaminated water and wondering why their children were becoming more sick.</P>
    <P>This happened because people did not get information from their local sanitary authority.  It was only when the situation became really serious, ten days after the problem emerged, that any comprehensive advice and guidance was given to householders, but by that stage 16 children and one or two adults were in hospital and a quarter of the population of Naas were groggy, had lost weight or were suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea, all the problems associated with the illness.</P>
    <P>In that case the local sanitary authorities first reaction was the standard one in all these difficult problems &mdash; let us keep the lid on it, above all let us not create panic.  In that case as in most other cases that is the wrong reaction; it is what continually results in people being ill.  It can be lethal and it does not solve the problem.  The proper reaction of course is to start from the beginning as if the worst had happened; hit the panic button, assume the worst and then deal with the problem.  One's reaction to such a case can always be de-escalated if one finds one has done more than is required to deal with the problem.  If one reacts gradually, with a phased response one will never get on top of the problem and the result is that people continue to get ill, the problem becomes worse and will be more difficult to deal with.</P>
    <P>That is a case that has been of concern to me and to a few thousand people in Naas, but it is not unique.  The same approach was taken by the relevant authorities to the problem at Two Mile Island, and exactly the same approach &mdash;<Col N="1678" /> although they were more rigid about it &mdash; was taken by the appropriate authorities in the case of the Chernobyl disaster. If you under-react you will never deal properly with a problem; if you overreact from day one you may do too much but you will always be sure you have done as much as can possibly be done to sort out the problem.</P>
    <P>I wonder if that is the kind of approach that is going to be taken by the Environmental Protection Agency and the local authorities when the provisions of this Bill are passed into law?  The scale of the problem we face here is far greater than is usually recogised.  There is a completely inadequate understanding among the general public of the effects of industrial, agricultural and municipal effluent and emissions.  That was typified by a report I heard of yesterday &mdash; I am speaking very much at second hand because I have not seen this report.  Apparently the ESRI have turned their attention to the problem of cleaning up the emission from the generating plant at Moneypoint.  As far as I am aware, the cost of putting state of the art scrubbers into the stacks there is in the region of £200 million.  I gather now that it is being seriously proposed that it would be more economic to spend that money in Eastern Europe to clean up some of the pollution there than to spend the money in Moneypoint.  That might very well be true if the European Community were paying for it all.</P>
    <P>The rest of the proposition is what amazes me, that if scrubbers are put in the stacks at Moneypoint they will reduce the total level of emissions, but because the emissions go higher they will travel further and the remainder will fall in Dublin, and it is a bad idea to pollute Dublin.  Apparently, that is part of the economics of this proposal.  If that is done it will pollute Dublin and depollute the parts of the country that are now affected.  It is more economic to spend the money in Eastern Europe and allow east Clare, Tipperary and the Midlands to be continually affected.  If that is the kind of economic analysis being applied in this country by a responsible organisation to investment in cleaning up our <Col N="1679" /> environment, there is precious little hope that we will get much sense out of environment policy for a long time to come. We can see the evidence of an inadequate approach to effluent treatment all over the country: we have instances in Dublin; including the row about the quality of the water in Dublin Bay; we had the row about the pollution of Cork Harbour; and the row over the sewage discharge into Lough Swilly.  There is another incident the Minister of State knows quite a bit about, the row over the sewage scheme for Kilcullen, County Kildare. The Minister of State had the great kindness and goodness to come down to Kilcullen by co-incidence I think a day or two before the last local elections and to announce solemnly that the Kilcullen sewage scheme was getting priority.  I am sure that her colleague in the locality, Senator Dardis who is also councillor John Dardis was delighted to hear the good news, as were the people of Kilcullen. It was a couple of weeks later, when the election was safely out of the way and Senator John Dardis with his beam-end safely ensconced on a seat in Kildare County Council that we found out exactly what &ldquo;priority&rdquo; means. Priority means that nothing will happen for at least 18 months.  Meanwhile in Kilcullen we still have the problem of raw sewage going into the Liffey causing a hell of a smell around the place and leaving the people downstream from Kilcullen worried about what is flowing past their lands, in some cases what is flowing into their taps, or what their children are swimmimg in.</P>

      <P>The Chair is experienced enough to know that oftimes a friendly tete-à-tete like this can develop into what would be disorderly conduct and I would not wish that to happen to either Deputy Dukes or the <Col N="1681" /> Minister of State.  Will the Deputy address the Chair, please?</P>

      <P>As always, Sir.  I am grateful for your mellifluous advice but I can assure you, Sir, that this ain't friendly and it aint't a tete-à-tete.</P>
      <P>These kinds of instances are very commonplace and they happen frequently all over the country.  However, they have one thing in common, they are partly the result of a very slapdash approach to the job before us of implementing legislation. Deputy Ellis dealt with part of the psychosis behind that.  Deputy Ellis was objecting to prosecutions where a genuine accident happened.  That all sounds very reasonable until one realised that the Two Mile Island incident was a genuine accident and that Chernobyl was a genuine accident.  One either decides to prevent it and punish when it happens, because if we do not do that rigorously one will never do it properly.</P>
      <P>Public opinion is evolving on these issues but not fast enough.  I will now deal with the kinds of things we do not seem to be sensitive about.  A while ago I spoke about the use of metals in the electronic industry &mdash; where they use several fairly rare metals which will be in the environment for a long long time to come. Many of them will have very serious effects on health if they get into the food chain or the drinking water supplies or came in contact anywhere near the human organism.  Yet we are pouring a great many of these metals into the environment every day.  It is not just the electronics industry, in case they feel I have singled them out for particular attention, but many other industries as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have transistor radios.  From time to time men use battery powered radios &mdash; although in my view they do not give you a very good shave.  Our children have toys that run on batteries.  We in this House use dictaphones that run on batteries. When you get to the point where the transistor is fading or the dictaphone is not working properly, you take out the old battery and throw it in the bin.  What happens to the used battery?  In most <Col N="1682" /> cases in this country it goes into a landfill site where the various acids and metals bubble away, polluting our environment for ages.</P>
    <P>We use plastics at an enormous rate. Indeed many people in this House use paper hankerchiefs which come in a plastic pack.  I bet many gentlemen in this House use disposable plastic razors which they throw away.  We all use ball-point pens; people in the public service use ball-point pens issued by Oifig an tSoláthair to beat the band.  All kinds of plastics are used in promotional material which we may keep for a while and then throw away.  If you go to the opening of a firm you will get this lovely little keyring with a little battery operated light so that you can find your way into you car or house at night &mdash; they seem to think that people who go to these promotions will need their keys late at night.  One gets many of these little things, all made from non-biodegradable plastic which sooner or later one throws away without any thought of what we are doing to the environment.</P>
    <P>We all use paper at a great rate.  One does not stand up in this House without paper in one's hand.  Our absent friends in the Press Gallery go through reams of paper every day, yet do we ever think about it?</P>
    <P>Yesterday I received this promotional packet &mdash; which I am sure most Members got &mdash; a cardboard box made from 100 per cent recycled paper which contains samples of recycled envelopes and the promotional letter printed in non-toxic ink.  They say they can produce any type of envelope and it will be printed in non-toxic ink.  At a fair bet 95 per cent of this promotional literature coming to Deputies will be vertically filed as we call it, into the waste paper bin, or else it will be left on the shelf in the office as something we must get around to doing whenever we have time.  It will not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Stagg, I hope you never have to get recycled because you cannot even find the handlebars.</P>
      <P>Let us concentrate on the issue.  I wonder if anybody in our public service is looking at this question or something similar, and asking if we should not use recycled paper in the Houses of the Oireachtas or in the public service because it is being used elsewhere. Undoubtedly somebody who says that will be smiled at and everybody will think it is a little naive and childish, but it will not make much difference.  They are right for as long as people think in that way &mdash; that it is a grand idea, that it is for the freaks or the ingénue but does not have much to do with the real world.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, firms who have a perfectly good eco friendly commercial idea are scrambling around carrying out commercial promotions and growing only very slowly where in fact they are producing something that is much more worth while than, for instance, what is produced by various people such as those whose products Deputies will again be spending time looking at in the next few weeks.  I am thinking of those who produce glossy Christmas cards on unrecycled paper and printed in highly toxic ink.</P>
      <P>It is not part of our culture yet to look systematically at those issues, and that is part of the reason we have reached the point at which we need a Bill that contains the kind of powers set out here; indeed, perhaps we need a Bill with even greater powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What of glass recycling?  We all use glass, though many of us have moved away from using this product in a great many ways, but do we consider recycling glass?  The Minister of State has been very active in this regard and has promoted the bottle bank idea all around the country. However, even the most successful of those projects here or in any other European Community country will indicate very clearly that they receive only a small proportion of the potential amount of material they could get.  Only a small proportion of what is recyclable is coming <Col N="1684" /> through the system to be recycled.  Again, that is because we do not have that culture and because we think that people who go on about such matters are grand, are nice people, but are a little off the wall and are not to be taken too seriously. As I said at the beginning, that is because we have not latched on to the idea that we are talking about here not about improving our environment but about stopping it from getting worse, and it has been getting worse for decades.</P>
    <P>Then there is the current argument in relation to toxic waste disposal, about the incineration of toxic waste and about the transport of toxic waste.  I wonder how seriously we take this matter.  Deputy Ellis made the very fair and reasonable comment that there are concerns in many parts of the country that landfill sites are being used for the dumping of toxic waste which should not be dumped in such places.  If we were to consider the situation in relation to toxic waste nobody would take more than a day or two to come to the conclusion that without the production of any toxic waste in addition to what we have already in storage, in landfill sites, in backyards or in factories all over the country, there is more than enough toxic waste to keep a vast plant going for years if we were to try to get rid of that waste.  But then we have an argument about whether a toxic waste disposal unit is needed.</P>
    <P>I must say that I find the current argument about the proposed Mayfield Plant in Derry to be completely unreal.  It seems to start off on the basis that there is no problem in the matter of the disposal of toxic waste, that people can sit down comfortably and argue about whether such a plant is needed.  The reality is that there is already more than enough toxic waste lying around the country to keep a vast plant going for many years.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that we have to reduce the production of toxic waste &mdash; that is another day's work; it will take time but there is no doubt that it has to be done. However, in the meantime it is idle, dishonest even, to pretend that all of the toxic wastes produced in different plants <Col N="1685" /> in this country can be effectively dealt with on site in the facility in which they are produced.  It is mischievous to say that.  On this issue I find the Green lobby to be completely unreal.  They are saying that toxic waste incineration plants should not be built because that would only encourage people to produce toxic wastes.  As I said, that argument ignores the fact that we already have toxic wastes, but it strikes me as being tantamount to saying that we should not train any more doctors because as long as there are doctors people will be encouraged to become ill.  Such an attitude is not &ldquo;green&rdquo;; it is burying one's head in the sand.</P>
    <P>Some of that argument was heard in the House yesterday at Question Time when the Minister for the Environment was doing his usual soft-shoe shuffle around the issue and not giving any answers.  He has issued invitations to tender for the provision of a toxic waste incineration plant, but he has not said where such a plant will be constructed. That is a burning question, if I may be pardoned the pun.  He has not said where the plant will be sited.  I wonder what is in the Minister's mind on this issue.  I do not know whether the Minister of State can tell us about that, sometimes I wonder whether she really agrees with her Minister or whether we will hear her on the radio next Sunday worrying about this disagreement between herself and the Minister and saying that the Government might fall on that issue next week. If the Minister and the Minister of State are serious about the issue &mdash; and I hope to God they are &mdash; they will have to give some idea of where such a plant might be situated because for as long as we do not know of their intentions in that regard there will be confusion and suspicion. Such an atmosphere on an issue of this kind is not an atmosphere in which any sensible decisions will be made, because for as long as there is confusion and suspicion and nobody knows where the plant will be situated, everyone will be running out the old NIMBY principle &mdash; if it is going to be here, not in my backyard. For as long as such an attitude exists all <Col N="1686" /> that we will have in our backyard is more and more toxic waste that could be dealt with by a properly constructed and properly monitored plant.  Let us forget the nonsensical argument about transport, because we know for a fact that wherever the plant is situated toxic waste will have to be transported to it.  We will not be able to afford, nor will people accept, any attempt to deal with the elimination of toxic waste on site everywhere it is produced.  That would not be sensible, economic or even environmentally friendly.</P>
    <P>The Bill adopts the principle of aiming for the best available technology not entailing excess cost &mdash; the BATNEEC principle, as it is called.  I should like to hear the Minister of State tell us why that particular principle underlies this Bill.  In my view, it is not self-evident that that is the way we should go.  It raises a series of questions.  We are supposed to follow the line of adopting the best available technology not entailing excessive cost, but who makes the definitions?  Who defines &ldquo;best&rdquo;?  There could be many arguments about that.</P>
    <P>After that, who defines &ldquo;available&rdquo;? We may agree on what the best technology is, but we could have endless arguments about whether it is available.  We could also have endless arguments about whether it is affordable, which is part of the &ldquo;available&rdquo; issue, and that is where the real difficulty starts.  Who defines &ldquo;entailing excessive cost&rdquo;?  What is &ldquo;excessive cost&rdquo;?  What is excessive cost for an industrial operator, a farmer or a local authority may not be considered by the Minister of State or her departmental advisers to be excessive cost.  How would that cost be measured?  Would there be a measure that includes the external costs of the investment concerned or the external costs of not adopting what wisdom has decided is the best available technology? I strongly suspect that the principle of the best available technology not entailing excessive cost will be fruitful ground for argument and will be used as a way out by a great many people involved in environmentally unfriendly activities in the years ahead and that <Col N="1687" /> there will be endless argument about it. There are some alternatives of course.</P>
    <P>There is the best practicable means principle, the subject of some comment recently in a report produced by the United Kingdom Comptroller and Auditor General, National Audit Office, on the control and monitoring of pollution. I found in the report of the inspectors' activities the following:</P>
    <P>Determining the best practical means of pollution control has had to take into account financial and commercial consequences as well as environmental factors.  Decisions and follow-up in individual cases that is not really relevant to what I am saying. Under the concept of best practicable means implementing necessary pollution controls at individual sites could be deferred over an agreed timescale after taking into account the cost and commercial implications for the industry sector to which the firms concerned belong and provided by any deferment was environmentally acceptable.  This approach provided for similar processes in different firms or plant to be authorised to operate in the interim to different emission standards.</P>
    <P>That is another possible approach, an alternative to the BATNEEC principle but, seems to me, to suffer from some of the same difficulties because it takes into account financial and commercial consequences as well as environmental factors. For example, what weight does one give to commercial and financial consequences and, on the other hand, what weight does one give to environmental factors?  That leads me to the question that, since there are problems with the BATNEEC and BPM principle, why should not we adopt the precautionary principle which is quite simply and what I recommended we should do in the case of the Naas water supply problem and incidents of that kind?  Why not assume the worst from the very beginning and act accordingly; assume that any process that comes before one for licensing will produce the worst results of which it <Col N="1688" /> is capable; do not license it and continue not to license it until one has a perfectly satisfactory, demonstrable reason for saying: now, that we have all those controls in place, now that they have been agreed, whatever the cost &mdash; and let the market decide whether or not the cost is affordable &mdash; then, and only then, will we license it.  I should like the Minister of State to give us, some of her thinking on that because she has not done so either here or in the Seanad debate.  I should like to know why this Bill goes for the BATNEEC principle because it is not self-evident that that is the best way to go in these matters.</P>
    <P>We have a great tendency here to clap ourselves on the back for having a grand clean, environmentally pure little country. Perhaps that is because we are an island.  Perhaps it is because we are good, God-fearing people as well, although I have my doubts about the whole idea. but we are not.  Environmentally there are no islands on this planet.  We are all connected up to everywhere else, if not by land then by sea and the sea is quite a good carrier of various problems, pollution and others.  There is not any way we can get away from sharing the environment with the rest of this planet.  We must examine the situation in global terms, where we have some things to learn.  Perhaps, looking at what is happening all around us, there are some indicators as to how strong we should be in the action we take under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State on Tuesday last referred to the position in the European Community.  In my view there is nothing of which to be enormously proud in the state of the environment or indeed environmental action within the EC. Nonetheless I would have to recognise that progress has been made.  I spent four years of my life working in the Commission in the EC.  One of the services with which I was directly involved was that of the environment protection service. The Minister of State will agree with me that it is in recent years only that that service has come to be recognised as <Col N="1689" /> anything more than a face-saving adornment along with the consumer protection service and the rest of the Commission services.  I am glad to say the Commission have now given it a more central role, that we have a more self-consciously militant environmental policy being urged on us by the Commission.  But there is a long way to go.</P>
    <P>The Minister made what I believe to be the kind of reference that gets in the way of real discussion here when she spoke about Germany.  I should like to quote the relevant passage from her introductory remarks to the House; I will not comment on the English:</P>
    <P>Suffice to say that the strongest economy in Europe is Germany and it is no coincidence that the Germans consider strict environmental controls to be an essential ingredient in their continued prosperity.</P>
    <P>Of course that is the kind of statement that suits the case the Minister of State was making.  But one must ask oneself: is it true; does it really reflect the reality? I do not think it does.  What the Minister has said forms a very small part of the picture.  Germany is strong industrially, not because today they have strict environmental controls but because, yesterday, they could not have given a damn about environmental controls and built up a position of industrial strength for which they and we are still paying today. I do not know whether the Minister of State has spent much time in Germany but they have serious problems there.  As we know, acid rain has devastated forests in Bavaria.  There is still serious pollution in the Rhine.  There is blight in huge areas in Germany.  I do not know whether the Minister of State has ever done so but I would recommend to her either a drive by car through the Ruhr or to fly over it.  One can spend a long time driving through the Ruhr and never be out of sight of smoke stacks, cooling towers, electricity transformers or power lines. And Germany is not the only one.  Last year I had occasion to travel by train from the Adriatic coast of Italy, across the <Col N="1690" /> northern end of the peninsula to the Mediterranean side &mdash; all the way, even in the mountains, one finds great gashes of industrial development, and all the paraphernalia that goes with it, that is an insult not only to the built environment but, much more importantly, to the physical environment, the atmosphere and the soil people have to live on.</P>
    <P>Take a drive through the Netherlands, as I have done many times, drive say, from Brussels to Amsterdam.  Take that trip through the Netherlands when, for most of that journey, one is never out of smelling distance of a chemical plant of some kind.  We know that they have major problems with disposal of animal effluent from a highly intensive agriculture. Those are problems that the EC must deal with.  In a sense I suppose one can give the negative reflection of those problems when one listens to the Austrians who talk about what they have done to the environment.  Their proud boast these days is that the Danube leaves Austria cleaner than it comes in.  Probably they are right when they say that. Let us not fool ourselves that the EC, its environment programme and those of its members states are things about which to be congratulating ourselves because they are not.  They have only slightly reduced the rate at which they are ruining their environment.</P>
    <P>Then one looks at what is happening in Central and Eastern Europe, all part of the same ecological system.  I had the opportunity this year to visit both Czechoslovakia and Hungary.  Talking to people there about the environment would make one's hair stand on end. They have the most enormous problems, with industrial pollution rampant, with acid rain, again, a major problem.  I am told there was a television documentary transmitted here in the past week or two about a town in Romania &mdash; where tons and tons of soot and metals land every day, not every year, on the town, one in which everybody has health problems, where life expectancy is considerably less than what is commonplace even in Romania, which is not one of the best places to live on the face of this planet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" /> Another example was when Russian troops were moving out of East Germany, leaving their bases there, when they found they did not have the equipment necessary to bring back all of the oil they had at their bases.  What did they do?  They spilled it out onto the ground, leaving a major pollution problem to be dealt with by the people now in charge there.  There is a huge amount of work to be done there, a huge amount of environmental damage to be overcome.</P>
    <P>Further east we can look at the Soviet economy.  We have in our Library a study of the Soviet economy produced by the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  It deals with a series of investigations into environmental problems in the Soviet Union.  God knows how many pieces the Soviet Union is about to break into.  For some time they have had state of the environment reports.  The 1988 state of the environment report identifies 290 ranges of severe ecological conditions, covering 3.7 million square kilometers &mdash; one-sixth of the total land area of the Soviet Union or ten times the size of a unified Germany. They occur all over the place. There are 33 of them in western Siberia, 28 in eastern Siberia and 22 in the north European section of the Soviet Union. We usually associate eastern Siberia with tundra, spruce forests and plains, yet there are 28 ranges of severe ecological conditions within that area.  The 1988 report indicates that about 62 million tonnes of primary pollutants are emitted annually into the atmosphere from industrial facilities and another six million tonnes from mobile sources.  It does not take long for all that to work its way around the globe and into the atmosphere of our grand, green little island. The effects on humans cover a range which is frightening.  Two-thirds of sourced water in the Soviet Union does not meet existing standards &mdash; and we think we have a problem in Naas.  Underground water supplies are seriously polluted and in 600 cities sewage water is not purified in a satisfactory manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> A section in the report deals with life expectancy in parts of the Soviet Union. In some parts life expectancy is not more than two-thirds and in some cases not more than half that common in OECD countries.  We may say that this is a problem for people in central and eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union but it will end up on our plate sooner or later, not just because we have rightly taken it upon ourselves to assist in the development of those economies but because the effects of pollution like that spread.  If they are churning out 36 million tonnes of primary pollutant into the atmosphere and they continue to do so, it will affect us.  It is part of our environment too.</P>
    <P>Other dramatic changes have taken place in the Soviet Union.  The Aral Sea today is much less extensive than it used to be.  Some time last year I saw photographs of fishing and trading vessels stranded on salt pans where there used to be fairly deep water in the Aral Sea. It is drying up because water is being drawn off and pollutants are being pumped in.  Lake Baikal, once one of the wonders of nature, is suffering from Europhication.  Nobody seems to have any confidence that this problem can be properly dealt with.  Deputy Ellis spoke earlier about using more hydro-electric power because it is environmentally friendly.  I invite him to visit the Soviet Union where major hydro-electric power stations have destroyed the environment in a number of areas.  They were part of the inspiration for one of the maddest and most gradiose projects ever conceived, namely to divert the north-flowing rivers of eastern Siberia to make them flow south and to build hydro-electric stations on them and irrigate the land.  Those projects have had a deleterious effect on the environment.  Happily some of the bigger ones have been cancelled in recent years because the resources were not available to carry them out.</P>
    <P>The Soviet Union is not the only country creating major difficulties with rivers. A whole species of salmon is about to disappear in the north west United States due to exactly the same kind of river management programmes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> I read during the past year the work of an American naturalist who wrote a series of four books about a journey across the United States at each of the seasons of the year.  One particularly fascinating book gives an account of a trip from the east coast to the west coast during the autumn in the late fifties.  I would love to find somebody to finance him to do the same trip today and to tell us how the environment compares with that of the late fifties.  Wilderness areas in all countries are becoming less and less wild.  They are being polluted and affected by our failure to do the kind of things this Bill sets out to do in a fairly modest way.</P>
    <P>What kind of development model have we for the rest of the world?  It is part of the same environment that we live in.  We are pushing western development models on the Third World.  What are the likely consequences of that?  What will those development models do to the environment not only of the Third World but to our environment?  They can only have catastrophic effects.  There is a large volume of literature on this topic.  The Minister might be familiar with the well known book, <i>The End of Nature</i> by Bill McKibbon.  It has become a kind of cult book in that people who read it and talked about it have become freaks.  It presents the arguments in such a simple way that it is difficult to argue against them.  It is the kind of thing that is pushed to the sidelines and characterised as a prophecy of doom because we all know that human ingenuity will save us.  Will it?  He makes the point that in 1985 40 per cent of the population of the western industrial countries were car owners.  At that time 1 per cent of the population of the Third World owned a car.</P>
    <P>What would be the consequences of bringing levels of car ownership in the Third World even to 1985 levels in the west?  That is a part of their aspiration, part of the development model we constantly urge on them.  If by the year 2025 energy consumption in the rest of the world reaches current western levels, we will have increased the energy load on the environment by five and a half times. <Col N="1694" /> Even today the energy load is proving to be unsustainable.  We are all getting the collywobbles about fridges and CFCs. What would happen, for example, if the level of fridge ownership per thousand households in China alone was to reach the level it is today in Western countries? There would be a huge expansion in CFC emissions and a huge multiplication of the problems of which we are now becoming aware.</P>
    <P>I want to pose another question.  One of the first things a Chinese industrial family do when they get a bit of money is to buy a transistor radio.  Radios are rather expensive in China but every family wants to have one.  They measure part of their progress by their acquisition of these kinds of consumer capital goods, brown goods.  What will happen to all the batteries used in those radios if the rate of transistor radio ownership per family in China even reaches the point we were at in the sixties?  This is a huge potential new source of pollution, not to speak of the pollution which will come from the waste products involved in producing those batteries in the first place.</P>
    <P>Can we in conscience say to the Third World that they must not follow that development model because it is bad for the world environment when they know perfectly well that we have got to our present state of material comfort with that model?  I do not think we can.  We cannot preach anything to them unless we clean up our own house first.</P>
    <P>It has been well remarked that we are hooked on fossil fuels, which is part of our problem.  The current edition of <i>The OECD Observer</i> has some very interesting things to say about the degree to which we are dependent on fossil fuels. We are making some progress but this is very slow.  It points out in an article entitled &ldquo;Energy, the Environment and the Drive for Efficiency&rdquo; that the IEA countries, that is the 24 members of the OECD minus Finland, France and Iceland, have been successful in reducing the amount of energy required to produce goods and services, thus limiting carbon dioxide emissions, not least because of a reduction in the share in the total primary <Col N="1695" /> energy supply of carbon based fuels.  It continues:</P>
    <P>Indeed without the 25% decline in energy intensity which has occurred since 1973, IEA countries would have emitted about 19% more carbon than they did in 1988.</P>
    <P>The article goes on to talk about the potential effects of future developments on energy use.  The curious part of the article is that it says that even though we have become more energy efficient in given operations, our culture still tends towards using more energy.  It continues:</P>
    <P>Structural change in road transport and in residential and commercial building has tended to offset these reductions.  In construction, for example, the trend towards smaller families has increased floor space <i>per capita</i> and, as a result, energy consumption. And in the office the increased use of air conditioning has tended to increase intensity.  Electrical appliances, too, are more widely used. In road transport there have been massive increases in traffic, outweighing improvements in the fuel efficiency of individual vehicles, and recent trends towards larger and more powerful vehicles have offset earlier improvements in fuels economy.</P>
    <P>In the IEA countries which, by and large are all Western industrialised countries, there have been improvements in energy efficiency.  While on the one hand we are becoming less energy intensive per unit of output, on the other we are becoming more energy using because we are living and acting in ways which give us more opportunities or create more situations where we use energy.  Even if we are doing well, we might be standing still.</P>
    <P>The really hair raising implication of this is that if we push on Third World countries Western development models we may make them less energy intensive per unit of GNP.  We will also be pushing on them a culture which will give them more and more reasons to use energy in different ways so that the kind of energy <Col N="1696" /> intensity we have today is something they will aspire to in the future and we will have to deal with all of the results of that on our environment, atmosphere and the soil under our feet.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal more at stake for us than the maintenance of this green clean little island of ours because we will also be affected by what goes on in the Third World, by how much energy they use and the increased emissions they put as a result into the atmosphere.  That scenario for the future underlines the fact that we are very late at national level in getting to grips with this problem.  There is a great deal more I could say but the literature on this subject is abundant and I am sure the Minister of State has it all at her disposal.</P>
    <P>We congratulate ourselves on not having any nuclear power stations in Ireland.  I honestly believe that is one aspect on which we should congratulate ourselves.  It is dreadful to contemplate that every time a nuclear reactor is commissioned we set off what is literally a time bomb which will tick away not for hundreds of years but thousands of years. Of course, we do not see the whole picture. Every time we manufacture a medical tool which uses radiation for measurement or any other reason we set off another little time bomb which will also tick away for quite a long time.  Every time we manufacture and commission a new very sensitive high technology state of the art industrial measuring device that uses radiation we set off another one of those little time bombs.  Every time we commission a new machine, as we hope to do more of, to help cure people of some forms of cancer we set off another little time bomb which will be around for thousands of years.  I am not talking about nuclear submarines which travel to the bottom of the sea in the Arctic; I am talking about machines we use day in and day out which are little time bombs and which remain time bombs long after they have come to the end of their useful life.</P>
    <P>We have to do something about these little time bombs.  We have to find ways of rendering them less dangerous.  We have to reprocess them and the nuclear <Col N="1697" /> fuel.  What do we do when we have nuclear fuel to reprocess?  We pack it up in containers which protect the public and ship it to Sellafield, the place we all love to hate and which we all demand the closure of.  Yet we send our nuclear waste to be reprocessed at that plant because it is the nearest and most convenient reprocessing plant to us.</P>
    <P>It is long past the time we began to discuss the real issue and real effect of the Sellafield reprocessing plant on us.  It is time Members of this House stopped trying to con the Irish public into the naïve belief that if we shout loud enough this plant will be closed down.  To tell the House the God's honest truth, while I have a certain feeling of congratulation for the Minister for Energy, I also like to see him wriggle because when he was a Fianna Fáil Opposition Deputy he came into this House and claimed that there was absolutely no difficulty in finding perfectly unassailable legal grounds for the Irish Government to demand the immediate closure of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>He is now the Minister in this Government who has to tell the Irish public that he cannot find a compelling reason, a sufficient legal armlock to put on the British Government, to make them close down Sellafield.  He says it as infrequently as he can manage to get away with saying it.  It is a pity we do not have more of the truth about that whole issue, not alone the political truth here but the economic truth over there.  I do not know what the opponents of Sellafield think about it. There are people on this side of the House who still perpetuate the myth that in some way we can engineer a situation &mdash; if that is the right word &mdash; where Sellafield will be closed down.  I do not know what they will do about the rest of the problems.</P>
    <P>About two years ago we began to have serious fears here about what was then adumbrated as a proposal in the UK to deal with the nuclear reactors from decommissioned nuclear submarines.  We got very annoyed, and quite rightly, about an idea that they were supposed to be considering, which was to encase the <Col N="1698" /> offending bits of these nuclear submarines in concrete or some other material and dump them in a trench some few hundred miles to the southwest of Ireland in the Atlantic.  We said: &ldquo;No, you cannot do that&rdquo; and we were right. Then there was a proposal that they would use old used-up coalmines in the northern part of England to bury nuclear waste that could not be reprocessed any further.  Quite rightly and understandably the people who lived over those coalmines objected strongly.  The <i>deus ex machina</i> was a proposal to dig deep tunnels under the Irish Sea to store all this material and we objected to that and said: &ldquo;If this stuff is too dangerous for your people to accept on your territory, there is no way we are going to have it under the Irish Sea where it will do us damage.&rdquo;  That is an illustration of the difficulty we face.  We do not want to see them getting rid of bits of decommissioned nuclear submarines southwest of us in the Atlantic, we do not want to see them burying it under the Irish Sea and the British do not want to see them burying it in old coalmines in the UK.  What happens?  All this stuff is still sitting somewhere above ground &mdash; as safe as it can be made &mdash; and nothing new is being done with it.  At the same time we are sitting here with our smug satisfaction that we do not have any nuclear problem here, quietly exporting our material for reprocessing to Seallafield and we are saying, close down Sellafield.  What is the logic of it?  Is that the NIMBY principle?  Are we going to say to them: &ldquo;Close down Sellafield&rdquo; and convince the French that they should have this operation on their territory and hive off the problem in that way?  Are we saying that Seallafield should be closed down and that we should convince the Czechs, who have not woken up to this problem yet, that they should have the operation on their ground?  I know we will not say to them: &ldquo;Close down Sellafield and remove the whole operation to somewhere beside Chernobyl&rdquo; so that they can do with the reprocessing plant what they did with a power station in Chernobyl.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1699" /> The fact is, whether we like to or not, we are part of the system &mdash; although only a small part &mdash; and we need nuclear reprocessing plants.  It is about time we started talking about dealing with that problem rather than fooling ourselves into the stupid belief and the anti-environmental belief that we can close down the only one that is near to us without something else being done to replace the activity and the facility it can offer to the rest of the world.  In all conscience we have little authority to lecture or to give out to the rest of the world until we have decided what we are going to do about the waste we can process here, or, are we going to keep on making the argument that any toxic waste produced in Ireland has to be sent away, not just out of our lttle green Republic but off our island and even away from the neighbouring island, because it is too close to us?  Those are the issues we should be dealing with in relation to the environment, but we are not going to deal with them by the kind of sanctimonious claptrap that has passed for arguments about Sellafield and toxic waste disposal in Ireland for the last five or six years.</P>
    <P>I said earlier there were proposals in Fine Gael's 1989 Bill, brought forward by Deputy Shatter, that are not in this Bill.  I would like to mention a few.  We proposed that the chairman and the board of the Environmental Protection Agency be appointed by the Dáil with a procedure similar to that used for the appointment of the Ombudsman so that we could have proper parliamentary involvement in what is going to be a key area of our national life in future.  That is not in this Bill and it is all the weaker for it.  I have not heard any argument from the Minister of State as to why she proposes to do it her way rather than the way we proposed.  I would think &mdash; although maybe after the events of last week where nothing was discussed in the Dáil &mdash; the Minister of State and her Minister would prefer things not to be discussed in here; personally, as a Member of this House I think these things should be discussed here and the <Col N="1700" /> Dáil should be involved in making as many of those decisions as it can be.</P>
    <P>We provided for a Dáil committee on the environment which would provide this House with the means of keeping itself informed on environmental issues on what is being done and what progress is being made to deal with those problems. I think, Sir, it is important that we should do that, because although there may be scribes &mdash; not present at the moment &mdash; who write about us in disparaging tones from time to time, one of whom said the other day he thought there was only about a quarter of us worth keeping, there is not even a quarter of them there, so that is a comment on themselves.  Whatever we may think, people listen to what Members of this House say with varying degrees of scepticism. If we are not properly informed in this House about the key issues of our environment and of preventing any further deterioration of our environment I do not think we will be able to do our job properly.  That was the reason we proposed in our Bill an environment committee of this House.  I would have thought that a Minister of State who belongs to a party that belongs to a Government that says they want to see Dáil reform should agree with us on that point.</P>
    <P>It is pernicious that people in this House who are listened to by the general public do not have under the provisions of this Bill any lever, any window into the argument about what is happening to our environment or any influence in what public policy is going to do apart from the passing of an Act.  They have very little else because this Bill provides for reports to be made at three yearly or five yearly intervals so that this House will not be able to discuss reports on a regular basis that would get us plugged into the debate and the effort that has to be made on our environment.</P>
    <P>We proposed greater access for the Environmental Protection Agency to documents and records of Departments and State agencies.  That is not contained in this Bill.  That will constitute a very serious limitation on the scope of the <Col N="1701" /> action that the agency will be able to take.  We also provided for a supervisory role for the Environmental Protection Agency over the operations of Government and State agencies in the environment area.  That too is not in this Bill. That is a very serious lack because there is absolutely no reason whatever, in logic or in commonsense, that public agencies, the State, local authorities, semi-State bodies should not be subject to the same public controls and publicly accountable controls over their activities as private operators.  In some cases we have reason to believe it is even more urgent in the case of some State agencies than in relation to private operators.</P>
    <P>In Deputy Shatter's Bill we provided for control or stop orders with an appeal mechanism; but there is nothing of that kind in this Bill.  The reason we made those provisions was to allow the agency to take immediate action when a problem arose rather than having to wait for all the procedures to be gone through, and the problem worsened, before any action could be taken to remedy it.  There is no reference in this Bill to pesticides.  That is an area of major concern in relation to the environment which should properly be brought in.  We have air pollution and water pollution in this and we should have specific reference to pesticides.  Pesticides are one of the elements that cause serious environmental problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, towards the end of her speech on Tuesday, talked about sustainable development.  She said:</P>
    <P>This Government are committed to sustainable economic development. Essentially, that means that in the pursuit of economic development to meet the needs for the present generation we must not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their needs. I have no doubt that the greatest legacy that we can leave to future generations is a clean, unspoiled environment because that is our single most important natural resource.</P>
    <P>Bravo, we all agree with that.  I compliment the Minister on the beautiful phraseology she used, but what does it <Col N="1702" /> mean?  What is &ldquo;sustainable economic development&rdquo;?  Could the Minister of State give us any concept of what is the &ldquo;sustainable economic development&rdquo; to which the Government are committed? Does it mean that there are some kinds of industry that we will not have, that there are some kinds of costs that are not too great for us to incur for the sake of our environment?  Does it mean that we want to see an economy that stops adding polluting materials to our environment, not that observes the standards we lay down for additions?</P>
    <P>Environment control legislation as we have known it up to now is based on the proposition that one can pollute the environment as long as one does it according to the rules, the criteria and the specifications laid down in the law. We are not stopping pollution.  We are guiding it, we are controlling it, but we are not stopping it.  The proper concept of sustainable economic development is economic development that does not add any more to the pollution of our environment. That is a very different concept from what is in the Bill &mdash; the best available technology not entailing excessive costs.  That is not necessarily sustainable economic development.  It may be economic development that can carry on for a bit longer than uncontrolled pollution, but in the long term it is not sustainable economic development.  I would like the Minister of State to tell us what she has in mind by sustainable economic development and to tell us how long she thinks that kind of economic development she has in mind could be sustained.</P>
    <P>We are not without advice from our own resources on this Bill.  The Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities produced its report No. 6, dated 5 December last year, entitled <i>Aspects of EC Environment Policy</i> and it produced eight recommendations. The first was that</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Directive on freedom of access to environmental legislation should be transposed into national law as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> I am not at all convinced that the provisions on public information in this Bill meet that requirement and there is a question that there are limits to public access to information on this Bill.  The Minister of State has not explained satisfactorily why the limits there are contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. II says:</P>
    <P>Information available to the public under the provisions of the Directive should be supplemented by authoritative assessments of risk in environmentally-sensitive areas.</P>
    <P>I do not think that that is provided for in this Bill.  I do not find in this Bill even what seems to me to be the minimum step of putting public authorities of all kinds automatically under an obligation to produce an environment impact statement on the plans they have.  They are not obliged to do that under the terms of this Bill and I cannot see any reason why they should not be obliged.  I am not insulting anybody when I say that any county council, any corporation or the Office of Public Works are just as capable of polluting the environment as any private operator and need the supervision of a dispassionate objective State agency just as much as anybody else.  Nowhere have we seen that more clearly than in the recent argument about the Mullaghmore Interpretative Centre to which my friend and colleague, Deputy Carey, referred earlier this morning.  A lot of energy has been wasted in discussions about that when it was obvious from the beginning that one of the things needed in order to allow both sides of the argument to make any sense of it was an environment impact statement.  We are going to have that, not because the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works reclining up there, volunteered to have it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can tell you, you are no adornment to the environment, for your unfortunate leader at the moment. Recommendation No. III says:</P>
      <P>Environment Action Programmes should be published annually by Government and should include an assessment of achievements under the previous year's programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will come to that later on but there is one place in this Bill where reviews or reports are required every five years and another place where they are required every three years.  I do not know why we have to wait three years and five years <Col N="1705" /> for these things but it is certainly not what the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities had in mind when they made that recommendation.  Recommendation No. IV was that the national environment agency should be established as a matter of urgency.  I agree with that.  Recommendation No. VIII was that</P>
    <P>Ireland's record in implementation and enforcement of EC environmental legislation should be improved and maintained at a high level.</P>
    <P>I agree with that also.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Chair will forgive me for not going into recommendation No. V which talks about this argument that is going on about Johnstown Castle.  In the favourite phrase of the Taoiseach, I will stand aside from that argument.  I am afraid it is, like a lot of the noxious substances that are poured into our environment these days, an argument that will generate a lot more heat than light.</P>
    <P>I will turn briefly to the Bill because there are a number of issues that seem to me to require more comment than we have had from the Minister of State. The Bill makes provision for a series of regulations and orders in relation to different matters.  I commend the Minister of State on the fact that a number of the most important of these regulations and orders are made under what I choose to call the positive procedure in this House &mdash; in other words, the draft is brought before the House and no effect is given to it until a motion approving the draft has been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There are cases where orders and regulations may be made under the provisions of this Bill under the negative procedure, that is, they will come into effect and will continue to have effect unless they are annulled by a motion of this House within 21 sitting days.  I would seriously recommend to the Minister of State again that, if she has any interest in democracy and parliamentary procedure, she look at that again.  I do not believe that those orders should be a regular feature of our legislation. They are a very bad idea as they <Col N="1706" /> allow Ministers to go off into the wild blue yonder to do things without any proper control in this House.</P>
    <P>The Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill claims that Part IV provides for an integrated pollution control licensing system.  We will go into that matter in more detail on Committee Stage, but I wonder if that is true.  The main reason I wonder about that is that the Bill provides in a number of respects not only for the Agency to be the licensing authority but to be the judge and jury of their own record when it comes to reviewing licences.  That is not satisfactory.  We proposed a different procedure for dealing with that problem in the Bill Deputy Shatter brought forward.  Nothing I have seen in this Bill or nothing I have heard from the Minister of State convinces me that this problem has been dealt with properly.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go in detail into the sections of the Bill except to repeat what I have said before: that the amendments made to the Bill in the Seanad are more technical than anything else.  I am not insulting anyone when I say that in terms of policy they do not amount to a row of beans.  We have a definition section which states that &ldquo;noise&rdquo; includes vibration.  It is grand to know that the definition of &ldquo;noise&rdquo; includes vibration but on a purely physical level noise is a vibration at different frequencies.  One does not get noise without something vibrating. One does not hear me making noise without my vocal chords vibrating.  To say that the definition of &ldquo;noise&rdquo; includes vibration is something of a tautology. Does it say anything more than that?</P>
    <P>The reason I ask this is that in a later section of the Bill there is a provision which states that public authorities can be exempted from the provisions of the Bill in relation to the control of noise. They can exempt authorised agencies from the provisions of the Bill in relation to the control of noise which immediately raises the question of what is noise.  There is no definition of &ldquo;noise&rdquo; in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Neither is there any definition of &ldquo;smell&rdquo;.  I have heard learned discourses <Col N="1707" /> on the difficulties of defining &ldquo;smell&rdquo;.  At least twice a day I have to pass a meat factory.  I am delighted it is there because it employes a great many young people in my town and provides a service for farmers.  As you know, Sir, better than anyone else sitting in this House at the moment, there are always arguments about prices but that factory produces a hell of a smell from time to time.  That is not the only place where you get that kind of nuisance but it is cold comfort to people who suffer from that to tell them that we are not going to do anything for them in this Bill because we cannot define &ldquo;smell&rdquo;.  I wonder if the Minister of State has given any attention to that matter.</P>
    <P>I was never a chemist or anything like it but to my knowledge a smell is produced by the suspension of certain materials in the air and by the fact that certain chemicals are carried in the air and when they reach our olfactory nerves they produce a reaction which is called smell.  It seems that if one were to set about doing the job properly one could define smell, or noxious smells at least, as the presence of certain elements in the air.  I recall the experiments we used to do in my science classes at school years and years ago when one could produce fairly ripe smells with bromine and chlorine and their various compounds.  I do not know what we might call, the salient elements are in the smell which comes from meat and bone meal plants, or most meat factories, but it seems that it should be possible to define the matter suspended in the air which gives rise to the smell.  That is an area of nuisance we might look at.  I am not being facetious about this but we know very well that bad smells can make people sick.  We should not just pass over this area as being too difficult to deal with and to let people go on getting sick because we can not find a definition to put in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 contains the BATNEEC principle which I have already mentioned. I wonder why we refer in section 5 (3) (b) to the Air Pollution Act, 1987, only and why other forms of pollution are not dealt with.  Section 12 deals with <Col N="1708" /> the cost of prosecutions and provides that certain costs will be paid to the agency. There are other provisions in the Bill which deal with payments to the agency by way of costs and charges.  Would the Minister of State, when replying to the debate, like to comment on the fear which was raised in the Seanad and I think in this House already &mdash; it is a very real fear &mdash; that the existence of the possibility of the agency recovering costs in a number of ways, including charges, might take the pressure off the Exchequer to fund the agency's operations properly?  I have to say that I do not see any evidence in this Bill of any great intention to ensure that the agency will be funded properly.  For example, the agency will have to set up specifications and standards and will have to do a lot of research if they are to do this properly and this costs money.  I have not been convincecd by anything we have seen yet that we will see any net increase in the allocation of resources to environmental action.  If we do not see any net increase we will not see much improvement by way of a reduction in the rate at which we are polluting our environment.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for immunity for the agency in certain circumstances in relation to &ldquo;damage to property or other loss alleged to have been caused or contributed to by a failure to perform or comply with any of the functions conferred on the said agency or body&rdquo;. Therefore, people will not have a claim if they suffer damage or loss as a result of the agency having failed in their duties. I would like to know why it is necessary to put that in because it seems an agency of this kind should be under the maximum possible pressure to ensure they fulfil their obligations.</P>
    <P>Section 21 speaks of the director general and committee which will be put in place.  As I said, it is my belief that the Alan Shatter Bill of 1989 produced a far better procedure and I would prefer to see that procedure substituted for the one here.  As long as we are talking about the procedure provided for in this Bill I note that three of the people who will make up this committee will be the managing <Col N="1709" /> director of the Industrial Development Authority, the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the chief executive of the Council for the Status of Women.  I would like to know why those three people are included and the reason many other people, who might be just as well qualified as the very excellent people who are now respectively the managing director of the Industrial Development Authority, the general secretary of Congress and the chief executive of the Council for the Status of Women, are not included.  Each of those three people is an excellent person. While I would not agree with everything they say I admire them all.  They are very able people, but why are those three people or functions picked out when there is a wide range of choice?</P>
    <P>Section 27 deals with the advisory committee which it is proposed should be set up.  On the whole I am sure it is a very good section which we might look at in more detail on Committee Stage.  Under section 27 (16) (b) the Minister may remove from office a member of the advisory committee if, in the opinion of the Minister, he has become incapable through ill health of effectively performing his duties or for stated misbehaviour. So far, so good.  However, it goes on to say that he may be removed if the Minister considers it necessary or desirable for the effective performance by the advisory committee of their functions. I agree that people should be removed if they have become incapable through ill health of performing their duties or for stated misbehaviour.  Will the Minister of State tell us what she or the Minister have in mind in leaving it to themselves to judge that the removal of a person appears to the Minister to be necessary or desirable for the effective performance by the advisory committee of their functions?  I do not like provisions in legislation which give Ministers mysterious, murky and opaque powers of that kind.  If the Minister believes that there is a reason for removing a person it should be an objective reason.  I will not go into any more of the inferences we might take from that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1710" /> Section 29 is an important one which deals with the staff of the agency because they will be very important in carrying out the work of the agency.  However, the impression I have from the Bill &mdash; and everything that has been said about it &mdash; is that the staff of the agency will be garnered from various agencies already in existence, from the former An Foras Forbartha, local authorities and so on. This section does not give me an assurance that we will see any net extra resources of staff applied to the agency. I ask the Minister &mdash; I referred to this before &mdash; to look at the UK National Audit Office report on the pollution inspectorate.  There is much in it about the kind of staffing they believe is needed to carry out their job and indeed the level of research expenditure which is also needed.  They do not intend to do this by taking in staff from existing local authorities. There is nothing in this section about the level of provision of staff but there is quite a substantial amount regarding how negotiations will be carried out between the agency and the unions to persuade staff to move to the agency from other employment.</P>
    <P>Section 44 deals with the provision of services to the agency.  Again I must ask the Minister of State whether she can give me any indication that the provisions of the section will produce any net new resources which will be devoted to the functions provided for in this Bill.  If they do not the Bill is doomed to failure from the beginning.</P>
    <P>Section 58 relates to the agency's work in relation to drinking water.  On the basis of our recent experience in Naas and other places the current provisions are not satisfactory.  To the extent that the section is based on current provisions it is likely to need very substantial modification.</P>
    <P>Section 60 deals with landfill sites for waste disposal; there again we need to look very carefully at the section because nobody can argue against my contention that there is a crying need for a very substantial improvement in the way we deal with landfill sites.  Deputy Ellis raised a problem in this regard.  We know <Col N="1711" /> there are instances where landfill sites have been used to dump toxic waste.  I will make another simple point in that connection, anywhere you go you can tell you are coming near a landfill site because you can see the rubbish for miles on the approach.  Rubbish of all kind is polluting the environment and we do not have a proper way of making sure that our landfill sites are properly managed.</P>
    <P>Section 61 deals with the performance of their statutory functions by local authorities. Curiously, it provides that where the agency are of the opinion that a local authority are not doing their job they may request a report from them.  Why are we adopting that approach?  It is a bit naïve to expect a local authority to make an objective and useful report on their own shortcomings, which is what this section seems to require.  Subsection (3) (b) states that local authorities can be penalised for a failure, without reasonable cause, to comply with a direction from the agency.  How will &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; be defined because elsewhere in the section local authorities are absolved from giving effect to directions if they can show that they do not have the necessary funds to comply with the direction or that those funds cannot reasonably be made available by the local authority?  That seems to indicate local authorities can get out of their obligations under the Bill by saying that they do not have the money and, therefore, the Minister cannot require them to do the job.  Is that what the section means?  If local authorities can be relieved of their obligations because they do not have the funds then it seems to me that smart local authorities will use their funds for everything except the requirements of the Bill and put the onus for its implementation on the Minister because they will say it is separate from their normal funding.  It is not satisfactory that that kind of doubt or possible confusion should be in the Bill, it should be very clear.</P>
    <P>Section 63 deals with the environmental monitoring programme.  Again I have to ask whether the local authorities will have the resources to do that <Col N="1712" /> because, if they do not, the provision will be a dead letter.  Later, in the same section, it says that if the agency are not satisfied with the performance of the local authority &mdash; and find they are not doing the job &mdash; they can monitor the agency and local authority.  However, the costs of carrying out that monitoring will have to be borne by the local authorities.  If the local authorities do not have the resources to carry out the job in the first place how will they find the resources to cover the cost of the agency?</P>
    <P>Section 66 (7) provides that the agency shall, at intervals not exceeding three years, prepare and publish a report on the monitoring operations of local authorities and so on.  Why not more frequently? Section 68 provides for a state of the environment report which has to be produced within a period of five years after the establishment of the agency and in every fifth year thereafter.  Why five years?  If we wait for five years for a report on the state of the environment we will very often find that it will be sadly out of date because much can happen over that period.</P>
    <P>Section 69 deals with environmental research but, again, there is no indication that we will have a proper level of resource provisions for research which will be a key part of equipping the agency to set standards to carry out monitoring and all the other jobs set out in the Bill. Section 70 deals with environmental impact assessment, to which I already referred.  I do not like the idea that public authorities are exempt from that.  This Bill should fill that gap and make public authorities subject to the same requirements as private developers as regards producing environmental impact statements.</P>
    <P>Environmental audits are dealt with in section 72.  The question of funding for research will be a key issue here.  Codes of practice are dealt with in section 74.  I would like to ask a very simple question: why does section 74 state that the agency may do certain things rather than stating that the agency shall do certain things? Section 76 deals with environmental labelling.  I would like to hear more about <Col N="1713" /> this on Committee Stage.  Environmental labelling is an extremely complex matter. It has what to my mind seems to be unexpected complications.  I went to the trouble of reading a recent OECD report on environmental labelling in OECD countries.  It is a very useful report which shows a number of things, not least of which is that we are very far behind in our approach to environmental labelling.</P>
    <P>Although it is referred to in the Bill, and in the Minister's speech, I am not at all impressed with the first approach by the European Community to environmental labelling.  It has taken an unconscionable length of time to get that far. When I was with the Commission, from 1977-80, we started work on drawing up specifications for environmental labelling of products, but it is only this year that the Directive is putting pressure on member states to put the scheme into effect.  Germany started in 1978 and they now have 3,600 labelled products in 64 categories. The Nordic countries, Austria, Portugal and France are to start this year and by 1992, it appears, 22 OECD countries, excluding Ireland, will have an environmental labelling scheme.</P>
    <P>However, there have been problems. In a number of countries attempts have been made to make the scheme self-financing &mdash; which is always a useful thing to be able to do &mdash; but they found it difficult to do so.  Their method of making it self-financing was by making a charge for the approval of a label.  There is also the problem of categorising products, where it is possible to discriminate against some products that have no environmental side effects by giving an environment label to ones that do.  One of the examples given in this report is of the difficulty that would arise when an environment label is given to a propelled deodorant.  One is saying that when account is taken of its full effect on the environment it is relatively better than most other propelled deodorants. However, one does not have to give an environment label to a stick deodorant because it does not contain or emit anything that would harm the environment. One could argue &mdash; we may have a long <Col N="1714" /> and intimate discussion on this on Committee Stage &mdash; that stick deodorants are more preferable in environmental terms, certainly if one leaves the question of olfactory nuisance out of it, than propelled deodorants.  They are some of the difficulties that will have to be dealt with when we go about setting up a scheme of environmental labelling.</P>
    <P>There is an exemption in section 82 for what are to be regarded as &ldquo;exempted developments by local authorities&rdquo;.  That comes back to the question I raised earlier, why should there be any area of our planning laws from which local authorities, being themselves developers, should be exempt?  Section 86 gives rise to the difficulty which I mentioned earlier, that this Bill makes the agency the judge and jury in their own case, an unsatisfactory method of proceeding and one the Minister should rethink very seriously.</P>
    <P>Section 95 deals with discharges to sewers and involves sanitary authorities in the granting of licences for such discharges. Again, I have to ask about the question of resources.  Will the sanitary authorities have the experience and expertise to participate constructively in that process?  Section 98 allows the agency to undertake certain functions either in addition to or in lieu of local authorities.  The Minister of State has not explained why that provision is there.  I would like to know the reason because it seems on the face of it to create the possibility of a confusion of responsibilities, and all agree that confusion of responsibilities in relation to the environment produces only one result, damage to the environment.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the problem of noise and the fact that there is no definition of it. It is provided in section 106 that that section shall not apply to noise caused by aircraft or &ldquo;such statutory undertaker or local authority, as may be prescribed, in the exercise of powers conferred on it by or under any enactment in such circumstances as may be prescribed&rdquo;.  I can understand why the section does not apply to noise caused by aircraft &mdash; that is regulated for separately &mdash; although I <Col N="1715" /> cannot see any <i>prima facie</i> reason why there should not be a link between the activities of this agency and the regulation of noise from aircraft.  That is already the subject of international agreements and specifications of different kinds.  I would like to know why an exemption can be made for noise caused by statutory undertakers or local authorities in such circumstances as may be prescribed by the agency.  It seems that a noise nuisance is a noise nuisance no matter who causes it, and it is no consolation to people who are suffering badly from the effects of noise pollution to know that the noise is caused by somebody who has a licence to do so from the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>There are many areas where the provisions of the Bill are inadequate, open to question and do not meet our need not simply to control pollution but to try to reduce the rate at which we are damaging our environment.  I confess that although I am normally a sanguine person in relation to questions of the environment, even with this Bill, I see the future as being only gloomy.  The only question that arises is to what degree we can slow down the rate at which it becomes even gloomier.</P>

      <P>I have listened with interest to Deputy Dukes's speech and there is no doubt he has not lost his oratorial skills since he moved to the backbenches.  While I found his speech to be full of interesting comments on his experiences on the international scene, and no doubt a well researched speech, I question the length of it; it went on for about two hours.  I hope the committee dealing with Dáil reform will consider putting a limit on Second Stage speeches. I say that not because I have been waiting to contribute but because I believe that Deputy Dukes's contributions could have been made in a more concise way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy could convince his colleagues to set up more committees to deal with Bills we might make much more progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dukes said some <Col N="1716" /> interesting things on the global perspective but as regards our country his contribution was rather negative and non-progressive.  In the earlier part of his speech he said we have a clean environment because we have a small manageable population.  It is true we have a small manageable population, but surely that is our greatest advantage.  The fact we are arriving at this legislation rather late puts us at an advantage in that we can learn from elsewhere.  The Government have taken a number of initiatives in recent years and we must compliment them on that.  For example, the legislation in relation to smog has made life much more tolerable for many people and has had a beneficial effect on the health of many in the Dublin area.  Legislation in relation to the pollution of our rivers has been effective and I for one have noticed a dramatic decrease in the number of fish kills in the recent summers, in particular.  While I accept the point that we have a small manageable population there is no doubt that many good things have been done as a forerunner to this legislation.</P>
      <P>I look forward to seeing this Bill on the Statute book as soon as possible as the Minister requested.  In the course of his speech Deputy Dukes commented on Sellafield, and I will refer to that later.  I found some of his comments fatalistic and having listened to some of the views he expressed one would feel like throwing in the towel although he did paint a true picture of the global scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can make a positive contribution. We are perceived internationally as a country with a clean green image. However, we have done some positive and progressive things to enhance our image.  I believe the Environmental Protection Agency Bill is a landmark piece of legislation.  The implications of the Bill extend far beyond the boundaries of our island.  It throws down the challenge to us as legislators to become leaders in the field of environmental preservation and protection in the European Community and indeed worldwide.  The fact that we are introducing this legislation a little later than some of our European partners <Col N="1717" /> may ironically be an advantage in that I am convinced we will get it right on this occasion.  We will have better legislation than many of our EC partners.  Indeed we are fortunate that our country has not been ravaged and destroyed environmentally like so many other industrialised nations.</P>
    <P>We have a country, a product, that can be saved not just for us but for our children and indeed our children's children. Ireland is perceived internationally as a country with clean air, clean rivers, green fields and a breathtaking landscape. It evokes the words of Yeats: &ldquo;I will arise and go now and go to Inisfree&rdquo; which conjures up the true image of Ireland.  This environmental beauty is without doubt our greatest natural resource.  It must not just be protected but preserved for all time, for generations to come.  The speedy enactment of this Bill is essential in order to demonstrate clearly our commitment to preserving our natural splendour while at the same time allowing for controlled industrial expansion which will fit comfortably and be closely compatible with our natural surroundings.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment laid the foundation for the introduction of this legislation when he initiated the Government's excellent ten year environmental action programme, a clear blueprint for all of us who are concerned about the future development of this country.  Having shown this type of leadership at EC level I see no reason the European Environmental Protection Agency should not be located in Ireland. After all modern technology means that Ireland's peripheral geographic location can no longer be seen as a reason for not locating this agency in this country.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency will rise to the challenge presented by the desire and necessity to protect our environment and at the same time encourage new and progressive industries. The regulatory functions allocated to this independent agency allow for research and the implementation of environment programmes.  The agency are rightly given the power to penalise <Col N="1718" /> and prosecute violations as defined under Part I, section 11.  There has been considerable progress in pollution control among the farming community in recent years.  The number of fish kills was much lower this summer.  Farmers must continue to play their part by availing of the scheme of grants to assist them in carrying out pollution control works. There has been considerable Government investment in this area and I hope that the blatant destruction of our waterways and lakes is a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency will in the long term operate under the umbrella of the European Community Environmental Protection Agency.  It is noteworthy that the practice of introducing new taxes and levies on environmentally unfriendly goods and services is being adopted by the European Community Environmental Protection Agency.  Similarly, the Irish Environmental Protection Agency will obviously develop a similar strategy in providing an incentive for industry to be environmentally friendly and penalise and discourage the pollution of our environment.  Our agency, in co-operation with the Euopean Community Environmental Protection Agency, must address the issue of energy sources and supply; the safe use of existing fuels and disposal of their waste.  It is interesting to note that oil reserves in Eastern Europe are over three times as great as those in Western Europe and gas reserves are eight times greater in Eastern Europe. At the same time Central and Eastern Europe has undergone a frightening level of environmental degradation.  In its industrial regions the quality of life and life expectancy are well below the average in Western Europe.  The unacceptably high levels of pollution have resulted in widespread respiratory diseases, infant mortality and congenital defects.  The quality of drinking water has been destroyed in many areas and the damage to forests by sulphur dioxide pollution is literally suffocating some of these countries.  In Czechoslovakia, for example, 60 per cent of all trees are reported to be dying.  I have referred <Col N="1719" /> to the situation in Central and Eastern Europe for the following reasons, any debate on the environment in this Chamber must take account of our membership of the EC and the role we should play within that Community.  I hope that the Environmental Protection Agency will not have an insular approach to our environment but will see the need to address global issues, compare notes with other countries and learn from the experience elsewhere.  Western Europe, including Ireland, has an important role to play in aiding the economic and environmental recovery of Central and Eastern Europe. This will not be a one way development process.  As I already mentioned, Central and Eastern Europe have vast energy resources which could be shared with the West in exchange for economic and environmental assistance.</P>
    <P>The European Environmental Protection Agency will have a central and pivotal role to play in facilitating a process of co-operation between Eastern and Western Europe.  The European Environmental Protection Agency should be empowered to address transfrontier problems which have resulted from the expansion of the nuclear industry in Europe.  Our own Environmental Protection Agency should promote such a proposal.  What is sadly happening in Europe is that the pro-nuclear lobby within the Community has the upper hand.  Ireland, in opposing ludicrous nuclear expansion at the Sellafield plant needs new allies within Europe.  Perhaps with the expansion of the European market such allies will emerge.  I certainly hope so.  The concept of a European inspectorate that would monitor the safety and expansion of nuclear installations throughout Europe, including Sellafield, is something that must be pursued vigorously.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to some of the remarks made by Deputy Dukes.  As I said earlier, he paints a fatalistic outlook of Ireland's relationship to Sellafield over the years and a rather black picture of future developments.  I think the Deputy fails to see that the debate on Sellafield <Col N="1720" /> is really a debate about the expansion of the nuclear industry in the United Kingdom.  They have installed a new plant, THORP, a thermal oxide reprocessing plant in Sellafield which is due to come onstream next year.  This plant will be reprocessing waste not only from the UK but from countries as far away as Japan and indeed from Germany where they have decided not to construct a reprocessing plant due to local opposition, having already invested over $1 billion.  The process of reprocessing nuclear waste increases the waste two to three hundred times and the natural result from the reprocessing process is that the Sellafield authority, BNFL, want to dump this waste in a repository underground.</P>
    <P>The waste would be stored for millions of years.  My point is that we know very little about the way in which the waste will behave in years to come.  The only evidence available comes from places such as Fosmark in Sweden where a so-called repository was put in place.  Problems have been experienced there with gases being released from the repository. A pilot project in New Mexico has shown that roofs of some of the caverns have collapsed.  What I would say to Deputy Dukes is that rather than just accepting that reprocessing must take place and rather than rejecting storage of waste over ground &mdash; which is proven to be relatively safe at least and where it is possible to monitor waste on a regular basis &mdash; it is legitimate for the Irish people and the Irish Government to say no to the expansion of Sellafield and to say no to an overconcentration of the nuclear industry in one location.</P>
    <P>During Deputy Dukes' contribution he kept going back to speak of the global nature of this debate.  I recently attended a parliamentary forum in Washington on the new world order at which I asked whether it was not in order for a country such as Ireland, which is non-nuclear, to object to this ludicrous concentration of the nuclear industry, not just in Sellafield but along the west coast of the United Kingdom.  I asked whether there should not be some framework in place, either <Col N="1721" /> on a European level or on a global level, to which Ireland could go to say that the problem needed to be resolved, that we needed assistance from other countries, that we needed assistance from some kind of international forum to help us in our objection.</P>
    <P>After all, the Dáil some years ago, on an all-party basis, said no to Sellafield.  I accept that it would be naïve to simply say: &ldquo;We must close down Sellafield&rdquo;. There are thousands of people working at Sellafield.  I have been there and I have met many of the workers.  However, it would be correct for us to say &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; to the ludicrous expansion of that plant. That would be a legitimate course.  Perhaps Deputy Dukes was trying to introduce some crazy air of reality &mdash; there is no doubt that what he had to say was quite sensational.  It would be quite legitimate for Ireland to adopt that approach and to continue with it.  After all, the waste is coming from Japan and Germany. Why could the Japanese at least not look after their own waste, and should there not be some international agency to ensure that they do?  Deputy Dukes also said that waste from some of our hospitals goes to that general area. He was right in that; as I understand it, such waste arrives at Drigg, not so far away from Sellafield.  I understand also that the waste is stored there.  To introduce that argument is rather to go off course and will do no good for the general all-party agreement we have in the House on the developments at Sellafield.  I shall leave the matter there for the moment and come back to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I consider the Bill to have the potential of being strong and effective at local, national and, indeed, EC level.  The Bill calls for effective co-operation at local level.  It requires the collaboration of the Environmental Protection Agency and local authorities concerning environmental questions.  Even further, the legislation allows for public hearings if the public so desire, in relation to a particular project.</P>
    <P>The strongest challenge facing the new Environmental Protection Agency will be to narrow and indeed eliminate the <Col N="1722" /> gulf between industrialists and environmentalists. The divide is most evident in the Cork region.  The debate in Cork, I believe, merely mirrors the feelings that prevail throughout the country.  My hopes are that the Environmental Protection Agency will create the conditions in this country in which business and technology are not seen as the enemies of the environment.  Rather, I hope that a convergence of interest from both sides will be seen.  The resources of business and industry must be followed into pollution control and into producing goods that are compatable with our environment. The agency must pursue a course that will make environmental protection profitable for multinational corporations.</P>
    <P>The business community has a historic opportunity worldwide to demonstrate its commitment to new means of producing goods and creating wealth while at the same time ensuring that future generations will enjoy the riches of this planet.  Such an approach is also in the interest of the worker and those currently seeking jobs.  It is now evident that where serious damage has been done to the environment by companies in parts of eastern and central Europe some of those companies have been forced out of business as they were not in a position to provide the capital investment needed for the new equipment necessary to clean up their operations.  The worker loses heavily in such circumstances.  We have a clear advantage in that we can learn from some of these unfortunate mistakes. We can now step into the role of leader internationally by achieving the dual objective of a protected environment and an expanding labour force.</P>
    <P>The new agency can be assured that they will have the full support of the educational system in their work.  The process of awareness has already begun in our schools.  Tribute must be paid to the thousands of teachers who are utilising to its full potential the excellent environmentally orientated curriculum in our schools.  Our young population of schoolgoing children have responded <Col N="1723" /> warmly and enthusiastically to the inspirational work of those involved in our educational programme.  It is only proper that during this historic debate we salute our teaching professions and acknowledge the invaluable contribution they have made to changing in a most positive way the attitude of Irish society towards its natural environment.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to note in the details of the new <i>Programme for Government, 1989-93</i> that the environment was given special priority and that there was a commitment to the implementation of the ten year environmental action programme. After careful consideration of the programme, it is obvious that the environmental aspect runs through many Departments, and I shall refer to that later.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Department of Transport and commitments made in that regard, the <i>Programme for Government</i> deals with Dublin transportation problems. This is a Green agenda, because it concerns our health.  I am pleased that plans are now clearly in place for the introduction of a light rail system and that there will be environmental controls on the development of the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture the programme recognises the fundamental importance of preserving and improving the rural environment.  I am pleased that the Government will increase the number of areas designated as environmentally sensitive on the basis of results obtained from two pilot areas already so designated and that the Government will continue their actions to help farmers to prevent any pollution arising from farming activities.</P>
    <P>Within the Department of the Environment in the Custom House I recognise, as I have said before, a clear need to separate the functions dealing with the Green environment from those relating to issues such as local government grants, road construction, lending institutions and so on &mdash; what might be described as more concrete or administrative functions. The Green environment relates to <Col N="1724" /> the protection and preservation of our rivers, lakes, landscape and air &mdash; matters referred to in the ten year programme &mdash; but this agenda means much more.  Its horizons are broader than that.  The Green environment is about the quality of drinking water, public health, marine resources, control in the development of the agricultural sector, a clean and efficient transport system, the &ldquo;greenhouse&rdquo; effect, the ozone layer, CFCs, the threat of the nuclear industry, the process of irradiation of food and the labelling of food.</P>
    <P>What concerns me is that our Department of the Environment are still looked upon as a Government Department who are focusing too narrowly.  The Department could unload much of their baggage in relation to local government, housing, road construction and lending institutions. All of those technical and administrative functions should be shifted elsewhere and the Department of the Environment should concentrate on the Green agenda.  The Department should be allowed to expand into other areas of Government activity.  In reality they are about the environment and health, and these two issues permeate all Government Departments and they must be encouraged to do so by separating the Green and health agenda from their other more administrative functions.  It will become evident that a different, more innovative attitude will emerge in relation to how this Department carry out their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In relation to the light rail system, since the seventies a light rail system in various forms has been taken up by many local authorities and transport authorities throughout Europe and the United States.  I, like other councillors and public representatives here, have attended many seminars and conferences over the years on transportation particularly in respect of Dublin and surrounding areas. It would appear that we are now coming down in favour of some kind of a light rail vehicle system, some of which can even climb hills and go around corners. This is something we must warmly welcome and applaud.  We must urge on <Col N="1725" /> the Minister to ensure that these new measures are put in place as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We all experience transport difficulties coming to and leaving this House when traffic in the city centre sometimes simply grinds to a halt.  Such a light rail proposal would involve restricting car movement in the city and more pedestrianisation, which is proceeding steadily and is something I warmly welcome.  The fact that we are now focussing on a particular model of light rail tram car, interacting with buses and linked into the rail system, is a very good thing.  We are inclined to knock Dublin city.  I am convinced that this city has become more vibrant and progressive in recent times, first for its citizens and, second, growing in stature as a tourist attraction.  We need only look at what is happening in the Temple Bar area as one example of how, through picking a particular historic part of Dublin, through pedestrianisation and other incentives, one can change the shape of the city overnight by bringing out the best of its past and making it accessible to its citizens.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the proposed light rail system will complement these works and alleviate the chronic traffic congestion obtaining in our city.  I welcome the fact that this light rail system would appear to be now a possibility &mdash; and hopefully a probability &mdash; especially as part of the land needed is in my constituency, that is the Harcourt Street railway line and the line from Tallaght, which must be proceeded with also.</P>
    <P>The success of the DART has proved that, once a transport system is put in place that is comfortable, safe and clean and offered to motorists as an option for entering and leaving the city, they will use it.  Obviously motorists have not taken to the bus system, though Bus Átha Cliath do their best.  To be fair to them, their best is not good enough bearing in mind the present state of traffic congestion on our roads.  If a reliable, frequent service is provided motorists will gladly avail of it and leave their cars in their driveways. I look forward to the reopening of the Harcourt Street railway line and to the <Col N="1726" /> establishment of a rail line to Tallaght in the very near future.</P>
    <P>That takes me to the question of the roads debate in Dublin.  An environmental impast assessment has been undertaken on the part of the Ring Road which covers the Southern Cross route. I recently attended a public inquiry in relation to the Southern Cross route.  It must be acknowledged that the provisions of this Bill allow for such public hearings, which are to be warmly welcomed. Having participated in that public inquiry I fully appreciate the absolute necessity of introducing such a measure. In the course of that inquiry all interested parties &mdash; householders, local councillors, planning consultants, experts &mdash; were given an opportunity to put their case and have a fair hearing.  What emerges from this debate on transport and roads is that there must be a balance struck between the rapid rail system and motorways since there is a need for both. I have always supported the concept of a ring road around Dublin.  After all, it is a Euro-route from Belfast, coming round north County Dublin, joining the Bray Road in the south, continuing to Rosslare and, ultimately, Le Havre.</P>
    <P>Great progress has been made in relation to these motorways in that the western section is now operational and at this very moment the Shankill by-pass is being opened.  Indeed, I would be present had I not chosen to speak in this debate. The remaining portions, the Northern Cross and Southern Cross, have yet to be completed.</P>
    <P>I might make one strong appeal to the Minister of State present in regard to the existing line of the Southern Cross route which goes from Firhouse Road, across Ballinteer, as a motorway &mdash; I want to explain this before making my appeal &mdash; and arrives in the Sandyford area, where it funnels and narrows down in the form of a dual carriageway.  Worse still, it then joins the existing Leopardstown Road and Brewery Road.  If that plan goes ahead in its present form it would be disastrous in that we would be sending motorists along a high speed motorway, <Col N="1727" /> then sending them blindly into a <i>cul-de-sac</i> at Leopardstown Road, even if that road is improved.  I am convinced that that road will be unable to withstand the volume of traffic when there will be a back-up of cars and trucks to Stillorgan, Sandyford, Dundrum and Ballinteer.</P>
    <P>There is a solution which I might advance to the Minister, that is, that the South-Eastern motorway planned for construction must be constructed in conjunction with the Southern Cross route. That South-Eastern motorway intersects and joins the Southern Cross route at Sandyford.  If that arm is put in place it will relieve the Leopardstown Road area of traffic chaos, directing the traffic along the South-Eastern motorway to join the Bray Road at Loughlinstown.  This is not merely a local but national, indeed European, issue because of the nature of the road and is related to this debate in that it has major environmental and health implications.</P>
    <P>We have been awaiting this Bill a long time.  Many political parties, including the Fine Gael Party, have advocated the establishment of this proposed agency.  I believe Deputy Dukes referred to Deputy Shatter's Bill claiming that they were the first to propose it.  I should like to place on record that, before any party proposed the establishment of such an agency, I, as chairman of Ógra Fianna Fáil, put forward a policy document to my party that an environmental protection agency be established, which document was subsequently accepted by my party.  There is a commitment in the new Programme for Government that this legislation will be introduced as quickly as possible.  Let us proceed without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1991, has been long awaited and is welcomed by the Labour Party as one of the most significant Bills relating to the environment to come before this House.  However, we have deep misgivings about implementing such a complex Bill if the resources needed to do so are not forthcoming. This Bill would appear to be nothing <Col N="1728" /> more than wishful thinking on the part of the Minister of State in that she has not shown specifically from where the money is to emanate to allow its provisions be fully implemented.  The Minister is more than aware that there is no money on the ground with which to implement its provisions.  Therefore, I maintain it is merely another piece of aspirational legislation that will not see the light of day in any real sense.  This Government appear to adopt a two-fold approach to the introduction of new legislation. Indeed, it could be argued that the Minister of State has not done her homework. I should like her to outline in detail to his House where and from whence the money will be provided to allow the provisions of this Bill to be implemented and the important work carried out.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party are concerned that the proposed agency be properly funded. We believe that dependence on an annual grant, provided for in section 45, will diminish the effectiveness and independence of the agency, particularly in their longer-term planning and operations. We are all aware that starving an agency of funds has been used by this Government previously to disempower an agency whose activities they have grown to dislike.  A recent example of that negative policy on the part of a previous Government was the office of the Ombudsman.  It is noteworthy that in the current Book of Estimates a nominal sum of £1 million has been allocated to represent the agency's total resources for 1991.  The Labour Party will be seeking the Minister's commitment that there will be no arbitrary ceiling on the agency's capacity to do their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of previous speakers referred to the global nature of the environmental problem with which we are dealing. My party spokesman will deal with that aspect.  I want to concentrate on what we can do, on what I perceive as my role as a Labour Party public representative from Kildare with a special interest in Mayo.  The main polluters in the constituency I represent are the local authorities.  The reason is that <Col N="1729" /> resources have not been provided to the local authorities to put in place treatment works for human waste.</P>
    <P>Will this Bill ensure that money is provided so that the authorities can carry out work to ensure that pollution is reduced or eliminated or will the new agency simply prosecute the local authorities who have been starved of resources necessary to do these works?</P>
    <P>Will the Bill deal with situations like the one which occurred in Naas &mdash; and which is ongoing &mdash; when a well supply of water to the town was polluted?  The reason given was that there was a scarce supply of treated water available in the region.  If we are to believe Dublin Corporation's publicity officer, Noel Carroll, we must be living in a desert, not a very wet island.  Every time we have a week or two of fine weather we are told there is an emergency and that water supplies are scarce.  There is plenty of water available and we must treat enough of it to make it suitable for human consumption. It is not satisfactory to tap into sources like that in Naas.  The switch in Naas was made not because there was not an ample supply of suitable water available but in order to save pennies because the local authority were starved of resources.  It was a bad decision, a dangerous decision and nearly a deadly decision.  The monitoring of that supply before the incident was entirely inadequate. Five metres from that water supply runs a main sewer.  The sewer became blocked and overflowed into a well which was being used to service 1,500 houses in Naas.  As a result 3,000 men, women and children were seriously ill at the one time.  It was days after contamination occurred before any action was taken.  There was not in place a monitoring system which would warn immediately of the occurrence of contamination.</P>
    <P>The fears of people in that town and elsewhere where similar types of supply are provided must be allayed by the Minister and the Department.  I have written to the Minister for the Environment asking for a public inquiry.  My letter stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1730" /> I would urge that you now establish a Public Inquiry to establish why such a dangerous supply was used in the first instance and to further establish why the monitoring system for such water supplies failed to prevent this serious health hazard.  This inquiry should also examine where other such high risk supplies exist and put in place procedures for dealing with such contaminations in the future.</P>
    <P>Will this Bill deal with matters like the continuing scandal in Robertstown village, which has been on a waiting list for 25 years for a simple sewage treatment plant?  Because of the canal and other facilities there, Robertstown has been designated by Kildare County Council as a top tourism area in County Kildare. The sewage from the houses, the pub and the hotel goes straight into the canal, untreated.  That has been the way since Robertstown was built.  It is scandalous that Robertstown has been waiting 25 years for a treatment plant to prevent this pollution.  Will the agency to able to do anything about that type of problem or will they simply prosecute the Minister who has not provided resources?  Will the county manager be dragged before the courts for not providing the required facility?</P>
    <P>Will the Bill remedy the problem in Kilcullen?  The Minister of State knows Kilcullen particularly well.  Just before the local elections she visited Kilcullen to examine the sewerage works.  She issued a letter to her party colleague in that town stating that a sewage treatment works would be put in place forthwith.  That letter was issued to every house in the town.  The senior Minister knew nothing about it.</P>

      <P>The letter was issued in the Minister's name with a covering letter from her colleague.  The effect of that deceiving of the people of Kilcullen <Col N="1731" /> resulted in a decent Fianna Fáil councillor, Paddy Aspell, losing his seat and being replaced by a colleague of the Minister. That sort of strokism from the squeaky clean Progressive Democrats is something the public should know about. They are no more squeaky clean than any of the rest of us.</P>

      <P>Every house in Kilcullen has the letter.  I have it in my file but it is not with me.  If the Minister of State wants to see the letter, I will show it to her.  That letter did not advance the cause of pollution prevention in Kilcullen by one iota.  The sewage from that town goes into a hole in the ground right beside the Liffey.  The old tanks which used to be there are gone; they used to overflow into the Liffey.  Now the sewage goes straight into the Liffey.  All the people in north county Dublin and north Dublin city, including the Taoiseach, get a supply of water which is first dealt with at Kilcullen. The Taoiseach is getting that recycled supply in his own home.  All the other citizens in north Kildare, in north county Dublin and north Dublin city are getting a supply from the Liffey which is seriously polluted by raw sewage from Kilcullen. This is despite the promises made by the Minister of State before the local elections in June.  The Minister for the Environment has told us that the matter is under consideration, just as it was ten years ago.  There has been no advance. The Minister of State should withdraw her letter, apologise to the people of Kilcullen for giving false information and apologise to Paddy Aspell for depriving him of his seat by her actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Bill empower the Minister or this House or the agency to deal with the unlicensed dump at Hillsborough in Athgarvan?  The Minister was contacted directly in this regard.  She did not say she would do anything about it; she just ignored it.  A Belgian national, Peter Kup, bought a small farm there in 1978 to raise goats.  They are dead now from pollution.  A local entrepreneur decided <Col N="1732" /> to turn nearby quarries into a dump and illegal dumping has been going on ever since.  I visited the area last Monday morning.  Deputy Dukes was speculating earlier on what constituted a smell.  If he went to Athgarvan, which is close to where he lives, he would have no doubt about what a smell is.  One would need a gasmask to approach Mr. Kup's house, which is surrounded by a mountainous dump of all sorts or rubbish.  The dump is unlicensed, unregulated and of course commercial.  There is a heavy volume of traffic at night to that dump.  I wonder why people go to the dump at night.  Why do they not go there during the day?  I am convinced the reason they visit the dump by night is that they are dumping materials which would not be permitted legally.</P>
    <P>The local authority members and their management stand condemned in this case.  They took a half hearted prosecution against this illegal dump but they did not call key witnesses.  The county manager who briefed the solicitor or the solicitor who took the action on behalf of the council or both should be sacked for dereliction of duty.  That is a very strong thing to say in this House but I am sure that anybody who has visited this mountainous dump, which contains fridges and the carcases of animals and where papers are strewn for at least half a mile all over the place, would agree with my sentiments &mdash; that there has been a serious dereliction of duty by somebody.</P>
    <P>The Minister was notified about this issue two years ago when her new &ldquo;Green&rdquo; image was presented to the public.  Will the Minister with the help of this agency do more than she did before, which amounted to nothing, in regard to this dump?  The house owned by this old man and his wife is now surrounded by this mountain of rubbish, rats have invaded his house, his water supply has been polluted and his goats have died. Seemingly the authorities can do nothing about the problem.  I want to know if the new agency will be able to do anything on behalf of Mr. Kup.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1733" /> I want to raise one other specific case. As I said at the beginning of my contribution, I have a special interest in County Mayo.  I want to know if the agency will be able to help resolve a problem there which I want to outline. Will they be able to act as the Minister obviously has not been capable of acting? The beautiful River Robe meanders slowly through the plains of south Mayo. This river was an excellent brown trout fishery.  Kingfishers were seen aplenty there, tranquility was to be found there. I often found tranquility there myself. That river rises at a place known as Beacon Springs and passes through Claremorris, Ballindine, Hollymount and through my own beloved Cloomcormack and Robeen, on to Ballinrobe and eventually into Lough Mask. Because of gross neglect of the people of the area by the Minister for the Environment &mdash; he is the local Deputy for some of these areas &mdash; that river has been grossly polluted.  The source of that pollution is mainly sewage, although I have seen some evidence of agricultural pollution also.  In Claremorris untreated sewage overflows from a settlement tank into the river; at Ballindine there is a direct pipe from the town's untreated sewage system into the river; at Hollymount, my home village, there is no tank and the sewage goes straight into the river and at Ballinrobe, which is very close to Lough Mask and which is very definitely in the Minister's constituency, untreated sewage flows into the river. Plans are not at an advanced stage for treatment works in any of these towns.</P>
    <P>The river has deteriorated over a period of five years.  I have raised this issue with the local authority and with the Minister on a number of occasions. In August of this year that once beautiful river was covered with a green fluorescent scum from one bank to the other from Ballindine to Ballinrobe, a distance of about 15 miles as the river flows.  The stench from this rotten material which had piled up on the side of the river was unbelievable.  It was impossible to fish in the river and there were no kingfishers to be seen there.  That <Col N="1734" /> cesspool, open sewer, in south Mayo runs straight into Lough Mask, which, without doubt, is the best brown trout fishery in Europe.  We are doing to Lough Mask what the pig farmers in Counties Monaghan and Cavan did to Lough Sheelin.</P>
    <P>Lough Mask is also the only source of drinking water for south Mayo.  The new schemes which have been planned for Claremorris, Ballinrobe and other areas of south Mayo will be piped directly from Lough Mask.  I raised the issue of the pollution level in Lough Mask with the council and asked whether the water was suitable for human consumption.  I was told that they had tested it and all was in order.  However, I was told the same thing about the drinking water in Naas three weeks ago, that tests had shown that the water was all right.  However, with 3,000 people sick in Naas, some very sick and one very seriously ill, we now know that the water was not all right in Naas.  I am not trying to scare people about the quality of the water in Lough Mask but I want to impress on the Minister the importance of ensuring that the agency will have powers not alone to say what is wrong but powers to put in place the resources required to put right what is wrong.  Without that this Bill will amount to nothing and will be simply window dressing.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, who has a particular interest in this issue, to take action now to save the River Robe.  I do not believe it has gone beyond the point of being saved.  I ask him to take action to save it and to ensure that Lough Mask is not turned into another Lough Sheelin.  The question I want to ask is: will the Minister be able to provide resources for the agency under this Bill?  I have serious doubts about that.  There is a real possibility that under the strictures of the Bill the Minister and the agency could be nobbled.  If the Minister does not provide resources to prevent pollution at local level, will the agency be able to prosecute the Minister, as the person responsible, for not providing the anti-pollution measures required or will they continue to drag county managers before the courts for not doing something which they were <Col N="1735" /> not given the resources to do in the first place?</P>
    <P>Those are the key points I want to make.  While we have many small problems, the main polluters are the local authorities who do not have the resources to correct and deal with human waste. Even though there are good treatment works in County Kildare, anyone who drives south on the Naas bypass &mdash; my colleague referred to this &mdash; would need to put on a gas mask for half a mile because of the overpowering stench from the modern sewage treatment works. Even though there are modern treatment works in Leixlip the constant stench there is also overpowering.  What is the reason for this?</P>
    <P>There is a particular problem with agriculture in my constituency where cereal farmers use high levels of phosphates. They have succeeded in polluting the ground water in south Kildare.  Scientists have calculated that if they stop using phosphates now it will take 150 years for that water to become fit for human consumption again.  The artesian wells which were used previously to supply water to small villages have been closed down and water has had to be piped, at a very high cost, to the villages from the main supplies.  The new system of making silage in plastic bags, which is used a lot in the West, creates fewer problems, and the number of unscrupulous farmers causing pollution is smaller.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are pleased to note that the Government have decided to follow the procedure originally drawn up by Deputy Dick Spring in 1983, in the context of his proposed reform of An Bord Pleanála, for the appointment of a director general and other directors of the Environmental Protection Agency. This approach is to be welcomed.  It should be pointed out that the Government were asked to follow a similar procedure in relation to the RTE Authority and the IRTC in the recent debate on the Broadcasting Bill but refused to do so.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believe that the &ldquo;Green&rdquo; debate to date has dealt solely with the waste and disposal end of the <Col N="1736" /> environmental issue.  We would like to see the Environmental Protection Agency placing as much emphasis on the production of socially responsible consumer products.  If the environmental issue is to be fully tackled, the agency must deal with the daily use of goods. This will include the establishment of recycling depots at all supermarkets for bottles, tins &mdash; can banks &mdash; plastic bags and paper.  We would like to see friendly technology used at all public purchasing outlets, for example, recycling or unbleached paper, and that public transport vehicles would use unleaded petrol or car gas.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Labour Party published their own environmental policy, which represents a major development of the Labour Party's approach to environmental issues.  It reflects the growing concern of many people about the state of our environment and the impact that this generation of humans is having on its condition.  I would recommend that document to the Minister if she has not already had an opportunity to see it.  At the outset, in our policy paper we stated that all things are connected. There is an established and inseparable link between the socialist concerns and the values and absolute necessity to conserve and manage our global environment. With this in mind the Labour Party will be tabling a series of constructive amendments to give this agency the independence and strength they require to carry out their task as thoroughly as possible.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to emphasise to the Minister that this Bill will end up as another piece of window dressing unless she can find the resources required to put its proposals in place &mdash; that means a lot of money.  A green, clean environment comes most expensively but we must be prepared to provide that money as otherwise our environment cannot be controlled in such a way that it will continue to be suitable for human habitation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us today has been welcomed as a major advance in environmental legislation.  It <Col N="1737" /> has also been welcomed by diverse groups from An Taisce and Earthwatch to the Confederation of Irish Industry.  It is a detailed and thorough Bill and in a standard way also outlines the Government's aspirations to a clean environment. This commitment was most obviously made during our Presidency of the EC during which the first major declaration on the environment was issued by EC Heads of Government and as an extension of this I understand a charter on the environment will be included in the amended Treaty of Rome.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment in this whole area was seen last year when the Government published their environment action programme, the first such programme by a Government in the important area of the environment.  The Bill before us today is issued against this background and it is further evidence of the Government's initiative in these so-called green issues.  For many years these issues were seen by people to be less important than the other issues which were before them.  To some extent perhaps they were on the political back-burner or were on the second or third tier of public concern.  I am glad to see this is changed and that there is grave concern and an interest in our environment. With this change in attitude the Bill before us today underlines how important it is that we have a positive interest in the protection of the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Environmental destruction is not limited by geography; as such it can be dealt with only through comprehensive and far-reaching structures, structures that are not <i>ad hoc</i> or confined to the privacy of national policy.  The Chernobyl disaster reminded us that we live in a global village, hence the importance of Ireland's green Presidency and the Government's initiative in sponsoring the East-West meeting.  Hence also the spuriousness of the argument that the mess at Sellafield is an internal British difficulty.  The consistent call by the Government for the closure of Sellafield is becoming more important, particularly since Sellafield <Col N="1738" /> has been designed as a plant for reprocessing purposes.  Not only is our own vital national interest at stake here but also the interests of the broader economic community of which we are all a part.</P>
    <P>I hope the functions of the proposed agency, as outlined in Part III, will be directed with this in mind.  I hope the proposed liaison with the European Environmental Agency as stated in section 51 (1) (e) is not just an aspiration and that it will be able to cover our important concerns in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes also a radical overhaul of existing legislation at national level.  Its brief is very wide, covering all areas of environmental interest as detailed in Part III.  Part IV deals with wide-ranging powers which will be conferred on the agency, not least in the area of licensing and prosecution.  It will also be an independent agency with its own budget, as provided for in Part I, and will bring together what has been up to now the diverse management in the whole area of environment monitoring, control and planning.  This area has been dealt with for many years by many groups and agencies.  It is important that the agency being set up would have an overall view on this important area.</P>
    <P>It is also a timely Bill.  In Ireland we have been blessed with a relatively clean environment.  Even without stringent legislation we have been able to hold on to a clean environment but it has come to the time when it is more important that we should protect our environment. In the nature of things an expanding as well as an increasing industrialised society will challenge this inheritance we have of a clean environment.  Sandoz, Merrell Dow and the smog problem in Dublin last winter serve to remind us of the seriousness of these issues.  In each case action was taken but they highlighted how fragile our natural environment is.  In this context the Government introduced pioneering initiatives, such as the Air Pollution Bill, 1987, and the Water Pollution Bill, 1990.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House marks a further development in the whole area of national policy.  It brings under one <Col N="1739" /> authority a whole range of functions which up to now had been dealt with by a number of various agencies, local authorities and various groups.  While the Bill could be seen as an anti-devolutionary measure, it makes sense to concentrate these powers of environmental control at national level because, as we are all aware, protection of the environment knows no boundaries and neither does destruction of the environment know boundaries.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the centralisation implicit in the new structures will be balanced by the establishment of regional environmental units, as stated in section 42.  Under the provisions of section 55 local authorities will continue to be involved.  This is essential because local authorities play a very important part in monitoring and controlling the environment and it is important that they should continue this work.  The consultative aspects of the Bill are welcome, but just as important is consultation with the public at large.  Prior to the drafting of the Bill various aspects were discussed, consideration was given to the views of the public and public seminars were held. Under the Environmental Protection Agency I hope the views of the public will continue to be sought and listened to.</P>
    <P>I welcome this open door policy on information, including the availability of environmental monitoring results, registers of research and so on, as outlined in section 64.  Local environment information offices have a very important function to perform in this area.  I welcome the Bill's brief under section 75 to establish a labelling scheme on environmentally friendly products and services. This is particularly important as regards the export of products.  This country has, and still is perceived to have in terms of clean food, a relativley clean environment. I hope the general thrust of this section will be incorporated within the broader brief of our marketing agencies abroad through, for example, the publication of some type of recognised logo which would complement the quality <Col N="1740" /> control logo already used by the Irish Quality Association.  The clean environment and the good food associated with Irish products is important in the export of food and it is also critical to us in the area of tourism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 38 and 51 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services &mdash; Needs and Abilities details the number of day and residential places required to meet the needs of the mental handicap population. The Government have accepted the <Col N="1741" /> recommendations of that report and are committed to their implementation.</P>
    <P>The statistical information provided to my Department for 31 December 1990 indicates that the level of mental handicap services has increased by 17 per cent since the beginning of 1986.  There are now over 11,500 people receiving services on a residential or day basis compared to 9,800 people on 31 December 1985.</P>
    <P>In 1990 the Government provided a special allocation of £2 million for the development of mental handicap services. This enabled 149 residential places, 21 respite places catering for 200 people, 442 day places and 25 staff for other supports to be provided.  Of this 91 residential and 184 day places were provided in the Eastern Health Board area.  This year a further £1 million was provided to build on those developments.  I have again ensured that the bulk of this money will benefit people in the Eastern Health Board region.  The commissioning of places in Aras Attracta in County Mayo will free up 12 places in centres in the Eastern Health Board area.  Twenty places will be commissioned in Cheeverstown House.  In addition a sum of £230,000 has been provided for extra respite care in the eastern region.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the Government's commitment to the development of the mental handicap services.  I have asked each health board to prepare a seven year plan for the development of mental handicap services.  These plans will quantify the extent of unmet needs in each health board area.  The provision of sufficient day care residential places for people with mental handicap is one of the priorities to be addressed in these plans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not stick to the question and as a result he used up much of our time.  If the Minister accepted and committed himself to this plan will he explain why in years one and two of this plan for which a projected requirement of £28 million was indicated he has spent only £3 million, barely one tenth of what was required?  Will the <Col N="1742" /> Minister agree that the provision of 47 residential places in 1991 as against their target of 190 is a very poor measure of commitment?  Will he agree that that 47 means that it will take 20 years to deal with the 900 people now waiting for residential care for mentally handicapped people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy.  In reply to the Deputy's statement that I did not deal specifically with his question, I would point out that I said I was taking three questions together.</P>
      <P>On the implementation of the recommendations of the report, &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo;, they will be implemented as resources allow.  We provided £2 million extra in 1990.  That was repeated in 1991 and a further £1 million was provided. Since I became Minister the level of funding for those with a mental handicap has been protected.  There was an increase of 40 per cent in the allocation between 1986 and 1991, which is well ahead of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that there is a crisis in the provision for mental handicap and that talk of protecting funding is beside the point. There was a need for £28 million and £3 million was provided.  That is a fact.  Does the Minister realise that an all-party committee of the House are seeking a serious commitment to spending in 1992?</P>

We have addressed that to some extent in the last two years and we will continue to do so as resources allow.  The reviewed Programme for Government announced last week states specifically that within the scope of community based services it will be necessary to provide improved day care facilities for the elderly, for <Col N="1743" /> psychiatric patients and for those with a mental handicap and to expand the home support services.

      <P>In introducing the relevant legislation to the Oireachtas in May, I explained that the new eligibility arrangements would be introduced on a phased basis.  The first two stages of the process were implemented in June, when the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991 came into effect.  First, the income limit for category 2 services were removed, so that all those who wish to avail of public consultant care may now do so.  Secondly, all public hospitals were instructed to ensure that the clear identification of the status of every patient, as either the public or private patient of the consultant, was carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third stage of the process involves the designation of public and private beds and the implementation of the requirement that, except in emergency cases, private patients must be accommodated in designated private beds and public patients in designated public beds.  The information on the public or private status of each patient, which is being collected in public hospitals since June, provides a basis for the designation of beds in line with the pattern of usage of the hospital concerned.  My Department are working with the health boards and voluntary hospitals on the assessment of their bed designation proposals in the <Col N="1744" /> light of the usage data.  This work is nearing completion and will be followed by the formal approval of bed designations for each hospital, as required under the Health Services (In-Patient) Regulations, 1991.  My Department will be involved in the continuous monitoring of the operation of the new system.  I am satisfied that this will ensure that the objective of improving equity of access of public patients will be achieved.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister put in extra money to match the widely reported switch from private to public care?  Is the Minister aware that several hospitals, for example, the Mater, are now closing down wards which will make access for public patients considerably more difficult in the remaining quarter of the year, even though there are now 15,000 people waiting for elective surgery in Dublin?</P>

      <P>I do not have any evidence that there has been an increase in the number of public patients going into the hospitals and that evidence would not be there for the very good reason that before 1 June it was not possible for hospitals to identify the category of patient in a public bed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 8, 37 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the undertakings I have given in relation to health services in 1991, the non-capital allocations of health boards will be adjusted to take account of approved increases in expenditure, including pay, increases in the rates of allowances and certain services-related items.</P>
      <P>Health boards are now generally aware of the order of these adjustments. Despite this it is not possible at this stage to project what overrun, if any, may occur in the Health Estimate in 1991. The budgetary position under each board tends to vary from time to time throughout the year.  The information available to my Department indicates that a number of boards are having to take corrective action in order to ensure that their overall expenditure will not exceed their revised allocations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, all agencies were notified in their letter of allocation for 1991 that expenditure must be contained within the limits of the allocation, as revised from time to time throughout the year.  Any expenditure excess arising in 1991 will be a charge against the 1992 allocation.  This position <Col N="1746" /> has been reinforced in meetings with the agencies throughout the year and I have again drawn specific attention to the difficulties which will arise for any agency carrying a deficit into next year.  Indeed, I have met with the chief executive officers of health boards earlier today to emphasise the vital importance of achieving agreed service targets within the budgetary limits.</P>
    <P>The cash which is transferred to health boards on an ongoing basis is tailored, with the agreed level of bank overdraft, to match the approved level of non-capital expenditure.  This level of expenditure is geared to enable boards to deliver the approved 1990 level of service in 1991.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to confirm that the Minister made this commitment in the House on 26 February. Would the Minister not agree, having made that commitment, that in the discussions that are now taking place to which he has referred he has changed that commitment &mdash; he misled the House to believe a commitment was given &mdash; and that the health boards are not able to meet their ongoing commitments?  As these schemes are outside their control, I would ask the Minister to live up to the commitment he gave.  All the information available to me suggests that he is not living up to it and is now talking about paying half these costs.  All I am asking him to do is to stick to the commitment that he gave in the House and to the health boards.  Would he agree that that is what he said and that is not what he is doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not agree. We are dealing with two areas, first, the service area.  Sufficient funding was provided to ensure that the level of service delivered in 1991 would be maintained at 1990 levels.  With regard to the question of open-ended schemes, the drug refund scheme in particular always causes a problem.  Indeed, I told the House before the summer recess that it was projected there would be a £22 million overrun which we will certainly look at.  What we did for the health boards with regard <Col N="1747" /> to the drug refund scheme was that we introduced a revised scheme which will have benefits for the health boards.  We also took a number of measures to reduce the cost of drugs in the current year.  It is unreasonable therefore to suggest that we have been unfair to the health boards in that regard because we have put in place mechanisms to reduce the cost of drugs.  As I have often said in the House before, no patient should be denied the drugs or medicine they need for their particular illness.  I think everyone in the House would accept that both in terms of the volume of drugs and brand of drugs prescribed there are opportunities to save.  For example, less expensive drugs which would be equally as efficient and effective could be prescribed instead of the more expensive drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the DPMA scheme?  These are statutory entitlements. The health boards have no control over them.  The Minister promised that he would fund them but now he is telling them that he will not.  This is contained in the minutes from health boards all over the country.  If they cannot meet their requirments under statutory schemes they have been let down by the Minister. All I can say is that every health board in the country feels that they have been let down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 5, 39, 65 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>The drugs refund scheme, which provides for a refund of any expenditure on prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of a specified amount over a prescribed period, was amended with effect from 1 August 1991.  Under the amended scheme the prescribed periods for expenditure are the quarterly periods commencing 1 January, 1 April, 1 July or 1 October each year.  A refund will be made in respect of any expenditure in excess of £90 over the course of any of these periods.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise to Deputies that the drugs refund scheme is one of a range of drug schemes which benefit the population as a whole.  In addition to this scheme, other drug schemes, designed to meet specific needs, are in operation as follows.</P>
      <P>The continued operation of the drug cost subsidisation scheme, which I introduced last year, ensures that persons who are certified as having a long term medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for drugs and medicines in excess of £32 per month are not required to pay more than £32 in any month for their drugs and medicines.  They pay that amount to the pharmacist who claims the balance from the GMS (Payments) Board.</P>
      <P>Under the medical card scheme any person who is deemed by the chief executive officer of a health board to be eligible for a medical card continues to receive all drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances without charge as heretofore. Over 1.2 million people, almost 35 per cent of the population, are covered in this way.</P>
      <P>Under the long term illness scheme persons suffering from a specified long term medical illness obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of their condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that the changes were only introduced to the drugs refund scheme in August 1991 and, accordingly, it is too early as yet to judge their full <Col N="1750" /> impact.  I will, of course, be closely monitoring the operations of all drug schemes to ensure that particular hardship is not caused to any individual or family.  In this regard I would stress that the chief executive officer of a health board is empowered to grant a medical card on grounds of hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this change has led effectively to a deepening of the poverty trap? How can he expect a single person on £80 or £90 a week or a married couple on £115 a week, to bear the cost of drugs, up to £180, during a bout of illness in addition to the cost of their visits to the doctor?  Is it not a reality that these people will not seek medical care and will eventually be driven back to the accident and emergency departments which are already in chaos and proving very costly for the Minister?  If the Minister is anxious to deal with the escalating drugs bill why does he not start with the £35 million being spent by the drugs companies in promoting the use of drugs, often in scandalous ways, among doctors across the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>A special allocation of £3 million was made available in the budget for 1990 for the development of dental and orthodontic services.  A further £3 million was made available as a special allocation in the 1991 budget and £1 million was specifically earmarked by my Department for orthodontic services. As a result of these special provisions an additional 2,500 children began their courses of secondary orthodontic care in 1990.  The 1991 allocation has enabled these children to continue with their treatment and has enabled a further two and a half thousand children to begin treatment this year.  Priority in orthodontic treatment is being given to children with the most serious orthodontic conditions in accordance with guidelines issued to health boards by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of orthodontic service provided by the health boards has been affected by difficulties in the recruitment of consultant orthodontists.  The Local Appointments Commission recently held a competition to fill existing vacancies with improved conditions and salary and I am confident that at least two additional <Col N="1752" /> consultant appointments will be made to health boards as a result of this competition. The recruitment of consultant orthodontists will considerably enhance the orthodontic services provided by health boards.</P>
    <P>As well as providing a major clinical commitment, it is envisaged that as soon as possible the newly appointed consultants will commence orthodontic training of dental surgeons from the health boards staff.  This training programme will enable the less severe cases to be treated by a specifically trained dentist and the health boards will, therefore, be able to deal more expeditiously and effectively with cases requiring treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply &mdash; for which I thank him &mdash; is thorough, laudable and plausible; but, unfortunately, it does not address the problem. Is the Minister aware that it will probably take about five years to clear the number of children on the list of orthodontic treatment given the present rate of progress? By that time most of them will have to be dealt with by private orthodontists although many parents of these children hold medical cards.  The orthodontic service available throughout the country does not cover the vast majority of people eligible for it; it simply is not working.  Will the Minister agree that the measures now being taken are totally inadequate to deal with the problem and will not resolve it within the next five years?  At present, due to a lack of expenditure there is merely talk about the problem but nothing is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy because real progress will be made in regard to this issue, particularly waiting lists, when the consultant orthodontists are put in place.  This has only been achieved because the Minister for Helath improved the terms and conditions to enable consultant orthodontists to be recruited.  This has been effective because of the campaign in the middle of the year by the Local Appointments <Col N="1753" /> Commission.  When the consultant orthodontists are appointed they will have an opportunity to train existing dental surgeons within the health boards to provide orthodontic care of a secondary nature so that the more severe cases can be dealt with by the consultants, which is considerable progress.  Attempts were made as far back as 1983 to recruit consultant orthodontists without success. Only one consultant orthodontist was recruited since 1983, that was in 1985.</P>

However, now that we have allocated additional resources to this part of the dental service we will make progress in an ordered and structured way.  We are talking about the allocation of £6 million over the last two years in this general area.  In conjunction with the appointment of consultant orthodontists, it will significantly improve the service, <Col N="1756" /> not just on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis but on a planned, structured basis so that nationally the waiting list can be dealt with and reduced.

      <P>As I have already pointed out, as a result of the special allocations 2,500 children began courses of secondary orthodontic treatment in 1990. The additional allocations made in 1991 enable these children to continue with the treatment as well as enabling a further 2,500 children to begin treatment this year.  That is significant progress in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Belton, the question of employing private orthodontists has been the practice in a number of health board regions.  However, it is not accepted by the professionals in health boards as a system whereby specialist orthodontic treatment ought to be provided by the health board.  That is why the recruitment of consultant orthodontists has been proceeded with.  The terms and conditions have been changed in an effort to have appointments made to all health board regions so that the health boards through their own staff, facilities and professionals provide a good level of care, <Col N="1758" /> which is the entitlement of those who seek it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>Guidelines in relation to the provision of orthodontic treatment at specialist level were issued by my Department in 1979 and updated in 1985.  These guidelines prioritise orthodontic treatment by the degree of handicap and severity of the orthodontic condition.  Health boards have been asked to review all cases presenting for orthodontic treatment in accordance with these guidelines.</P>
      <P>It is important that the guidelines have regard to advances and developments in the provisions of orthodontic treatment. They should be generally acceptable and be in accordance with internationally accepted norms.  Accordingly, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, has asked the chief dental officer of the Department of Health to undertake a further review of the guidelines in consultation with consultant orthodontists to see whether any updating of the current guidelines may be necessary.  We are currently working on the 1985 set of guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there has been a reduction in the list for orthodontic treatment as a result of people fleeing the system because they have no realistic chance of getting treatment under the present guidelines which are too restrictive?  Accepting that treatment is quite expensive would the Minister consider introducing a system of grant aid to patients who are eligible but have no realistic chance under the <Col N="1760" /> present arrangements of getting treatment? Those who remain on the list have no realistic chance of treatment and those who have some means are leaving to undergo private treatment.  Would the Minister consider introducing a system of grant aid in an effort to give some realistic hope of treatment to those on the list at present?</P>

      <P>I have already made the point that these guidelines are being reviewed arising from a decision taken by my colleague, the Minister for Health, and I am sure that such a revision will meet the points made by various contributors here today.  As regards grant aid, I do not believe that is the way to deal with the waiting lists which have built up over the years under different administrations.

      <P>I think there is agreement on all sides of the House that this is a very important service.  Would the Minister not agree that regardless of when the guidelines were laid down they are extremely restrictive?  Therefore, people bringing their children to orthodontic clinics are told that their children are outside the guidelines but that they can be treated privately for £2,000?  Most of these people are medical card holders. There must be some merit in reviewing the position to ensure that people who need treatment get it.  The Government cannot meet the demands of those who come under the existing guidelines but there are also others in need of treatment.

The Deputy can be sure that we will endeavour to provide in so far as resources permit an additional allocation of resources for the coming year. By doing that in an ordered, structured way, using personnel recruited directly to the health service, we will begin to reduce the waiting lists and hopefully they will be reduced considerably.  These waiting lists have built up over a number of years and we are now working in a structured and ordered way to deal with them.</P>

    <P>At national level the Exchequer contributes, through the allocations to the health agencies and through the activities of the health promotion unit to on-going research on the prevention and treatment of AIDS-HIV.  The Department have also made capital grants of £450,000 to the Virus Reference Laboratory, UCD, where HIV surveillance testing is carried out.  At this time we are placing an emphasis on research in relation to the primary care of persons with HIV. Towards this end, during 1991 a total of £117,000 has been made available from the Exchequer to fund research projects, in this area, being conducted by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and by the Health Research Board.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland project is based at Mercers Health Centre, Dublin 2, and is a project dealing with the <Col N="1764" /> care of HIV infected persons at primary care level.  It provides a range of services, including the prescribing of early intervention medicines and the monitoring of the person's immune system.  Formerly, these services were available only at secondary care level.  Further Exchequer funding for this project will be made available as required.  The Health Research Board project which will be carried out by a new research unit will conduct research into opportunistic infection in AIDS, with particular reference to such infection in the oral cavities, as the early manifestations of the HIV virus occur in oral cavities.  The board is providing £50,000 per annum towards this project and, subject to satisfactory review after three years, may provide a total of £250,000 towards the project.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Exchequer funded research projects listed above the following on-going reseach projects are funded from lottery sources.  A total of £30,000 has been granted to the AIDS Fund to conduct research into cases of paediatric AIDS.  This is continuing.  The Eastern Health Board Outreach project which is aimed at controlling the transmission of the HIV virus both within the intravenous drug abusing population and from this group to the wider community contains a research element.  This is designed to evaluate the effects of risk infection services on the prevalence and incidence of HIV among this group. Since 1988 lottery funding of £300,000 has been provided for the project, which is centred on the AIDS resource centre at Baggot Street.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is concentrating on research into primary care would he not agree that it is very poor that there is virtually no care and facilities outside Dublin for persons with AIDS? There are no respite care beds available and there is no acute hospital care available. Bearing in mind that in the past 12 months there has been a 35 per cent increase in the number of persons with AIDS &mdash; 183 per cent increase among the heterosexual community &mdash; is it not now <Col N="1765" /> time that the Minister established a dedicated budget to deal with the AIDS crisis right across the country and deliver primary care on the ground?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very unfair of the Deputy to suggest that there is no acute hospital care outside of Dublin for patients suffering from AIDS.  That is most unreasonable.  There are excellent physicians in all our hospitals across the country who are quite competent to manage patients suffering from AIDS and HIV infections.  It is well recognised now that patients suffering from AIDS should be treated in the same way as patients suffering from other serious infectious diseases in the community by their family doctor and in general hospitals and, in specific areas, in a tertiary referral hospital.  It is unfair to say that there is not an acute hospital service available outside of Dublin.</P>

      <P>On the question of the increasing number of persons with AIDS, that has to be a matter of concern to all of us.  The number of persons suffering from AIDS is increasing in this country and of course, as the Deputy appreciates these people would have been infected with AIDS a number of years ago.  The incubation period for AIDS is anything between eight to ten years.  Nevertheless we are concerned to ensure that we contain the spread of AIDS.  The Government have taken all the appropriate measures.  I am glad to say, as I have said in this House before, that we are taking exactly the same measures as all other developed countries to combat the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will share the concern of Members at the apparent increase in AIDS and the spread of the disease in the heterosexual community. The number of deaths from AIDS in the heterosexual community has increased from nine in 1990 to 17 in 1991, almost a 100 per cent increase.  Would the Minister <Col N="1766" /> not agree that as over 81 people have died from AIDS, the number of HIV-positive patients in the community in addition to those who have the undetected virus will require increased spending on public education and awareness in addition to increased spending on care and support for the victims of HIV? Given the growth in the number of AIDS and HIV positive cases, will the Minister outline the plans he has to cater for this increasing number of people who will require care?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the dental profession have expressed concern at the increasing number of AIDS and HIV patients as they believe they are handling at least four cases per week of persons with the undetected HIV virus?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of questions.  First, the number of patients suffering from AIDS in this country is 216, and of those 18 are heterosexual. The number of people who have died to date, that is up to 21 October, 1991 is 92 of whom six were heterosexual.  It is important to be accurate in our figures.</P>
      <P>As I have said, we are all concerned about AIDS.  AIDS is the major public health issue facing all countries in the world at present.  In some countries the problem is more serious than others.  Of course, we have taken our responsibility very seriously.  We had a major public information campaign and following its evaluation, it was found that the vast majority of the Irish people know how AIDS is contacted and how it is avoided. Nevertheless we are presently preparing a further public information programme for the benefit of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We thought it was very important that we target two specific groups in this country: first those leaving school, and second, intravenous drug users.  In relation to the first target group, we had the directors of community care for each area go into the schools and give the necessary information to the pupils.  At the same time my colleague, the Minister <Col N="1767" /> for Education, and I were preparing an AIDS education programme for schools. This programme has been very well received not alone in this country but by others from outside the country who have seen it.  That programme is in place in the schools around the country.</P>
    <P>The second group we targeted was the intravenous drug abusers because as Members know 60 per cent of the people who are HIV positive are intravenous drug abusers.  The spread of the disease to the heterosexual population came in the main through intravenous drug abusers. We have targeted that specific group.  As the House knows, a public information programme is not so effective with that group, perhaps because they do not receive the information through the electronic media or the printed media, and for that reason the outreach programme was adopted by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne raised a point in relation to the dental service.  As I said in reply to the original question, money is being spent by the Health Research Board on a research programme into the incidence of HIV presented through the mouth and the area with which the dentists work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated in the Dáil some time ago that he was still reviewing the matter.  Does the Minister agree that the figure of £54 for midwifery services is completely inadequate?  Does he agree that people who have medical cards and are on low incomes do not have the financial resources available to them to be able to have a choice about whether they will have a home birth?  Does he know that home births save the Exchequer much money in that in most cases they cost about £500, while hospital treatment for an expectant mother amounts to about £1,500?  Will the Minister make representations to the VHI board that home births cover be made available for couples?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one final question. Under the Health Act, 1970, provision was made for support services for home births.  The information received <Col N="1769" /> subsequently is that couples are actively discouraged by health boards from having home births.  Will the Minister comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three home births per 1,000 births here at present, which, as the Deputy will realise, is a very small number.  The issue is not a simple one.  First, it is difficult to provide the necessary expert staff for home births.  In the main, general practitioners do not deliver babies in homes and the old post of midwife has been done away with in most health board areas, so the expert staff required is not readily available. The Deputy should look at the 1976 report of all the expert groups.  Comhairle na nOspidéal, in their report in 1976 stated that if the basic aims of ensuring safe delivery and giving the infant the best chance of optimum health and normal development are to be achieved, every expectant mother should have ready access to care at a consultant-staffed obstetric neonatal unit.  That strong recommendation was made by that authority.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in relation to the point made by the Deputy about cost, there is no way that the question of cost could enter this issue, it is a fundamental right of every mother and child to have the very best care and attention &mdash; antenatal care, care during the delivery and post natal care.  Cost is not an issue in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the matter of cost, surely if proper services are to be provided for couples who wish to have a home birth £54 is a derisory figure and could go no way towards meeting the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, you have already made that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am pointing out to the Minister that that sum cannot meet the cost of the services required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear that there is a review of overall policy in the Minister's Department.  Will the review <Col N="1770" /> take into account the growing trend for mothers to want to have a subsequent child &mdash; not their first child &mdash; in their home?  Five or six years ago that trend did not exist.  I ask the question fully cognisant and aware of the Minister's concern for safety factors.  The reality is that many mothers now want to have subsequent children at home.  Would the Minister consider it prudent and sensible to seriously consider changing the policy, given the huge pressure &mdash; certainly in the Dublin area &mdash; on maternity hospitals and the enormous cost involved?  I am not saying that cost should be a deciding factor, but several factors should be taken into account.  I should like to know whether the Minister is seriously considering changing the policy operated by the Department for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>All aspects will be taken into account, including the views of couples who wish to have their babies at home.  However, as I pointed out in reply to Deputy Deenihan, the issue is not simply about increasing the £54 fee to a midwife.  There are not the expert staff available to undertake the work, and that is a very important consideration.  We also have to have regard to what Comhairle na nOspidéal, an expert body, had to say about the need for access to a good, well-staffed consultant unit for the benefit of both mother and baby.  The review will, of course, have regard to the views of the parents and what they want.</P>
      <P>Again I come back to the question of cost.  Cost does not enter into the matter. We will continue to provide the very highest level and quality of care for mothers and their babies.  The pressure on Dublin hospitals is nowhere near as great as it was years ago.  As the House is aware, there was a reduction in the birth rate from 74,500 in 1982&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider the possibility of maternity hospitals providing the necessary back-up staff, particularly in the light of the decline in the number of births?  If, as the Minister says, that money is not at the root of the issue, how can he say that £54 honours a person's statutory right to a home birth when home births, as I told the Minister in private correspondence, cost at least £280?</P>

      <P>That is what was being said by Deputy Garland.  I respect the views of parents who want to have their babies delivered at home.  We must ensure that the essential services are provided for them in so far as that can be done.  But because there are only three deliveries at home in every thousand it is not possible to put the level of expertise in every parish in Ireland.  In the olden days when I began in practice I delivered babies regularly, but now in the main general practitioners do not do so, although there may be a very small number who do.  The first thing one must do is ascertain how one can provide the necessary level and quality of expertise to women and their babies, because that is fundamental.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister only very recently received the report of the accident and emergency steering group and is examining the matter.  Would he bear in mind my strongly held view as a Dublin Deputy &mdash; and I am sure other Members will want to advise him of the position &mdash; that what has now been put in place by the hospital services in Dublin is a disaster?  Would he accept that clearly, the indications are that the reorganised service does not work?  It does not work internally, in so far as it imposes massive pressure on the everyday services within the hospitals concerned, secondly it is proving totally disastrous for the population of Dublin. Would the Minister undertake to move as quickly as possible to restore full accident and emergency services on a 24-hour basis?  Does the Minister accept as satisfactory, for example, that somebody <Col N="1774" /> living on the northside of the city in my constituency should have to have recourse to a hospital in Blanchardstown as an emergency outlet at night time, when there is no bus service available and when many of the people who badly need that service would not have the necessary resources to avail of a taxi to get to that hospital or return home? Would the Minister accept that major problems obtain wanting urgent attention by him at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McCartan that there are problems in the Dublin area needing to be addressed. The first one that needs to be addressed is that of the first point of referral to medical care within our health services. There is also the question of the number of people who bypass their general practitioners, resorting to the hospitals services leading in some instances to a delay in the treatment of more serious casualties in hospitals.  That is an issue that must be addressed.  Indeed, the Kennedy group examined and commented on that. I have initiated something in an endeavour to deal with that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the hospitals involved in the Dublin accident and emergency service, as the Deputy is aware, before, I think, 1989, just one hospital on the northside and one on the southside of the city was open at night. Because of the problem that caused, the number of such hospitals was increased to six.  The figures made available to us &mdash; I should say this is monitored all the time &mdash; showed there had been a major reduction in the level of activity, with some very high staffing levels, particularly throughout the night.  I remember that in one such instance the average was that 13 patients were tended during the night by seven staff.  Therefore, it was considered appropriate to reduce the number of hospitals to two on each side of the city.  As the Deputy rightly said, we have not as yet completed our study of the report; it is an interim one only, <Col N="1775" /> but I must add that we are monitoring the position very carefully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>Is the Minister not aware of the leaked information from this report, which was reported in the <i>Medical News</i>, indicating that this measure has thrown waiting lists into complete chaos, has led to a lengthening of waiting lists, and that there is major concern about the continuity of care when, as Deputy McCartan said, somebody is taken from Beaumont and admitted to Blanchardstown Hospital?  Is he not aware also that the consultants running these departments indicate that there will not be the cost savings the Minister thought he would effect?  Does the Minister not agree that the reality is that these hospitals cannot cope with the 50 per cent increase in their load the Minister says they should have?  Even last year we knew that patients were left on trolleys overnight during the winter peak activity. Especially when all of the accident and emergency consultants have so advised him, would he not agree that this is not a sensible way to save money?</P>

      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy is saying.  I should say that the hospitals now do have a full week during which they are not on accident and emergency duty, which should have given consultants and hospital managements an opportunity to plan their admissions for elective work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the issues that arises in the Dublin hospitals, one that must be of concern to everybody in this House, is that Dublin hospitals are being funded as tertiary referral hospitals.  A fair question to ask is: why is it costing so much if the accident and emergency services they are providing are similar to that being provided by general hospitals <Col N="1776" /> throughout the country?  That is one of the questions I have posed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that even without this report it is public knowledge that as soon as this new interim arrangement was put in place it failed utterly.  We are as concerned as those in the city of Dublin about this accident and emergency service which is not available when required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that contention at all.  The position is that in the initial weeks when the revised accident and emergency service was implemented there was no problem about it, but it had been predicted by accident and emergency consultants that it would fail.  That had been predicted before it came into operation at all.  They kept predicting it would fail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they were not right, because in the first three to four weeks there were no problems encountered.  As I understand it, there were one or two problems experienced but those were problems that had obtained even when the six accident and emergency hospitals were open, when all the beds were full and when patients had to be transferred to another hospital.  That happens all the time irrespective of the number of hospitals open.  Even when the six were open there was the same problem experienced of patients being transferred to other hospitals where beds were available rather than opening up new beds.  That makes sense.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister's attention been drawn by his Minister of State who was present at a recent public meeting in my constituency where testimony was advanced about a traffic accident when the casualty was left lying on the road for some time while the emergency staffs argued about which hospital was on duty that night?  Does the Minister not agree that this is further evidence of the serious deficiency in the accident and <Col N="1777" /> emergency service in Dublin?  Furthermore, does he not agree that it ought give him additional motivation to reverse his disastrous decision to longfinger the construction of the Tallaght Hospital?</P>

Given that it appears that the impetus for this change &mdash; this was confirmed by the Minister today &mdash; came from his Department in the hope of saving money, may I ask the Minister to ensure, whatever decisions are taken, that there will be easy access to this service from a geographic point of view?  If the service is to be limited, I ask him to ensure that it will at least be provided at the six major hospitals in the city as heretofore.  As a man from a rural area, the Minister may not appreciate the major logistical problems being experienced by people who live in the city in <Col N="1778" /> terms of travelling at night time and outside normal bus hours to and from hospitals.</P>

      <P>The Public Health Nursing Service is available free of charge to all persons with full eligibility and to such other categories of persons and for such purposes as may be specified.  A wide range of services has in the past been specified and this specifically includes home nursing services for the elderly for both eligibility categories.</P>
      <P>Provision of services to the elderly in their homes is a key element in both the working party report <i>The Year Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> and in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>Of the £8 million additional funding made available for services for the elderly in 1990 and 1991, the area to benefit most was the home care services.  At least 400 extra staff have been recruited by the health boards comprising nurses, home helps, attendants, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and chiropodists to improve these services and all of the health boards have appointed co-ordinators or district liaison nurses to ensure that the elderly in need are identified.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a specific case in mind, he might let me have details of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that before the cutbacks in the health services by the present regime all people in need of such services received them but that since then priority has only been given to medical card holders?  In Galway city, an area with a population of 50,000, there are only four full-time home help assistants who are earning the great sum of £1.80 per hour.  There are only about 30 such assistants in the entire county.  There are 12 district nurses in Galway city and 50 throughout the county.  How can those people provide the services they are expected to provide? The Minister is misleading the House by saying that the service is available to everybody.  If it was I would not have <Col N="1780" /> put down this question.  This is a general rather than a specific question.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the working group on care for the elderly recommended the recruitment of an extra 250 public health nurses and that these have not been provided? We have not even started to move towards that target.  Those figures were way below what they would like to see in terms of European standards.  Would the Minister not agree that what Deputy McCormack has said is the reality &mdash; care is not being provided because there is not enough public health nursing staff?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I think what is being said is a reflection on the very good people in the health service who are providing a very high level of care for so many of our elderly people.  Of course, there is a need to provide more staff but, as I pointed out in reply to the question, the Government provided £8 million between 1990-91 specifically targeted at care of the elderly.  As a result, 400 extra staff, which is a very good number when one has regard to the financial difficulties we faced throughout the eighties and continue to face, have been appointed.  The Government can take a lot of credit for what has been done.  Of course, there is <Col N="1781" /> more to be done and we will continue to discharge our responsibilities.</P>

However, the situation in Galway city &mdash; I am talking about specifics &mdash; is that two home help assistants who retired have not been replaced, with the result that the number has now been reduced to four.  This does not reconcile with what the Minister has said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, home helps are employed on a temporary basis; they are employed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by the health board to look after an elderly person at a particular time.  That is the general system operated throughout the country.  In addition, some health boards provide care attendants, for example, the Eastern Health Board who provide full-time care attendants for people who are more disabled.  Other health boards employ a person as a full-time home help to look after a number of elderly people.  The number of elderly people who need a home help service is changing all the time and I cannot accept that there is a reduction of the level outlined by the Deputy.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was <Col N="1839" /> adjourned I was referring to the importance of a relatively clean environment, clean food and a good image from the point of view of exports and tourism.  In that context I should also like to say that the proposed agency should not be shy of local RTCs, universities, institutions and groups involved in environmental monitoring and research.  I would include here the excellent work done by local authority laboratories such as the one run by Meath County Council.</P>
      <P>This Bill must represent a balance between the national and local authorities and a balance between industry and the environment.  It cannot and must not be seen as anti-industry, because its aim is to ensure that all sectors of the economy are developed within standards of cleanliness that will ensure the quality of our environment and contribute to maintaining the image we have abroad of a truly green landscape.  There is no contradiction between this and job creation. That has been stressed in the whole idea behind the legislation and the setting up of this body.  We must get away from the notion that the interests of industry and those of the environment are necessarily in competition with one another, because they are not.  This is especially so in contentious areas such as aquaculture, peat excavation, offshore oil exploration and agri-business.  Instead, we must stress the importance of balance &mdash; a balance between the need to protect the environment and the need for social and economic development.  As I said at the outset, this sense of balance is reflected in the nature of the diverse sectoral welcome for the Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome also the proposal in relation to environmental impact studies, and again they are being streamlined under one agency.  However, given the spirit of openness that characterises the Bill, I hope its intent to make such information more easily available will be honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 59 seeks to involve the Environmental Protection Agency in the management of waste.  While I understand that more specific proposals will be brought before the House soon, the <Col N="1840" /> Environmental Protection Agency has set an important agenda here.  Local authorities will continue to monitor landfills, but in liaison with the proposed Environmental Protection Agency. However, the cost of waste management is considerable for any local authority and is something that has caused difficulties for virtually every local authority in recent times.  While I commend the Government for the development of more modernised water and sewage schemes in various parts of the country, they must be developed in association with a modernised waste disposal system and should be given the same priority because they have the same relevance.</P>
    <P>One way to answer this problem is to deal with it at source and in a sense that is what the Bill proposes to do.  I wish the Bill well in this regard.  Given the Government's thoroughness with this Bill, I would hate to see its intent undermined by the failure to address the problem of actual waste disposal as well as waste creation, which is what the Bill is trying to curtail.  The problem of waste disposal is evident and poses difficulties for every local authority.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the Bill suggests balance; it suggests partnership between national and local government and between official bodies and the public at large.  This sense of balance is reflected, too, in the composition of the Environmental Protection Agency board.  I would like to draw attention to this board because it is balanced and positive.  Representation on the board will include the chairperson of An Taisce, the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the managing director of the IDA.  The IDA will represent the various sectors of industry. This board could have been drawn from a narrower base, but the inclusion of the managing director of the IDA and the secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is a positive step.  I am particularly pleased that the chief executive of the Council for the Status of Women is proposed as a board member, under section 21.  This reflects well on the <Col N="1841" /> Government and on their policy of ensuring that women participate and take part in State boards and semi-State boards. We would all agree there is room for continued improvement in that whole area.  It is good to note it is mentioned specifically in this legislation that the chief executive of the Council for the Status of Women would be a board member.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the local authority constitutes an important part of the proposed new structures and does much work in this area.  Accordingly, would the Minister consider the possibility of appointing somebody from the General Council of County Councils to the board because of their involvement in this area?</P>
    <P>The proposed Bill marks a major breakthrough.  It is detailed and thorough legislation and deals with the protection of the environment, an area in which we are all interested.  I think everybody welcomes the fact that a national agency is now being established to ensure that this area is looked at on a national basis. I commend the Bill to the House and I congratulate those responsible for bringing it to this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. However, I must qualify that by saying I hope this legislation does not end up as another piece of unfinished business, like the Local Government (Reorganisation) Act which started life in this House over six years ago and is still part of an ongoing process within Dublin County Council and in local authorities generally.  While waiting for the Local Government (Reorganisation) Act to be implemented fully within county councils on the planning front, major undesired developments are occurring throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.  This Bill gives me an opportunity, as a person who represents one of the most scenic and high amenity areas of Dublin city, to speak in defence of such invaluable national assets.  Will the Bill before the House afford any protection against such undesirable developments, or will it end up as another piece of unfinished business within local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1842" /> In essence, what I am saying is this: I am not happy with the speed and the pace of imlementation of the Local Government (Reorganisation) Act which to date has not been implemented within Dublin County Council.  I hope this legislation, which seems to be what is desired, is implemented much quicker than the three years which some commentators say it will take to fully implement.  While local authorities are making every effort to implement the Local Government (Reorganisation) Act and while they will make every effort to implement this Bill as quickly as possible, developers are carrying out the rape of such scenic areas as Howth Head and Sutton and every green space is threatened with extinction by developers who wish to plan Bel Air or Dallas type housing, completely ruining some of the most scenic sites in western Europe.  So serious is the threat on this scale to the environment in north-east Dublin that the residents of Howth peninsula and Sutton have come together in an effort to bring pressure to bear on local authorities and on the Government to save such sites of scenic and environmental importance.  The Howth Sutton 2,000 group is completely voluntary. With the help on a voluntary basis of architects and planners they are now identifying sites of such significance and merit in the Howth peninsula.  The east mountain of Howth is still threatened with development as is the large area of Carrickbrack, close to Sutton.  If Dublin County Council cannot find enough money or exchange lands and purchase the interest of such developers, these scenic sites will be lost forever.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to one of the most scenic and best amenities in Dublin.  Here I refer to the cliff walks, the rights of way and the Hill of Howth.  Some of these walks, which start from the most scenic areas of Dublin Bay in the Sutton area and work their way right around to Howth Harbour, are an invaluable asset. However, they have not been taken in charge by the local authority and the Government does not seem to interest themselves in such amenities.  The only way one can interest oneself in such <Col N="1843" /> amenities is to put money up front and ensure that such rights of way and such cliff walks which are so near the city are properly presented by way of leaflets explaining the historical sites around these walks.  Tourists who come to Dublin like to get out and see the countryside and see Dublin as it is.  This amenity on our doorsteps is completely neglected.</P>
    <P>Dublin County County have made every effort to have the walks brought up to date.  It is impossible to take a walk around that area without running into brambles and injuring oneself as the area is completely overgrown.  There is no proper hard core or paving on these rights of way.  Dublin County Council have tried to operate schemes through FÁS and the Department of Labour.  Though they made every effort last year, the Department of Labour were not able to sanction such schemes and Dublin County Council were unable to take on staff to do anything about the walks. People were prepared to put in some work.  However, they could not liaise with Dublin County Council and do such works because a programme was not put in place since the Department of Labour did not sanction the schemes.  The rights of way are there and locals are still pressing to have some scheme put in place by Dublin County Council which would need finance from Government. Will the Minister look into it and see if finance can be put at the disposal of Dublin County Council so that they can take the rights of way in charge from An Taisce and look after them properly so that they can be used as an amenity and to encourage tourism?</P>
    <P>The rights of way about which I talk could be extended to take in Howth Harbour, Sutton, Baldoyle and Baldoyle Estuary.  Baldoyle Estuary was granted the status of an estuary and it is famous as an overwintering place for Brent geese and other species of birds which we like to welcome in the winter and which we want to protect.  If the walks could be extended to the Baldoyle area and <Col N="1844" /> around the estuary it would be a wonderful natural amenity.  This estuary is twinned with the Polar Bear Pass in Canada and it has the full support of the Irish Wildlife Conservancy as an estuary. I know that the Department of the Marine and the Board of Works, who were responsible for having the estuary declared as such, are making every effort to put the infrastructure there.  I am talking about putting in hides from which ornithologists can study the birds who overwinter there and about putting in paving or some sort of a road so that it is accessible to Dubliners and tourists. People could start from O'Connell Street, work their way out to Sutton and Howth and use the rights of way right into Baldoyle to this wonderful amenity at Baldoyle Estuary.  Ornithologists and other environmentalists could study birds and could generally enjoy the wonderful amenity there.</P>
    <P>Will this Bill help local authorities to ward off undesirable developments?  If it would, I welcome it.  The only sure way to protect high amenity areas is to have a special amenity area order declared.  I understand that there are four special amenity orders in the pipeline.  Work is presently taking place in relation to the Liffey valley special amenity area and I understand that a special amenity area order for the Howth and surrounding districts is placed third in priority with the Dublin County Council.  Will this legislation allow for such special amenity area orders and when set up will the expertise in the agency have the wherewithal to deal with special amenity area orders and will the agency have the power to declare such orders?  Perhaps the Minister is summing up will let me have this information.</P>
    <P>This Bill should be enacted as soon as possible to stop the stampede of developers trying to beat the legislation.  The onslaught of developers in the areas of Howth and Sutton must be stopped.  I hope this Bill contains the remedy.</P>
    <P>Sewage pollution of Dublin beaches is relatively slight considering the volume of effluent which enters the waters, <Col N="1845" /> according to a recent report.  It is imperative that we cease dumping raw sewage in Dublin Bay in order to bring to an end an intolerable problem which is worthy of the Middle Ages.  At present most Dublin sewage is processed through the corporation treatment plant at Ringsend, which is in need of further upgrading. This would cost in the region of £45 million. On the far side of the bay the north Dublin drainage scheme empties totally untreated sewage into the sea beside Howth Harbour.  The scheme, which starts at Finglas, serves all the large housing estates, factories and hospitals on the north side of Dublin and it discharges raw sewage into the sea beside Howth Harbour.  Factors such as tide, wind and the length of time which bacteria live in sea water combine to minimise the effects of sewage effluent, according to a recent report.</P>
    <P>Beaches such as Donabate, Malahide and Rush received the blue flag award in 1990.  It is encouraging to note that the awards were given to seven beaches in the present year, those beaches being Donabate, Rush, Portmarnock, Portrane, Malahide, Skerries and Sutton.  I welcome the fact that Sutton received the blue flag award this year because it is so near the Nose of Howth where raw sewage from the north side is dumped and is washing back towards beaches. However, Sutton escaped this year and I welcome that.  Dollymount Strand did not have the water quality to qualify for a blue flag award.  I regret that, but I am glad it received a special award for the lack of rubbish on the beaches and for the way the interpretative centre there do their business.</P>
    <P>It seems to be the present Government decision to spend most of the money available for sewage treatment on the Ringsend plant.  This plant serves mainly the south side of the city.  There is not any mention of money being made available to establish a similar sewage treatment works on the north side.  Is it Government policy to continue to treat north side citizens as second class?  Is it Government policy to continue with the dumping of raw sewage off the nose of <Col N="1846" /> Howth, systematically polluting beaches traditionally used by northsiders?  That is something the Minister should take on board.  Most of the money has been put into the Ringsend works.  I am not satisfied that the Ringsend plant is doing its job either and some of the waste coming into the water from Ringsend washes over to the Howth area.  More money is to be made available to update the Ringsend's works and that should be done as soon as possible to stop it polluting the north side.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bay should be environmentally managed for the benefit of thousands of Dubliners who use it every year.  A recent report tells us that 15,000 people go sailing, 30,000 go boating or cruising and that about 250,000 go walking.  That is why I mentioned the walks which could start in O'Connell Street, go out by Clontarf, out to Sutton, around the Hill of Howth, around by the harbour and so on.  The rights of way are there but they are not being maintained.  The Department should make money available to Dublin County Council to make those rights of way accessible to people and have this wonderful amenity restored. About 250,000 people go walking, 1,500 people use the bay for angling and over 250,000 go to the beaches every year. The report also reveals that most of the complaints received from the general public were about water quality.  Litter pollution and odours caused by pollution were of major concern.</P>
    <P>A detailed monitoring programme is of the utmost importance.  This should include water quality surveys, measurements of waste discharged into the bay and studies of algae growth.  With proper monitoring and management, beaches and shoreline waters will improve and the amount of sewage and plastic will reduce considerably.  Will the agency have the power to carry out such monitoring and management of Dublin Bay waters?</P>
    <P>Nowadays we are worried about the provision of jobs.  We are trying to get cleaner industries, cleaner air, a cleaner environment and protection for our natural resources.  If we do not get it right in <Col N="1847" /> protecting the environment and if this agency does not work well but becomes another body that attends half heartedly to matters, it will not make effective decisions.  It is important that the Minister should move ahead with all possible speed to ensure that the agency is set up as soon as possible.  What timescale does the Minister of State envisage as undue delay that would be a sign we are not taking the protection of the environment seriously?</P>
    <P>A few moments ago I referred to the environment of the Dublin north-east area.  Recently Dublin Corporation granted permission for the construction of over 900 houses in the St. Michael's-Grange Road area, which is known locally as the &ldquo;Hole in the Wall&rdquo;.  I said earlier that the north Dublin drainage scheme starts at Finglas and works its way to the Nose of Howth, serving each estate, industry and hospital along the way.  The residents of the area do not object to a further 900 houses being connected to the scheme, but what they do object to is the fact that 35 to 40 houses in the area known as the Hole in the Wall have no sewerage facilities and that their occupants have to depend on toilets which in this day and age could only be described as medieval.  They have spoken to the developer who intends to build these 900 houses but he has given them no encouragement.  It is his intention to build a road which would connect with the Hole in the Wall Road, which is the main road from the Donaghmede area and leads on to the Airport.  Therefore, one can imagine the volume of traffic on this road.</P>
    <P>The developer has informed the residents that in providing such sewerage facilities he would have to erect a pumping station at a cost to the residents of £30,000 to £40,000, money which they do not have.  The point I am trying to make is that we have housing within eight miles of Dublin city which does not have proper toilets and the residents of which have to depend on septic tanks.  The smell from these tanks during the summer is unbelievable. This should not be tolerated in <Col N="1848" /> this day and age.  Dublin Corporation should talk to the residents and make sure they are provided with proper sewage facilities.  They already have water facilities.  Needless to say, the developer will be able to tap into this resource.  Dublin Corporation should make sure that the developer, who is seeking further permission, provides proper sewerage facilities to the residents of that area.  Having said that, the Hole in the Wall is not all that far away from the pipe in Kinsealy.  I ask the Minister of State to look into this matter to see if these houses could be connected to the pipe to make sure that they have proper sewerage facilities.  That would be most welcome.</P>
    <P>Also close by stands Baldoyle Racecourse, which over the years has been the subject of many planning applications. The Encamp development which was proposed a few years ago would have led to the creation of another concrete jungle which would have completely ruined the environment of the Baldoyle area. However, the local residents and others came together to launch a campaign to make sure that no undesirable development took place in the Baldoyle Racecourse.</P>
    <P>Baldoyle Racecourse, however, which comprises 60 acres, forms only a small part of the land mass of the owners, who own approximately 600 acres in the area. It was their intention to build a new town but, as I said, local residents and other groups came together to ensure that that development did not take place.  Part of the coastal area is zoned high amenity which they will not be allowed develop. However, behind this and backing on to the famous sewerage pipe I have spoken about at the Baskin Cottages lie the remaining 540 acres.  This is a wonderful area and it should be preserved.</P>
    <P>The people of Baldoyle and the surrounding areas are not naive and they know that in time to come there will have to be some development, but they do not want a concrete jungle.  Recently some developers suggested that there should be limited development with provision made for golf clubs, an interpretative <Col N="1849" /> centre beside the Baldoyle Estuary, which would be most welcome, a hotel and other developments.  They want to build a shopping centre, but that may not be acceptable to the residents.  What we are saying is that it would be most welcome if they set aside open space on which a golf course, a pitch and putt course and other facilities, such as a running track and other open air facilities, could be constructed.</P>
    <P>Given that this site is located beside the airport and the DART stations at Sutton, Kilbarrack and Bayside and that there is no traffic congestion between the city and Baldoyle, it would be an ideal site for the national sports centre.  I also note that the site suggested by the Government on the quays has run into trouble.  This site at Baldoyle should be looked at as it would be the ideal place for the sports centre.  It is right beside Baldoyle Estuary and near to Howth where water sport facilities could be provided at a very low cost.  It is also beside some of the best golf courses in Europe, including Portmarnock.  I hope the Minister of State will take this suggestion on board to see if it would be feasible.  I am not happy at the way in which the Department have tried to split the complex among certain areas; it should be maintained in one unit.  We should locate the training centre, football pitches, running track and soccer stadium on this site on the old Baldoyle Racecourse.  This would be welcomed by the residents and the people of the north side of Dublin. When this site was used as a racecourse it attracted people from the North of Ireland and abroad who used the airport. I understand that the owners of the site would welcome such an approach.  I suggest therefore that the Department of the Environment should speak to them.  If they do they will be able to buy a site more cheaply in the Baldoyle area and could protect the environment by locating the national sports centre there.  This would be welcomed by the citizens of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Another site in my area which has been the subject of media attention over years is the Red Rock site.  Once again, the <Col N="1850" /> local residents and others came together to ensure that no development took place on eight acres of that site.  This was a wonderful victory for the local residents associations.  Dublin County Council also came to our rescue and put up £500,000 to satisfy the developer, who wished to develop this wonderful amenity which would have interfered with the local walks which cross the Hill of Howth, including the famous walk to which I have referred which runs from the city to Howth Head and on to Baldoyle. However Dublin County Council seem to be having a problem in getting the developer to accept what is on offer.  A land deal has been made but he is not happy with that.  We are worried that this site may come under threat once again if the developer does not accept what is on offer.  Could the Department make finance available to the council to compete the deal and to protect forever the Red Rock site, which, as I say, is a wonderful amenity?  Perhaps the Minister will take this matter on board.</P>
    <P>One could not talk about the north-east of Dublin without mentioning the wonderful amenity of Howth harbour.  It is a marvellous development, into which the Department of the Marine and successive Governments over the years put £13 million and created a harbour worthy of the highest praise.  We are very happy with it.  The harbour has landings worth £4 million per year and creates good employment.  The allied industries which have been set up in the area have been very clean.  The ship repairing business is excellent but they have to bring the boats across the road to the west pier, an uncovered area, to repair them. However, that is a matter for another Department and we will be looking for finance in that regard.</P>
    <P>I worry about the fact that the harbour is very close to the village and needs a sewage treatment works to cope with the pollution in the area.  I hope the Minister will treat this matter with urgency.  The sewage is ruining the spawning beds and the fish life.  Fishermen will tell you that there is no point in looking for lobster in the Howth area.  Dublin Bay prawns used <Col N="1851" /> to be on the menus of good restaurants but they have now disappeared.  Employment in the fishing industry is practically nil although, of course, trawling has made a difference and has upset the beds. Raw sewage affects the beds and the famous Howth herring cannot reproduce themselves.  It is a long time since the Howth herring was on a menu.</P>
    <P>A proper treatment works in the north Dublin drainage scheme would cost a lot of money but it would solve many problems.  It would bring back fishing, help tourism and the harbour.  If the Minister takes just one point from my speech I ask her to ensure that whatever money she can get from the European Community &mdash; which would be welcomed by the people in Howth and the surrounding district &mdash; will be spent on the north Dublin drainage scheme in the Howth area.  A sewage treatment works as good as the one in Ringsend would be adequate for our needs although we would welcome a more elaborate one. I hope the Minister will consider that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Government on bringing this Bill before the House.  In 1987 the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> proposed various strategies for developing our natural resources.  By any standards it was an ambitious programme and its strategies for development in areas such as tourism, the food industry and so on, are now carried forward in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  The Government also recognise that agriculture and industrial development must be balanced by a public policy which is environmentally sound.  For example, it is pointless pouring vast sums of money into tourism if, on the other hand, we tarnish our image as a country with clean air, clean water and clean soil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is part of a much wider strategy. On one level it represents the most far-reaching review of our environmental law since the foundation of the State; on a second level it represents the Government's commitment to ensuring that, as <Col N="1852" /> we move through the nineties, a proper balance will be maintained between developmental policies and conservation, which is most important for the development and creation of jobs within our economy.  We should maintain the balance between developmental works and conservation and if we get the balance right I am convinced that we can make major inroads in the present unemployment.</P>
    <P>In a sense we have taken the cleanliness of our environment for granted and, to a certain extent, there are historical reasons for this.  We never developed the great industrial bases of our European neighbours and, consequently, we avoided much of the pollution which has destroyed most of the Black Forest as well as the Rhine and the other great rivers of Europe.  Accordingly, much of our environmental law has evolved on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and, to a certain extent, its diverse administration reflects this.</P>
    <P>As our country moves from its near total reliance on agriculture, the limitations of our laws become more apparent. There is nothing wrong with such economic redirection but it would be worrying if we did not balance this with an adequate system of monitoring and controlling our environment.  Since they came to office the Government have actively pursued this agenda, notably during the period of our Presidency of the EC, better known as the Green Presidency. It is important to stress the national and international dimensions of Government strategy.  A few years ago we were all dismayed at what happened in Chernobyl, we were even more dismayed that its direct effects were felt as far away as the sheep farms of Wales.  In a similar vein it is short-sighted not to worry about the depletion of the ozone layer on the basis that it only affects the polar regions.  What all this adds up to is that any effective environmental policy must be part of a wider agenda.  As I said, this agenda was largely set out during our EC Presidency; here I want to pay special tribute to the Taoiseach for the tremendous work he did in advocating the Green <Col N="1853" /> Presidency.  I compliment his Ministers and Ministers of State&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy compliment him next week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed I will and be proud to do so.  We must ensure that this work is carried through and that we have a strong, Community-wide environmental protection agency which might deal with the broader issues, including the ongoing scandal of Sellafield.</P>
      <P>I should also like to take this opportunity of complimenting my fellow Wexford Oireachtas Members in the early seventies, in particular my own Fianna Fáil organisation, for ensuring that a policy decision taken by a Fianna Fáil Government at that time was reversed. I speak about the decision by the then Minister, Deputy Des O'Malley, to build a nuclear power station in Carnsore in my constituency.  While I read today of the many objections to the Sellafield plant &mdash; they are justified objections &mdash; I realise that without the wisdom, foresight and political mechanisms used by my Oireachtas colleagues and my own organisation in Wexford, we could be facing a very serious situation today in my constituency and in the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House today is part of a broader EC strategy.  I am glad to note that it allows for close co-operation and liaison between the proposed Environmental Protection Agency on the one hand and European and other international agencies and bodies on the other.  The Bill shows thought, thoroughness and responsibility.  As the Minister has already given a detailed report on the Bill I will not go through the schedule here.  However, I want to make one specific point about the location of the proposed agency.  I may be accused of being parochial but if that is the case, so be it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the facility at Johnstown Castle, County Wexford, as a national institution with a deserved national reputation. Johnstown has had a distinguished place in the whole area of advisory services and research.  Under the leadership of the late Dr. Tom Walsh in particular, <Col N="1854" /> Johnstown established a national reputation for its unique survey of soil types as well as for its research of plant disorders. More generally its experts played a decisive role in the areas of water, soil and air-related studies, a role that was appreciated by the farming community and the industrial sector alike.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Government to ensure that Johnstown serve this new agency as proposed for the nineties just as it served in the sixties when it was operated by An Foras Talúntais and prior to that when it was used for agricultural education and research under the terms of the Johnstown Castle Agriculture Act, 1945.  At that time it provided advice to local authorities of the kind envisaged in this Bill.  Indeed the Bill not only builds on this tradition but also extends it.  As I said at the outset, the agency will have a much more comprehensive structure and will set an agenda that will be determined by the long term rather than the short term interest of our community.  As I have said, I regard this Bill as a milestone in the evolution of Ireland's environmental policy.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Harney, for bringing this Bill before us and, without hesitation, I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a long-awaited Bill but at last it has come into this House after a difficult passage through the Seanad.  Despite all our good wishes, I am disappointed with the Bill.  It effectively takes from the control of the elected representative of the people the functions of environmental protection.  The Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy Jim Mitchell, pointed out that this party will be moving an amendment which will ensure that there will be involvement by this House in the role of the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the events of recent months have taught us anything it is that politicians, public representatives, are the people best equipped to deal with the structures of the State, be it in the services area, the whole area of local government or health. When we allow the activities of bodies to <Col N="1855" /> go outside the control of public representatives strange things can happen. We are accountable to the people who elect us and we have to seek re-election, sometimes after nine or ten months but at least every five years.  The people can give their verdict on us at the end of five years.  Unfortunately some of the bodies that have been set up in the past and took control away from the public representatives have not acquitted themselves with honour.</P>
    <P>I am extremely discouraged that the Environmental Protection Agency will be a body similar in ways to An Bord Pleanála.  Strange things happened at one stage in the area of planning but stranger things are happening now with the activities of An Bord Pleanála.  That body are not accountable to anybody.  They can overrule decisions of local authorities and nobody can question their performance or their decisions because they are &ldquo;independent&rdquo;. In other words, they are not accountable.  Some of the decisions taken by them in my own city and in other parts of the country are disgraceful and bring that body into question.  However, we are not dealing with them today.  Here again we are setting up another agency that will not have to account to this House, and that is a major defect in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill was long heralded.  It is good to see that at last the whole question of environmental protection has become a political issue.  For far too long &mdash; I am going back to my early days in the House, 1981 to 1983 &mdash; when you talked about environmental protection, pollution and nuclear waste, people looked at you as if you had two heads.  They did not understand what it was and they did not care. It was not a political issue.  The only person in this House who had any interest in the matter, and I pay tribute to him, was a colleague from the other side, Deputy Gerard Brady.  He came in here week in and week out and raised issues in relation to the environment, issues such as Windscale, as it was known then, and the disposal of nuclear and toxic waste.  Deputy Brady and I raised these <Col N="1856" /> issues but people did not want to hear us. I am not being political in this; I am condemning all Governments in the past.</P>
    <P>It was only after the disaster at Chernobyl that people sat up and took notice. That was not only a disaster for the USSR; but also an international disaster, a disaster that crossed territorial and continental lines.  As the previous speaker said, we suffered the effects of the Chernobyl fall-out in the mountainous areas of the country.  It took a disaster like that to make us sit up and take notice.  It made us aware of the wide range of issues that come under the umbrella of the environment and environmental protection.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to our structures in this area.  At one stage I counted the number of bodies in this country dealing with environmental protection.</P>
    <P>I will refer now to the structure in place to deal with environmental problems.  In the mid-eighties I counted 13 bodies dealing with environmental protection, comprising Government Departments, local authorities and other agencies.  There were overlaps but there were also gaps in the level of monitoring.  The local authorities dealt with water and air pollution inadequately and that remains the case through no fault of theirs because they are starved of cash.  When local authorities make the decision to spend money they spend in areas where there is a far greater political demand on their resources.  In my opinion protection of the environment is very far down on the agenda of most local authorities.  In sensitive areas, for example where there is a chemical factory, the local authorities have attempted to equip themselves to deal with the modern-day problems arising from modern industries with their limited resources.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of Chernobyl the health boards were running around like headless chickens.  They were not equipped to deal with possible contamination of the milk supplies.  They did not have iodine tablets available and did not know what to do.  I cannot really blame them because at the time this issue was low on the political agenda.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine deals <Col N="1857" /> with the issue of dumping at sea, the Department of Energy deal with nuclear issues, the Department of the Environment deal with similar issues and, of course, the Department of Health are involved also.  Indeed, the fisheries boards are involved.  That is an indication of the disjointed and innefficient approach to the question of environmental protection and it continues.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency will bring ideas and a new approach to the problem but ideas without resources and without commitment are not much good.  Since the early eighties Windscale &mdash; now called Sellafield &mdash; has become more controversial as evidence accumulated to show that Windscale was a threat to our environment and the health of our people.  That project is of no economic benefit to the people of this country but because of its proximity it is a threat to our people.  It has become a big issue. The people who went to investigate Windscale, later called Sellafield, are convinced that it is an unsafe plant.  I will outline the reasons why we cannot face up to Britain on this issue.</P>
    <P>After two visits to the plant I came to the conclusion that it was very unsafe and that a great deal of the information that should be forthcoming is not forthcoming. I am not happy with the lines of communication that are supposed to exist between our Government and the British Government on Sellafield.  I hope the Government will honour the commitments made by Ministers when in Opposition to bring this issue to international fora and take Britain through the courts to try to close down Sellafield. I agree with Deputy Dukes who made a detailed and well researched contribution this morning, that this is just a pipedream because we have been compromised by our lack of an environmental policy.  The first thing we should do &mdash; I ask the Minister to set it out in her reply to the debate &mdash; is put in place a national environmental protection policy because we do not have one at present?  We are establishing an agency but we do not have a clear policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1858" /> Yesterday the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, spoke about the disposal of toxic waste.  When asked about the proposed toxic waste disposal plant in Derry he replied in his usual way that plans were being drafted, consultations were ongoing, that the Department were in contact with companies and that in due course we would have a decision on a toxic waste plant.  In the meantime, he said, the proposal to build such a plant in Derry will take care of our immediate problem.  That is a typical Irish solution to an Irish problem &mdash; export our problem abroad.</P>
    <P>The absence of a waste management programme here has cost us dearly.  I had occasion a month ago to meet industrialists who were visiting Cork city with a view to locating industry there.  One of the issues raised was the question of the disposal of industrial waste.  The absence of a clear-cut policy in relation to industrial waste will be a big factor in that company's decision on where to locate. Companies choose to locate elsewhere in the world because we have no policy in this area.</P>
    <P>We will be in a mess in a few years time if we are told by the EC to dispose of our waste on our own territory if we have not reached a decision on how to dispose of toxic waste.  What will we do? Are we going to wait until the alarm bells go before we make a decision?  A national waste management policy should be prepared by Government and pubished so that we will at least know where we stand. Not only do we have a problem in regard to the disposal of chemical and toxic waste but local authorities need to know where they stand in relation to the disposal of domestic waste.  The days are fast passing when we can open a hole in the ground and dump in domestic waste and all that goes with it.  There are no controls at many tipheads and we do not know &mdash; indeed many do not care &mdash; what is going on.  To be parochial for a moment, we have a problem with a landfill site in Cork.  In the absence of clear information and direction from the Government we do not know how to plan the next step in our waste management <Col N="1859" /> programme.  We do not know whether to go down the line of incineration, or recycling.  There seems to be a limited policy of recycling.  Grants are available to certain companies.  A company who got a grant last year from the Department of the Environment were out of business within a matter of months while another company with a long track record did not get the grant which would have allowed them to use their expertise to develop their recycling operaton.  It was a case of the newcomer having the right contacts. That company folded within a couple of months, and we are now back to where we were.</P>
    <P>Admittedly one recycling project has been grant-aided and I hope they will be successful in operating a comprehensive recycling programme but that is not the approach the Government should adopt. We should have a firm policy instead of the play here and play there policy.  It is inconsistent.</P>
    <P>As I said, I believe that industrial development has been seriously hindered because of the lack of waste management policy.  It has been hindered because of the lack of confidence people have in present structures.  People do not have confidence in the ability of local authorities to monitor the activities of industries. Merrill Dow provided a tragic example of a major international company lost to Ireland, lost to the east Cork area.  I believe that the company was lost to this country because the people of the area did not have confidence in the ability or the resources of their local authority to protect their interests.  They saw what happened in Clonmel in the Hanlon case, which I shall not go into.  People saw what happened there and they witnessed the inability of a local authority to protect local interests.  People became scared, scaremongers took over and created opposition to Merrill Dow, and Merrill Dow eventually got tired of that and went elsewhere, taking with them the potential for 1,000 jobs.  After that came a big test case in the south, Sandoz.</P>
    <P>All the same issues came up about Sandoz, a company which I believe to <Col N="1860" /> have, with one unfortunate exception, a magnificent track record in environmental protection.  There again people from the area for which the factory was proposed became anxious and worried because in the past their interests had not been protected adequately by their local authority.  Local authorities did not have the sophisticated equipment or the knowhow or technology for many years to protect local interests through adequate monitoring.  It is only in the past two or three years that that has changed.  I pay tribute to the Cork County Council, which is not in my area, which, despite cutbacks, has faced up to the challenge presented by modern day industry. Sandoz is now going ahead with their project, but only after a hard and vicious battle.  That company too could have been lost because of lack of clearcut vision and policy coming from central government.</P>
    <P>The scaremongers in our community are given a free hand in that they can make outrageous claims which at times our local authorities are not equipped to answer.  One evening I attended a meeting at which outrageous allegations were made against a company that was, in my opinion, performing well.  Those claims were taken as gospel because there was nobody at the meeting to contradict them apart from representatives of the company itself.  There again, the company, tiring of the situation, was on the point of giving in.  At this stage, therefore, I call on the Government to set out clearly a national environmental protection policy in relation to industrial development, urban decay, air pollution, water pollution and a whole range of environmental issues so that people will know what is happening and will have confidence in existing structures.</P>
    <P>I now wish to come back to the issue of international pollution, especially radioactive waste.  As I said, I have spent much time and gone to much trouble considering the Sellafield plant and the problems posed by that plant.  One of my most embarrassing moments occurred when I visited Sellafield for the second time in <Col N="1861" /> 1986 and spent two days there with British Nuclear Fuels.  People from the Department of Energy came up from London to meet us, took us around the plant and were quite frank in what they had to say.  On the second evening we were there we were asked to visit a waste management site about seven miles down the road.  While we were at that site we were asked why we were so ready to criticise, to raise issues about nuclear waste and the disposal of nuclear waste &mdash; be it low level or high level &mdash; to query British problems about the disposal of high level waste and their proposals to build under the Irish Sea and to bury in mineshafts, when we were the very people who asked them to dispose of our waste.  They pointed out that Irish nuclear waste was on their site.  That example completely undermined our case if there ever was an example of a case being undermined.  The nuclear waste that comes from our hospitals, universities and from our industries is exported because we do not have our own house in order.  For a modern industrial country that is complete neglect.  It is about time that the present Government, being in a position of authority, got its act together and came up with a comprehensive policy to deal with toxic, chemical and nuclear waste disposal, as well as a policy to deal with more everyday issues relating to the treatmnet and disposal of domestic waste.  As I said, there is no point in Ireland just exporting our problems to Derry and imposing on the people of Derry and Northern Ireland the waste we have down here.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very comprehensive.  But I am worried that, even though it is a Bill of pious platitudes and lofty ideals, there will be no real allocation of resources to implement many of its proposals.  More important, I am concerned that the staff and resources will not be available to enforce many of the powers that the authority will have.  I should like the Minister to assure the House that adequate resources will be made available to carry out the monitoring of our seas, air and countryside.</P>
    <P>When talking about environmental <Col N="1862" /> protection we seem to think immediately of our rivers and our countryside but we tend to neglect the issue of urban decay. Coming from a major urban area, urban decay is something in which I have a particular interest.  The utter neglect and decay taking place in our cities is something that must be faced up to.  At times we seem to be obsessed with and worried about &mdash; and we should have some concern &mdash; keeping our countryside in order lest tourists be frightened away and no longer come.  We think that if we do not keep our rivers and our fields pollution free then we will not be able to sell our foodstuffs and products in the European market.  Much more important than that is the environment in which many of our people live in our cities, especially in our inner cities.  The environmental problems of modern day urban life have not been faced up to.  I hope that the Government at some stage come forward with a comprehensive policy for the urban environment. We must set out to achieve a policy that will bring about healthy living in healthy cities, and I hope that there will be a policy aimed at healthy cities so that we could have an environment in which people can live in a proper way.</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of traffic management in the cities.  Admittedly, the Minister has brought about an improvement in that regard here in Dublin.  I would not exaggerate the improvement achieved last year, because I think the climatic conditions last year were a little better than they were in the previous year.  That contributed to the detectable improvement, but goes beyond smog control.  We must turn our attention to monitoring the unburned hydrocarbons, the benzenes that are products of the traffic congestion in our inner cities.  That is not being done.  Our roads are not being designed or constructed in such a way as to ensure a free flow of traffic within our inner cities, something that should form part of any environmental protection programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indeed happy to be given an opportunity to discuss this problem this afternoon.  First, I want to acknowledge that the Government are making efforts to carry out environmental works, as is evident from the debate which has just been adjourned and launched their environmental action programme on 26 January 1990.  There is provision in that programme for the expenditure of approximately £1,000 million on environmental works.</P>
      <P>I want to raise with the Minister of State a problem which could have very serious consequences if not dealt with.  I refer to the pollution of Monalty Lake, Carrickmacross, which is a water source for the Killany group water scheme, outside Carrickmacross.  The scheme supplies approximately 500 houses in that area.  It does have a filtering bed which, of course, removes solids from the water. However, such filtering bed would not remove harmful chemicals which might be in the water.  Because of that consumers of the water from the lake are vulnerable as any chemical substances finding their way into the lake tend to come through consumers' kitchen taps. There is no need for people to be concerned about it at present because, at this point, the water arriving in the taps is not harmful or of very bad quality, but in recent years, Monaghan County Council &mdash; who act on behalf of the Minister in the monitoring of water quality &mdash; have regularly advised the public that water from that lake should be boiled if used for human consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent months a new threat to that water source has become evident in that the sewage treatment plant operated by Carrickmacross Urban District Council is inadequate for the volume of material it has to treat.  The water from it, which I understand is very high in nutrients, God knows what else &mdash; I would not be familiar with its quality in every respect &mdash; flows into Lough na Glac.  Lough na <Col N="1864" /> Glac is connected by a short tributary to Monalty Lake.  Therefore, one can assume that some polluted waters already form part of the water source of the planned group water scheme.  There is evidence of that in so far as green algae growth appeared this year on the lake, at the end where the tributary enters the lake.  Fortunately for the scheme, the water is being tapped at the other end of the lake.</P>
    <P>This year the Department of the Environment have grant-aided a development at this sewage treatment plant which however, will not increase its capacity. That investment was designed to improve the quality of the effluent.  But I am informed that, even when that is operational &mdash; and the work is almost complete now &mdash; there will still be under-capacity at that plant.  I am asking the Minister to take all these matters into account and assist Carrickmcross Urban District Council to increase the capacity of the plant by grant-aiding it in 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the problems which have affected Monalty Lake.  In 1990 my Department gave a special contribution of £204,000 to the group under the group water schemes programme.  The overall cost of the scheme was £262,000.  Those works were for treatment of raw water, to filter and purify it, so that the drinking water could be of the standard specified. The most recent test carried out of the drinking water from Monalty Lake was on 17 September 1991 and showed that it was of a high standard both in relation to its chemical and bacterial content.</P>
      <P>There have been pollution problems encountered in Carrickmacross.  The treatment plant there is being improved by an additive to remove phosphorous, thereby improving the quality of the water.  In addition, a preliminary report has been approved to improve the capacity of the plant which will eliminate pollution from town sources of water and will allow also for new connections to the treatment plant.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Proposed Reorganisation of Eastern Health Board.</Title>
    <Col N="1865" />
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like the Minister to comment for the record so that we can eliminate once and for all the farce that takes place daily on the Order of Business when what is Government-planned legislation announced outside the House must be raised in the House to enable us to debate these issues.</P>
      <P>Clearly the Government and Minister have committed themselves to restructuring the health services, to replacing the Eastern Health Board with a Dublin regional health authority.</P>
      <P>The reason I sought to raise this matter this evening was to explain to the Minister that the deadline he has set for receipt of submissions, that is Friday, 1 November 1991, is much too early for many, if not all of the hospitals, voluntary and non-voluntary, for the Eastern Health Board along with the large numbers of religious hospitals and so on, and indeed, the voluntary agencies.  For example, the Eastern Health Board only received the Minister's letter of instruction on 1 October 1991.  The board have not met to finalise their submissions and will not meet until 7 November 1991, six days after the deadline set by the Minister.</P>
      <P>As a member of the board of Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, I appreciate, as I am sure will the Minister, that a tremendous amount of thought, consideration, consultation and so on is required for the hospitals and other agencies to fully prepare their responses.  In the course of the Minister's letter of instruction dated 27 September, 1991 to the Eastern Health Board he had this to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the first stage in this consultation process I am now inviting your board to make a written submission in relation to the implementation of the Government decisions which are set out on pages nine and ten of the address.  I should stress that the Government's consideration of the broad principles of the reorganisation is now complete and submissions should concentrate on the issues which you would wish to see taken into <Col N="1866" /> account in preparing the detail of the legislation and the subsequent implementation.</P>
    <P>A lot of work must be undertaken by these hospitals and by the Eastern Health Board to prepare their submissions.  The Minister's proposals are hugely complex and their implications for those involved in administering and delivering the health services are equally complex.  One month is not enough time to analyse the recommendations of the Kennedy group report given that that report is inconclusive and vague in relation to, for example, the type of structure they envisage will replace the health board.  Given that the report, as submitted, envisaged that the Tallaght Hospital would be <i>in situ</i> in one of the five management areas, it must be extremely difficult for people to know how to make their submissions to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give a commitment that he will extend the 1 November closing date for receipt of submissions so that the recommendation's can be properly analysed and there can be more consultation by those who will be affected by their implementation.  As I have said, nobody knows how the regional board will be structured or who will be on the five management boards. Information on the subsequent districts which will be set up under the new structure is also very vague.  No matter what structure is set up, I think politicians from all political parties will demand proper and full public representation on the boards.  In order that everyone will have an opportunity to make their submissions I ask the Minister to extend the 1 November closing date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I announced the Government's plans for the reorganisation of the health services in the Eastern Health Board area on 18 September last.  Legislation will be necessary to provide for a single new authority to replace the Eastern Health Board.  The new authority will be responsible for all health and social services in their area of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next phase of the consultation process has now been initiated following the <Col N="1867" /> announcement of the Government's decision.  My Department have written to 133 organisations inviting them to make written submissions.  I have asked them to try to have their submissions in relation to the issues of detail I have outlined above sent in by 1 November next.  It will take time to process the many submissions I expect to receive and any which arrive after that date will also be accepted.  I am aware that the Eastern Health Board will consider the matter at a special meeting on 7 November.  Of course, we will take their views into account when we receive them in the Department.</P>
    <P>I believe the timescale is acceptable.  It is a question of balance.  Deputies opposite often come in here and accuse us of prevarication and not moving rapidly enough.  The recommendations of the Kennedy group have been available for a long time and I am sure have been studied by all the interested agencies. Indeed many of them were represented on the hospital side during the Kennedy group review.  It is a question of balance between trying to move on with the legislation &mdash; I am anxious that we move ahead with it &mdash; and ensuring that people have the opportunity for proper consultation. Of course, the receipt of these submissions will not in any way mean the end of the consultation process.  Consultation will be ongoing with the various interests concerned, both in the context of the finalisation of the proposal and also their subsequent implementation.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Deputy that we will respect the voluntary status of a number of the agencies.  I respect the contribution they have made to health care and it is the Government's intention that their voluntary status will be respected.  As the Deputy knows, the services will be administered through five administrative areas, two on the north side and three on the south side.  I would not like the Deputy to make out that it is more complex than it really is.  This will be a management authority which will manage all health and social services in the Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow areas.  At present we are spending £500 million on such services, £231 million of which is paid <Col N="1868" /> by the Eastern Health Board.  The new authority will be responsible for the management and administration of all the services, having regard to the voluntary status of a number of agencies.</P>
    <P>From the very start of this review of structures I have insisted on the widest possible consultation and this will continue to be the case until the new arrangements are in place.  The deadline for written submissions, while flexible, is necessary if we are to maintain progress. As I have explained, these submissions represent only one aspect of a long process of consultation.  I firmly believe it is important that those who will be affected by the reform, especially the voluntary agencies, are fully involved in it and understand what we are hoping to achieve.  In this way I believe that it will meet with their full support and co-operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity of raising this serious matter on the appointment of a 15th assistant teacher to St. Mary's primary school, Mullingar.  I am somewhat disappointed that my constituency colleague, the Minister for Education, is not present this evening to reply to the debate, but nonetheless I welcome the Minister of State.  Deputy Treacy, whom I am sure will give me a favourable response.</P>
      <P>The opening paragraph of a letter recently sent by the Department of Education to the chairman of the board of management of this school stated:</P>
      <P>It has been brought to the Department's attention that a number of irregular practices are currently evident in your school.</P>
      <P>That is strong language to use about a school which has such an impeccable record.  The Christian Brothers have provided education at that school for approximately 150 years.  Indeed, it is strong language to use about any school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Departmental rules for teacher appointments indicate that if there are 485 pupils or more enrolled in a school <Col N="1869" /> on 30 September 1990 then the board of management can make such an appointment with the automatic approval of the Department.  One can imagine the disappointment and frustration of the board of management in this instance when they were informed by the payments section of the Department of Education that ten pupils were not validly registered as pupils of this school.  On making inquiries of the Department, the board of management were informed that ten children who had spent their earlier years in other schools could not be enrolled validly in St. Mary's primary school.  I believe from the volume of letters which the Minister subsequently received that she is aware of the level of disgust among the parents of these children who now wonder why their children are considered to be illegal aliens in this school.</P>
    <P>This, of course, begs several questions. Were these children insured for the year they attended St. Mary's school?  Why did the Department of Education pay capitation grants for these children?  Why did the Minister's Department say that ten children who repeated sixth class last year were invalidly enrolled when 23 children had repeated sixth class?  I should point out that this is the fifth year there has been a repeat sixth class in the school. Were the registrations during those years also invalid?  Department of Education inspectors visited this school on many occasions during that period and have spoken very positively about this class. The school had a major inspection in June of this year and got a glowing report.</P>
    <P>If parents wish their children to repeat a class in primary school their teachers endorse that application, the principal concurs and there is written evidence of all these factors.  Can the Minister for Education overrule the wishes of the parents and teachers?  By taking such action against the wishes of the parents and teachers is the Minister not curtailing the constitutional rights and duties of parents to provide the best possible education for their children?</P>
    <P>What criteria did the Department use to arrive at this decision?  Did she take into account the knowledge of the parents, the teachers, school reports and so on, or was her decision based purely on <Col N="1870" /> a financial consideration?  I am sure the Minister of State, will quote Circular 10/67 and say it is not normal that children should repeat in primary school.  I am not saying it is normal that they should repeat.  These are extraordinary circumstances where it is the wish of the parents and the teachers that children should repeat.  Surely that must take precedence over everything else.</P>
    <P>I wish to inform the Minister of State that the INTO made repeated representations in this case and in relation to the school.  They take a very serious view of the fact that these children are declared invalidly enrolled.</P>
    <P>What are the thoughts of the Department of Education in relation to repeat sixth class?  Recently, some senior departmental inspectors indicated that repeat sixth class is the most important class in primary schools.  Indeed, it would be interesting to hear the comments of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the principal of a secondary school, about the standard of pupil he would get into a second level school who repeated sixth class.  Finally, I call on the Minister to sanction immediately the appointment of the assistant teacher to CBS, Mullingar.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous school year.  This has been standard practice for many years and is in accordance with the agreement on staffing made between the Government and the Irish National Teachers' Organisation. The staffing of Scoil Mhuire, CBS, Mullingar for the 1990-91 school year was a principal, 14 assistants and a full-time remedial teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school authorities applied for sanction to appoint an additional assistant for the 1991-92 school year, based upon the enrolment in the school of 489 pupils on 30 September 1990.  A valid enrolment of at least 485 was required on 30 September 1990 in order to qualify for <Col N="1871" /> the appointment of a fifteenth assistant as and from 1 September 1991.</P>
    <P>The Department requested a report from the district inspector, An tUasal Éamon Ó Breacáin, in order to consider the school's request for an additional appointment.  The inspector's report drew attention to a number of pupils, 20 in all, who were repeating sixth standard in the national school.  Ten pupils had completed sixth standard in this school, while ten others had completed sixth standard in other schools in the area. All these pupils were repeating at their parents' request, on the basis that some were weak academically, while others were considered immature.</P>
    <P>The Department operate a policy of discounting from valid enrolment pupils who are repeating sixth standard, unless those pupils are repeating for exceptional reasons, for example, where a child has missed a large part of the school year through illness or otherwise.</P>
    <P>It has been traditional and regular that the Department of Education have repeatedly emphasised to boards of management and principal teachers by means of Circulars 15/89, 8/90, 15/91 and, most recently, 32/91, the need to keep retention of pupils to a minimum, and that retention of pupils in sixth standard, should only take place in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>The policy on the promotion of pupils in national schools was originally set out in Circulars 10/67 and 15/89.</P>
    <P>The normal procedure should be that a pupil is promoted to a higher standard at the end of each school year.  This is to ensure that all children should have the opportunity of having three years post-primary education before reaching the minimum school leaving age.  There may be cases, however, where the principal teacher considers that a pupil would benefit educationally by being held back for a second year in a class.  In regard to such cases it is felt that, by reference to educational principles, they should be minimal; that no pupil should be held back for longer than one year throughout his or her national school career and that usually the retention of a pupil in a class <Col N="1872" /> for a second year should take place only in the third or fourth standard.</P>
    <P>In regard to pupils who have completed sixth standard in a national school it would be in accordance with accepted practice that they transfer to a post-primary school.  Only in exceptional circumstances will such pupils, if retained in a national school, be considered to be validly enrolled for staffing and other purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>These are exceptional circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of opinion.  In line with this policy the Department refused to sanction the appointment of an additional assistant to Scoil Mhuire in the 1991-92 school year.</P>
      <P>Another report was requested from the district inspector, in relation to the enrolment in the school in September of this year.  An tUsail Ó Breacháin's report again drew attention to the fact that the school has 15 pupils repeating sixth standard this year, four of whom had completed sixth standard in the school and 11 had transferred into the school from other schools to repeat.  This class of 15 repeat pupils is being taught by the principal teacher, Br. Crummy.</P>
      <P>The Department wrote to the chairperson of the school, Br. P. Mac-Aoghain, on 14 October regarding irregularities in the school system of pupil promotion.  It was pointed out to the chairperson, first, that the curriculum of a primary school is designed as an eight year programme with provision for an infant programme of approximately two years followed by six years in standards one to six; second, the syllabus for each component of the curriculum is drafted to give the greatest possible degree of flexibility in selecting programmes best suited to the needs of individual pupils and schools.</P>
      <P>The board of management of Scoil Mhuire CBS has been requested to discontinue the practice of enrolling pupils in a repeat sixth class, and to furnish to the Department of Education, in writing, details of the school's enrolment policy. This is presently awaited in the Department of Education.</P>

      <Col N="1873" /> I should like to inform the Deputy and the House that the excellent Deputy from his constituency, who happens to be Minister for Education, would be here to take this debate were it not for the fact that she is involved in very detailed Government business to ensure that maximum resources are available for the continued expansion of the great educational programme over which she presides.</P>

      <P>Sadly, Tubbercurry vocational school has closed.  It may not be closed officially, the doors may not be locked, but the end has come for it as a second level school.  The first thing I must do, as a Dáil Deputy and a native of that area, is to pay tribute to the great work of Tubbercurry Tech., as we knew it.  For many years, for many people, it provided the only possibility of post-primary education. These were tough times and this was in an area that suffered the worst emigration in the country.  The school, with a dedicated staff, eased the way for many people.  However, the recent drop off in numbers in the school, clearly indicated some change had to be made.  That is accepted by all.  What is not accepted by the students, by the parents, by the people of Tubbercurry is the manner in which the change came, two weeks into the school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the students back in the classes for two weeks, with all the back-up arrangements on transport and otherwise made by the parents and with the school firmly settled down for the year, they were told of the closure, that the pupils would be bussed to Ballymote vocational school.  Any fair-minded person will accept that this was intolerable.  How did it happen?  If there was to be a closure why was it not notified in June or July? The best alternatives could then be explored as there was plenty of time to do so.  County Sligo Vocational Education <Col N="1874" /> Committee say they had applied for the extra funding then to keep Tubbercurry school open for the year but this was not dealt with in time.  I am sure the Minister will tell us the Department's story.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister what extra funding would have been needed to keep Tubbercurry open for the year?  What are the extra costs involved in the alternatives put in place, with pupils going to the Marist Convent in Tubbercurry and being bussed to Ballymote and to Swinford?</P>
    <P>The students, the parents and the people of Tubbercurry would like to hear the Minister say why, in view of the circumstances with the school opened for two weeks, it was not possible for her to provide the extra funding needed for this year.  Obviously, the County Sligo Vocational Education Committee had expected this.  Indeed, why was the situation allowed to develop into the school year &mdash; which is the big complaint in the first place?  Also, what of the future of Tubbercurry vocational school?  Will the woodwork and metalwork facilities be available in future years to other pupils? Would the Minister consider starting special classes there for boys and girls whose preferred option would not be second level education?  In view of the unemployment levels and the traditionally high emigration are there any special plans for day time adult education there, perhaps on a pilot basis, for people with particular needs?</P>
    <P>Are there any plans for the continuation of the provision of practical subjects and new technology?  With some imaginative and innovative ideas and with the availability of the excellent school facilities down there, now abandoned, perhaps something of significant value for people in the Tubbercurry area and indeed for the whole western area could emerge.  I would like to hear the Minister's ideas on this.  I know that the Minister of State will say that the Minister is involved in detailed work for the expansion of education.  I am afraid that it is too late for Tubbercurry Vocational School and I know that this is something like locking the stable door after the horse has bolted.  In view of its extraordinarily fine reputation when it was the <Col N="1875" /> only second level institution available to boys in that area for many years and in view of the excellent work it did, it is at least entitled to a decent obituary in Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>I would not like to preside over the obituary of any school but I appreciate the concern of the Deputy and his colleagues in Sligo who raised this matter on a number of occasions.  We must all agree that in modern times there is equality of opportunity prevailing not alone for the children of the nation but for the schools of the nation in the level of services, the range of subjects and the modern technological opportunities that they provide for our children.  This new opportunity brings about a need to have a consensus about what is best to serve the educational needs of any area.  There are two post primary schools in Tubbercurry &mdash; a secondary school conducted by the Marist Sisters and a vocational school operating under the aegis of the County Sligo Vocational Education Committee.  The secondary school had an enrolment of 218 pupils in 1990/91 and the figure for the vocational school was 44 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education's main role in relation to the vocational education committees is to allocate financial and teaching resources to them.  The teaching staff resources are allocated for the scheme as a whole and the assignment of teachers to individual schools is a matter for the County Sligo Vocational Education Committee and its chief executive officer.  In a press release dated 13 September 1991 County Sligo Vocational Education Committee indicated that alternative provisions for the Tubbercurry vocational school pupils had been made following consultation with <Col N="1876" /> the parents.  The junior cycle pupils were to be transported to the vocational school in Ballymote ten miles away and the senior cycle pupils would continue with their technical subjects in the vocational school but would be served for other subjects through a co-operation arrangement with the Marist secondary school in Tubbercurry.  That is a very commendable arrangement.  Our real regret is that the students had been enrolled and only informed two weeks into the term that the school was to be closed.  The Minister met the parents and community council representatives on a visit to Sligo some time ago regarding this matter.</P>
    <P>Prior notification of the Vocational Education Committee's decision was not received in the Department of Education. The Minister was concerned at the timing of the decision and questioned the need to transport the pupils to Ballymote. She arranged for officials to discuss the matter with the chairman and chief executive officer of the Vocational Education Committee and subsequently with the authorities of the Marist convent. Following consideration of the officials reports, the parents of the pupils in question were offered the following options: enrolment in the Marist Convent School, Tubbercurry, or transport provided by County Sligo Vocational Education Committee to attend Ballymote vocational school.  We are satisfied that these options adequately meet the educational needs of the pupils.  The Minister for Education and her Department are very pleased that a local solution was possible in this case and are confident that the education opportunities prevailing for the pupils in the Sligo area will be reinforced and expanded in the years ahead and that no pupil will suffer as a result of the changes.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 4, 16, 52 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that the Tallaght Hospital project, costing an estimated £118 million, is the largest health capital project ever proposed in this country.  I have previously informed the Deputies that the construction period involved is about four years, following which a further period of about 18 months would be required for commissioning. It is estimated that £5 million would be required in the first year of construction of the project, the remaining cost falling to be met in the subsequent four and a half years.</P>
      <P>In relation to the commencement of work on this project, the position is that the total capital allocation available to my Department for 1991 did not allow for the commencement of the Tallaght project in 1991.  However, as I have indicated on several occasions, I will be considering the development of the Tallaght Hospital project in the context of the capital resources available to my Department in 1992 and subsequent years.</P>

      <P>I am aware that concerns have been expressed that figures in relation to certain notifiable diseases published by my Department were at variance with figures reported to the Department.</P>
      <P>This difficulty has arisen because there are two systems of reporting tuberculosis:</P>
      <P>(i)  My Department circulates to all directors of community care and the medical press a quarterly summary of the number of cases of tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, which are notified by individual directors, to the Department on a weekly basis.  An annual summary of these returns of infectious diseases is also compiled;</P>
      <P>(ii)  The second system of reporting is a separate annual system of notification of tuberculosis alone which has been in operation since the late 1940s when TB was a very serious public health problem in this country.</P>
      <P>The difficulty which has arisen stems from the fact that some directors of community care have not been notifying tuberculosis in their weekly infectious disease returns.</P>
      <P>In fact no case of tuberdulosis was notified for the Dublin area in the weekly returns for 1990 and this was reflected in the quarterly and annual summaries on infectious diseases.  The figure of 157 cases of tuberculosis which has been referred to was in fact an annual return for 1989 and not 1990 and is the figure included in the separate annual report on tuberculosis.  Annual figures for tuberculosis for 1990 are curently being compiled from the separate tuberculosis system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1784" /> In view of the difficulty which has arisen and in order to ensure that tuberculosis is notified weekly as well as annually, and thus included in the quarterly summaries of infectious diseases, a circular letter has issued to all directors of community care on the matter.</P>

      <P>A wide range of statistics are collected at both national and health board level which serve as measures of the health status of the population.  These include, for example, statistics on life expectancy, death rates from specific causes, infant mortality rates, outcome of child health examinations, incidence of infectious diseases, the uptake of specific schemes and services.  These statistics are used in the planning of services and also provide an input to the development of strategies for health promotion.</P>
      <P>Information on the health status of a regional population is vital in the development of health services and especially in planning, implementing and evaluating health promotion strategies. The factors which influence health are complex.  They involve a broad range of issues including demographic features of a population, e.g. age, sex, employment, education, housing and environmental factors.  The development of measures of health status at regional level is currently taking place involving the Mid-Western Health Board and my Department's health promotion unit.  This pilot project will develop an approach to measuring health status for specific use in planning and implementing health promotion strategies aimed at maintaining and improving health.  The feasibility of replicating this approach will also form part of this pilot project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1785" /> Important survey work is also a common feature of the Kilkenny health project, a community pilot project for cardiovascular disease prevention.  A baseline survey of factors associated with coronary heart disease &mdash; e.g. cholesterol levels, hypertension, smoking prevalence, weight and exercise levels &mdash; was conducted in 1985 and subsequently in a reference county.  A major health promotion project in Kilkenny commenced following this baseline survey which aimed at reducing the risk factors of coronary heart disease among the population in Kilkenny.  A follow up independent survey in Kilkenny and in the reference county is nearing completion which will measure changes in behaviour and in factors associated with coronary heart disease over the five year pilot period.  The Kilkenny health project is largely funded by the health promotion unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's contention that there is a lack of incentives for encouraging preventive medicine in the revised GMS contract.  The provisions of the new contract are specifically intended to encourage general practitioners to fulfil their key role in health promotion and preventive medicine.  The replacement of the fee per item of service by a comprehensive capitation rate system encourages a volume of activity in GMS practice which allows more time for individual consultations.  This facilitates the giving of advice to patients on lifestyle factors affecting the health of the patient.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the key role of the GP in promoting healthy lifestyles the health promotion unit in my Department have developed an anti-smoking programme for use in general practice. Weight loss materials are included as part of the programme.  The programme pack is being disseminated to general practitioners at present and will have reached all GP's in the GMS by mid-November.</P>
      <P>On a wider front, officers of the health boards who have health promotion as part of their remit liaise on an ongoing basis with general practitioners in the promotion of healthy lifestyles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in so far as my Department are concerned is as follows: In relation to job-sharing, every applicant has been matched with a job-sharing partner either within the Department or in another suitable Department since the commencement of the scheme.  The total number of staff job-sharing in my Department at present is 11.  The numbers by grade are one higher executive officer, two executive officers, two clerical officers and six clerical assistants.</P>
      <P>In relation to career breaks, a total of 87 applications have been received since the commencement of the scheme. Eighty two applications were granted and five were refused on the grounds that those applying did not fulfil the requirements of the Department of Finance circular. The grades involved in the career breaks granted are 60 clerical staff, 21 middle management and management grades and three professional staff.  The grades involved in the refusal of career breaks are four clerical staff and one member of middle management staff.</P>
      <P>As regards the health boards, voluntary hospitals and other health agencies, the Deputy will appreciate that each such body is a separate employing authority with a substantial degree of autonomy in relation to satisfying its staffing needs within the employment ceiling, budgetary and operational constraints set by my Department.  In operating the job sharing and career breaks schemes, local managers must, of course, ensure that services can continue to operate efficiently.  The health service, which involves a wide range of very specific skills, poses a particular challenge in this regard and on occasion the exigencies of the service demand the continued employment of the applicant in the particular post concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of providing for greater flexibility in relation to the job sharing scheme is a matter for the Minister for Finance to decide upon.  I am not aware <Col N="1794" /> that there are any proposals for extending the scheme.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the Health Research Board's recently published report on the surveillance of congenital anomalies in the Eastern Health Board region for the period 1980 to 1987.</P>
      <P>This report was prepared by the Health Research Board in connection with their participation in EUROCAT, an EC concerted action programme which compiles information on a range of congenital anomalies, including Down's Syndrome, from 18 individual registries throughout Europe.</P>
      <P>In interpreting the EUROCAT findings it is important to take into account that the risk of having a Down's Syndrome baby increases with the age of motherhood.  As Ireland has a relatively high proportion of births to mothers aged over 35 years, the incidence of the syndrome would be expected to be higher than in countries where the pattern of age at motherhood is different.</P>
      <P>However, EUROCAT also provides data on the incidence of the syndrome in each maternal age group in respect of the individual registries.  Data from these show that the prevalence rates by maternal age group of Down's Syndrome in the Eastern Health Board region are not particularly high.  For example, in the age group for mothers less than 20 years, the Eastern Health Board rate &mdash; 4.3 per 10,000 births &mdash; was exceeded by ten of the 18 registries providing information. In the age group for mothers older than 40 years, the Eastern Health Board rate of 150.8 per 10,000 births was exceeded by five of the 18 registries.</P>
      <P>My Department's health promotion unit publishes material on preparing for pregnancy.  This information is being updated at present.  The new version will advise prospective mothers that the risk of having a Down's Syndrome baby increases with the age of the mother.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 48, 68, 70 and 116 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have agreed that I should prepare legislation, which I hope to have before this House next year, to put in place a single new authority to replace the Eastern Health Board.  The new authority will be responsible for all health and personal social services in the Eastern Health Board area and will provide those services either through their own agencies or through voluntary agencies which they will fund directly.  I would <Col N="1797" /> like to stress that the role of the voluntary sector will be respected under the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>The board of the new authority, the membership of which will include elected public representatives, will be responsible for determining broad service objectives and for representing community views to me.</P>
    <P>The principal objectives of the reforms are to achieve greater co-ordination between hospital and community services and a clearer assignment of accountability and tighter financial control within the organisation.  The reforms will facilitate the shift from hospital/institutional-based care to community care which is a part of the new Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>I am broadly happy with the number of boards in the rest of the country. However, I believe that the differing roles and responsibilities of the boards, the chief executive officers and the various other agencies need to be clarified and I will be taking this into account in preparing the legislation.</P>
    <P>I have initiated a comprehensive consultation process with the relevant interests, following which I will be finalising the details of the new administrative structures.  The question of the most appropriate method of funding the different services, including national specialities, will be considered as part of this process.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Tallaght Hospital development, the position is that the capital allocation available to my Department for 1991 does not allow for the commencement of the project in 1991. However, as I have inidcated on several occasions, I will be considering the development of the Tallaght Hospital project in the context of the capital resources available to my Department in 1992 and subsequent years.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the community care service has been severely curtailed in County Kerry.  In 1988 the report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; Services for the Elderly</i> was published.  One of the main recommendations of the report was the establishment of district care teams for the elderly.  In 1990 and 1991 the Government made an additional £8 million available to the health boards to implement the recommendations of the report.  The Southern Health Board received just over £1.25 million of this money and a substantial proportion of this money has gone to develop services for the elderly in Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the aid of this special funding, the Southern Health Board have set up five district care teams in County Kerry. <Col N="1799" /> These teams are headed by district liaison nurses supported by 34 public health nurses in the districts.  In addition to those nurses, the equivalent of three full-time State registered nurses are being employed on a part-time basis to give a nursing service outside normal working hours.  An extra home help supervisor has also been appointed with a further 148 part-time home helps being employed under the scheme.  The Southern Health Board have also made additional funding by way of section 65 grants available to voluntary organisations to improve and develop the services to the elderly.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the community care services in County Kerry are being enhanced as a result of this special funding.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the health boards are well aware of their statutory duties under the Adoption Act, 1991, and that they have been taking appropriate steps to fulfil those duties.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that any health board personnel are discouraging couples from adopting abroad.  If the Deputy has details of such cases, I will, on receipt of this information from him, make inquiries regarding these cases with the relevant health boards.</P>
      <P>What I am aware of is that the detailed guidelines issued to health boards and registered adoption societies by the Adoption Board, which have a central role in the administration of the legislation, emphasise that part of the assessment process must involve counselling and advising the proposed adopters on the complexities and potential hazards of inter-country adoption.  This is a perfectly sensible approach to an extremely complex matter.  It is clearly desirable that any person or couple contemplating adopting a child abroad must be made aware of the possible pitfalls involved in order to ensure that their decision to adopt is a fully-informed decision.  An adoption agency which omitted to do this would be failing in their responsibilities towards the proposed adopters.</P>
      <P>The detailed information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department in respect of all the health boards.  I have made arrangements for the information to be collected from the health boards and I will forward it to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Regulations governing the labelling of medicinal products are laid down in the Medical Preparations (Advertisement and Sale) Regulations, 1958.  These regulations set out in detail the information that must be contained on the labelling and packaging of medicines.  In addition to these statutory requirements, further specific requirements may be stipulated in the terms of the product authorisation granted for any individual product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also proposals for an EC Council Directive in relation to the labelling of medicinal products.  Consideration <Col N="1806" /> of these proposals is at an advanced stage and when adopted the provisions will be fully incorporated into our own statutory regulations.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the present combination of statutory requirements, together with the specific requirements of product authorisations, are together sufficiently adequate to ensure that ample information is contained in the labelling or packaging, which, when correctly followed, will ensure the safe handling of such medicines.</P>
    <P>The controls on medicines, including labelling requirements, are matters that are kept under continuous review both within my Department and by the National Drugs Advisory Board, which have a particular responsibility to advise me on these matters.  Following the recent reports relating to paracetamol poisoning I asked that the NDAB should review current labelling requirements of medicines containing paracetamol.  The board however, are of the view that present labelling requirements are adequate but would emphasise the need for people to read instructions carefully and to follow the directions given.</P>
    <P>I would stress the importance of the need to treat all medicines with the greatest of care and respect.  Medicines should only be taken in accordance with the advice of one's doctor or, in the case of self-medication, be taken strictly in accordance with the instructions provided. I would also draw attention to the possible dangers that may arise as a result of mixing medicines.  Expert advice on the proper use of any medicine is readily available from one's pharmacist or doctor and where there are any doubts whatsoever such advice should be sought.</P>

      <P>Because of the special allocation of £3 million for dental services which the Government made available in the 1991 budget, I was able to make an additional allocation for orthodontic treatments available to the Western Health Board which enabled the board, <i>inter alia,</i> to bring a further 115 secondary care orthodontic cases into treatment in the current year.  The board have now a total of 317 cases undergoing treatment during 1991. This is a significant improvement on the position in previous years.</P>
      <P>Despite the progress made, however, there are still 15 children in category A, which is the category of greatest severity, and a total of about 1,800 children in other categories on the waiting list and I have asked the board to draw up a programme to deal with these cases on a priority basis as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The average waiting period for cataract operations is two years and there are currently 560 patients awaiting cataract surgery.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the admission of a patient to hospital for treatment is a matter for the hospital authority and the consultant in charge of the case.  Waiting lists are kept under regular review and priority is given to urgent cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> Should any patient feel that their condition has deteriorated, they should contact their general practitioner who will be in the best position to stress the urgency of the case to the consultant concerned.</P>
    <P>There are currently 1,638 adults on waiting lists for dental treatment.  The waiting list in counties Galway and Mayo is approximately two to three months.</P>
    <P>The waiting list in Roscommon is currently under review.  Emergency treatment is available to persons who require it.</P>

      <P>In 1988, the National Council for the Elderly, an advisory body to my Department, undertook a study entitled The Caring Process &mdash; A Study of Carers in the Home.  This study provided information for the first time on family members caring for elderly relatives.  It estimated that somewhere in the region of 66,000 elderly people were at least partially dependent on help and required some level of care.  Furthermore it estimated that 50,000 of these were cared for from within the home &mdash; by family carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> is the first official report to recommend comprehensive measures to assist carers of the elderly. The report emphasised the importance of additional day care places and respite facilities to offer carers a break from <Col N="1813" /> caring during the day or for short and regular periods of time.</P>
    <P>The Years Ahead report has been accepted by the Government as policy towards the elderly.  The Government have made an additional £8 million available to implement the recommendations of the report dealing with the expansion of home nursing and home help services and of facilities for the elderly in the community.  These funds have enabled health boards to recruit additional public health nurses, general nurses working in the community, home helps and home care attendants.  They have been able to provide additional day care centres, respite places and extended care beds. Each health board provides respite services and my Department will continue to encourage boards to extend these facilities.</P>
    <P>My Department recently circulated copies of the Charter for Carers prepared by the Soroptomists to each health board, asking them to take the charter into account in preparing their plans to implement fully the recommendations of The Years Ahead as provided for in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <P>The group's second report deals with the organisational structures in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>Sotos Syndrome is an extremely rare condition of genetic origin which involves abnormalities of the central nervous system, mental retardation, accelerated bone growth especially in infancy and other abnormal features.  The information on the number of sufferers in the country is not readily available and I will let the Deputy have the information when it comes to hand.</P>
      <P>There is no definitive treatment for the condition itself and management of affected children relates mainly to the control of complications such as increased incidence of febrile convulsions. Treatment would be provided through the general practitioners, paediatric and general hospital services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no laboratory or other tests which are specific to the diagnosis of this condition.  Identification of children suffering from the condition is essentially <Col N="1817" /> based on the recognition by a paediatrician of the clinical features mentioned above presented together in such a way as to indicate the presence of the syndrome.</P>
    <P>Genetic counselling services are largely provided in paediatric hospitals and paediatric units and in obstetric hospitals and units throughout the country.  In addition, genetic screening and testing facilities are available in the major university hospitals.  I established a special committee to examine and recommend how an adequate medical genetics service should be organised.  This special committee have submitted their report to me, and this is currently being examined in my Department.</P>

      <P>I confirm that I have received representations in this matter and I have taken up the issue with the Revenue Commissioners.  They have informed me that all employees referred to &mdash; in both the health-social services and education-library services &mdash; are not regarded by the UK authorities as rendering services to the Government of the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland or to a local authority in the United Kingdom as required by Article 18 (2) of the Irish-UK double taxation treaty.  Accordingly the exemption from Irish tax under the provisions of that Article does not apply.</P>
      <P>Until recently, the Irish Revenue Commissioners granted exemption to employees of the education and library boards.  Following confirmation from the UK authorities that the position is as outlined above, the exemption given in respect of these employees has been withdrawn. Consequently there is now no difference in the tax treatment of employees of the various employments referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that while employees in these circumstances who are resident in this State would be liable to tax in both jurisdictions, credit is allowed here, under the Ireland/UK double taxation treaty, for tax paid in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Payment of the first instalment of the ewe premium commenced on 31 July, only nine days after the publication by the EC of Ireland's new disadvantaged areas.  It was not possible in that short period of time to make all the necessary arrangements to pay the additional premium to the new flockowners who would benefit, without delaying the general payment of the premium. The additional payment will be made to the flockowners entitled thereto with the third and final instalment of the 1991 ewe premium.</P>
      <P>It had originally been hoped to make these payments to applicants in the new disadvantaged areas with their second instalment of 1991 premium.  However, in the light of the income difficulties facing sheep producers, I successfully negotiated with the EC Commission arrangements whereby it became possible to pay that instalment earlier than had been intended.  It would not have been possible to make those early payments if the adjustments consequent upon the extension of the disadvantaged areas had to be made simultaneously.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the registrar of companies that, in the normal course, having followed certain procedures and believing that the company was no longer trading, the registrar struck off the name of the company to which the Deputy refers and the company was dissolved by notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on 29 June 1990.  Since incorporation in 1985, the company had failed to submit an annual return as required under the Companies Acts.  I understand that the company's solicitor contacted the registrar in July 1991.  Once the company fulfils its legal obligation to submit returns, there are procedures to restore it to the register. I am informed that these returns are still outstanding.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 to 104 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in order to answer Dáil questions concerning Garda matters, it is necessary to consult the Garda authorities and necessary for them, in turn, to divert gardaí and other staff from their normal duties to compile the information required from various records.  A similar position obtains on the prisons side.  A number of Garda and prison service personnel may be engaged in preparing material, depending on the nature of the question and the time available to answer it.  To compile the very detailed and extensive range of information sought by the Deputy in these questions would require the commitment of Garda and prison resources to an extent which would be quite disproportionate and would not be warranted.</P>

      <P>General practitioners are granted entry to the GMS scheme on the basis of one of the following:</P>
      <P>(1)  Open competition for vacancies that arise;</P>
      <P>(2)  Open competition for posts of assistant with a view to partnership;</P>
      <P>(3)  Doctors who have established themselves in whole-time general practice prior to 1 January 1989 are granted right-of-entry on completion of five years continuous practice in the one location.</P>
      <P>Doctors applying for positions under (1) or (2) above must have the following experience.</P>
      <P>(a)  Six months experience in full-time general practice.  The six months need not be continuous but must be in full-time general practice.  Experience gained in short term locums, in a locum bureau or in employment otherwise than as a full-time general practitioner is not reckonable towards the aggregate of the six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  Periods of six months hospital experience in each of any three of the following specialities, or three months in the case of participants in a recognised vocational training scheme, accident and emergency medicine or general surgery, general medicine, geriatric medicine, obstetrics and/or <Col N="1830" /> gynaecology, paediatrics and psychiatry. All entrants should have at least six months in either general medicine or paediatrics.</P>
    <P>These arrangements have been the subject of negotiations and agreement between successive Ministers for Health and the Irish Medical Organisation since the inception of the scheme.</P>
    <P>All doctors, including doctors who have served in the Permanent Defence Forces, are entitled to apply for entry to the scheme if they meet the requirements. However, Army medical service, in itself, is not taken into account in determining eligibility for right-of-entry to the scheme under (3) above.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Irish Medical Organisation are at present discussing the arrangements for entry to the GMS and I will write to the Deputy when these discussions are completed.</P>

In line with the recommendations contained in a report by Comhairle na nOspidéal, Beaumont is proceeding to fill its complement of six consultant neurosurgery posts, one to replace a post formerly located at St. Vincent's Hospital, the other to replace a consultant post with special interest in paediatric neurosurgery at Beaumont Hospital.

The decision with regard to when a patient will have his/her operation performed is a matter for the consultant concerned and the Deputy will appreciate that it is not a matter in which I have any involvement.  However, I understand from Beaumont Hospital that the patient was to be admitted to the day ward on 8 October 1991.  Unfortunately, his admission had to be cancelled due to the high level of emergency admissions to the hospital on that date, which I am sure the Deputy will realise must take precedence.</P>

      <P>A development plan for the acute hospitals in the Mid-Western Health Board region was adopted by the board in March 1988. The plan provided for 70 in-patient beds and six day care beds at Ennis General Hospital.  Following a review of the matter, this was subsequently increased to 78 in-patient and six day care beds.  In conjunction with the establishment of a consultant-led geriatric service, work is presently in progress on developing a ten-bed acute assessment unit at the hospital, which will increase the bed complement to 88 in-patient beds plus six day care beds &mdash; a total of 94 beds altogether.</P>

      <P>Arising out of negotiations following submission of the National Development Plan 1989-93 to the EC Commission on 22 March 1989 the Commission agreed that subject to the results of a feasibility study, investments in sea and air freight services might be considered.</P>
      <P>The access transport study, completed in July 1990 by KPMG Stokes Kennedy Crowley on behalf of the Irish Government and the EC Commission, found that while investment in internal transport facilities was necessary, it was not sufficient to cater for Ireland's unique peripherality problems.  Substantial additional investment in access transport services was needed.</P>
      <P>In the Operational Programme on Peripherality published in November 1990, the Irish Government and EC Commission undertook to examine the conclusions of the study and possibilities for co-financing by the community of the access transport investment measures identified by the consultants.</P>
      <P>Following detailed consideration of the consultants' findings by a high-level interdepartmental group, I made a formal application on behalf of the Government on 27 May 1991, for EC grant aid for mobile assets.  Both myself and the Minister for the Marine have had formal meetings with the relevant Commissioners to advance our application and seek a quick decision.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1838" /> Officials of both our Departments have been in constant contact with EC officials dealing with the matter.  The Commission has informed us that they hope to give a decision on our application by the end of November.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I Line, Irish Continental Group and all other relevant parties in the Irish shipping industry have been kept advised of developments in relation to Ireland's submission.</P>
