      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 2, 3, 7, 8 and 9.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that all proceedings on Nos. 7, 8 and 9 shall be brought to a conclusion, if not previously concluded, at 12 noon, 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. respectively by one question in each case.</P>
      <P>If a division is demanded today, such division shall be taken at 8.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 19 June 1991.</P>

      <P>In relation to item No. 9, the motion regarding the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which it is proposed to conclude at 5 p.m., that effectively means that it starts at 1 p.m. and concludes at 5 p.m., giving something around two hours to the debate on a crucial renewal of the sections of the Criminal Justice Act which should require a major debate in this House because they touch on fairly crucial areas of the rights of the accused in relation to how they are treated in Garda stations and in court.  In the absence of a committee on crime this House should be enabled to have a debate on the issues surrounding these sections.  Therefore I <Col N="1870" /> am opposing the guillotine on item No. 9.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, can I have an opportunity to endeavour to persuade the Chair that this is in order on the Order of Business?  The Taoiseach gave a promise that he would have a <Col N="1872" /> debate on this matter of EC affairs in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking, in view of the imminence of the Summit and the important issues that are now arising in the European Community affecting the livelihoods of people here, will the Taoiseach agree to have this debate before he goes to the Luxembourg Summit so that he can have the views of all the Members of this House on these crucial matters affecting the livelihoods of people here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the promised debate on EC matters, the Minister for Finance had a meeting with three other EC members, the poorer countries, on Monday last.  It appears that their efforts have been rather unsuccessful, given the statement of President Delors yesterday. Will the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance say if this House will have an opportunity to discuss the question of Structural Funds or the lack of them, according to President Delors yesterday? The Taoiseach has come before the House saying that there will be Structural Funds available in the future.  It would appear that this is now off the agenda in Europe.  We should have a debate on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misinterpreted the situation.  The President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, was talking about different matters.  He was talking about compensation arising from the EMU.  On the broader issue, I shall be reporting to this House on the Luxembourg Summit and on that occasion Deputy Spring may raise any of these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach <Col N="1873" /> not agree that at that stage there would be a <i>fait accompli.</i>  The Taoiseach will have gone to the Summit without having the benefit of the views of the Members of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to remind the Taoiseach that on a number of occasions in the House he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated that there would be a wide-ranging debate on questions arising from the IGCs on EMU and political union and that these debates were to have taken place this session.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when he proposes to have those debates?  It was suggested before by you, a Cheann Comhairle, that this matter should be raised with the Whips.  However, we have raised it at Whips meetings and the Government Whip indicated that he does not have responsibility in the matter and that he has not been informed by the Taoiseach in relation to it.  When will we have this wide-ranging debate, not a series of statements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I committed myself to having the debate this session.  I accept that as both IGCs proceed it will be important for us to have a wide-ranging debate on it.  However, as I already indicated to the House, I do not believe that enough progress has been made to enable us to have a satisfactory, substantial debate.  I anticipate that the Summit in Luxembourg will probably be confined to reporting progress on the IGCs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I again urge the Taoiseach to have the debate before the end of this session, if possible.  It is a matter that <Col N="1874" /> warrants consideration because of the importance of European matters to this country and the obvious consequences of statements made by the President of the Commission yesterday.  On another matter, in relation to the statement made by the Minister for Finance yesterday regarding decentralisation, would the Taoiseach say if consultation will take place, even at this late stage, because it is very obvious from the response to the Minister's statement that there was no consultation prior to the announcement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I could say &ldquo;not in front of the children&rdquo;.  Given the nature of the announcement, is the Taoiseach satisfied that all Government Departments have been consulted?  It is obvious that civil servants or their unions have not been consulted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Departments even been consulted?  Senior people were not consulted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach to consider that there is not much point in having a debate on EC matters after decisions have been taken.  Surely it makes sense to allow Members of this House &mdash; to strengthen the Taoiseach's hand in going to these discussions &mdash; to come to a unanimous view before the decisions are taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All the indications are that the crucial decisions will not be taken until much later this year and we have ample time before then to have a worthwhile debate.  I am not trying to deprive the House of an opportunity to debate <Col N="1875" /> these matters; I welcome that debate and I have promised it.  However, my view at this stage is that there is not sufficient substance there at the moment.  The direction in which the IGCs are going is not yet sufficiently clear for us to have a worth-while debate.</P>

      <P>With respect, a Cheann Comhairle, the Taoiseach said he had dealt with this matter before, but it is an item on today's Order Paper.  The way it was dealt with before was by a wave of the Taoiseach's hand.  When will each of these committees be established?  Is it still the Government's intention to establish both committees or have one, or both, been dropped?  It is a simple question.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following order in draft&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Gas Act, 1976 (Section 9) (Establishment of Subsidiaries) Order, 1990</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>copies of which Order in draft were <Col N="1878" /> laid before Dáil Éireann on 15th June, 1990.</P>
    <P>Copies of the order have been placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this order is to confer on Bord Gáis Éireann powers, duties, rights and obligations in relation to the establishment of subsidiary companies so that it can conduct its business through the most appropriate corporate structures and, where necessary, enter into joint ventures with other bodies.</P>
    <P>Since natural gas was first brought ashore in 1978 it has rapidly become a crucial element in our fuel mix.  Natural gas currently accounts for about 14 per cent of our primary energy requirement and the resulting saving to date on our imported fuel bill is in the region of £2 billion.  This is no small achievement in an economy the size of ours.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann were established under the Gas Act, 1976, with powers and functions related to the transmission of gas and the development on a commercial basis and maintenance of the natural gas supply grid.  The gradual involvement of the board in the gas utilities in Cork, Limerick and Clonmel in the eighties and, finally, the acquisition of the assets of the Dublin Gas Company, which included the Waterford Gas Company, has meant that the board's role is now an expanded one, indeed a greatly expanded on, which has projected them into the difficult commercial areas of urban gas distribution.</P>
    <P>New legislation to cater for these changed circumstances was enacted in 1987 and a number of orders were enacted subsequently.  Bord Gáis have functioned very well in their new environment and have made a very successful transition.  It is fair to say that the image of the gas distribution industry in the towns and cities where gas is available is now greatly improved.</P>
    <P>The benefits which accrue from the use of natural gas have gone not only to those fortunate enough to be within the range of a gas supply, but to the nation as a whole, in the form of dividend payments by Bord Gáis Éireann to the State.  The Exchequer has benefited from this source to the tune of £260 million to date.  A further payment is expected this year.  On <Col N="1879" /> a cautionary note, however, I might say that the board's capital expenditure programme for the coming years may require a review of dividend payments in the medium term.  I will elaborate on this capital expenditure later.</P>
    <P>In addition to the direct payments to the Exchequer, natural gas has had a significant effect on many sectors of the economy.  In 1990, 45 per cent of all gas produced went to electricity generation. With modern advances in combustion technology such use of gas has recently come to be recognised internationally as being economically efficient and environmentally beneficial.  Indeed, the European Community has lately revoked the Directive which banned the use of natural gas in power stations.</P>
    <P>Continued use of gas-fired power stations will be an essential element in helping us to meet out international environmental commitments, notably in regard to reduction of sulphur and nitrous oxide emissions under the Helsinki Accord and the Sofia Protocol.  In addition, it helps us to reduce our dependence on imported oil, which is the alternative fuel available to the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>Many customers in industry have learned to appreciate how important gas can be as an energy source.  The cleanliness, versatility, efficiency and competitiveness of this indigenous resource has meant that it has to a great extent replaced other fuels in the area of the existing grid and is now the dominant fuel for industry in the gas supply area. In the foreseeable future the main growth market for gas in this area will be the small commercial sector, which in 1990 alone increased volume sales by 15 per cent and looks set to develop rapidly over the next few years.</P>
    <P>In the domestic sector sales are consistently increasing.  In 1990 alone the volume of gas sold increased by 40 per cent over the previous year.  Twenty-one thousand new central heating customers were connected up in 1990.  In percentage terms this represented an increase of approximately 43 per cent on the number for the previous year.  Sales of cookers and fires exceeded 29,000 in the same <Col N="1880" /> year.  These developments owe their success to the board's initiatives in marketing. The establishment of the concept of &ldquo;Warm Home Centres&rdquo; is one such initiative which has been very successful, as have the board's other promotional campaigns and incentives.</P>
    <P>The ban on the sale and distribution of bituminous coal in Dublin from 1 September 1990 has presented Bord Gáis with both a golden opportunity and a challenge.  The opportunity to greatly increase gas sales to fill the vacuum left by coal is clearly apparent.  There are approximately 350 non-gas estates in the Dublin area.  When one includes the houses within the present gas network area which are not connected to the grid there are about 100,000 houses in Dublin which do not have a gas supply.  The demand for connection to the grid is enormous. The challenge for the board is to satisfy that demand in as far as they can, efficiently, in a cost effective manner and working to a realistic timescale.</P>
    <P>A start has been made.  The board have drawn up a register of non-gas estates.  A pilot project has been undertaken in two Dublin estates to assess the likely take up for gas and the return on the board's investment.  The project has shown positive, but marginal, results.  On the basis of this pilot project, and subject to take up, the board are proposing to extend supply to an additional 8,000 homes in hitherto non-gas estates throughout the country in 1991.  Some 32 estates in the Dublin area involving about 6,000 houses will be approached.</P>
    <P>A programme of this scale cannot be completed overnight and will cost a lot of money to implement.  Extension to individual non-gas estates will naturally depend on the level of uptake in each case.  Bord Gáis Éireann have a statutory responsibility to earn a reasonable return on their capital investment and must therefore assess all extensions on a commercial basis.  Accordingly, the board will survey each of the estates involved to check out the prospective level of take up for gas and only those estates which are identified as being able to provide a satisfactory return on the board's expenditure will be considered for connection.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Dublin estates, Bord <Col N="1881" /> Gáis, this year also intend to offer a gas supply to some 1,700 homes in hitherto non-gas estates in Cork and to 400 in Limerick.  Similar viability criteria and incentives will apply in these centres as in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The programme for future years will depend on the funds available to the board and to a great extent will be dependent on the success of this year's projects and the lessons learned by Bord Gáis Éireann in carrying them out.  Nevertheless, it would be my intention that all viable estates in the gas supply area would be connected within five years.</P>
    <P>In short, it can be said that because of all its benefits &mdash; environmentally friendly, efficient, reliable, economical, versatile &mdash; natural gas is widely perceived as the fuel of the future.  It is my purpose and that of my Department to ensure that the body charged with developing and maintaining the gas industry are enabled to do so properly.</P>
    <P>The natural gas industry, apart from its impact in other sectors is an important industry in itself.  Bord Gáis currently employ over 900 people directly and a great many others are employed by associated companies such as the warm home centres and the gas contractors. Bord Gáis Éireann expect to announce a turnover in the region of £160 million on operations during 1990 in their annual report and accounts for the year, which are due to be laid before the Oireachtas and published shortly.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure by Bord Gáis Éireann in 1990 was approximately £22 million.  Extension of the grid and replacement of mains and services in Dublin cost £15 million.  The remainder was spent in extending and enhancing the networks in Cork, Limerick, Clonmel and connecting customers in Drogheda, Dundalk and Waterford.  Grant assistance of about £900,000 is recoupable from the European Regional Development Fund in respect of the expenditure incurred.</P>
    <P>From the commercial aspect the various gas utilities, which prior to the board's intervention were in very serious financial difficulties, are now far stronger financially than they were before the involvement of Bord Gáis Éireann.  They <Col N="1882" /> are not yet in a break-even situation because of the necessity to finance the substantial marketing campaign being undertaken in the domestic sector.  The increased level of gas sales in this sector indicates that the board's campaign is having the desired effect and that the utilities should begin to trade profitably and move into the black in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Any modern gas utility, if it is to operate successfully and retain the confidence of its customers, must have a satisfactory safety record and must implement the most up-to-date safety standards and practices.  The networks inherited by Bord Gáis Éireann when they acquired the old &ldquo;town gas&rdquo; utilities were old and in many instances in bad repair.  The Dublin network alone comprises some 2,600 km of pipe.  The board have set about modernising and replacing much of the distribution grid.</P>
    <P>The Government, conscious of the need for independent investigation of serious incidents, appointed international engineering consultants to investigate the Raglan House explosion in 1987.  The terms of reference asked for recommendations on how incidents such as the Raglan House explosion might be avoided in the future.  There were 38 recommendations in all.  Bord Gáis Éireann have implemented the recommendations of the report in relation to Dublin Gas and an annual pipe replacement plan now in force for mains and services will ensure that the network is maintained to the highest standards.</P>
    <P>A further three safety audits were carried out in respect of Dublin Gas, including the report of the task force, under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment, on the network and operating procedures relating particularly to multistorey buildings.</P>
    <P>Emanating from these four reports were 123 recommendations referring to Dublin Gas.  The systematic implementation of all these recommendations was set as a high priority by the Department of Energy and has been closely monitored by the Department with the result that all the short-term recommendations included in the reports have been carried <Col N="1883" /> through.  Most of the longer term technical improvements have been completed. Progress on the remaining elements is on target and is being monitored.</P>
    <P>A number of technical audits have been carried out by independent experts since the takeover of the southern utilities by Bord Gáis Éireann.  These have verified that the system is being operated safely and to current international standards.</P>
    <P>My Department have set up a detailed regulatory framework for monitoring safety practices in all of the gas utilities. As Minister for Energy, I am empowered to require Bord Gáis Éireann to submit detailed reports on safety matters, including the condition of the gas network, maintenance and renewal programme and leak records.  Detailed procedures have been put in place regarding the reporting of gas incidents.  There is also provision for the appointment of an independent investigator to examine safety practices and for my Department to require adherence to specified codes of practice.</P>
    <P>The Dutch VEG Gasinsituut was commissioned by BGE to carry out a further review of all safety improvements in the organisation over the last two years.  The final report indicated general satisfaction that the safety related policies, systems and practices in Bord Gáis conform to the best international standards.</P>
    <P>The safe transmission and distribution of natural gas, and indeed the safe installation of appliances and heating systems, depend on a high degree of skill and expertise.  The board's in-house training programmes and its involvement in training courses with FÁS have made a significant contribution to ensuring that skilled staff are involved in all aspects of the gas industry, particularly in the domestic and commercial installation business.</P>
    <P>Another factor which helps to ensure the highest standards of safety and quality of workmanship in the industry is the panel of approved installers which is operated by the board.  The qualifications for admission of contractors to this panel <Col N="1884" /> are rigorous and the performance of those companies or individuals who are accepted is constantly monitored by the board's quality control department.</P>
    <P>The progress made by BGE in the area of safety in the last few years has been significant.  Publicly reported escapes of gas have been greatly reduced and unaccounted for gas is now below the internationally accepted norm.  We cannot afford to become complacent, however. Constant vigilance is necessary both on the part of the board itself and my Department in their monitoring role.</P>
    <P>Over £50 million is being provided for BGE's 1991 capital expenditure programme, the principal elements of which involve spending on the Ireland-UK gas interconnector, the continuing upgrading and expansion of the gas utilities distribution systems and development of new business.</P>
    <P>A major capital project being undertaken this year as part of that capital programme is the extension of the gas grid westwards from Skibbolmore, County Louth, on the Dublin-Dundalk line to Mullagh in County Cavan.  The pipeline will run through Ardee, where it will serve a number of commercial customers, with spur lines to serve industrial customers in Virginia and Bailieborough. The project is based on a limited number of specific industrial and commercial customers, with whom Bord Gáis Éireann have held discussions and who have agreed to take gas when the pipeline is built.  The possibility of supplying domestic users will be considered if and when viable markets can be identified in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>The project, which is estimated to cost just over £10 million, has recently been approved by the European Commission for funding from its special Border areas programme.  It is scheduled to commence shortly and should be completed early next year.</P>
    <P>Overall the success of Bord Gáis in transforming the gas industry has made it imperative that we secure the future of that industry.  We now recognise more than ever the important role gas can play in providing clean and efficient energy. This role is expected to expand as we face into the next century.  However, our <Col N="1885" /> currently identified reserves of natural gas are finite and are expected to run out shortly after the turn of the century.  With this in mind I have made it a priority since taking office to examine the options open to us with a view to securing long-term gas supplies.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of ensuring future supplies is the drilling programme agreed with Marathon Petroleum Ireland in 1988, which is currently under way.  The object of the agreement was to facilitate the further exploration of the 37 blocks off the south and south-east coasts of Ireland which are held by Marathon with a view to finding additional deposits to improve Ireland's security of supply.  As the Members of the House will be aware, the Kinsale Head gas field is our sole supply of natural gas at present and supplies from these fields will begin to taper off towards the end of the century.</P>
    <P>One positive result of the Marathon drilling programme was the discovery in March 1989 of the Ballycotton field, which, although of modest proportions, augurs well for future projects in the Celtic Sea and other areas where, hopefully, additional indigenous reserves will be identified and developed.  The Ballycotton gas field is located some ten miles north west of the Kinsale Head gas field with estimated reserves of about 70 BCF. This is approximately one-twentieth the size of the Kinsale Head gas field.</P>
    <P>A gas sales agreement in respect of this latest find has been concluded between Marathon and BGE and on 27 March 1990 I announced my approval of a plan of development submitted by Marathon for the field.  First deliveries of gas from the field are expected in July this year.  It will be linked with the Kinsale Head field and its reserves will be depleted about the same time as those of the latter field.</P>
    <P>While the discovery of the Ballycotton gas field indicates that further indigenous reserves may be indentified in our offshore, nevertheless, we must, be pragmatic.</P>
    <P>In late 1989 the Government decided that the options for gas importation should be examined.  My Department and Bord Gáis carried out a feasibility study of the main options and decided that the best solution would be a subsea <Col N="1886" /> interconnector pipeline to the UK.  In addition to linking us to the UK gas grid and North Sea supplies, an interconnector would give us the benefit of a link to the greater European grid in due course and the opportunity to export any gas that would be surplus to our needs in the event of a significant indigenous gas find.</P>
    <P>Planning for this gas interconnector is now at an advanced stage.  There are various aspects to the project, including the necessary statutory clearances here and in the UK, and environmental impact studies, which are scheduled for execution at different times throughout the period up to the target completion date in October 1993 when first deliveries are expected.</P>
    <P>Subsea surveys of a number of possible pipeline routes have been carried out. The planned route runs from north county Dublin to Moffat in southern Scotland.  This route allows for the possibility of a link to Northern Ireland and my Department have maintained close contact with the Northern Ireland authorities in this matter.  We are anxious, in the spirit of North-South co-operation, to facilitate them in any way we can. However, no final decision has yet been taken on the Northern side.</P>
    <P>Negotiations for a supply of gas are ongoing and engineering design is now well under way.  I expect to put the project before the Government for final approval soon so that the major procurement and construction contracts can be placed.  Construction should commence in March 1993.  Preliminary estimates are that the cost of the project will be about £240 million at current prices.</P>
    <P>There are four main elements to the project.  These are onshore pipelines in Scotland and Ireland, the subsea pipeline and a compressor station in Scotland.  The project has been chosen by the European Commission for support through its REGEN initiative under which £300 million have been allocated to assist five energy related projects in the Community. A formal application to Brussels for assistance has been made, but the amount of the allocation to the Irish project will not be known for some time.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention that <Col N="1887" /> the pipeline will effectively be owned and operated by Bord Gáis Eireann.  Initial imports are intended for electricity generation but, as indigenous reserves are depleted, increasing amounts will go to Bord Gáis Eireann's other markets.  The participation of the ESB will be vital to the success of the project and for that reason the ESB have been involved in the gas supply negotiations.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the possibility of a joint venture arrangement between Bord Gáis Éireann and some other suitable partner on one or more aspects of the project in the future has been raised and could be worthy of serious consideration, if a suitable proposal were to emerge.</P>
    <P>It may be advantageous, or even necessary, for Bord Gáis to handle their involvement in the interconnector project by way of a subsidiary company. Indeed, Bord Gáis Éireann may consider it prudent to set up subsidiaries to deal with the ownership and operation of the pipeline itself even if no joint venture partner is involved.</P>
    <P>Even with an interconnector pipeline in place, linking us to a complete European market for gas, in the event that no significant new finds of gas emerge before the Kinsale Head field is depleted, Bord Gáis Éireann will still need to make provision for security of supply since there will then be only one source &mdash; imported gas &mdash; and for meeting peak demand.  It is envisaged therefore that more capital expenditure will be required in the latter half of this decade for construction of either a gas liquefaction plant or a terminal for imports of liquified natural gas (LNG).  Much of the business of energy production, transmission and distribution worldwide is carried out by co-operation between interested parties.  This will be another area where a joint venture might prove to be suitable.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am anxious that the way should be cleared now to enable Bord Gáis Éireann to act in the appropriate way should the occasion arise where there is a need for a subsidiary company.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann's existing legislation does not address in any clear way the question of the board's entitlement to establish subsidiary companies or enter <Col N="1888" /> into joint venture arrangements.  In effect, the board already have four subsidiaries in the gas utility companies which they have acquired i.e. Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Clonmel Gas Companies. Dublin Gas is, as I have said, an integral part of Bord Gáis Éireann.  I feel it is now necessary to remove any doubt there might be regarding Bord Gáis Éireann's ability in this area, in order to pave the way for any future ventures which the board may wish to be involved, particularly at this time, in connection with the proposed interconnector project. The making of this Order will confer on Bord Gáis Éireann the power to set up or participate in companies, to form subsidiaries, and to enter into joint venture arrangements.  In giving these powers to the board, however, I think it appropriate to address the question of accountability and control in connection with the functions conferred on the board under the order.  Accordingly, I am including a provision that my approval and that of the Minister for Finance will be required before the board can exercise any of their powers under the order.</P>
    <P>Similar provisions to these are included in section 2 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1988, and in section 2 of the Turf Development Act, 1990, for the exercise of similar functions by the ESB and Bord na Móna, respectively.</P>
    <P>I am adopting this procedure because I feel it to be the most appropriate and expedient way of conferring the additional functions I have described on Bord Gáis Éireann and of ensuring the appropriate control.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Gas Act, 1976, provides for the making of an order to confer on the board such functions, in relation to the provision of a supply of gas, as the Minister thinks proper.  Functions can include, in this instance, powers and duties.  Such an order must be laid in draft before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and requires the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas before it can be made by me.  The approval of the Seanad has already been obtained.</P>
    <P>I therefore recommend this motion to the House.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael will be supporting this order.  We welcome the clarity it brings to this area.  There has been some doubt as to the legality of certain of the activities of BGE to date and about the legality of desirable activities in the future.  Most of us who have been involved in debate in recent times have found it virtually impossible to enshrine in legislation the requirement that a positive order must be affirmed in the House.  It is no accident that the Act on which this order is based was passed during the period of office of another Coalition Government between 1973 and 1977.  The Minister is required to come into the House to seek an affirmative order and to discuss the operation of the industry in general.  I commend the procedure to the Minister and the Government, who are singularly unwilling to concede this provision in other legislation. It is most valuable and, in this instance, gives the House an opportunity to hear the Government's plans for the development of our gas resources and the interconnector.</P>
      <P>The broad purpose of this order is supported and the powers being given to BGE are welcomed.  The Minister has indicated in relation to the interconnector that a subsidiary company or a joint venture is a possibility in regard to this new development.  He will be aware that during Question Time I took the opportunity to indicate our view that the option of having this new supply handled by a body other than BGE should be looked at seriously.  To the degree that a subsidiary or a joint venture might be a move in that direction we welcome it.  Earlier this year we had the sorry experience of being at the mercy of a State utility which has a monopoly.  Where it is possible to build in an extra element of competition, that should be done.  In the context of the electricity or gas supply network, it is complicated by the fact that the distribution network is in the hands of one entity in each case.  A new source of supply might be of very limited value if the distribution company were involved in a dispute but, as a principle, it should be energetically pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is timely that we should be debating this matter since during the past few days <Col N="1890" /> BGE finally indicated their plans for the extension of the gas grid to estates in Dublin which do not have that facility. Initial steps are to be taken in 1991.  Eight thousand additional houses in Dublin are to be connected to the gas grid.  For the many estates which have to wait it is bad news.  They have been lobbying local representatives, the Department and BGE for inclusion in the grid as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>This matter is related to the significant level of contribution BGE have made to the Exchequer.  It is a question of judgment as to whether those funds would be better used for the more rapid development of the gas grid nationally or paid directly into the tax coffers.  The issue of policy and of clarity of direction arises in this context.  One of the matters which has been raised with me in the short time that I have been Fine Gael spokesperson in this area is the problem caused for industry by the lack of clear policy direction, leaving aside for a moment the environmental issues.  This is relevant to the pricing of the gas supply to industry and the domestic user.</P>
    <P>There is an element of competition but also of juggling, and transparency is lacking there.  There is an element of using this as a source of revenue for the State.  Without that pressure different priorities might be established in regard to investment.  The new supply of gas will be available <i>via</i> the interconnector. This is one reason it would be desirable to have a competing source of gas supply for the various utilities and industries.</P>
    <P>In relation to the extension of the gas grid in Dublin and throughout the country, I am more familiar with the Dublin scene because BGE have provided us with details of what they are doing in Dublin.  The lucky Dubliners are to be connected, but they will have to find the capital cost of that connection.  The indication is that one group of householders will be paying £600 to £700 for the connection. For those who have the money, that will be worthwhile; but many people will find this an impossibility.  In view of the environmental desirability of converting to gas and the conservation appeal of gas as a source of domestic energy, particularly in heating, the State <Col N="1891" /> should be involved in some incentive to people to participate in this.  There should be some help to meet what for the average household will be a sizeable cost but which will be prohibitive for less advantaged households.  I ask the Minister and his Government to consider this very carefully.  Other semi-State companies have availed of the power to establish subsidiaries quite effectively, with benefit to the Exchequer and to the economy. Therefore, we welcome this development and hope the Minister in due course will consider a total separation of responsibility for distribution of this new supply.</P>
    <P>BGE are acting to acquire town gas companies throughout the country.  We welcome that development on the basis that it brings some clarity into the operation and some assurance of a statutory basis for the gas company's operations to date.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the opportunity provided by the ban on smoky fuel in Dublin last year.  There is no doubt that BGE, Bord na Móna and other State companies have benefited enormously from it.  It is important for us environmentally that it succeeds.  This brings me back to the need to encourage people to convert to gas.  I refer to my hobby horse, for which the Minister accepts no responsibility directly, that is the problems encountered in using some of the new fuels.  The frustrations people felt with the new coal last year, which they found to be dangerous, expensive and problematic to deal with, will encourage people to convert to gas if they can do so and thus benefit BGE.  However, because of slow progress and because the Government are making no direct investment in the capital cost of the grid extension and are not helping individuals to meet the cost, many householders will not have the choice because they will not be able to afford it.  Because gas will not be an option for such people steps should be taken to improve the grading of fuels and so on.</P>
    <P>I see some of my colleagues on my right are impatient because they want to contribute in the debate before 12 noon.</P>

      <P>It appears that the aim of this Order is to enable BGE in principle to expand the range of their operations and take part in commercial activities over and above the activities they undertake at present.  This order would be acceptable in principle to us in the Labour Party, but we cannot make a final decision on it without being absolutely clear as to the motivation behind it. There are a number of possible reasons for putting a motion like this before the House at this time.  One may be that the Minister for Energy has a deep belief and conviction about the possibility of expanding State enterprises and contributing in a major way to job creation and economic development.  If that is the reason, the order is most welcome.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister has made a number of statements in the past about the possibility of liberalising this whole area of economic activity.  Therefore, we must get a clear statement from him on the complete motivation for this order. There is a possibility and a suspicion that the reason this order is being brought before the Dáil now is that it is part of a process of preparing BGE for privatisation either in whole or in part.  If that is the Minister's motivation he should say so, then we will all know exactly where we stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>BGE are the State body responsible for the safe transmission of natural gas throughout the areas served by their national grid.  Since the development of the company they have contributed to meeting about one-sixth of Ireland's energy needs.  The company have proved to be successful in commercial terms. Domestic sales have increased every year for the past number of years as have central heating sales and sales of appliances.  The company have provided a valuable service in both the domestic and commercial markets.  In particular, with the banning of bituminous coal in the <Col N="1893" /> Dublin area, natural gas has made a significant contribution to a cleaner environment. In fact, it is arguable that BGE should be encouraged to concentrate a great deal more on getting their house in order before they are encouraged to expand.</P>
    <P>I recognise what the Minister said in his statement about the efforts which have been made and which continue to be made particularly in the Dublin area.  In that area it is apparent that Dublin Gas are unable to meet the demands for service and appliances and there is still the need to eliminate the long history of complaints about the quality of service in the Dublin area.  Strenuous efforts have been made by the company to address these problems but it is clear that more work needs to be done.  The Minister in his opening statement recognised there are a number of housing estates in the Dublin area which have no supply of natural gas and, unfortunately, there is little prospect of these estates being supplied with this amenity.  It must be annoying for a great number of householders in Dublin to watch the very professional advertisements on television and in the newspapers encouraging people to switch to natural gas when they know that natural gas is not likely to be available to them or, in some cases, is available to them only at considerable cost per household.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann recently circulated literature about their plans to make more natural gas available to users in housing estates in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Clonmel and Waterford and to include 8,000 new houses this year but the capital investment required for more rapid development, particularly in regard to the replacement of obsolete pipelines, is substantial.  It is unlikely that natural gas will be a viable option for thousands of domestic consumers unless the capital requirement is addressed.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, Bord Gáis Éireann are a very substantial company. In 1989 total investment by the company was £21.5 million.  Extension of the grid and replacement of mains and services in Dublin cost £14 million which included the gas supplied to north county Dublin. The remainder was spent extending and enhancing the networks in Cork, <Col N="1894" /> Limerick and Clonmel and connecting customers in Drogheda, Dundalk and Waterford.  A European Regional Development Fund grant of £1.082 million is receivable for this work.  There are five wholly-owned subsidiary companies Cork, Limerick, Clonmel, Waterford and Natural Gas Finance Limited.  The turnover of the company as a whole is in excess of £40 million per annum with gross profits of around £25 million.  The assets of the company are approximately £46 million.</P>
    <P>In short, Bord Gáis Éireann represent a considerable asset to this State.  It is an asset that needs to be developed and make an even greater contribution to economic activity and to job creation. The importance of Bord Gáis Éireann will be further highlighted with the development of the gas interconnector. This is not an asset we can afford to lightly sell off to the highest bidder.  Therefore, before we give our full support to this motion I would like to have an assurance from the Minister that the aim of the order is to enable the company to develop as a strategic publicly-owned national asset providing the highest level of service and making the greatest possible contribution to the economic development of the country. Otherwise we will oppose resolutely and effort by this Government to sell off this important utility company.</P>

      <P>Deputy Pattison may well be proved to be correct in regard to what is in the mind of the Government; one never knows.  Privatisation seems to be the way to go at present.  After the privatisation of the Irish Sugar Company, and Irish Life coming up, no one knows what company is next.  On the basis of what we have before us we can take it that the Minister is simply giving powers to Bord Gáis Éireann which have been given to other State companies such as the ESB and Bord na Móna.  On that basis I welcome giving Bord Gáis Éireann the same opportunities for initiative and enterprise as other companies.  It is important for the development of the company &mdash; as it was for the ESB and Bord na Móna &mdash; and for the morale of the staff to be able to use their initiative <Col N="1895" /> and enterprise and to be generally more flexible.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna now have their own company in France which has been a boost to the staff who formerly had an image of being stuck in the bog all their lives.  Now they are a live European company and it is an asset to them, although I am not too happy with the general direction the management of Bord na Móna are taking.</P>
      <P>The way forward for State companies is to give them opportunities for joint ventures or initiatives, not privatising. We should give them more opportunities to be more flexible and to have more autonomy, to use their initiative, to allow them to expand and develop while retaining their public service role and desire to serve the public.  Semi-State companies see themselves in a role of serving the public.  They like to succeed in doing something for the benefit of the State and the public.  It is very important to retain that ideal while allowing them all the flexibility, initiative and enterprise we can.</P>
      <P>To privatise a company like Bord Gáis Éireann would turn the whole philosophy of that company on its head from being one of public service to one of private personal greed at the expense of the public good.  Essentially that is what it comes down to.  You do everything to make a profit even if it means sacking people, going into a different area, doing less for the State, not reinvesting and creating jobs or not using the material resources of the State in the best way. All these things are done with a profit motive rather than providing a service for the public good.  I welcome this as the way forward for semi-State companies as it allows them the maximum opportunities for development with subsidiaries, joint ventures, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann have been a highly successful company from the start.  They have done much for all the gas utilities throughout the country, all of which were ailing and on the verge of collapse.  The fact that all these gas utilities have been given new life has been a great boost for many towns and cities.  The take-over of Dublin Gas has been very important for <Col N="1896" /> the citizens of Dublin.  The huge job entailed in renewing the ancient facilities of the Dublin Gas Company is still ongoing. Bord Gáis Éireann have successfully given a new image and credibility to gas as a clean and efficient product to be desired in one's household where it had a bad image in the old days.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the initial development of the smoke controlled zones under the provisions of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, because the first zone selected was in Ballyfermot where air pollution was twice as bad as any other area.  Bord Gáis moved in very rapidly and, following a highly successful campaign, the first area was developed. Grants were made available to encourage people to use gas, electricity or enclosed solid fuel burners instead of bituminous coal.  Bord Gáis were more successful than any other company in this campaign. They gained a major portion of the market in Ballyfermot.  This led to a dramatic reduction in the level of smog in that area.  Ballyfermot is the only area to have been designated a smoke controlled zone under the Air Pollution Act. Although this scheme was slow to get under way during the first 12 months due to hold-ups and so on, once it was set up it moved very rapidly.</P>
    <P>It was proposed to extend the smoke free area to include Neilstown and Crumlin when suddenly the Minister scrapped the scheme and simply banned the sale of bituminous coal.  This move was promoted as a marvellous initiative by the Minister but had a traumatic effect on the people of Neilstown, the next area in line for the grant scheme.  People were no longer offered grants to change over to smokeless fuel.  Instead they had to buy new fuels which would not light, caused enormous problems in grids and were very expensive.  Last winter was very cold but no mention has been made of the hardship suffered by the people in those estates who did not have the money to purchase smokeless fuels.</P>

      <P>The decision was taken by the Minister to ban the use of bituminous coal and not give grants to people to change over to smokeless fuel. This has led to a decision by Bord Gáis Éireann which is clearly stated in a letter dated February last that further developments would be totally dependent on the socio-economic profile of the area.  Bord Gáis have issued a list, which they have sent to all Deputies, of the areas in Dublin to which they intend to extend their gas system.  They propose to extend the pipeline to Hillcrest in Lucan, a large estate.  In doing this they will be by-passing Arthur Griffith Park, a local authority estate.  They also propose extending the pipeline to Palmerstown Woods in Clondalkin, quite a small estate, but they are making no effort to extend the pipeline to Neilstown or Rowlagh, local authority estates.  These estates will be left without any gas supply.</P>
      <P>There is no grant system in operation to encourage people in local authority estates, the areas which were to be designated as smoke control zones, to change over to gas.  Under the Bord Gáis proposal, the gas pipeline will only be extended to areas of high socio-economic profile.  Even though the pipeline will pass-by their doors, people in local authority housing estates will not be given the opportunity of availing of a gas supply. The Minister should address this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support this ministerial order which will enable Bord Gáis to establish subsidaries or joint ventures to import gas. Because of the need to ensure continuity of supply I fully support the building of a pipeline to import gas.  This is vital for all consumers.  However, I ask the Minister to look at the decision by Bord Gáis to take socio-economic factors only into account when extending their system.  No consideration is being given by them to the social factors involved. The Minister has a responsibility to ensure that social factors are also taken into account.  The use of turf in power stations has no economic basis but, because of the very powerful social reasons involved, the State decided to <Col N="1898" /> use this type of fuel in power stations. This is vitally important for the whole midlands area.  The Minister also has a responsibility to look at the supply of gas to local authority estates.  Some procedure should be adopted to ensure that gas will be supplied to these estates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing before the House this order which will enable Bord Gáis to establish subsidiaries or joint ventures in a way which was not foreseen in the Gas Act, 1976.  That Act was passed against the background of the so-called oil crisis. That crisis underlined the importance of indigenous energy resources as well as the dangers of relying exclusively on oil.</P>
      <P>Since 1976 we have taken these points to heart and the development of Board Gáis, Bord na Móna and the ESB bear witness to this.  However, as our energy needs develop, the brief of Bord Gáis must also be expanded.  The establishment of subsidiaries in Cork, Limerick and Dublin during the eighties outlined this expansion.  It has been suggested that the legality of these subsidiaries might be questioned in so far as they are not covered by section 9 of the 1976 Act.  I do not know if such suggestions are legally tenable but, if we are to proceed with a subsea interconnector as well as expand our domestic subsidiaries both in terms of numbers and responsibilities, all legal reservations must be removed.</P>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the interconnector with Britain and our need as a nation to tie into the European energy system.  I accept this need and very much welcome the Minister's declaration of our need to tie into the European energy system.  However, we must be serious about expanding the grid and the number of our subsidiaries at home.  This is implicit in the order.  Therefore, it is vitally important that we are clear on the criteria for the subsidiaries and of the undoubted role they may play in our national recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a speech to the Seanad on 4 July last year the Minister for Energy stated that the extension of the gas grid would have to be &ldquo;economically viable&rdquo;.  I have great reservations about the policy of Bord <Col N="1899" /> Gáis to distribute gas on the basis of economic viability.  Last year in Wexford over 1,400 gas consumers were threatened with a lack of supply because of the closure of Wexford Gas.  I approached the Minister on a number of occasions about the matter.  Initially he was hesistant to intervene but after discussions with myself and with Deputies in the Wexford area he took action on which I compliment him.  He provided £300,000 so that consumers in Wexford could get an alternative supply of gas. On that occasion the Minister recognised that Bord Gáis Éireann has a social responsibility.  We must look at the matter of the provision of gas throughout the country.  There is a social responsibility to supply gas to Wexford, Galway and other counties.</P>
    <P>We all agree that semi-State bodies must be financially sound but this criterion must not be one that shuns or denies the sense of social responsibility which must be the priority of all political parties.  If we were to distribute electricity in the early sixties on the basis that Bord Gáis are now distributing gas half of Ireland only would have electricity.  Similarly, if we were to distribute running water on the basis that Bord Gáis Éireann are distributing gas, half the people of the country only would have running water. I would ask the Minister to ensure that in distributing gas Bord Gáis take into account the social needs of the different areas.  I make this plea for my own constituency where there is very high unemployment. If we are to solve this problem we must have natural gas.  It is a Catch 22 situation &mdash; we cannot attract industry because we do not have natural gas and we cannot get natural gas because of Bord Gáis policy.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the matter and impress on Bord Gáis the need to distribute natural gas throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As I would like to give the Minister an opportunity to reply I will be very brief.  I share the sentiments being expressed in relation to the social aspect of the supply of natural gas to the various areas, particularly, housing estates, in all constituencies.  Bord Gáis Éireann have <Col N="1900" /> informed me that it is their intention to extend the gas supply to various areas in the town of Clonmel, but, inevitably, there are consequences of any such procedures. If we depend completely on the ability of everybody in the area to pay for natural gas those who can afford it probably will not be able to avail of it and those who can get it probably will not be able to afford it.  The Minister should ensure that Bord Gáis are commercially viable.  The extension of the gas supply would have an environmental impact. However, we are anxious that as many people as possible avail of this facility.</P>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Dick Spring, when Minister for Energy, came up with the novel idea of setting up subsidiary companies and indeed made a special arrangement to extend the same to Clonmel.  That has been highly successful and has ensured that the normal users of Clonmel Gas were connected to the national gas grid.  I am anxious that as many people as possible in the town benefit from this facility.  The corporation are very active and could ensure that grants are available &mdash; these could be considered to be appropriate reconstruction grants, or loans, as the case might be &mdash; so that everybody would have the opportunity of participating in what is a very valuable national asset.  The subsea interconnector grid and all the various projects which the Minister has mentioned are essential for the future of Bord Gáis.  This order will give legislative power to Bord Gáis Éireann to become involved with various sub-companies without privatising the company.  I share the concern expressed by Deputy Pattison and Deputy Mac Giolla regarding privatisation.  It is not our intention to support the privatisation of Bord Gáis, but we have no objection to joint ventures or other such procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to request the Department to carry out environmental impact studies and research into areas in Ireland which are not very far from the gas grid and which would benefit commercially and socially from an extension. I am talking about areas such as Tipperary town which could use the supply industrially.  It is very close to the gas supply to Limerick city and is certainly <Col N="1901" /> within the range of an extension.  A feasibility study should be carried out by the Department to ensure that towns like Tipperary with large industries such as Tipperary Co-operative Creamery, BRMC McMahon who have major demands on the ESB, and Tambrands who have a continuing demand for energy, could avail of the supply.  If the supply was extended to Tipperary town the ordinary residents could also benefit from this major energy source.</P>
    <P>In the past the private sector operated this facility but mismanaged it in such a way in the Dublin area that the State had to ensure, by setting up a certain procedure under the late Frank Cluskey, that existing users of the facility were protected.  It would not be acceptable for the Government to go ahead with the £240 million investment programme and then suddenly make the company a viable proposition for privatisation.  That would be a travesty of justice and would be against everything for which we, on this side of the House, stand.  I am sure the Minister has no plans in that regard but perhaps he would reassure us.  I support the order in principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans for privatisation but the Labour Party Members have put some thoughts in my head.  My objective is to guarantee security of supply to all gas consumers in the country. I recognise that, with the finite nature of the gas reserves available to us, there is a doubt about the continuation of supply beyond the year 2000 unless we discover additional reserves in the Irish offshore. I cannot wait in the hope that we might find more gas.  That is why we are proceeding immediately with the proposal to construct a pipeline to give us access to North Sea gas and the wider European gas grids.  That would be a substantial guarantee of continuity of supply into the future.  Huge reserves of gas have been discovered and the exploration of gas continues to be a success story.  One can expect further discoveries in the European region which will feed into these pipelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Oireachtas established Bord Gáis Éireann as a commercial semi-State body with a commercial mandate.  I would like <Col N="1902" /> to see gas extended to every house but the semi-State body have a duty and a responsibility to act in accordance with good commercial practice.  Some years ago we saw the bad side of semi-State companies who did not act in a manner that would have ensured they did not get into financial difficulties.  Huge debts were incurred for various reasons, in some cases due to no fault of the companies involved.  Therefore it is important that we keep tight control over the way in which our State bodies operate.  It would be reckless to suggest that they commit themselves to capital expenditure without any assurance of revenue accruing to them to fund that expenditure. That is one of the difficulties.</P>
    <P>I have been asked in the House on numerous occasions about various estates.  Bord Gáis Éireann have now announced the estates to which they hope to extend the gas supply.  Deputy Mac Giolla mentioned a case in which the pipeline was passing by a local authority scheme and going on to some other scheme.  I shall examine that case.  It is not my job as Minister to interfere with the day to day operations of any of the semi-State bodies that come under the aegis of my Department, but I shall look into the matter to determine whether there is anything in what the Deputy says.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for the support that has been given to the motion.  The sole intention of the change is to facilitate the construction of a pipeline and the possibility of attracting investment into that project.  It was necessary to establish a subsidiary company and, to clear up any doubt about that, it was felt proper to bring in a separate order so that the law is clear and unequivocal.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1903" /> That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
    <P>The Royal Hospital, Donnybrook (Charter Amendment) Order, 1990,</P>
    <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 18th December, 1990.</P>
    <P>This is a small technical amendment to the charter of The Royal Hospital and, as indicated in the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the draft order, the application to amend the charter of The Royal Hospital, Donnybrook, was made by the board of management of the hospital.  Section 76 of the Health Act, 1970, gives power to the Minister for Health to make an order on the application of the governing body of a hospital to amend a charter or private Act relating to that hospital, subject to consultation with the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests, who have been consulted in this case and who have approved of the proposed amendments to the hospital's charter and to a draft of an order which it is proposed to make being laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The section stipulates that the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of the amendments to the charter and supplemental charter put forward by the hospital's board of management, I agreed to make an order incorporating the amendments to their existing charter, which was granted to the hospital in the year 1800, also to the supplemental charter, which was adopted in 1886.  This order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann in December 1990 and was approved by the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the amendment is to make new provisions for the appointment of governors and to bring up to date certain other clauses that are regarded as outmoded.  The memorandum circulated with the draft order explains the various amendments.</P>
    <P>I believe that the House will welcome the amendments to outmoded clauses. But it is only fair to the board of The <Col N="1904" /> Royal Hospital to say that the outdated clauses have not been applied in practice for many years past.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to thank the board of The Royal Hospital, and the medical, nursing and other staff of the hospital, for the excellent work they have performed over the years in treating a great number of long-stay patients and, more recently, in developing rehabilitation services.  I feel sure that this good work will continue and will be further developed to meet the changing needs of the hospital's catchment population in south Dublin.</P>
    <P>I ask the Dáil to approve of the draft Royal Hospital, Donnybrook (Charter Amendment) Order, 1990, which has been laid before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  It is very timely that a charter originally drafted in 1800 under the pen of King George III should now be amended.  I am sure the Minister is proud to be making history that dates back to the Act of Union.</P>
      <P>Even within more recent times the change is overdue.  The board of governors has for a long time sought changes, it is a pity it has taken so long to come to fruition.</P>
      <P>As the Minister says, much has changed and there have been dramatic improvements in The Royal Hospital since 1800, when it was described in the charter as the hospital for incurables.  It is now a bright hospital providing excellent care, rehabilitation and returning people to the community.  The hospital is excellently run and is a tribute to its staff and board of governors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes involved in the amendment to the charter are also welcome. They will bring new blood into the board and will bring forward representation from groups such as the health board, which obviously have a major contribution to make in the running of the hospital.  The amendment also brings to an end the notion of life governorships. As Members of this House I suppose we would all like to have that concept established a little more widely, but it is appropriate in this day and age to do away with such anachronisms.  I commend the <Col N="1905" /> Minister for bringing the measure to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be pleased to know that there will be no acrimony in this health debate.  There will be agreement across the floor of the House of the motion now before us.</P>
      <P>In this debate it is opportune for all of us to pay a compliment to The Royal Hospital at Donnybrook for the services they have rendered through the centuries. Many people were in real need when the hospital and its charter were set up.  The hospital carried out a very useful function and, even to this day, it has a very important function in relation to the hospice movement that is being promoted throughout Ireland.  The hospital fulfils a particular category of need that can be easily forgotten at times by many people.  This is one of the most sensitive and important aspects of nursing &mdash; the care for those who are terminally ill, those who would have been called &ldquo;incurables&rdquo; in the old days.  That is a very important role played by specialised nursing carers throughout the country. The Royal Hospital in Donnybrook has a long history in that regard.</P>
      <P>In recent years the hospital has carried out an essential service in the treatment of geriatrics.  All of us know how important that service is for our old people who are unable to get long-stay care in many of the public institutions, whether geriatric hospitals, sub-acute district hospitals &mdash; many of which are closed now &mdash; welfare homes or whatever. Over the years the hospital has provided 220 to 230 beds for geriatric patients, who have benefited from the quality of service provided by the hospital.  The hospital also have day-care and rehabilitation wards.  All of the work of the hospital is very commendable. I have no doubt that the Department of Health have assisted the hospital by way of special grants made under the 1970 Health Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This order provides an opportunity to remove what is an ancient, outmoded and outdated charter.  The only reason that The Royal Hospital at Donnybrook succeeded to operate in recent times under such an old charter is that they have <Col N="1906" /> managed to ignore the old charter, to their eternal credit.  Compliance with the old charter would have inhibited the hospital's continued progress.  The order abolishes the old provision for life governors, people who paid a fee of 20 guineas to become life governors.  The sum of 20 guineas was quite a commitment to invest 200 years ago in order to become involved in the running of a hospital that provided a service which was possibly not then available.  It is to be hoped that, by excluding outdated sections of the charter, it will be moved into line with more every day events in the health world, whether nominated by local authorities, the professions or the Department.  It is appropriate that the hospital be given the change they have sought.  The Minister has the power under the Health Act to confer the change if the order passes through both Houses.  The other House has already passed it and, with its passage through this House, the requests of the board of management and the governors will have been met.  They will also have the ability to borrow and enter into contracts for the purchase, sale or leasing of property and anything else that is necessary today if they are to obtain advantage in the commercial world.</P>
    <P>People are prepared to invest money in hospitals which give a hospice type service.  They are prepared to make gifts and requests in their wills.  I would suggest that the Minister consult with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to ensure that any finances made available by direct payment from taxpayers to this type of concern which is caring for our seriously ill old people would be considered to be a charitable donation and deductible for tax purposes.  That would be an incentive to people who have money available to give gifts and make wills in favour of such institutions.  As the charitable trusts have dealt with this hospital in the past, that is possibly still legally binding.  That option may continue to be available to people who want to make gifts to the hospital.</P>
    <P>It has taken the Minister some time to bring a non-contentious order before the House though he was sure of support from all sides.  It would be inappropriate <Col N="1907" /> for anybody to hold this order up.  I and the Labour Party support it fully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We in The Workers' Party equally support the changes proposed by the Minister.  Those of us who sit on Dublin City Council are conscious of the role of the hospital because we have three nominees on the board.  One of them, Deputy Doyle, is present and I am sure he will give us an insight into the role of a governor of the hospital board.</P>
      <P>I have glanced at the Charter of the Hospital for Incurables which was written in 1800.  I feel the charter is in need of more radical upgrading than what the Minister is proposing.  I would argue that it needs to be completely upgraded and restructured.  One only has to look at the opening lines to realise that.  It says:</P>
      <P>GEORGE III, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, France and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, and soforth,</P>
      <P>To all whom these Presents shall come GREETING.</P>

    <P>The title, &ldquo;hospital for incurables&rdquo; is equally an outmoded and improper title. I do not think any hospital now or any section of the medical profession would ever use the term &ldquo;incurable&rdquo;, even in the area of hospices for the dying, because in many cases people go into those places and come out again feeling better.  That, therefore, is a terminology <Col N="1908" /> that is improper and should be abolished as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We are happy to support the proposed changes in the Charter of The Royal Hospital.  These changes are clearly necessary and long overdue.  The charter of the hospital is a relic of another era when both the health problems and the social structures of Irish society were quite different.  It will clearly present difficulties if a hospital has to rely on a charter which was drafted in 1800 and a supplemental charter which was drafted in 1886.  I do not think the proposed changes go far enough.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us in a few minutes that he recognises that the charter is so ancient as to be in need of complete upgrading.</P>
    <P>It is quite ludicrous that a person could become a governor of the hospital by simply paying a fee of five guineas per year; this clearly could create all sorts of organisational difficulties.  One wonders if there might not be a case for totally updating the charter to take account of modern conditions.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has visited the hospital can only have been impressed at the manner in which it is run.  The regime is a very progressive one and, despite the problems created by the continual shortage of funds, the patients &mdash; all of whom are suffering from severe disabilities and many of whom are elderly &mdash; are treated with great care and attention.  It is important to record that here.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we need more places like The Royal Hospital.  I mentioned the social concern of people in the eighteen hundreds when they went about providing these services.  Equally in 1991 we need more of these services for the elderly and the incapacitated.  There are many elderly and incapacitated people who should be receiving institutional care and attention, but who are unable to find places, and are living at home with their families.  This is a very severe problem today.  There are many elderly whose families wish to place them in hospitals and who are finding it extremely difficult to get beds.  I refer not to hospital beds but to long-term care beds.  There is a crisis in the Dublin of 1991.  We need more facilities, more places.  I am a bit disturbed that the carer's allowances <Col N="1909" /> which was brought in to assist those caring for people at home&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne, we have to refer specifically to what is in the motion.  I will not say you are abusing the position but you are straying beyond what is pertinent and approrpriate to the motion before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am attempting to draw a comparison between the love and care expressed in 1800 by the people who set up this hospital and similar people in Dublin today, an urban capital city.  We could do with more of that loving care and attention from the Minister for Health by the provision of places for the equally distraught family members who are caring for the elderly at home and desperately seeking accommodation for their loved ones.  I think it is a fair comparison. I will leave it at that.</P>
      <P>There is a need not just for more full-time residential care, but also for short-term or respite beds to give families a break from the constant strain of having to care for an elderly or disabled relative.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that of so many carers out there, estimated at 65,000, only a miserable 1,400 qualify for the meagre £45 carer's allowance.  We have to put this on the record and recognise and congratulate not just The Royal Hospital but the 65,000 carers many of whom are sacrificing jobs, marriages and other prospects in life to care for the elderly.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I would say that this is, of course, all linked to the question of adequate funding for our health services. The health services have been starved of funds by successive Governments.  We need additional funds if we are to have a proper health service.  It is only because of the commitment and dedication of people such as those running The Royal Hospital that the situation is not worse.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to be able to speak on this motion today.  I have been privileged to be a member of the management committee of The Royal Hospital for the past 12 years, representing the City Council.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The present by-laws are not in keeping with the practices of the hospital.  It was considered by the managing committee that it would be more appropriate to develop a new set which would reflect present day needs.  The structure and substance of the proposed new by-laws will concur closely with the hospital's needs for the future.  Since the original charter was signed in 1800 the hospital has changed for the better in many ways.  Today the hospital is quite a modern one with an excellent medical and nursing staff.  The staff are supplemented by other medics who specialise in physiotherapy, which is an important aspect of hospitals that deal with the elderly, particularly a hospital which deals with long-term patients.</P>
      <P>When speaking on the Nursing Bill here I spoke about the problems that public representatives have when they are approached by constituents about an aged parent who has suffered a stroke, who is in hospital, and for whom they are trying to find a nursing home.  It is difficult to deal with these problems.  The Royal Hospital plays a very important role in providing care for people who have suffered strokes.  They keep them in great comfort for the remainder of their lives.</P>
      <P>One of the most recent innovations of the hospital is that they implemented a rehabilitation service for young people. They also run a day centre which provides a service for many elderly people living in their catchment area.  One of the most unique aspects of the hospital is the friendliness of the people there.  Everyone in the hospital is happy.  I pay special tribute to the management under the secretary-manager Mr. Jim Darlington, the medical officer, the director of nursing care and the nursing staff, who contribute to this friendly atmosphere which is essential to the running of a good hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the hospital is the dedication of the board of management, some of whose members have served for many years and whose fathers <Col N="1911" /> served before them.  They are dedicated people who spend many hours of their free time visiting the patients of the hospital.  The Minister was generous in paying tribute to the nursing and medical staff in the hospital.  I know the Minister takes a special interest in the hospital, as did his predecessor, former Deputy Barry Desmond.  The hospital has been the beneficiary of generous contributions from the Department of Health in difficult times over the last number of years. I hope the hospital will continue to receive that kind of support from the Department of Health.  The hospital deserves all the support it can receive.  I welcome the proposal before the House and the amendment to the by-laws.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for their support of this draft order and for their praise of The Royal Hospital in Donnybrook.  On the point raised by Deputy Byrne about the name of the hospital, it was formerly The Royal Hospital for Incurables, but the name was changed in 1974 and it is now officially The Royal Hospital.  The hospital was founded in 1743, well before 1800 when George III gave them the charter.  Since that time people have sung the praises of The Royal Hospital for their work.  The hospital has 224 beds, 190 of which are long stay beds and 30 are rehabilitation beds.  They also have a very good day care centre.  We are in constant communication with them, the most recent time being in April this year about further development at the hospital.  We hope to see a new unit for more confused patients developed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a modern hospital.  The charter did not impede them from managing their hospital in a most efficient and professional way.  The hospital requested this amendment to the charter.  The main purpose of the amendment relates to the appointment of governors.  Governors were automatically appointed on the payment of an annual or life subscription. We are amending the charter to allow the management to appoint new governors or approve applications for appointment <Col N="1912" /> as governor, just to give them the flexibility and facilities modern day management would have in managing the hospital.  The original charter dates back to George III in 1800, but it did not impede them from doing a first class job. I have no doubt that they will continue to do that.  I again thank Deputies for their contributions here this morning. I have no doubt that the hospital will be happy that the charter has now passed through this House.  There has not been any delay on our part.  When the application was made we had to consult with the Commissioner of Charitable Donations and Bequests and draft the order.  As Deputies are aware, the order has already been laid before the Seanad and this is the final stage of passage through this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann resolves that sections 4 to 6, 8 to 10, 15, 16, 18 and 19 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (No. 22 of 1984), shall continue in operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion seeks Dáil approval for the continued operation of sections of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, concerning the detention of arrested persons in Garda custody in certain circumstances, the withholding of information regarding firearms, ammunition or stolen property and inferences which may be drawn by the court from an accused's failure to account for certain matters.  These provisions were brought into force on 1 July 1987.  The effect of section 2 of the 1984 Act is that those provisions will cease to operate after 30 June next unless both Houses resolve that they should continue in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said in the Seanad in recent days when speaking on the equivalent of this motion, the fundamental purpose of the 1984 Criminal Justice Act was to enhance the capacity of the Garda <Col N="1913" /> Síochána to deal with crime.  It is of the greatest importance in a democratic society that increased police powers be accompanied by appropriate safeguards. The reason for our discussing the 1984 Act now is primarily because as Members of the Oireachtas we have a shared concern to ensure that the safeguards put in place in this instance are working sufficiently well to warrant the continuance in operation of the sections of the Act which are referred to in the motion.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, our clear duty to bear in mind that the Act itself is aimed at protecting the public against the activities of criminals and that such protection of the community in general is also a matter which must be of central concern to all public representatives and, indeed, all members of society.  Crime is naturally a source of concern to society worldwide. Equally naturally, it is the subject of considerable media and political attention. For the person who is the victim of crime the reality is one of distress, the feeling of revulsion, of violation and a deep sense of injustice.  It is a mark of a caring society that it demands response to incidents of this kind and that such incidents become the subject of political and media attention.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps unavoidable that, from time to time, commentators may present an exaggerated picture of crime which does not sit easily with the facts.  This can tend to create an excessive sense of apprehension, particularly amongst those who are, or see themselves to be, vulnerable to crime or have recently been the victims of crime.  It is important that any commentator should understand the damaging impact overstatement in this area can have on the daily lives of the people we seek most to protect.  It is important, therefore, that they should also hear us say, first, that in recent years crime levels have come down significantly, and, second, that substantial changes have been brought about by way of resources allocation and otherwise to strengthen our capacity as a society to deal with crime.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat the salient points which the Minister for Justice enumerated while speaking to the Seanad Motion on 29 May 1991:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1914" /> In the period 1984 to 1990 crime figures fell by about 12 per cent overall from 99,727 to 87,658 while the number of convictions rose by 10 per cent from 16,396 to 17,957.</P>
    <P>Within these overall figures there are very encouraging trends, for example: offences against the person dropped by 30 per cent from 2,331 offences to 1,631; attacks on the elderly, one of the most despicable of crimes, fell by over 90 per cent from 432 to 51; residential burglaries came down 19 per cent from 18,774 to 15,160; unauthorised taking of cars came down 44 per cent from 18,735 to 10,521; larcenies from the person&mdash;down 23 per cent from 5,842 to 4,495; deaths on the road reduced by traffic law enforcement on an unprecedented scale &mdash; down 25 per cent in the first quarter of this year from 122 to 90; and armed raids, which peaked at 685 in 1986 were down 33 per cent by 1990 to 459.</P>
    <P>On the resources and other fronts: 1,000 Garda trainees will have been taken on in the two years to December 1991; a further 1,000 will be recruited in the next three years; by the end of this year, 500 extra gardaí will have been put on our streets since July 1989; over 120 gardaí in Dublin alone have been assigned to community policing duties.  Cork and Limerick have also benefited from this programme which will be further extended shortly and 350 experienced members of the force are being retained by a temporary extension of the retirement age of gardaí, sergeants and inspectors in order to strengthen the management of the force, some 660 promotions in their ranks have been authorised by Government since November 1989; in the last 18 months, 195 civilian staff have been taken on to release gardaí for outdoor duties.  A further 55 civilians will be taken on for this purpose before the end of the year; a sum of £10 million is being provided in this year's Estimates to upgrade Garda equipment of every kind; by the end of this year, £40 million will have been spent on the current Garda building programme; Garda juvenile liaison officers and public service vehicle inspectors have been put on the seven day roster to enable evening and weekend working by these members of the force; <Col N="1915" /> the juvenile liaison officer service is being totally reformed.  A national office to oversee this service was set up last December; community-based initiatives to rehabilitate young offenders have been set up in Dublin and Limerick and will be extended elsewhere; a Garda schools programme is now in place in 14 Dublin schools and will be extended to other population centres shortly; The Minister has obtained Government approval for the recruitment of a team of 31 extra probation officers in the current year to provide for an intensive supervision regime for about 200 offenders in the community as an alternative to custody; and there has been a major response to neighbourhood watch schemes with over 1,046 schemes now in operation covering 202,175 households.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is also currently examining proposals for an improved Garda service in rural areas. Deputies will recall the misleading comments reported in recent days in the media about this review.  I am glad to have this opportunity to put the true position on the record.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have submitted proposals to the Minister for reform and enhancement of the rural policing arrangements.  These arrangements have remained largely unchanged since the foundation of the State.  Any dispassionate observer will readily agree that policing in rural Ireland is ripe for fundamental review to ensure that rural communities are getting the Garda service they deserve and, as taxpayers, are entitled to.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat the point that the plan submitted to the Minister by the Garda authorities is not, as some have suggested, a cost saving exercise; neither is it a front for station closures.  The factual position is that it will involve substantially more, not less, expenditure on rural community policing.  It aims at substantially improved contact between the gardaí and the communities they serve in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to get gardaíin rural as well as urban areas out from behind desks to do the job for which they were recruited and trained.  Under the <Col N="1916" /> plan they will have more transport, new computer facilities, additional civilian clerical back-up and will see the abolition of outdated record-keeping.  For example, the number of forms to be filled at a Garda station will be reduced by more than half from the present number of 61.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat, there will be no closure or downgrading of Garda stations.  On the contrary, rural stations and Garda houses will be renovated, specifically to encourage gardaí to reside in the communities they serve.  These proposals will guarantee to the general public that their local station will be open during those hours it is officially due to be open.  At present the opening hours of rural Garda stations are unpredictable, with many of them closed for a quarter of their official opening hours.  This is something the Minister is determined to redress.</P>
    <P>Those who make a great play about the new proposals leading to severe restrictions in the opening hours of rural Garda stations might do well to inform themselves fully about the situation on the ground before making further inaccurate comments in this regard.  I should also point out that any reduction in the current opening hours for a particular station would tend to free the local Garda for outdoor crime prevention and detection duties in their local communities.</P>
    <P>The Minister considers it vitally important that expert advice received from the Garda authorities as to how rural community policing might be improved should receive full consideration.  He does not intend to be deflected from his examination of the plan on the basis of misleading comments as to what is involved.  Of course, full consideration will be given to all the views that have been put forward. both inside and outside this House, before any final decisions are made.</P>
    <P>The Garda associations have already been given the opportunity to put their views to the Garda authorities and to the Minister.  I can assure the House that he will weigh very carefully the views of all interested parties before finalising the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Minister's major concern at this point is to reassure the rural community <Col N="1917" />&mdash; some of whom, for example, the elderly, may have been unnecessarily distressed by the misleading and politically motivated statements which have been made&mdash;that the aim of the Garda plan is to make their communities safer from the activities of criminals and not the opposite.  The aim is to devise ways in which the Garda service to rural areas can be improved.  There is no hidden agenda in the Garda plans for rural policing and I deplore the irresponsible comments being made which suggest otherwise.</P>
    <P>On the legislative front the Minister has been responsible for significant advances and in particular: the larceny Act, 1989; the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990; the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1990; and the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>The whole question of drug-related criminal activity has again become the subject of widespread and justifiable public concern.  People feel that this menace, which was brought within bounds in recent years, is re-emerging as a problem on our streets.  The Minister has discussed this issue in depth with the Garda authorities who, while reporting an increase in the level of drug seizures in recent years, mostly cannabis, say there is no question of the problem being on the scale which existed some years ago.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that the drugs problem is continuing to receive priority attention from a law enforcement point of view.  All members of the Garda Síochána deal with law enforcement aspects of drug misuse within their operational area.  In addition, specific Garda drug squads operate in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, and, at present, small specialist units are in operation in Dublin's north inner city, Ballymun, Ballyfermot and Tallaght.  Similar specialist units are set up on a temporary basis in other areas as required.  The strategies employed include intelligence gathering and analysis, surveillance, targeting and monitoring the activities of suspects as well as routine investigations.</P>
    <P>There exists a high level of ongoing liaison with the customs authorities, <Col N="1918" /> which provides for exchange of information and for joint operations in major cases.  This liaison includes meetings as required at senior level to exchange information and views on current trends and mutual problems.  The Minister for Justice has been informed by the Garda authorities that the strategies are proving very effective.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to develop and coordinate effective measures against drugs on an international level and this problem is being addressed in a number of fora in which representatives from this country are actively involved, such as TREVI, police group; CELAD, co-ordinators from member states; MAG, customs group; POMPIDOU, Council of Europe, and the United Nations.  However, law enforcement on its own will never solve the drugs problem.  This is an area in which the role of parents, teachers and other agencies caring for our young people is at least as important as the Garda response.</P>
    <P>I was pleased that I was chairman of the Government's National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse for the past year.  The need for a national drugs strategy has been recognised by the Government.  We presented our report and recommendations to them earlier this year and they were accepted.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, recently launched the Government's strategy to prevent drug misuse.  The intention is to tackle the drugs problem on every front.  Realistic and achievable objectives have been set for the reduction both in the supply and demand for drugs.</P>
    <P>Again on the legislative side, the Minister for Justice has announced plans which he believes will make a major contribution towards the fight against drugs. Very shortly he will publish legislation to provide for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and money laundering.  I have no doubt that this legislation will be widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>The bringing into operation of the sections of the 1984 Act referred to in the resolution before the House was subject, under section 1 (2) of the Act, to two important matters.  The first of these was the enactment of legislation relating to <Col N="1919" /> the investigation and adjudication of complaints from the public against members of the Garda Síochána.  Secondly, there was a requirement that regulations for the treatment of persons in Garda custody be made under section 7 of the Act.</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986, which provides procedures for handling Garda complaints, the Garda Síochána Complaints Board were set up under the Act in April 1987.  In view of the backlog of complaints with the board, perhaps I should at this stage, say something about the matter and the operation of the board generally.  The Act requires the board to keep under review the workings of the system of investigation and adjudication of complaints and to make a report thereon every three years.  The first such report by the board, their Triennial Report 1987 to 1989, was published just a year ago. This report gave a very full account of the board's activities up to then.  It contained comments and recommendations on the Act and included chapters on staffing and on possible less costly alternatives to the present system.  However, it is particularly noteworthy that the board indicate in the report that their conclusion is that the Complaints Act is basically sound and provides an adequate legislative basis for the proper investigation of complaints.</P>
    <P>With regard to staffing, the report referred to a less than satisfactory situation and it called for additional permanent staff for the board plus temporary staff to clear the backlog of complaints.  The receipt of a greater number of complaints than anticipated when the staffing complement was being decided was a major cause of the backlog of arrears.  However, the volume of complaints received has been dropping steadily since 1987 and I understand that this is in line with the experience in other countries when a new complaints board is established.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, of course, shares the board's concern about the backlog of complaints.  His concern is both with the position of the public and with that of the members of the force about whom complaints are made and <Col N="1920" /> in whose interests it is that complaints should be dealt with promptly.  It was for this reason that, on assuming office as Minister for Justice in July 1989 and on being made aware of the board's position, he immediately took up with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, the question of additional staffing resources for the board.  He subsequently obtained agreement to the sanctioning of four extra staff members for the board, thereby increasing their complement from six to ten.</P>
    <P>All of these extra staff were made available by redeployment from elsewhere in the public service and assigned to the board by December 1989.  The nature of the work involved, however, means that it takes some time for additional staff to make an impact on the volume of arrears.  However, the impact of the extra staff is reflected in the reduction which has been brought about in the real backlog of complaints from about 750 last November to under 500 today, a decrease of about one-third in six months.  Nevertheless, it is the Minister's wish that the backlog would be cleared completely and, therefore, notwithstanding this improvement, he is still actively pursuing the possibility of providing staff resources for the board and provision for this purpose has been made in the board's allocation in this year's Estimates.</P>
    <P>The second matter I referred to earlier, namely, regulations regarding the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations, came into force in May 1987.  The regulations impose a duty on the Garda to act with due respect for the personal rights of persons in custody and their dignity as human persons.</P>
    <P>As required by the 1984 Act, the regulations include provision for the assignment to a member of the Garda Síochána of appropriate rank in each Garda station of responsibility for overseeing the application of the regulations to persons in custody.  That responsibility includes such matters as ensuring that persons in custody are informed of their rights and arranging for a solicitor to be contacted or some other person to be notified where a person in custody has decided to exercise those entitlements.  The member in <Col N="1921" /> charge also has overall responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of custody records which provide a full and detailed account of any period during which persons are in custody in the Garda station. The regulations were approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas prior to their being brought into operation.</P>
    <P>I turn now to each of the sections of the 1984 Act which are the subject of the resolution before the House.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Act gives the Garda power to detain for up to six hours a person who has been arrested without warrant for an offence carrying a penalty of at least five years imprisonment.  The six hour detention period may be extended for a further six hours on the authority of a Garda superintendent.  A period between midnight and 8 a.m. during which questioning does not take place may be excluded in calculating the permitted period of detention if certain requirements, which include the agreement in writing of the suspect, are satisfied.</P>
    <P>In considering section 4 it is important to bear in mind that it contains the only general legislative power the Garda have to detain, for questioning, persons who are reasonably suspected of having committed a serious crime.  There is a power to arrest and detain persons under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, but that provision deals only with a limited range of crimes&mdash;it does not cover, for example, ordinary murder, rape or robbery.</P>
    <P>Prior to the late seventies the Garda operated on the basis that they could ask a suspect to go to a Garda station to &ldquo;help them with their inquiries&rdquo;.  That situation changed completely about 1977 when the courts overturned the Garda practice in these situations and held that it was unlawful.  The courts also rejected as inadmissible in evidence confessions or incriminating statements obtained during periods when it was adjudged that an accused person had been unlawfully detained.  The Garda difficulties in the matter were also exacerbated by court decisions to the effect that where a person went to a Garda station voluntarily and the stage was reached where he came under suspicion for the offence, then he <Col N="1922" /> had to be told by the Garda that he was free to leave the station unless and until he was arrested.  That new requirement could involve interrupting a suspect who was freely making a statement containing an admission of guilt and from a Garda viewpoint it virtually destroyed the practical value of being able to &ldquo;invite&rdquo; persons to the station.</P>
    <P>The position prior to section 4 which I have mentioned helps to illustrate the problems that the Garda faced before its enactment.  The need for the detention powers as such in section 4 is, I think, beyond dispute.  Much more extensive detention powers for investigating crime operate in other European countries &mdash; in the United Kingdom, for example, detention in police custody for up to 36 hours is permitted for the investigation of a serious offence and after that period the suspect may be brought before a magistrate who may order the person to be further detained up to a maximum of 36 hours.</P>
    <P>The real question we have to ask ourselves is whether safeguards built into section 4 to minimise abuse are satisfactory and have, in fact, minimised abuse.  The safeguards in the section are stringent.  Before a person can be detained, he must have been arrested, with reasonable cause, on suspicion of having committed a serious offence.  The member in charge of the Garda station to which the suspect is taken must have reasonable grounds for believing that detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence.</P>
    <P>The arresting garda and the member in charge are liable to be cross-examined on the reasonableness of their actions and it is open to a court to decide whether, in all the circumstances, their actions were justified.  This is also the situation where a Garda superintendent extends detention beyond an initial six hours.  The superintendent can only authorise such an extension on the basis of reasonable grounds for believing that further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence.</P>
    <P>The operation of section 4 is limited in other important respects.  A detained person must be released forthwith if there <Col N="1923" /> are no longer reasonable grounds for suspecting that he has committed the offence for which detention is permissible.  Once a person is charged, questioning must stop and the person must be brought before a district justice as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be interested, therefore, in the way in which section 4 has operated in practice.  The Garda authorities were requested to maintain statistics on the operation of the section and the relevant information is contained in a table which I have arranged to be circulated to Deputies.</P>
    <P>In the period 1 July 1987 to the end of December 1990 a total of 24,095 persons were detained under section 4.  This I believe, demonstrates the importance of section 4 to the Garda.  Of those who were detained, 58 per cent were charged with an offence for which they were held under the section.  That figure comprises those who were charged immediately or on the spot so to speak and those who were released without charge but subsequently charged with an offence for which they had been detained.  The very high proportion of persons charged provides a clear indication that persons are being detained under section 4 where there is a real suspicion that they have committed a serious crime.</P>
    <P>It is also significant that the number of cases where detention was extended beyond six hours was approximately 16 per cent of the total number of persons detained.  That figure could not be described as excessive and certainly lends weight to the view that the Garda have exercised their powers under section 4 in a responsible manner.</P>
    <P>This is something that also emerges from the statistics for the lengths of time after which persons were charged or were released without charge: for example, well over 50 per cent of the persons who were released without charge were released after detention for under three hours; and detention was extended in only 11 per cent of cases where the person was released and not charged.  On the basis of the information available to him, the Minister is satisfied that section 4, containing as it does reasonable powers <Col N="1924" /> of detention and safeguards, should indeed continue to be part of our law.</P>
    <P>Sections 5, 6 and 8 to 10 referred to in the resolution are related in one form or another to section 4 but are important provisions in their own right.</P>
    <P>Section 5 imposes a duty on the member in charge of a Garda station to inform a person detained under section 4 that he is entitled to consult a solicitor and to have notification of his detention and whereabouts sent to another person. Upon request, the member in charge is required to cause a solicitor and a person named by the detained to be notified. Where the detained person is under 17 years of age, a parent or guardian of that person must be informed of his detention. I might point out that the Supreme Court has since held, in People (DPP) v. Healy, December 1989, that a person detained by the Garda has a constitutional right to consult a solicitor if he wishes to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 6 gives necessary powers to the Garda authorities to carry out a full and proper investigation of the offence or offences for which a person is detained under section 4.</P>
    <P>A garda may obtain the name and address of the detained person, search him, photograph him, take his fingerprints and palm prints, and seize and retain for testing anything he has in his possession.  The section also allows swabs from skin or samples of hair to be taken for the purpose of testing for contact with firearms or explosives.  However, the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, repeals and re-enacts that particular provision with more extensive provisions in relation to the taking of bodily samples.  Arrangements are being made to bring that Act into operation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The section places a number of restrictions on the Garda where the exercise of the more intrusive powers conferred is involved.  A detained person cannot be photographed or fingerprinted or required to remove certain clothing without the prior authority of a Garda superintendent. In exercising those powers there must be reasonable cause to suspect that the person is concealing drugs or explosives on his person.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note from the table I <Col N="1925" /> have circulated that the number of cases where fingerprints were taken under section 6 for the period 1 July 1987 to the end of December 1990 was 5,501 and that a search involving the removal of underclothing was authorised in 1,274 cases.  These figures represent 23 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, of the total number of persons detained and there is nothing in them to suggest that the powers conferred on the Garda are being excessively used.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that every copy and record of a photograph, fingerprint and palm print of a person taken under section 6 must be destroyed after six months if the detained person is not prosecuted or if he is acquitted.  The person concerned is entitled to witness, or to have another person witness, the destruction of the photographs etc. if he so requests.  In the event that the DPP wishes to retain section 6 material when it would otherwise have to be destroyed, he must satisfy a district justice that the material may be required for the purpose of criminal proceedings in relation to the offence for which the person was detained.</P>
    <P>Section 9 applies certain provisions of the 1984 Act to detention under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  These include the right of access to a solicitor and the requirement that the taking of photographs and fingerprints must be authorised by a Garda superintendent or higher officer.</P>
    <P>Section 10 contains safeguards against rearrest and detention under section 4 for the same offence.  A detained person may not be arrested again for the same offence unless it is for the purpose of charging him with the offence immediately or, the Garda receive further information and a district justice authorises the rearrest.  A similar restriction operates in relation to the use of section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act where a section 4 detainee is released because, in order to detain that person under section 30, he would have to be arrested and, accordingly, section 10 would apply.  A person who is arrested for an offence under section 30 and not charged cannot be detained under section 4 for the same offence or for an offence of which he <Col N="1926" /> was or reasonably ought to have been suspected at the time of the initial arrest.</P>
    <P>I turn now to sections 15, 16, 18 and 19 of the 1984 Act covering certain matters other than detention.  Sections 15 and 16, respectively, make it an offence to withhold information about the source of illegally held firearms, ammunition and stolen property.  The Garda must have reasonable grounds to suspect that the firearm, ammunition or stolen property is illegally held.  The Garda must also explain to the person the consequences of his failure to provide the required information.  Any information given cannot be used against the person or his spouse unless he is charged with an offence under the section.  Although the number of prosecutions under the sections has been few, the Minister has been advised by the Garda authorities that the provisions are of importance in Garda efforts to get at the source of supply of arms used for criminal purposes and the source of stolen property.  There were four and five prosecutions, respectively, under sections 15 and 16 for the period 1 July 1987 to the end of December 1990.</P>
    <P>Section 18 allows a court or a jury to draw an inference from the failure or refusal of an accused, when questioned by a garda, to account for the presence of an object, substance or mark either on his person or clothing in the place where he is arrested without warrant.  The idea behind the section is that a suspect could be expected to account for, say, a stain on his clothing which might be attributable to his participation in a specific offence.  This is no more than common sense and it is something a jury would, in any event, be fully aware of apart from this section.  Section 19 allows an inference to be drawn where the arrested person fails or refuses to account for his presence at or about the time the offence for which he was arrested was committed. The Garda must inform the person about the consequences of his failure or refusal to comply with the sections and a person cannot be convicted solely on the basis of an inference drawn under those sections. The number of persons failing to comply with sections 18 and 19 was only two and <Col N="1927" /> 13 respectively, for the period 1 July 1987 to the end of December 1990.</P>
    <P>Apart from the statistics I have made available about the numbers of cases arising under the sections of the 1984 Act, Deputies will be interested to know that the Garda Complaints Board have informed the Minister that, while the statistical system operated by the board does not link complaints to specific sections in the 1984 Act or indeed any other Act, the board can say that they have received very few complaints relating to the 1984 Act.</P>
    <P>That more or less concludes what I have to say about the sections referred to in the resolution.  However, I should like to say something about another section in the Act, section 27, which provides that the Minister for Justice may provide for the recording by electronic or other similar means of the questioning of persons by members of the Garda Síochána in connection with the investigation of offences.</P>
    <P>The need for such recording was considered in detail by the Martin Committee in the context of their examination of the need for additional safeguards, given that an uncorroborated inculpatory admission to the Garda Síochána can be sufficient evidence to ground a conviction. The Martin Committee, in their report, outline the many safeguards which exist at present in relation to Garda questioning of suspects &mdash; for example, the right to remain silent, the Judges' Rules, the right of access to legal advice, the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986, and the responsibility which the Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations Regulations, 1987, place on the member in charge in a Garda station in relation to persons in custody.  Indeed, it is worth noting that the Martin Committee state in their report as follows:</P>
    <P>... we should state, however, that the submissions received from practitioners, and in particular from defence practitioners, are unanimous <Col N="1928" /> to the effect that the coming into force of the Regulations for the Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Stations, coupled with the setting up of the Garda Complaints Board, has resulted in the virtual disappearance of complaints of physical ill-treatment or threats of violence.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that the existing safeguards, and in particular those which were introduced subsequent to the 1984 Act, play a very important role in ensuring that the rights of the person being questioned are upheld.</P>
    <P>Our Department and the Garda authorities looked into the possibility of introducing arrangements for the audio recording, that is sound only, of the questioning of suspects by the Garda Síochána, similar to arrangements which were in operation in some other countries. However, in view of developments in technology, some countries which had introduced audio recording are now trying out video recording on a trial basis.</P>
    <P>The Martin Committee also considered the question of introducing audio recording, which would cost substantially less than video recording, but came down in favour of the latter.  We are now in a position to avail ourselves of the experience of other countries in relation to both audio and video recording and to ensure that any system introduced takes account of the lessons learned in other countries and makes the best use of scarce financial resources.</P>
    <P>As Members will appreciate, the introduction of video recording means that video evidence, even during a pilot scheme, will be available to the court. It is essential, therefore, that all issues regarding the operation of the system are decided upon in advance of the introduction of a pilot scheme.  The Minister for Justice is considering this matter at present and he hopes to be in a position to put proposals in relation to a pilot scheme before the Government shortly.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied that all of the sections of the 1984 Act referred to in the resolution should continue in operation. The view of the Garda authorities is that <Col N="1929" /> the provisions have played a vital role in the detection and prosecution of serious crime.  It seems clear also that the provisions have played their part in deterring people from criminal acts.  The Minister for Justice has no doubt that, as regards the section 4 detention provisions in particular, the vast majority of people would accept that the Garda must for the purpose of questioning and conducting investigations and inquiries have the power to detain for a reasonable period those persons who are suspected of having committed crimes, which may include murder, drug trafficking and serious robbery.</P>
    <P>All the indications now, in the light of experience for the four years of their operation, are that the 1984 Act provisions in question have operated satisfactorily. I therefore commend the resolution to the House.</P>

      <P>Before dealing with the various sections of this Act, which the resolution seeks to renew, I should like to consider the overall effect of the Act in relation to crime since it was enacted. This Act was introduced by the 1982-87 Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government because it was felt that the powers available to the Garda Síochána needed to be increased.  I recall a great deal of opposition from the party now in Government and I welcome the fact that they have come to realise it was good legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The rules under which the Garda were working were clearly hampering them in their efforts to combat crime and full advantage of this was being taken by various criminal elements.  This Act has helped considerably in dealing with the problems of crime.  Whatever the figures are today, I have no doubt that they would be far worse if this Act had not been introduced. The Government are attempting to convince the electorate, particularly before the local elections, that crime rates have <Col N="1930" /> reduced significantly.  I do not know where the Minister is getting his facts.  I will quote one example from my own constituency which disputes this assertion.</P>
      <P>In the Shankill area of County Dublin there were 256 recorded house break-ins in 1990.  In 1987 there were 167.  The Minister, in reply to a parliamentary question tabled by me recently, stated that the tentative estimate for the first three months of this year in the same area is 135 house break-ins.  If this trend continues it would mean that we would have over 500 house break-ins in 1991 in Shankill alone, double the figure for 1990.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government are parading around the country trying to convince members of the public that crimes rates are reducing.  If we engage in that sort of fairytale we will not wake up and realise that there is a real problem. It shows how much the Government are out of touch with the electorate.  I cannot understand how a Minister can stand up in this House or outside it and publicly say that crime rates are dropping.  I repeat that in 1990 in the Shankill area alone there were 256 recorded house break-ins. This information was supplied by way of parliamentary question.  In the first three months of 1991 the figure was 135.  Multiply it by four and you have in excess of 500 if the trend continues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is 50 per cent of what was there last year.  You can quote figures if you wish, but it depends upon the period you choose.  I am dealing with what is happening today on the ground. Anybody who has been out canvassing for the local elections knows the facts as presented by the Minister are false.  The public are quite aware that there is a serious crime problem facing all of us.  I have no doubt also that a number of people have stopped reporting crimes, especially minor burglaries, petty thieving and vandalism causing damage to property.  The fact that these crimes go unreported is a measure of people's despair of anything being done about it. People are afraid to walk our streets for <Col N="1931" /> fear of being mugged.  They are afraid to open their doors at night.  I suggest to the Taoiseach and his Ministers that they canvass parts of Dublin, particularly where there are old people, and knock on a door after 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. and see if they will get an answer.  They will see perhaps a lady living on her own looking out the window afraid to open the door. In many areas in the city people are afraid to leave their cars.  All these are facts, not fiction.</P>
      <P>It is true that increasing the number of gardaí alone will not solve the problem of increasing crime.  As long as we have over 250,000 people unemployed, continued drug abuse, lack of educational facilities for a large section of our population, we will have high crime.  I do not suggest that any of these problems constitutes an excuse for committing crime; but as long as we have the current social problems affecting vast sections of our society, especially in the urban areas, whether we like it or not, if unemployment continues at its present high level, with no job prospects available particularly for young people, we will have crime.  If a very high proportion of our young people in certain areas in urban Ireland find it impossible to get to third level education or advanced training at that level we will have massive unemployment resulting in high crime.</P>
      <P>Another scandal is the national lottery legislation which was put through this House to provide resources in particular for sporting and recreational facilities.  I know what I am talking about because I was involved in it.  The intention was that with this money we would build up throughout the country sufficient centres where people could spend their spare time in a positive, constructive way through recreation and sport.  I have yet to see one hoarding in any part of the country which indicates clearly that this development is by way of national lottery funds.  I produced a plan, which the Opposition at the time criticised&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of us worked at it, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to build a number <Col N="1932" /> of regional centres throughout the country. The locations were identified, negotiations had commenced and we heard a big outcry because we were not going ahead first with a national stadium.  I am blue in the face reading that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is announcing for the 54th time that some day they will be proceeding with a national indoor centre down on the quays.  I have not yet seen a sod turned.  The Government are now four years in office.  Where has the money gone from the national lottery for sport and recreation?  We know much of it has gone into facilities in the constituencies of Ministers and Deputies from the other side of the House and given to clubs who do not really need the money.  Compare a private golf club getting national lottery funds to what I experienced recently when I attended the annual general meeting of the Ballybrack Boys' Football Club, of which I am proud to be president.  That club caters for 13 juvenile teams mainly in local authority housing estates.  The cost of running that club is about £11,000 per annum through insurance costs and transport costs for the young kids, many of whose parents are unemployed.  Not one penny is available to clubs like that from our national lottery to assist in their running and provide a social service to an area which is much in need of help.  If you happen to be in a Minister's constituency and you want national lottery funds for some project or other that might produce a few votes, yes, you have a fair chance of getting it; but not for the people most in need.  We are fortunate that we have dedicated people who are spending four or five nights per week looking after young children in areas of massive unemployment and lack of facilities, and let me say those people who so give up their spare time have families also.  In addition they have to go around begging their friends and neighbours to buy a ticket in a draw or attend a dance to keep a small club like this going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then you wonder why there is vandalism in many areas, particularly urban Ireland.  Are we fooling ourselves?  What is happening to this money?  Why is it not being used in this area?  Prevention is better than cure.  Again I am not making <Col N="1933" /> excuses for people to engage in crime because they find themselves unemployed or in difficult circumstances, but as long as those social problems are present we will have crime.  As long as there is drug abuse there will be house break-ins and similar type offences because people need money to feed their habits.</P>
    <P>Again, I call on the Minister for Justice to establish a criminal law reform commission to review and update the criminal law and bring it into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>Regarding juvenile crime, we must look at parental responsibility as well as the provision of adequate places in detention centres.  I mention parental responsibility deliberately.  It confuses me, and a number of people I speak to, that 13, 14 and 15-year-olds are consistently appearing in the District Court in this city and other urban areas with 40 or 50 charges against them of house break-ins, vandalism &mdash; you name it.  All these are offences being committed at 12 midnight, 1 a.m., 2 a.m.  These young people are allowed out on our streets at 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. breaking into people's homes, damaging people's property and nobody asking where the parents are or who is responsible.  Of course, we have to help. We have to take those children and, unfortunately, perhaps put them into a detention centre for a period, hoping when they are in there they will get some sort of help to wean them off a future of crime.</P>
    <P>These children are returning to exactly the same situation they left.  Having spent all that money on trying to help, cajole and provide adequate detention centres they walk back into a home where the parents do not bother.  I do not accept any parent saying to me that they have lost control of their 12-year-old or 13-year-old child.  It is important that we modernise our laws.</P>
    <P>It is important that we, as elected representatives of the people, face up to the sort of problems that society is experiencing today rather than concentrate on laws which were meant for a different time and a different era.  When people drive in certain streets in the city and stop at traffic lights, a group of 13-year-olds or 14-year-olds can smash the window of <Col N="1934" /> the car, take a handbag from the back seat and run off and nobody asks where the parents are.  Some parents are responsible if their child gets involved consistently in crime.  I do not say that all parents of children who get into trouble are at fault.  Unfortunately there is always the wayward one and there are occasions when parents do their best and still it may happen once or twice.  When it happens 40 or 50 times there is no excuse.</P>
    <P>There are many instances where, in addition to the child receiving help, the parents need assistance but there is no system of making certain that those parents receive the help and guidance they need to look after their children properly because our system does not cater for that.  When a child has to appear in a District Court it is not obligatory that the parents be informed that the child is in court.  Under a particular section in this Act if a child under 17 years, is in a police station for questioning on a serious offence involving a sentence in excess of five years, we are obliged to inform the parent or guardian that the juvenile is in a police station.  If it involves a less serious crime but still affecting society, the parents are not informed.  If we want to have parental responsibility, we must change our laws to involve parents at a very early stage and let them know what is happening before it is too late.</P>
    <P>We must also face up to the fact that crime has become big business.  It is time we gave our courts discretion in deciding where assets which were clearly built up as a result of criminal activities could be confiscated.  Detention alone is no longer a deterrent for some criminals.  I am encouraged to hear the Minister say that at long last we are getting the legislation we asked for in relation to the confiscation of assets derived from drug dealing, but it should go beyond that.</P>
    <P>Somebody breaks into a home and takes £400, £500, £1,000, £2,000, £3,000 or whatever it may be, which I and many people like me may have been saving for a long time to get a present for our wives or children or certain items for the house.  It might be repayments on a loan from the bank.  Although we are paying high premiums for household insurance cover lo and behold someone can walk <Col N="1935" /> in, take our property, walk away &mdash; obviously there is some way they can sell them and build up a very nice nestegg.  If we are fortunate enough to catch them &mdash; there is a one in five chance that we may catch them &mdash; the justice may decide to put them into prison.  When they go to Mountjoy Prison it costs me, the taxpayer, in excess of £600 per week.  When they return to normal society they proceed to enjoy the proceeds of my property and that of other people.  This is a great way of making a living.</P>
    <P>Nobody asks me &mdash; the victim of crime &mdash; anything about my property.  Why should not that person, having been caught, return to me the value of the goods they took from me or if they do not have the assets why can an attachment order not be placed on their future earnings when they will say to me: &ldquo;yes, I am responsible for repaying you the £1,000 worth I took from you and from your neighbours&rdquo;?  Then, we might do something practical about crime.  Everybody here knows there are certain individuals who know they are likely to spend three months in the &ldquo;Joy&rdquo; but it is worthwhile because the business is probably worth £30,000 or £40,000 per year.  Following three months in prison at the taxpayers' expense &mdash; £600 per week &mdash; they come out and enjoy my property.  It would be cheaper to send them to the Berkeley Court.  Certainly putting them into prison will not act as a deterrent. The day you say to them: &ldquo;Crime no longer pays and that you have got to return to society what you took out of society&rdquo;, then you might stop them breaking into the 500 houses which I anticipate will have been broken into in Shankill in this year alone.  In the first three months 135 houses were broken into in that area.  It is evident from the canvass I am doing in that area that people are afraid to walk our streets.  It is gone beyond a joke.</P>
    <P>I am totally in support of giving a person a reasonable chance of defending themselves; I am totally in support of providing every possible protection to society so that powers will not be abused, that the courts will behave in a reasonable way and that people have representation <Col N="1936" /> in court.  It is important to remember that when these laws were drawn which established these principles, they were different times and we were dealing with different types of criminals, people who were uneducated and could not represent themselves, people who were illiterate and who came from a background of complete and utter hopelessness.  Today's criminal is a different kettle of fish altogether. Today we have sophisticated criminals engaging in big business, in drug dealing and in bank raids.  These are not all uneducated.  They can march into a court and defend their right to have legal representation paid for by the taxpayer, but the poor unfortunate victim of crime gets help from nobody.  When that person's insurance premium is due for renewal his insurance premium will increase.  Not alone have they lost their goods but now they have to pay more insurance costs for cover if they succeed in getting it for the next 12 months.  If anybody tries to tell me that that is for the good of society I will eat my that.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the section of the Minister's contribution dealing with the Garda.  The Minister makes great play of the fact that 1,000 gardaí will be recruited over the next three years but he overlooks the fact that in the same period almost 1,000 gardaí will be retiring.  We recruit 1,000 gardaí to replace the 1,000 gardaí who will retire.  That is very sensible, but do not try to fool the public that Garda strength is being increased by a further 1,000 or that because we recruited an additional 1,000 gardaí in the last two years the strength of the Garda Síochána has increased by a further 1,000.  The reality is that, while there were 11,400 gardaí in 1985 this figure had been reduced by 1990, even after the recruitment of an additional 1,000 gardaí to 10,500.  There are 900 fewer gardaí today than there were in 1985.  I do not know how the Minister will be able to deal with the increased level of crime and more sophisticated criminals if the Garda strength continues to be reduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister can continue to deny that there are problems in both urban and rural Garda stations, but if he visits my constituency he will see the problems <Col N="1937" /> with which gardaí have to deal.  The numbers of gardaí in the Garda stations in Cabinteely, Dún Laoghaire and Blackrock have been reduced since 1987. Those facts were supplied to me by way of reply to a parliamentary question.  The only exception relates to the Garda station in Dalkey where there are 26 gardaí, the same number as in 1987.</P>
    <P>If 32 gardaí are allocated to a station that number has to be immediately divided by four as there are four rosters &mdash; three shifts and one rest period.  This leaves a total of eight gardaí on duty at any time.  One also has to take into consideration that gardaí will be on station duty and special duties such as protecting embassies etc.  Cabinteely Garda station covers an area where seven cars were burnt recently in the driveways of both local authority and private houses. It is only through the mercy of God that the cars did not explode and the houses were not burnt down.  Only two gardaí for Cabinteely Garda station are on night shift in that area.  The Minister can check this by telephone if he so wishes.  The Minister can play around with figures and try to confuse the public with PR stunts, but that is the reality.  The chief superintendent in Dún Laoghaire is left in the position where he has only two gardaí available to patrol an area where crime, drug abuse and house break-ins are rampant. When gardaí recently tried to arrest people who were selling drugs in an adjoining area, Kill-o-the-Grange, they were attacked by pit bull terriers.  Hooligans patrol the open spaces outside the buildings where the drugs are being sold and when gardaí move in they are attacked by these pit bull terriers.  Some of the gardaí involved in the incident to which I referred ended up in hospital.</P>
    <P>I do not know how two gardaí are expected to patrol this substantial area in terms of houses and population at night time when most crimes are committed.  It is mainly at night that cars are burnt in driveways and houses broken into. How can the Minister expect two gardaí to cover such a wide area and deal with such criminals?  I have received correspondence from people who are rightly concerned about the 999 system.  It may take up to three quarters of an hour <Col N="1938" /> before the gardaí are able to respond to an emergency call.  If the two gardaí on duty are investigating a crime it may take them an hour before they can deal with any other emergency call.</P>
    <P>If the Garda strength continues to be reduced and our laws are not changed there will be more crime and the public we are supposed to represent will have less protection.  As I said at a recent meeting, what is the point in balancing the books and getting our current budget deficit and balance of payments in order if people are afraid to walk the streets, old people are afraid to leave their homes at night time, people's homes are being broken into and young people are being attacked getting off buses or trains after an evening out?  What good will a reduction in our current budget deficit be to a lady who lives in a semi-detached house, who has worked hard all her life, raised her children and lost her husband and who has to put two bolts and three locks on the door at 8 p.m. in the evening? This woman cannot enjoy life, she is afraid to go out.  She is reluctant to visit her daughter, son or neighbours because she is afraid that her house will be broken into while she is out.  That woman is living in constant fear.  Society has an obligation to provide adequate protection for such people.  I am prepared to pay, by way of taxation, an adequate sum of money so that these people can be protected and go about their daily business.</P>
    <P>The juvenile liaison scheme, which has a big part to play in preventing crime, or at least preventing crime becoming more serious, has been under-utilised and underfunded and promises made by the Minister in this area have not been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The situation in regard to the custodial care of juvenile offenders is most unsatisfactory, with the buck being passed between the Minister for Health, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Education.  Surely it is time that the matter of custodial care of juvenile offenders was made the responsibility of one Minister?  Until this happens the custodial care issue will continue to be a political football.</P>
    <P>The neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes have been a great <Col N="1939" /> success but, again more resources must be placed against these schemes in view of their cost effectiveness in terms of preventing crime through citizens' co-operation with the Garda.  We must provide adequate resources to encourage active co-operation between members of the public and the Garda Síochána.  The Garda cannot deal with the problem of crime on their own; they need the co-operation of society.  I would encourage members of the public to co-operate with the Garda.  However, in order for these schemes to be effective &mdash; like the Minister, I accept that they have been effective &mdash; a reasonable level of resources has to be provided.</P>
    <P>In regard to more serious crime, there is no room for complacency about the menace of drug trafficking in our cities. While there is evidence that the grave situation of few years ago no longer exists, there is considerable unease among community and public representatives, particularly in the Dublin area, that the problem is on the increase again.  In this regard I would warn the Minister that the virtual elimination of customs controls throughout the European Community after 1992 is going to make the detection and prevention of drug trafficking much more difficult for the authorities.  I would ask the Minister, in his reply, to state what steps he is taking to ensure that 1992 does not lead to a bonanza for the international drug trade as far as Ireland is concerned.</P>
    <P>Another matter of great concern to members of the general public is the question of fraud, especially large scale and systematic fraud.  During the past couple of years we have seen a huge increase in serious fraud.  These frauds involve millions of pounds.  They have taken place in all sorts of companies and enterprises, public companies, private companies, semi-State companies, banks and so on.  The law in relation to fraud has not kept pace with changes in society.  To all intents and purposes the most up-to-date law we have in relation to fraud is the Larceny Act, 1916.  Other legislation designed to deal with fraud goes back to Victorian times, to the 1870s, to the Debtors (Ireland) Act of 1872 and the <Col N="1940" /> Falsification of Accounts Act of 1875.  Is it any wonder we cannot deal with the problem of white collar crime when our laws date back to 1872, 1875 and 1916? It is about time the Minister woke up and realised that we need a criminal law reform commission to look at these laws and bring them up to date.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to state what he is doing in relation to the crime of major fraud.  What is he doing to ensure that the Garda Fraud Squad is equipped by way of training and expert personnel to inquire into allegations of fraud, to collect sufficient evidence in relation to allegations of fraud which can be put before a court?  Would he say what steps he is taking to see that the prosecuting authorities are equipped to bring cases against people suspected of engaging in large scale fraud?  It is an affront to the public to see people getting away with fraud, embezzlement and other types of white collar crime while much less serious offences are dealt with.  It is time it was realised that fraud is a serious offence and we must have the laws to deal with it.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, in relation to these sections of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, the provisions seem to be working in a satisfactory manner.  Section 4, which is the most important of the sections we are dealing with today, provides for a modest increase in the power of the Garda to detain people in custody who are reasonably suspected of having committed a serious crime.  It is not generally realised that in no country in the world have the police authorities got less power to detain people for questioning than the Garda in this country.  Therefore it is to the credit of the Garda that they have operated this Act and have been reasonably successful in doing so.  In this country we have a good balance in terms of the rights of detention.  People argue that the period of detention should be longer in some cases, but overall we have struck a good balance and the system seems to be working well.  Therefore I see no reason against the renewal of that section.  As the Minister said, the section gives the Garda power to detain somebody for up to six hours, extended by another six hours on the authority of a superintendent.  This <Col N="1941" /> power is obviously a great help to the Garda in their attempt to bring criminals to justice and there is no evidence that it has been abused in any way.  Therefore I am satisfied that it should continue in operation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is obviously a safeguard in that it makes it mandatory for the Garda to inform a person detained that he is entitled to consult a solicitor and to have somebody told that he is in custody. Section 6 gives the Garda specific powers in relation to searching, photographing, fingerprinting and taking samples of hair, skin and so on for the purposes of testing. Again, there are safeguards against abuse, and I have no reason to doubt that these safeguards are working or to suspect that these powers are in any way being abused.  Sections 8, 9 and 10 are also safeguards in regard to the destruction of records in cases where a person is not charged or is charged and subsequently acquitted.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 16 make it an offence to remain silent about the origins of stolen property in a person's possession and illegally held firearms and ammunition. These are obviously very necessary powers to the Garda Síochána, especially in view of the greatly increased use of weapons in the course of crime and the great difficulties encountered by the Garda in regard to stolen goods before this section came into being.  If a person is not prepared to say from where they got the goods and is suspected of a crime, it is only right that certain inferences be taken from that.  Sections 18 and 19 involve slight changes in the rules of evidence, impinging on what is generally known as the right to silence, in that a court of trial may, if it so wishes, draw a certain inference from the refusal of the accused to account when questioned for things found in his possession or for physical matter found on his clothing.</P>
    <P>Section 19 enables the court to draw similar inferences, if it wishes, where a person refuses to give any explanation for his presence in an area at the time a crime was committed.  It is only right and sensible that the court should have that power to take into account the fact that somebody is not prepared to account for his movements.  Sections 18 and 19 are <Col N="1942" /> obviously sensible measures from which no innocent person has anything to fear. I am satisfied that sections 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 18 and 19 of the Criminal Justice Act should continue in operation for another four years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion before the House that the sections named and outlined by Deputy Barrett should become a permanent part of our criminal law.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether there is a provision in the Act that there be a further review in four years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>If this motion is passed, as it clearly will be, given that there is agreement on it from all sides of the House, these sections will become features in our criminal law until repealed or amended in the future.  For that reason today's business is extremely important. It is proper that we take time to consider closely the operation of the sections, the role they have played in helping the Garda combat crime and the extent to which safeguards introduced in the legislation in 1984 have worked to protect the interests of the suspect, a person who is deemed innocent until convicted.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given us some very useful and important information with regard to the operation of the sections.  I thank him, the staff of the Department and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána for compiling and making available to us statistical information on the workings of the Act.  This information gives us an idea as to how the sections have been used, the scale to which they have been used and the scale to which they have been successful in helping the Garda Síochána in their work.  There are obviously gaps in that information, some of which I will comment on later, but nonetheless it has been a useful base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we should not reach the final conclusions we are being asked to reach on these sections today but should allow for another review in four or five years if that is possible.  I make that case, and I hope to advance it in the few points I have <Col N="1943" /> to make to the Minister this afternoon, in the hope that he might say that the debate we have engaged in today has been a useful exercise and that his Department might consider some amendment of the legislation to enable a further review, if not a debate on these matters, in a few years.</P>
    <P>The 1984 legislation had a rather chequered and difficult introduction into the body of law generally and more particularly into the practice of An Garda Síochána and the practice of lawyers working with the legislation.  It has not had an easy passage.  The debate in the House on the legislation took many months in 1983 and 1984.  It involved very long, protracted and late sittings of the House and often heated debate, particularly by the then Opposition Deputies now members of the Government.  When reading the reports, I was reminded that the spokesman on Justice for Fianna Fáil at the time, now a constituency colleague of mine, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, was in fact ordered from the House.  It would seem to be terribly uncharacteristic of that very fine Deputy and gentleman that he be ordered from the House and it would have to be a very unusual event that would lead to his being asked to leave the House, but it did happen.  The debate did not centre on Deputy Woods only.  Many Deputies and former Deputies spent considerable time and energy analysing the provisions. There was strong opposition and firm reservations about many of the provisions, most of which we are today being asked not simply to renew but to make permanent in law.</P>
    <P>When I say that there are inherent difficulties, it should be remembered that some of the prerequisites of the sections coming into play, for example, the regulations regarding the treatment of persons in custody, were not put in place until May 1987, some three years after the legislation had passed all Stages in the House.  The Garda Complaints Board, which was a prerequisite to the sections coming into play, was not established until April, the board not being appointed until April 1987.  In fact, all the prerequisite work before the measures, and particularly the detention provisions <Col N="1944" /> contained in section 4, could come into operation as provided in the 1984 Act, did not come into effect until 1 July 1987. That resulted in a 1 July 1991 deadline for the House to consider this motion and allow the sections to become permanent in law.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that the rules, procedures and regulations for the Garda Síochána had to be substantially altered and new regulations for dealing with suspects in custody, beyond those introduced by the Minister at an administrative level within the Garda Síochána had to be introduced and they could prove to be very cumbersome and difficult.  There is no doubt that in the early stages, and perhaps even still today members of the Garda Síochána showed substantial resistance to the operation of these regulations and the many duties imposed on them under the legislation. That resistance, which I have no doubt will diminish in time as people become more accustomed to the workings of these sections, has through a number of years added to the difficult passage of these sections.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 27 for the recording of interviews and transactions in Garda custody.  That has not yet taken place.  A question mark is left hanging over the way the regulations would be developed and the way the legislation would operate in that development. Unfortunately, that is a question that will hang over the operation for some time to come.  That is regrettable and it should not happen.</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act has run in tandem with the provisions of section 4 for the detention of persons.  Despite a recommendation of the Criminal Law Reform Committee to deschedulise section 30, the recently published Malicious Damage Act does not carry a proposal from the Minister to do so.  The committee made that recommendation very strongly, and it is a matter that I shall come back to.</P>
    <P>All of those factors have added to a not easy passage into law of the provisions of section 4 and other measures that are now being considered.  In short, perhaps the House is being asked to make a final decision after too short a juncture from <Col N="1945" /> the workings of this legislation, although four years might seem to be a long time.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave statistics and information with regard to the operation of the legislation.  By and large, they are very welcome and paint a good picture.  I am concerned that because of the hiccups and inception problems we are not getting a true picture of the way the Act would operate statistically and otherwise when in full and free flight.</P>
    <P>It should also be recalled that the House took a long time to reach agreement on the provisions and to pass the legislation into law.  The legislation makes profound changes to our law and the House should now be reminded of those changes.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the potential detention of persons for upwards of 12 hours, provided the period of six hours is renewed, coupled with other provisions with regard to the breaking off of interviews at a certain time of the day &mdash; by and large, midnight, depending on the urgency of the incident, the time a person had been apprehended and taken to the Garda station and depending on other factors &mdash; and it has been illustrated that detention under this legislation can range over two days at the outside.  While we say that the measure is not so extraordinary and the Minister talks about the number of people who have been in custoday for three hours or less, that is the kind of application, in the widest operation of the legislation, for which we must have the most consideration.  A person can be detained for extraordinarily long periods when they are innocent of any suspicion other than that of the garda &mdash; persons who are innocent in the eyes of the law.</P>
    <P>The other extraordinary provision of the legislation is the introduction of an onus on a detained person to answer questions and to suffer the consequences of failing to answer those questions at any subsequent trial.  I accept that there was previously provision under section 52 of the 1939 Offences Against the State Act that a person was required to account for his movements.  For all practical purposes that measure had been abandoned since the early 1960s and, as I understand it, there has been no prosecution and no conviction under it since the mid-1960s <Col N="1946" /> because of a widespread view that it is in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, if not our own Constitution. For the first time we introduced in law an obligation on persons to account for property, movements and other unusual circumstances regarding their apprehension and provided that failure to do so would reflect on their position at any subsequent trial.</P>
    <P>All that must be remembered as we are today asked to make these unusual and extraordinary provisions permanent in our code of law.  This has to be put against the background that the legislation was debated at a time when, for the first time ever, we began to find at Government level, in this House and elsewhere, admissions that during the mid-1970s and into the late 1970s there existed within the Garda Síochána a group of people who were operating outside the law, known colloquially as &ldquo;the heavy gang&rdquo;. The Government must be reminded that in 1976, coming up to the 1977 elections, they gave a firm undertaking that there would be a judicial inquiry into the facts surrounding the operation of that group of men within the Garda Síochána who were operating outside of the law, and to date that has not happened.  That is a regrettable fact that must be recorded in any debate dealing with the detention of suspects and the rights of suspects in Garda custody.</P>
    <P>The people with the highest profile in that sad history of the Garda Síochána, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Breathnach, one subsequently vindicated and the other still seeking justice before the courts, are still floundering around seeking an explanation as to why they were brought before the courts and convicted in the circumstances in which they were.  It is particularly regrettable when we see, in the context of the detention of persons in England, in the Guildford Four, Birmingham Six and Maguire cases, fulsome efforts on the part of the Government there to see justice done and condemnation of the Birmingham, West Midlands and Guildford police when they were found wanting.  However, little or no follow-up to that commitment of 1976 has been carried out by Fianna Fáil when <Col N="1947" /> admissions began to emerge that we had less than satisfactory practices here ourselves. I would join with Amnesty International in reminding the Minister of their commitment of that period, that there has never been a proper investigation of that black and sad period of the Garda Síochána's history and that there should be a full and proper investigation into what went wrong and why. I accept that this Government were not responsible for the creation of that unit. Nevertheless they gave a commitment and it should now be honoured.  I acknowledge that the late Judge Barra Ó Briain sat in committee to look at certain aspects of the rights of accused persons, but that committee did not and could not have gone anywhere near meeting the commitments of Fianna Fáil in 1976 to fully and thoroughly investigate these matters.  This is all the more worrying when one has regard to the extraordinary provisions of section 7 (3) of the 1984 Act.  That provision basically says that where a member of the Garda Síochána fails to comply with the regulations introduced in 1976 or fails to comply with any other standards required of them under the Act, then such failures of themselves &ldquo;will not render that person liable to any criminal or civil proceedings or of itself affect the lawfulness of the custody of the detained person or the admissibility in evidence of any statement by him&rdquo;. Whilst we demand all of these standards which are in place since 1977, there is, nevertheless, this extraordinary provision that any breach of the regulations, any invasion of the rights of the accused in the context of the safeguards that are necessarily there in the law, will not render the officer responsible liable for criminal or civil prosecution and will not taint the legality of admissibility of the statement.</P>
    <P>I mention that because when, as we are doing today, we are putting these provisions permanently into our corpus of law, we should remind ourselves of the extraordinary effect of the provision on the one hand and the need for good safeguards and vigilance on the part of those in this House who are providing for this law.  That is why I make my case that we <Col N="1948" /> should be looking at this legislation on an ongoing, intermittent basis and not simply closing a chapter in this debate today without coming back to it in the future.</P>
    <P>The matters we must look at have been pointed out by the Minister.  There is a number of steps which require to be taken by the Government before these sections become part of our law.  The first was to establish an effective Garda complaints board. This was a <i>quid pro quo</i> of the legislation.  If we were to give rights to the Garda Síochána to detain suspects for certain periods of time then there should be in place an effective Garda complaints investigation tribunal.  If we had never brought in section 4 and other related sections it would have been proper to have such a board.  However the history of the board, once established, has been one of sad neglect on the part of the Government.  The Minister says that progress is being made, that the backlog is dwindling and it is now down to between 750 and 500 cases.  That is a remarkable state of affairs.  Can the board, even today, take on any new case?  I understand that for nearly two years now the board has simply not taken any new cases for investigation.</P>
    <P>From a date in or about mid-1989 we have, effectively, had no Garda complaints board.  What we have today is a board investigating life before mid-1989. My dates may not be entirely accurate and I may not have up-to-the-minute information but the fact remains that the Garda Complaints Board is grossly under-staffed, very poorly resourced and is not in a position to effectively deal with the backlog which stands at about 500 cases.  In other words, about 500 members of the public have gone to this board looking for redress and have to wait inordinate periods of time to get an answer to their complaint.  On the other hand, there is a minimum of 500, if not many more, members of the Garda Síochána hanging about with question marks over their heads as to their status, their good name and their future in the Garda Síochána.  I have met so many members of the Garda Síochána over the years who have been at the butt end of poorly investigated and long-delayed <Col N="1949" /> investigations of this board and who have simply lost heart and interest in their jobs, saying that if this is the way they are treated in the course of their duty, why should they bother at all.  Like so many other unfortunate, cynical servants of the State they sit behind their desks, keep their heads down and take no real interest in their duties.</P>
    <P>The Minister's neglect has led to a lack of confidence in the board at two levels, first among the public.  Here the figures need to be explained further.  The Minister says it is typical of similar situations in other European countries, that there is a bottoming out.  I would like to know to what extent that is due to people saying that there is no point in going to the Garda Complaints Board because they cannot deal effectively or quickly with complaints and that because of the delays justice will be denied.  On the other hand, there are members of the Garda Síochána who have totally lost confidence in the ability of the process to vindicate their good name and assure their position in the Garda Síochána quickly and effectively.</P>
    <P>I regret that the first prerequisite for the permanent establishment of this legislation in our law has been so shabbily dealt with by the Government and I hope the matter will be rectified without further delay.  The Minister should stop playing around with statistics in this area and recognise that there is a need for emergency, short term action to be taken so that every outstanding complaint is dealt with within the year if not sooner.  He should put in place the necessary resources to do that so that the board can reopen for new cases and deal effectively, on a current basis, with the work they have been asked to do.</P>
    <P>The final word I have to say on this is that the reports of the board make very sad and frustrating reading for the people who give up their valuable time and energy to do this work.</P>
    <P>The second prerequisite of the legislation or the obligation on the Minister to put in place regulations for the treatment of suspects once detained was a good and necessary arrangement, and the regulations which were eventually drafted and agreed by this House are <Col N="1950" /> effective and comprehensive.  However, there has been a substantial amount of resistance to the cumbersome procedures involved under the regulations.  The Minister should look again at streamlining processes whereby members of the Garda Síochána are required to supervise and to fill in forms when a person is detained.  Where a person is reasonably suspected of having committed a crime he should be taken to the station, detained for the shortest period of time required and questioned, and charged if necessary, or otherwise released.  However, in a system where there is a lot of cumbersome form filling there is a resistance from the members of the Garda Síochána to rely upon it, particularly where there is in tandem a much more straightforward, draconian and wide ranging provision under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act. We must deschedule for Offences Against the State Act purposes malicious damage and other offences which should never be considered under that extraordinary legislation introduced during the period of the Second World War.</P>
    <P>While the regulations provide for the right of the accused to have access to a solicitor and the right to consult with a lawyer while detained, there is not any provision in the legal aid scheme to pay lawyers so retained through the criminal legal aid scheme.  Many people are unable to afford the services of lawyers once they come before the District Court to be charged and tried.  If the Minister would make them available to us, the statistics in that regard would show that upwards of 90 per cent or thereabouts of persons tried before the District Courts would be afforded legal aid in the retention of lawyers for the purposes of defending themselves.  This reflects the by and large very poor background from which most people who come before our criminal courts originate.  That poverty and inability to pay extends to the time that a person is in the Garda station and it is somewhat disingenuous to recognise through the pronouncements of the courts that people have the right of access to a lawyer while at the same time not <Col N="1951" /> providing the means whereby they can afford to retain a lawyer.</P>
    <P>This matter has been discussed in the Law Society, the Criminal Lawyers Association and the Department of Justice for many years.  It should now be brought to a conclusion.  Some years ago the Department opened up discussions with the lawyers practising in this area in Dublin with regard to establishing at very minimal cost to the Department a duty solicitors' scheme whereby a solicitor or solicitors in Dublin and in other urban areas would be called upon on a roster basis at short notice to attend, so that the provisions of the Act could not be used as a device to frustrate the Garda seeking to proceed with a speedy inquiry in relation to a detained person; but the Department of Justice have simply refused to open up meaningful discussions in this area.  They are not even prepared to consider the paltry sum necessary to establish such a duty solicitors' scheme on a permanent basis.  Would the Minister of State deal with that matter and put in place a provision under the criminal legal aid scheme that allows people unable to afford to pay for a lawyer the means whereby they can do so, so that their rights in this regard can fully and effectively be protected?</P>
    <P>The next item with regard to the treatment of offenders in custody is this issue of the video tape recording of proceedings. This was provided for in the 1984 legislation.  It was clearly the intention of the House that it should be in place and that the only delay in doing so should be for the technical investigation of the possibility of doing it.  The Minister's explanation for not putting this system in place is utterly unacceptable. The notion of video recording and audio tape recording interviews is considered something of another era as far as the European police forces are concerned.  In Britain it has been in practice for decades rather than for years and the Minister's suggestion that there are other technological lessons to be learned, as a reason for the delay in this matter, is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Justice Martin was appointed in the wake of the Guildford <Col N="1952" /> case to look at the issue of ensuring that a Guildford type situation would not be repeated in our jurisdiction, having suffered that type of thing during the black period of the &ldquo;heavy gang&rdquo; era of the seventies, he quite correctly identified that, potentially, there was as much protection available to the Garda Síochána against unwarranted complaints as to accused persons under interrogation in a detention centre or a Garda station.  This visual and audio record would show a clear picture of what transpired and would clearly set at nought any unwarranted accusation against a member of the Garda Síochána during the course of the interrogation.  It is an important provision, not just for the accused but for the Garda Síochána.  It is incumbent on the Minister to move beyond this prevarication and the introduction since 1984 of spurious and specious reasons why the video or audio recording will not be introduced. I understand from the publication of the Martin Committee report that it was to be introduced then on a pilot basis in a number of Garda stations in Dublin and elsewhere.  I learned today that that has not happened and that the Minister is borrowing on some new technological evidence or facts that are emerging from experience abroad to delay it yet further. The Minister will not be congratulated by anyone on either side of the issue for delaying on this matter.</P>
    <P>The figures published by the Minister indicate that there has been a drop in the number of complaints about physical abuse against members of the Garda Síochána coming before the Garda Complaints Board.  That is welcome.  Nonethe less, I am worried that when we begin to fully operate the forensic evidence legislation, abuses will become much more sophisticated and more clever.  I hope that will not happen.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered why a pattern of complaints has not emerged in relation to clothes, personal items and other samples being interfered with by members of the Garda Síochána.  I could never understand why the heavy gang used the bully boy tactics they did during their period of existence in the Garda Síochána, why they had to go to the extent where they have been exposed in abusing <Col N="1953" /> people and why they did not just simply fabricate the statements in another room and claim, if they were going to lie about things, that that was the statement made and signed.  Why not just simply take the clothes and the sample of the suspect to another room out of sight of the accused and rub the firearm in them to show that it may have been in close proximity?  Who is to know?  The only way we will ever ensure safeguards within a Garda station is by a video and audio record of what goes on in it.  It is the only way to ensure continued confidence in the Garda Síochána, who do a very fine job on our behalf in combating crime.  It would ensure that there will never again be recourse to unwarranted and unfair accusations being levelled against them for practices that might go on within a station.  The Minister should not delay in dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>Malicious damage must now be taken from the schedule of offences to be dealt with under section 30, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  They point out that, given the operation of section 4 as part of our permanent law, the Minister and the Garda have no need to maintain malicious damage within that order of law.  One of the facts that must be looked at in the statistics&mdash;statistics which the Minister has not made available to us, but which I obtained in answers to parliamentary questions in the past &mdash; is that there has not been a significant fall-off in the use of section 30 as the use of section 4 has increased.  It seems that a significant body of members in the Garda Síochána much prefer to work the straightforward section 30 detention provisions in preference to what the legislature prefer and expect them to do.  It must be remembered that where there is a house break-in &mdash; probably the most prevalent crime &mdash; or when a motor car is interfered with there is an element of malicious damage and, as a result, there is an opportunity for the Garda Síochána to detain a person for up to 48 hours by reason of the inclusion of malicious damage under the schedule.  That should be dealt with and changed as the Law Reform Commission report recommends.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech outlined <Col N="1954" /> in great detail the legislative programme which has been undertaken and proposed by the Minister for Justice in combating crime generally, which is persistent and ongoing.  One of the major omissions from that legislative programme &mdash; and I call on the Minister to tell us in clear terms when it will come before us &mdash; is the vehicle whereby all the new changes in our criminal law can be brought speedily and conveniently into evidence before our courts, that is, a Criminal Evidence Act.  There is no doubt that the Forensic Evidence Act is not in operation because of the Criminal Evidence Act.  There is also no doubt that many other areas of law, that dealing with fraud in particular, are frustrated and held up because we do not have a modern Criminal Evidence Act which would deal with computerisation, microfilm records and all the receptions of evidence by way of certificate or a simple statement of evidence by people in the technical or exhibit preservation areas, which is so common in all the other criminal law jurisdictions in neighbouring countries and indeed throughout Europe.  We are way behind and very much at fault for not updating on a regular basis our criminal evidence law.</P>
    <P>Much of the Minister's legislative programme is totally and utterly frustrated and is not being implemented, used or relied upon by our courts because our criminal evidence law is so outdated. That is an urgent and important matter. The figures which the Minister gave reflect this.  He indicated that a very small percentage of people detained are required to give their fingerprints, to surrender personal clothing or to subject themselves to other forensic testing&mdash; the figure is as low as 5 per cent in regard to the latter and just over 20 per cent in respect of fingerprints.  The reason for that is not because of reluctance on the part of the Garda Síochána to use their powers or that section 4 is innocent little legislation.  The fact is that there is little point in relying on these forensic and technical devices because the criminal evidence law does not facilitate the easy reception of these technical matters to our trials before juries at hearings in the District Court and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1955" /> As long as that is the case and as long as forensic and technical evidence is not easily accessible and available in our courts, we will have a preponderance of interrogation centred criminal investigations, which clearly is the picture coming from the statistics which the Minister read in regard to detentions.  The fact that so many people are not technically examined in relation to fingerprints or other traces or for the reception of their clothes or other samples, indicates that they are being primarily detained for questioning purposes, which is never a happy development.  The police investigation must always be pushed in the direction of investigation in the field and in the technical pursuit of evidence.  We should never have the Guilford, Birmingham or the other type of investigations which led to such abuse abroad, and indeed here during the black period of the heavy gang to which I referred, of investigation alone in a Garda station room by members of the Garda Síochána in pursuit of an admission of guilt and nothing more.</P>
    <P>The celebrated case of the Sallins mail train robbery which involved what was described at the time as the single most audacious crime in the history of the State was solved and presented to the Special Criminal Court subsequently on one piece of evidence &mdash; the statements of alleged admissions by the suspects in Garda stations.  Not one jot of evidence outside the Garda station at the scene of the crime or elsewhere, was presented. The convictions stood or fell on admissions, and indeed two of them subsequently fell for that reason.</P>
    <P>Crime is a problem, as has been illustrated and experienced by all of us on a daily basis.  It will continue to be an unfortunate feature of our society as long as it is based on greed and when so many people are unemployed and living in poverty. On the other hand, there is a national industry which exists on crime fighting institutions.  Crime will long be with us and the extent to which the sections before the House for renewal are helping the Garda Síochána in the battle against that crime and its containment are welcome.  For those reasons <Col N="1956" /> The Workers' Party will not oppose the motion for their renewal.  However, this House and all those concerned about the rights of innocent persons must maintain vigilance and ensure that there is never a return to abuses which we, unfortunately, experienced here and abroad. We must ensure that all persons detained as suspects and as innocent persons are afforded the full protections and their rights under the law.</P>

      <P>The specific sections referred to are highly complex and important.  Nevertheless, they will enable the Garda Síochána to combat crime, a task which they have great difficulty in tackling and overcoming. This House must do everything in its power to ensure that crime is tackled and reduced.  That is a very difficult task. The Fine Gael Party believe that this is a reasonable motion, one that deserves the support of all parties.</P>

      <P>A report on the evaluation of the pilot use of this programme in 12 primary schools in the Dublin area has been supplied to my Department.  I have recently had discussions with the INTO together with persons involved in the development of the programme and a senior psychologist in my Department.  I support the programme.</P>
      <P>Consideration is now being given to the support for further use of the materials in other primary schools in the Eastern Health Board area.

      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is a crisis which is getting steadily worse &mdash; the most recent statistics show that Childline received 31,800 cries for help during the past 12 months?  In the three year formal training course in teacher training colleges a mere half an hour is devoted to the heading &ldquo;detecting and coping with child abuse&rdquo;. Would the Minister not recommend that not alone should this well structured and balanced programme be adopted in the Eastern Health Board area but also nationally?</P>

      <P>I agree that there is a problem but I stress that the matter must be approached in a professional way and with the appropriate sensitivity in the best interests of parents and children, teachers, management and all concerned. When the INTO sought a formal meeting with me and with Dr. Maria Lawlor and Dr. Deirdre McIntyre, I was glad to meet them at short notice.  At that meeting there was a video presentation of the information they had complied and they informed me of their experiences in piloting the programme in 12 schools.  As I said, I was greatly impressed and taken by the programme.  It was put to me that the programme should be extended to include schools in the Eastern Health Board area.  I asked officials of my Department to start work on the project and I am <Col N="1958" /> keen to get it underway.  As I said in my initial reply, the use of any such project in a primary school would be a matter for the management, teachers and parents. Regard must be had to the sensitivities involved, particularly with regard to young children, but having met the two professionals involved I must say that I was very impressed and taken by their integrity, commitment and professionalism in the matter.  I intend to actively pursue this area.</P>

      <Quest>the steps she intends to take to (a) remedy the injustices in the higher education grant scheme and (b) ensure that students, whose parents have a modest income, will be eligible for the higher education grant and will not be forced to turn down a place in a third level college due to lack of financial resources; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department review the higher education grants <Col N="1962" /> scheme on an annual basis in the light of their experience of its operation.  I am aware of the difficulties facing some parents with children in third level education and this is a matter which is examined from year to year.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the means test tables of the scheme are so framed as to give greater financial assistance to students &mdash; I know the Deputy is aware of this &mdash; from low income families.  The income limits were tapered in 1985. Indeed the tapering mechanism and the indexing of grants in line with the consumer price index were the two major achievements at that level of the former Minister, Mrs. Hussey.  From that time students who were previously ineligible for a full or partial maintenance grant could become eligible for a grant of fees or partial fees.  Moreover, despite the budgetary constraints of recent years, I have increased the income eligibility limits and rates of maintenance grant payable in line with increases in the consumer price index.  The grants have also increased in line with tuition fee charges.</P>
      <P>I was very pleased to have been able to correct a long standing anomaly in 1990, by reducing the number of honours required from four to two, under the higher education grants scheme.  Prospective third level students from low income families who satisfy the reduced Leaving Certificate attainment and other requirements will not be forced to turn down the offer of a third level place due to a lack of a higher education grant.  This improvement was widely welcomed.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that it has been my objective to ensure that the higher education grants scheme is as equitable as possible.</P>
      <P>At present over 50 per cent of students in HEA third level colleges are in receipt of grant aid.  In VEC colleges the figure is in the order of 90 per cent.  These figures indicate the extent to which third level access is already being facilitated by the various schemes of financial assistance to students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the PESP the question of developing more equitable income assessment criteria for all applicants <Col N="1963" /> under the scheme, including mature applicants, is being considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the present income threshold for higher education grants is too low and that families who fall within the threshold cannot afford realistically to send their child to third level education?  Statistics have proven that the method of income assessment favours the self-employed. Have her Department any plans to remedy the injustice this causes for the PAYE sector because fewer children of parents on PAYE are eligible for grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government, in line with previous Governments, have striven always to do what they can within budgetary circumstances.  The income eligibility limits have been increased in line with the consumer price index each year.  This was done despite the very severe difficulties, and it looked as if it might not have been able to be done.  The increase in funding from the European Social Fund means that the number eligible has increased from 30 per cent in 1985 to 90 per cent today, which is a remarkable increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now deal with the other questions the Deputy raised.  In 1983 the expenditure on the higher education grant scheme was £8 million, but in the year just past it was £27 million, which was a huge increase.  The Deputy raised the question of the seeming disparity in the numbers who qualify for higher education grants from the self-employed sector and the PAYE sector.  There is a long standing perception of inequity and I feel there are some grounds for that.  At present an interdepartmental group are looking very rigorously at the various ways in which entitlements are granted by the various Departments.  There would need to be across the board agreement on matters such as this.  It is my view that common criteria for various entitlements would need to be very correctly worked out.  On that point let me add that the Deputy's colleague seeks to put forward the opposite view in a question that will <Col N="1964" /> arise later on the Order Paper, but I bear the Deputy's point out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Department intend to do anything for families with more than one child in college?  Some families have to make very difficult decisions when the second or third child is offered a place in college.  They may have to defer the place or not allow their child to accept it because they cannot afford it.  Would the Minister agree that the greatest injustice is that parental income is not means tested to grant-aid students at regional colleges while it is at higher education colleges and have her Department any plans to remedy that injustice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not call this an injustice because the money to fund this scheme comes from Europe, who apply their own criteria, and at present the ratio is 65:35; but the other colleges are funded completely by the State.  To remedy this situation would require many millions and if the Deputy could tell me where that could be got I would gladly approve of it.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have seen fit to give a huge increase in the allocation to the higher education grant scheme but the influx of money from Europe has meant that up to 90 per cent of students in regional colleges obtain a grant for full tuition fees and a varying maintenance grant depending on where one resides. The Deputy raised the difficulties families experience when two or more children are at university or a third level institution.  Many families are finding it very difficult to cope with this burden and at present we are looking at it in the Department and working out the likely financial implications of it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that because of the introduction of the national lottery a lot of the smaller clubs catering for youth, particularly in certain areas of Dublin and other urban areas, are being deprived of fund raising opportunities because the money is just not there?  Will the Minister agree that it is time we increased the allocation for clubs performing a social service by looking after young children in certain urban areas and ensuring they get a reasonable amount of money towards maintenance costs from national lottery funds?  I accept that there is a scheme, but the amounts given are very small and are not enough to meet day-to-day running costs. In many cases these costs have to be borne by families who cannot afford them.  The clubs will just fold up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that clubs have major difficulties in raising money but there is no evidence to suggest that this is a result of the national lottery.  I take the point that clubs are short of money, but a very considerable amount is being made available through the national lottery towards both current and capital expenditure by clubs.  Given the need for lottery funding in several areas of State expenditure, a reasonable amount of money is being provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would wish to be able to provide much more money for clubs in areas of disadvantage.  The fact remains that we do provide much more money to clubs in disadvantaged areas than to clubs in other areas.  I accept that the amounts provided are not enough, but we have been very careful to ensure that most of the money is spent in disadvantaged areas in Dublin and other cities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to the Dublin area.  Would the Minister not agree that any changes would have to be introduced in the context of the national scene?  Clubs are having extreme difficulty with normal fund raising activities. I accept that money is paid to VECs but the system of distribution does not help clubs which encounter crises.  Such crises can often occur as a result of success when teams succeed in competitions to a late stage or when national champions emerge from a boxing club.  This is becoming a crisis.  A scheme should be introduced to cater for the legitimate and unexpected financial needs of clubs which provide for young people on a wide basis.</P>

      <P>I will always be aware that the country is larger than the Pale. Areas outside Dublin will be given consideration. I agree that there is a need for much more money for clubs but there is not a demand from the other parties or from the public at large to put money into sport.  That is a particular difficulty I have in putting a case to Government for more money.  Deputy Barrett's Leader has proposed recently that the lottery funds be raided and the money put into the health services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 7 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>The application form for the scheme of assistance with the purchase of books for needy pupils in primary schools will be in the schools shortly.</P>
      <P>I have introduced a grant for assistance to purchase books for needy pupils in infant classes for the first time in 1991. The delay was therefore of an operational nature in order to prepare for the introduction of the new scheme.  There has been an overall increase in the provision for the scheme of £284,000, which will provide for the changes referred to above.</P>
      <P>The total allocation for 1991 for the free books scheme for primary schools is £1.447 million, which represents an increase of more than 24 per cent over 1990.</P>
      <P>There was no delay in issuing the said forms to post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>In the case of voluntary secondary schools the relevant forms for aid towards the cost of school books for necessitous pupils were issued to the schools early in April.  The majority of forms have now been completed and returned to my Department.</P>
      <P>The forms were issued to the vocational education committees on 24 April 1991.  They are normally issued in May each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circular letter on the free book scheme is normally issued to community <Col N="1968" /> and comprehensive schools in April-May. No date is specified.  This year it was issued on 17 May 1991.</P>
    <P>The allocation to this scheme for post-primary schools for 1991 is £2.598 million, an increase of 10 per cent on last year's allocation.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that this is the first time the free books scheme will be available in respect of infant classes.  I raised this matter on a number of occasions over the past few years.  The Minister says the £284,000 will be provided but what does that mean to the child in the school?  Could the Minister provide books free of charge to infant classes?  What is the £284,000 to cover? What proportion of costs will have to be paid by the parents?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme is to cover children who are in need.  The fact that such a scheme did not obtain up to now probably had something to do with compulsory school age.  That is now irrelevant since over 95 per cent of pupils go to school at the age of four.  There was not always such a wealth of good material available in educational aids for very young children.  I am aware that Deputy Mac Giolla has frequently asked why infant classes were not included in the scheme.  It was one of the measures we agreed under the <i>Programme for Social and Economic Progress.</i>  The criteria governing the scheme are sent to principals and managers of schools.  I have felt for some time that the scheme did not work to the advantage of those most in need of it.  A review is being carried out by a member of my Department in collaboration with another person outside and we hope to have the results very shortly.  I hope to devise a much more focused delivery of that money.</P>

      <P>Reference was <Col N="1969" /> made earlier to parents who have two or three children at third level.  The Minister will agree that it is almost the norm for parents to have two or three children at primary level.  Would the Minister agree that the need is even greater in these cases?  What would it cost to provide infant classes with free books?  They do not need a bagfull of books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;a bagfull of books&rdquo; caught my ear.  We are accustomed to seeing children of five, six or seven years of age on country roads staggering to school in the morning under the weight of their satchels either in their hands on on their backs.  I do not know how they are to absorb all that is supposed to be in these books.  That fund is not to allow book sellers to produce better and glossier new books at every whim and drop of a hat, because there is nothing to prove that a glossier, shinier complexity of books will result in better education.  This outside agency and the Department are considering the cost of school books.  Is there need for constant replenishment and for the amount of books children have to stagger under?  Is there need for a vast range of books? The Deputy asked whether two or more children could use the same books.  That will be considered in this review.  For anyone who has two or three children at school at the one time of course extra cost is involved.  I have to be careful that that money is not put to a proliferation of, in some cass, needless texts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, allowing for the payment of £8.40, the standard rate for a necessitous pupil, even at infant class level we are talking about £28 on average as the cost of books, on top of the other subsidisation parents have to make out of their own pockets?  With VAT, telephone bills, ESB, £1,400 for oil and £2,500 for public liability insurance, each school now must produce between £4,000 and £5,000 for running costs.  The board of mangement, parents and teachers have literally become fulltime fund raisers between raffles, bazaars and jumble sales <Col N="1970" /> and the concept of free education is a myth.</P>

I am not going to allow the Department's fund for needy children to be eaten up by what I think is a superfluity of available texts.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the current speculation about the possible new system of certification for leaving certificate pupils has arisen from the fact that a sensitive internal draft document prepared by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment was leaked to <i>The Irish Times</i> and on 6 June it appeared on the front page with an extensive article on the inside pages of the same newspaper and a further editorial on the draft, and that there is considerable disquiet within the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment about the leaking of this draft document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should think there would be.  The first I knew of that was what I read in <i>The Irish Times.</i>  I followed <Col N="1974" /> that up the next day by giving an interview myself, and I sought to assuage the fears that were being expressed.  Be that as it may, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and their committees are composed of many people and that document would have been in the hands of dozens.  One cannot keep matters such as that private.  In general I have to say that the idea of having a debate about education is good if there are ideas to be put abroad and submissions to be received.  Remember, this had gone over a wide area all over the country covering all sorts of interests, and the amazing thing was that it was not produced until that time.  In general I see no harm in a very full debate.  If in the morning one were to wake up and say that this is what is going to happen, then all sorts of rí rá would emerge.  A document entitled <i>Senior Cycle Provision&mdash;a Position Paper</i> has come into my hands in the last few days.  It sets out options and discussions and a wide range of interests has been consulted.  I think it is a very eXciting development.</P>

Is it her policy that certain selected journalists are to be accorded preferential treatment on education briefings, particularly in relation to sensitive matters, in return for rather glowing and unwarranted comments on her educational performance which does little to preserve the traditional integrity and independence of the newspaper in question to the exclusion of the <i>Irish Independent, The Irish Press</i> and <i>The Cork Examiner?</i></P>

      <P>The Minister has not really answered the question.  She is simply telling me that the rate of maintenance grant payable under the ESF scheme is equivalent to the maximum rate payable under the higher education grants scheme.  How can a person maintain himself on an insufficient grant? What is the level of income for a single person maintaining himself as laid down by the Commission on Social Welfare?  Is the Minister considering the problems of maintenance for those on ESF courses and the need for greater levels of income, particularly for mature students?  Is a scheme being considered whereby they can achieve the same level of grant as a single person in receipt of social welfare?</P>

      <P>Physical education forms part of the primary school curriculum. It is the responsibility of the principal teacher, in consultation with the school staff, to outline a plan of work for the school as a whole and to ensure that each area of the curriculum is adequately dealt with in all classes.</P>
      <P>Irish national teachers are trained to teach all aspects of the curriculum and are, therefore, qualified to teach physical education.  Teachers are not recognised on the basis of subject qualifications.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Primary Curriculum Review Body made certain recommendations in regard to physical education.  At present, through the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, a comprehensive examination of the report, taking into account the views of interested parties, is in progress.</P>
      <P>The detailed information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of national schools which do not have a general purposes room is not readily available in my Department.</P>
      <P>Since 1987 there have been over 200 national school projects completed with another 100 in planning stages.  My priority is the elimination of pre fabs and the provision of high quality classroom accommodation.</P>

      <P>Basically, the question asked the number of such schools which do not have a general purposes room for physical education.  I am indebted to Deputy Deenihan who has done a very good study and analysis of <Col N="1980" /> the state of physical education in primary schools and has spent a lot of time on it. He states that one-third of our schools have no indoor facilities for physical education and that this activity has to be undertaken outdoors in the school yard. It is not proper that young children should have to go outdoors during cold and wet winter days to undertake this activity.  Surely the Department of Education have carried out some analysis of this?  The Minister stated in her reply that teachers are fully capable of teaching physical education.  I presume the Minister was referring to all teachers and not just physical education teachers.  Deputy Deenihan's survey covered over 3,000 schools.  He received replies from 1,500&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree with the finding that 66 per cent of teachers do not feel confident to teach physical education because of a lack of preparation and training in teacher training colleges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot possibly account for the findings in Deputy Deenihan's survey.  He is a very busy man and has unearthed all sorts of exciting facts in his survey.  Neither would I be competent to answer for the 3,500 teachers in primary schools.  What I am saying is that physical education forms a part of the primary school curriculum and teachers are trained during their pre-service training to teach all aspects of the curriculum, and physical education forms part of their training.  With regard to whether teacher training colleges believe they are giving enough training in this subject, that is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan said his survey indicated that one-third of our schools have no indoor facilities for physical education. I have no knowledge of this but I would be glad to discuss the findings of his survey with the Deputy.  Certain matters <Col N="1981" /> have arisen which I have had to deal with, for example, the problem of pre-fabs which I inherited.  The previous Government had also sought to deal with this matter.  I went about solving the problem in a very practical fashion.  I introduced a programme to provide decent, well lit and well heated classrooms, proper toilet facilities, proper staff rooms and offices for principals, tarmacadamed yards, ball courts, etc.  There was much goodwill for this programme from parents and the management of schools who regarded pre-fabs as a great hazard so far as primary schools were concerned.  We are about half way through that programme. It should be completed in two or three years.  Since I launched this programme, the number of pupils in some schools has fallen and they now have up to four spare rooms.  These schools have sought grants to demolish walls between rooms, thus making one large classroom which can be converted to a GP room.  We are providing grants towards this work.  When the problem of pre-fabs has been resolved, I will then tackle the problem of schools which do not have adequate facilities for physical education, concerts etc.</P>

This is a completely separate matter to the questions posed earlier.  I will ask my Department to raise this matter with the teacher training colleges.</P>
      <P>When we are talking about physical education we must remember that in many cases we are talking about children of four, five and six years old.  Surely Deputies do not believe that we should adopt the Russian or American practice where children of such tender age have to undergo rigorous training programmes. Physical education in that context implies set programmes and rigorous training. We are talking here in the main about young children at primary school.  I will ask my Department to discuss the question of physical education training with teacher training colleges to see if this matter can be tackled in a more detailed way.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  The debate has been very interesting. I will ensure, first, that the Department will speak to the teacher training colleges to see if they will lay more emphasis on the physical education component of the pre-service training and second, I will request the NCCA, who are now undertaking the implementation of the curriculum review in primary schools, to pay particular attention to that aspect.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 14, 45, 46, 48, 49, 54, 55 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>No money has yet been received by my Department under the Lingua Programme. However, for exchanges of young people in post-compulsory education and training £10,000 is expected to be received shortly by the Youth Exchange Bureau.  This will be used to give financial assistance to 100 students from seven schools and FÁS community training workshop to participate in two week exchanges with partner institutions in France, Germany, Spain and Italy.</P>
      <P>In the 1991-92 school year beginning in September about £69,000 will be available to the Youth Exchange Bureau for exchanges of young people and about £59,000 will be available to Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann for the in-service training abroad of language teachers. It is not possible at this stage to state the number of schools or teachers that will benefit in the coming school year because the planning is ongoing, but that will be known shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to these amounts the Higher Education Authority received £23,000 in the present academic year and will receive about £168,000 in the 1991-92 year to assist in the mobility costs <Col N="1988" /> of language students at third level to allow them to spend a period of study abroad.  My Department will also shortly receive about £38,000 to assist generally in the implementation of the programme. Accordingly the total amounts available under the programme in the 1990-91 and 1991-92 school years will be £71,000 and £296,000 respectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply, particularly in view of the fact that the Lingua Programme has had several false starts.  Is the Minister not somewhat disappointed with the amounts in view of the fact that this programme was heralded as a major initiative and a lot of EC money was to be provided for the promotion of modern language tuition and so on?  In view of the fact that 100 students will benefit at second level, can the Minister give a guarantee that these students should be from disadvantaged areas and backgrounds and that priority and precedence should be given to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the precise details but the minimum number for this year is 100 pupils.  The programme for the year 1991-92 will be of much greater benefit for both students and teachers.  It is estimated that funding for in-service training of teachers and the exchanges of young people will be increased from the present levels.  A commitment has been given to increase the funding.  The planning committee have been set up and they will take decisions on the geographical spread of schools and the balance as between different types of schools and vocational training institutions, as well as the linguistic balance between French, German, Italian and Spanish or in-service training of teachers and exchanges of young people in post-compulsory education and training.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that the Lingua Programme was a long time coming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In deciding where the money is directed, recognition might be given to the fact that we seem to have an <Col N="1989" /> extremely limited range of second level modern language choice.  I am talking particularly about the over-emphasis on French.  For example, of the 841 schools providing modern languages, 700 provide French, in the region of 100 provide German, 85 provide Spanish and 13 provide Italian.  In spending the money we should try to achieve a greater choice of modern languages in our second level schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Deputy has the wrong statistics but I will send him the correct ones.  At present over 400 of the 800 second level schools provide both French and German and it is anticipated that that number will increase to 500 in September next.  The Deputy may be using earlier statistics but I will send him the correct figures.  In the last 12 months in particular I was amazed at the huge increase in the number of second level schools providing these languages. I anticipate that in a couple of years' time maximum numbers of schools will be offering two foreign languages as well as Irish and English.  On the Deputy's supplementary question about the over-emphasis on French, I do not know how that position arose.  Perhaps it was due to historical reasons but for many years there has been a great emphasis on French in the schools.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The demand was so great that obviously we had to be rigorous in having all the cases considered. Of course every case was properly applied for and every case would need one.  We are starting a programme of extensive provision of remedial teachers. I wanted to be sure that we could stand over the allocations made.  I wish to put on the record of the House that since I became Minister for Education there have just been two previous occasions in which such allocations have been made, 30 last year and 30 the year before, and they were made on that basis.  The inspectorate made professional evaluations based on their own knowledge and the various tests carried out.  They then sent the evaluations to the Department for review by the more senior inspectorate and they are presented and just ratified by me.  I have explained that to Deputies from both sides of the House.  The apportionment of teachers is a professional matter and it is dealt with in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if there are enough qualified remedial teachers, and I believe there are.  The Department run various courses and teachers can leave work and attend them.  We try to facilitate those courses as often as we can.  In tandem with the 80 teachers, 30 extra teachers will be provided for areas deemed to be disadvantaged, and there will be a fairly good extension to the home school liaison scheme by the appointment of other teachers to that scheme.  Those measures will all be in place for the school year beginning in early September.</P>

My concern is that the school transport system operates safely and efficiently.  Bus Éireann and the subcontractors whom they engage appear to me to be doing that job very well.  If there is a minimal rise of 4 per cent, it is the first rise in the school transport charge for four years.  The same person said that school transport charges would be doubled, but it is the Government that set the school transport charges, not Bus Éireann or a particular individual.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister had any consultation or dialogue with her colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications in relation to recent reports that 600 school transport providers in the 14-seat minibus category will be put off the roads as a result of the implementation of a statutory instrument that means they must now hold a certificate of competence, they must have a special licence, and that such vehicles <Col N="1995" /> are from now to be categorised as coaches rather than minibuses?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy refers to the certificate of professional competency, the CPC.  I do not have material on that issue with me, but I know about it because I have been approached by many people in my own constituency in that regard.  The certificate of professional competency came from an EC regulation, sought to be implemented in early July, whereby anybody who did not hold such a certificate would virtually be put off the road.  The Department do not directly employ those subcontractors, they are directly employed by CIE.</P>
      <P>However, I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Brennan, about the matter because, both from a nationwide point of view and from my own local knowledge the measures seemed to be rather peremptory. I am sure that the people involved will all be notified, but the issue became public knowledge very peremptorily. The Minister assured me just last night, and I am glad to be able to pass on the knowledge, that the deadline has been extended to 1 January 1992, so that individual operators will now have an extra six months to achieve their certificates of professional competency.  Further courses for the certificate will be held in the autumn at various schools and colleges where the courses are held and operators will be able to undertake the courses or make other arrangements.  I understand that different members of the families of some contractors will undertake the courses.  Anyway, there is to be a six-month stay, which is good news.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given to me under Standing Order 20 (3) (a) and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy G. Mitchell, the circumstances of drivers, especially young drivers who have to pay increasingly large insurance premiums despite not having any claims against their insurance policies; (2) Deputy B. Durkan, if the Minister for Agriculture and Food will ensure that, in the context of the current appeals relating to the review of the disadvantaged areas, a thorough survey will be undertaken of all of county Kildare not yet reclassified with a view to including sufficient areas in the county to maintain parity with neighbouring counties; (3) Deputy P. Rabbitte, the need to set dates for the construction, commissioning and opening of the Tallaght Regional Hospital; and (4) Deputy Mac Giolla, the effect of the rezoning of 180 acres of land near Palmerstown, County Dublin, on the decision by the Minister to build three new satellite towns in west Dublin and to complete each of them with their own town centres to ensure that they were viable towns in their own right and not merely suburbs of Dublin.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann resolves that sections 4 to 6, 8 to 10, 15, 16, 18 and 19 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (No. 22 of 1984), shall continue in operation.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the break I had the opportunity to speak on the <Col N="2030" /> motion regarding the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  I said that the Fine Gael Party and I support the motion.  The motion deals with a large number of important matters that will affect the general public and the right of access to solicitors of persons detained at Garda stations.  The motion also relates to necessary powers being granted to the Garda Síochána to investigate crimes brought to their attention that required investigation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has presented a most interesting speech, a number of points of which I wish to comment on specifically. In October last, I raised a most important question on rural policing.  A number of members of the Garda Síochána at different ranks in the Force were concerned over changes that were being considered regarding the structure of the Force in rural areas.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise that the Fine Gael Party have at all times had a total commitment to the provision of the maximum numbers of Garda Síochána to serve the community in both urban and rural areas. We are also anxious to ensure that the Garda Síochána are provided with the most modern and efficient methods, equipment and technology to assist them in their fight against crime.</P>
      <P>Policy decisions have at all times been a matter that we felt should be discussed publicly and openly.  When I raised this matter in October last I was aware that in September 1990 a meeting on rural policing was held at Garda Headquarters with the then Deputy Commissioner McMahon.  The meeting was convened to discuss plans for rural policing.  Deputy Commissioner McMahon stated at the time that the four Border Garda divisions would not be affected.  Dublin was also not being included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was further outlined that the following 12 districts were to be included in the proposed restructuring of Garda arrangements, Enniscorthy, Nenagh, Ballinasloe, Longford, Newcastlewest, Birr, Loughrea, Tralee, Killaloe, Kanturk, Midleton and Baltinglass.  The <Col N="2031" /> existing two pilot schemes in Claremorris, County Mayo, and Thomastown, County Kilkenny, were to continue to operate.  The start-up date for this new scheme was to be 1 January 1991.</P>
    <P>Following my public statements, the Government recognised there was considerable opposition from the public to these new proposals.  For the benefit of the House, it is of interest to outline the situation as it exists in the Claremorris and Thomastown pilot districts. Claremorris Garda station is open to the public 24 hours a day.  Ballindine and Hollymount, which are in the Claremorris area, are open to the public for one hour a day.  Ballinrobe is the area headquarters.  It is open for two hours in the morning and one hour in the afternoon. Cong, Kilmaine and Shrule which are attached to Ballinrobe are open also for one hour a day.  The situation is almost similar in Thomastown.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to the House if I read an extract from <i>Garda News</i> of November 1990, which deals with the operation of these pilot schemes in Claremorris and Thomastown and I quote from Sergeant James Cannon's article:</P>
    <P>Under the scheme the local knowledge built up by a member in his own sub-district evaporates.  Crime is not being investigated as it should be because the system does not allow for appropriate follow-up action.  All contact with the general public is being lost and the lack of local knowledge is having an adverse effect on both the Force and the public.  The opening times for stations do not seem to be in accord with public need.  Patrol cars are being operated as a &ldquo;taxi&rdquo; service for the conveyance of members from one station to another.</P>
    <P>Sergeant Cannon continues:</P>
    <P>The main elements of the existing rural policing scheme are all Sergeants and Gardaí within an area are regarded as Area Officers and are detailed for duty in any part of the area.  It is <Col N="2032" /> patently clear that a Garda travelling up to 20 miles in a police car from a Headquarters Station to open a rural station for 2 hours each day is ineffective, impedes efficiency and will not improve the existing service.  It is difficult enough to get people to come forward to help the Gardaí and this situation becomes worse when Gardaí are distant from the local people.</P>
    <P>It is also of interest to quote an extract from the President of the Garda Representative Association, Mr. P.J. Stone, from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 8 May, 1991:</P>
    <P>The proposed Rural Policing Plan was being foisted on the Force as another great solution to the problem of falling numbers of Gardai in towns and villages.</P>
    <P>It is now the intention to give the impression of more Gardai in rural Ireland by giving the Force more mobility and having patrol cars travelling from town to town to open up stations for an hour a day so that an impression is given that Garda Stations are not closing.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now you see them, now you don't&rdquo;&mdash;a Paul Daniels type of illusion.</P>
    <P>Those are the words of the President of the Garda Representative Association, not mine.  I am not politically motivated in quoting this.  The people of Ireland have a right to know.</P>
    <P>What is happening is that the Government are in fact foisting a major policy change on the Garda Síochána without affording the general public an opportunity of publicly and openly debating this major policy change.  Garda management and the day-to-day running of the Force is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and the Garda Síochána. Policy and policy decisions are a matter for Dáil Éireann and for the people of Ireland to debate and to give a verdict upon.</P>
    <P>I reject this cloak and dagger approach of the Government on this policy change. I demand that the veil of secrecy that is shrouding this issue, should be lifted.</P>
    <P>The only way to combat crime in <Col N="2033" /> rural areas is to maintain and in fact increase the strength of the Force in rural areas, particularly nowadays when mobile criminals are moving from outside the cities into the country areas where they are striking terror into the heart of the elderly and the most vulnerable members of the community. Garda stations reduced to opening one hour a day are no answer to this very serious problem.</P>
    <P>The Garda statistics for 1990 which are overdue for publication have not yet been published.  In 1990, according to reliable information I have received, it is anticipated that there will be an increase in crime of 1 per cent nationwide and in 1990 there has been an increase of 6 per cent in the level of indictable crime outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>If I am wrong, I will apologise to the Minister.  However, those are the figures I have been given and I would like him to comment on them.  The general public are entitled to know whether I am correct. It is a serious matter when crime in rural Ireland increases by 6 per cent.  I wonder what is the delay in publishing these figures.</P>
    <P>I queried the Minister of State at the Department of Justice on Thursday last in this House on the proposals that are on the desk of the Minister for Justice where Garda stations are to be open to the public for only one hour a day.  I asked the Minister if it was not a fact that Garda management had submitted plans which effectively downgraded and reduced the hours of opening of many Garda stations in a number of areas across the country. This was denied by the Minister.  In his speech earlier today the Minister stated &ldquo;the Garda authorities have submitted to the Minister proposals for reform and enhancement of the rural policing arrangements&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there would not be a downgrading or closure of Garda stations and that rural stations and Garda houses would be renovated to encourage gardaí to reside in the communities they serve.  The Minister has taken poetic licence in outlining the facts <Col N="2034" /> in this issue.  The two pilot schemes in Claremorris and Thomastown indicate a reduced service in the towns and villages surrounding the district headquarters.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive discussions have already taken place with the chief superintendents in each of the districts referred to by me with regard to the implementation of new arrangements for rural policing. The discussions have covered the reduction of services down to one hour per day in the stations concerned.  If the opening hours of stations are to be reduced and if the numbers of gardaí employed locally are also reduced, I do not understand how there cannot be a downgrading of Garda stations.  If this scheme is implemented, reduced services would be provided in 100 Garda stations throughout the country, and the future viability of the stations will be threatened.</P>
    <P>This is the first phase affecting 100 Garda stations.  It is generally believed by the Garda that if this scheme is fully implemented over 350 Garda stations would be affected.  I do not see how gardaí are being encouraged to reside in the communities they serve when over 50 per cent of houses built for the gardaí have been sold or are in the process of being sold on the open market.  Will the Minister confirm that I am correct in that?</P>
    <P>Up to three years ago there were 960 properties comprising Garda stations and houses throughout Ireland.  There were 367 married quarters attached to Garda stations, 407 National Building Agency houses and 195 houses in the grounds of Garda stations.  I understand that the 367 stations with married quarters attached are being retained by the Department of Justice and that out of the 407 National Building Agency houses, 375 have been sold in the last few years to members of the Garda Síochána and their families and others to members of the general public.  I fully support that.  Of the remaining 195 houses in the hands of the Department of Justice and the Office of Public Works, 135 will be sold.  I understand that a memorandum was sent from the Department of Justice to the Office <Col N="2035" /> of Public Works within the past month urging that these houses should be sold. Last Friday evening I listened to the Minister for Justice on television saying that Garda stations would not be downgraded and that the houses for the Garda Síochána would be refurbished and so on.  A few minutes later in a local paper I saw two Garda houses for sale, one in Cloughjordan and the other in Ballingarry north.</P>
    <P>These measures to reduce the opening hours of rural Garda stations and to downgrade Garda stations are policy matters and we should debate them here. The general public are entitled to be made aware of the facts.  I will listen with interest to the Minister's reply.  Certainly I and many people in the 12 districts referred to are very concerned about the future.  The House is entitled to a detailed answer.  I do not want any more of the bluff and bluster of the Minister for Justice. I want specific detailed replies.</P>

When passed by this House this resolution will allow the detention and related provisions in sections 4 to 6 and 8 to 10 of the 1984 Act to continue on an indefinite basis, as well as those provisions in sections 15, 16, 18 and 19 which concern the withholding of information regarding firearms, ammunition or stolen property and inferences that may be drawn by the court from an accused's failure to account for certain matters.  In the time available I am not in a position to respond in detail to all the matters raised, but I will do my utmost to respond to as many as possible.</P>

    <P>Deputy Barret suggested that Garda strengths are static or down in stations in his constituency.  Garda numbers are up in Dublin and in the rest of the country, and our present recruitment policy will more than replace the number of gardaí who retired since 1987, or who are due to retire in the next few years.  I see <Col N="2036" /> Deputy Barrett shaking his head.  I am sure he will accept that when we left office in 1983 we had in position a recruitment campaign that had selected 2,000 young gardaí and that when his party left office in 1987 they had only slightly less than exhausted that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Coupled with the civilianisation policy which is now in full swing, we are putting more gardaí than ever on operational duty for which they were recruited and trained.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barret called for the setting up of a criminal law reform commission.  The Minister for Justice has no proposals for the establishment of a separate criminal law reform commission.  His approach to the need for updating the criminal law is to deal with the matter on a systematic basis, affording priority to those areas in most need of review.  In this, the Minister is assisted by the work of the Law Reform Commission who have published recommendations on many aspects of the criminal law and are currently reviewing other criminal law matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred to white collar crime and to other sophisticated crime. The Minister on a number of occasions in reply to parliamentary questions indicated to the House that he accepts the need for updating our criminal laws and that he is doing a good deal about it with all the speed that the resources at our disposal allow.  The Minister has before the House the Criminal Damage Bill, 1990, which we will debate next week. It proposes to replace the Malicious Damage Act, 1861, and penalises the unauthorised modification and assessing of computer data.  Also we hope to be shortly in position to publish a Criminal Evidence Bill which will provide among <Col N="2037" /> other things for the admissibility of evidence in criminal matters relating to business and computerised records.  We will also be introducing a Bill to provide for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other serious crime and the prevention of money laundering. As to the area of the law dealing with crimes of dishonesty, the Larceny Act, 1990, which Minister Burke initiated, updates and refines the law on receiving.  The Law Reform Commission are at present conducting a comprehensive review of the law on other aspects of dishonesty and their report, when published, will receive our early attention.</P>
    <P>Since assuming office as Minister for Justice in July 1989, Deputy Burke has promoted a number of other important Bills to deal with modern day crime.  The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, for example, provides for very strict controls on the carrying of offensive weapons and effectively bans stun guns; and the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, provides for the taking of body samples for DNA and other forensic tests.  This record is clear evidence of progress in updating the area of the law referred to by Deputy Barrett.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also referred to juvenile justice.  The Minister for Justice is concerned to develop programmes and initiatives which will help to prevent young people from becoming involved in crime, to guide those who have slipped into crime back to a law abiding lifestyle and to assist the rehabilitation of those young people who have entered the custodial system administered by the Department of Justice.  To this end the Minister initiated an ongoing review of the juvenile justice system within his Department.  I will very briefly outline some of the progress made.  A national office to supervise the service was established last December, juvenile liaison officers were then put on a seven day roster to facilitate evening and weekend working.  The length of time spent with and the number of visits made to young people on this scheme will be varied to reflect the extent to which continuing <Col N="2038" /> supervision is required on an individual basis.  Work is also at an advanced stage in new procedural guidelines for the operation of the scheme's cautioning and supervision system and a new training curriculum for juvenile liaison officers is being put in position.</P>
    <P>Based on a pilot project developed by the gardaí in St. Patrick's Teacher Training College, Drumcondra, and carried out in Tallaght in 1990, a Garda schools programme which aims to develop positive attitudes towards law enforcement and the gardaí is now in operation in 14 Dublin schools.  It will be extended to Limerick, Waterford and Cork in the near future.</P>
    <P>The probation and welfare service, with local Garda support, are actively involved in the implementation of community based programmes designed to effectively deflect youngsters from law breaking.  Already three specialised remedial projects have commenced at Cherry Orchard and in the Coolock-Darndale area of Dublin and in South Hill, Limerick.  Other measures being taken are the assignment of extra probation and welfare officers to areas where the incidence of crime is high and the utilisation of the resources of statutory and voluntary social agencies elsewhere.</P>
    <P>With regard to those children and young people whom the courts decide must be committed to custodial institutions, the position is that the provision of special school accommodation for boys under 16 years of age and girls under 17 years of age is a matter for the Department of Education.  My colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, is providing additional accommodation at Lusk, County Dublin. These places will come on stream very shortly.  Young offenders over those ages are, for the most part, detained, in the case of males, in St. Patrick's Institution and Wheatfield; and in the case of females in the Women's Prison, Mountjoy.  Wheatfield is a very modern facility where emphasis is placed on education and work training for young offenders.  An extensive programme of refurbishment at St. Patrick's and the <Col N="2039" /> Women's Prison is under way which will upgrade the facilities in those institutions.</P>
    <P>A juvenile justice Bill, to replace the Children Act, 1908, is also being prepared in our Department and will be introduced in due course.  To ensure maximum co-operation between the Departments which have responsibility for the welfare of children and young persons&mdash;Health, Justice and Education &mdash;all work in these areas is being co-ordinated by an interdepartmental committee under the chairmanship of the new Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Flood.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred to the need for proposals in relation to the victims of crime.  I was pleased to announce earlier this week that the Minister for Justice had made provision to increase the grant-in-aid by our Department to the Irish Association for Victim Support from £8,000 to £12,000 in the current year, an increase of 50 per cent.  I was also happy to state that we have made arrangements to provide accommodation in the Four Courts complex to enable members of the association to advise and support victims before and during court hearings and to provide a waiting room for victims awaiting commencement of court proceedings. In future, such waiting room facilities for victims and witnesses will be taken into account when designing new court accommodation.  Indeed, this has already been done in the case of the Children's Court complex at Smithfield in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The association have requested provision for court compensation orders in favour of victims of crime.  The Minister for Justice was happy in that regard also to inform the association that provision is made in section 9 of the Criminal Damage Bill, 1990, currently before the House, to enable the court to require a person who has been convicted of damaging property to pay compensation to the owner.  The Bill also provides that where it is appropriate to impose a fine and to make a compensation order but where the means of the offender are insufficient to pay both, the court may give preference to compensation.  I am <Col N="2040" /> sure Deputy Barrett will be pleased to hear that.</P>
    <P>Concerning injuries suffered by victims of crime, the Law Reform Commission have been asked to examine whether there is a need to revise or update the law on offences against the person and their report, when received, will be examined in due course.  The question of empowering the courts to order compensation to be paid to victims injured in the course of crime will be considered by the Minister for Justice in conjunction with his examination of the recommendations the commission make on the law relating to offences against the person.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme of compensation for personal injury criminally inflicted, which is funded through the Department of Justice, a total of £6 million was provided for payment of awards of compensation in 673 cases by the tribunal in 1990.  I am glad to have this opportunity to compliment the Association for Victim Support for providing a valuable service to the public.  I had the pleasure of doing so personally when I accepted this week the association's proposals for a charter of rights for victims of crime on behalf of the Minister for Justice and the Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to section 6 (4) which makes provision for the case when a person is detained between midnight and 8 a.m.  The necessity for this provision arises from the brevity of the period of detention permitted, a maximum of 12 hours, and the consequential difficulties which could ensue for the Garda arising out of late night arrests having regard to existing instructions and the rules relating to oppression. It provides mechanisms for ensuring that time is not running against the gardaí while the suspect is resting.  Under the subsection the member in charge of the station is able to authorise suspension of questioning between midnight and 8 a.m. to give the detained person a reasonable time to rest.  The subsection provides that the consent in writing of the detained person is necessary before questioning may be suspended.  This takes account of the possibility that the person might <Col N="2041" /> prefer to have the questioning continued. In order to suspend questioning, the member in charge must give the detained person a written notice for which he must sign a receipt, specifying the time the notice is given and the time up to which questioning is suspended.  The giving of the notice, which requires the detained person's consent, stops the clock; any period during which questioning is suspended does not count as part of the permitted six plus six hours detention period.  The effect of this could be that a person might be held in a Garda station for up to 20 hours if, for example, questioning was suspended for the full period between midnight and 8 a.m.</P>
    <P>It would negative the powers of the Garda almost entirely if they had to deduct a period of eight hours sleep from the permitted period of detention.  Even if the rest period was counted as part of the detention period, it would not improve the quality of the surroundings or encourage sleep.  Under Garda instructions a suspect must not be questioned for more than four hours at a stretch after which he must be given a break for rest and refreshment.  If the period from midnight to 8 a.m. was reckonable and if regard was had to breaks in questioning as well as time spent travelling to the Garda station after arrest, the Garda could find themselves in the position of having effectively not much more than four hours for the investigation of a very serious offence.</P>
    <P>The provision for suspension of questioning is intended to operate as much for the benefit of the detained person as for the Garda.  If something like this had not been included, the criticism could have been made that the powers of detention were oppressive.  Only one notice must be given suspending questioning. This precludes the possibility of abuse through the use of repeated suspensions and resumptions of questioning.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to sections 15 and 16 and the obligations they contain to provide the Garda with information in certain circumstances.  There is a number of similar provisions in existing law relating to the withholding of information. <Col N="2042" /> Section 2 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972, provides that where a garda has reasonable grounds for believing that a person whom he finds at or near the scene of a scheduled offence has knowledge of the offence he may require the person to give an account of his recent movements. Section 107 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, makes it an offence not to give information about the identity of the driver of a vehicle involved in a road traffic offence.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan suggested that the regulations for the treatment of persons in Garda custody were cumbersome. Those regulations provide for the first time for a statutory code of practice to be followed by the Garda in dealing with persons in custody.  Previously the Garda instructions were confidential.  They deal with such matters as the conduct of interviews; conditions of custody; notification of parents of arrested juveniles and the presence of a parent or, if not available, some responsible adult while a juvenile is being questioned.  Responsibility for seeing that the regulations are observed has been placed on a single identifiable member of the force, that is, the member in charge of the station at the material time.</P>
    <P>The aim of the regulations is to ensure that the Garda at all times act with integrity and with respect for the personal rights of persons in custody, particularly any of them who may be under a physical or mental disability, and their dignity as human persons, while complying with the obligations to ensure their safe custody and continuing to act with diligence and determination in the investigation of crime and the protection and vindication of the personal rights of other persons.  I am glad to say that in their report the Martin committee stated &ldquo;the information which we have received from defence solicitors is to the effect that, without exception, the member in charge takes his responsibilities seriously and ensures meaningful compliance with the regulations.&rdquo;  That is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan called for the expansion of the criminal legal aid scheme to <Col N="2043" /> include visits by solicitors to persons detained in Garda stations.  There is no provision under the criminal legal aid scheme at present to cover such visits. All fees and expenses paid under the scheme are payable only in respect of the period after the defendant has been charged in court.  This matter was raised during the course of the debate on the 1984 Act.  The then Minister for Justice said that there could be no question, in the prevailing circumstances, of the State paying out of public funds for the services of solicitors in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The matter was examined by the Martin committee.  They said that attractive though the idea of a duty solicitor may appear at first sight, they were less than sanguine as to its operation in practice. Their considerable reservations in relation to such a scheme arose from the wording of schemes in England which had collapsed through lack of support from solicitors.  Moreover, many of the experienced defence lawyers who assisted the Martin committee through written and oral submissions left the committee &ldquo;in no doubt as to the Committee's total lack of faith in the effective operation of such a scheme&rdquo; in this country. As a result, having considered the matter fully, the committee concluded, on page 45 of their report, that they were unable to advise the setting up of a duty solicitor scheme.  The committee noted the offer made by the Association of Criminal Lawyers to operate a pilot scheme in a limited number of Garda stations without seeking remuneration for their services but no scheme has so far got off the ground.</P>

      <P>Perhaps other initiatives need to be taken also.  Some Deputies referred to the operation of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939. That Act permits the Garda to arrest and detain for a period of up to 48 hours persons reasonably suspected of having <Col N="2044" /> been involved in the commission of certain offences &mdash; offences created by the Act and offences under the Explosive Substances Act, the Firearms Acts and the Malicious Damage Act, 1861. Suggestions were made that the Act is too widely used but I should point out that in 1989, the latest year for which figures are readily available the number of detentions under the Act was 2,040. This compares with a figure of 7,410, in the same year for the number of detentions under the 1984 Act.  The 1984 Act has an important bearing on the operation of the 1939 Act and this fact may not have been fully appreciated by Deputies. The importance of section 9 of the 1984 Act is that it applies to persons detained under section 30 of the 1939 Act various safeguard provisions which are contained in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the 1984 Act, and these include the right of access by a solicitor and the requirement that the taking of photographs and fingerprints must be authorised by a Garda superintendent or a higher officer.</P>
      <P>Moreover, section 10 of the 1984 Act contains specific safeguards against rearrest and detention for the same offence.  Under that section a person is not liable to be arrested again for the same offence unless it is for the purpose of charging him with the offence immediately or the Gardaí receive further information and a district justice authorises the rearrest.  This restriction operates in relation to the use of section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act where a section 4 detainee is released because in order to detain that person under section 30 he would have to be arrested and, accordingly, section 10 would apply.  A person who is arrested for an offence under section 30 and not charged cannot be detained under section 4 for the same offence or for an offence of which he was, or ought reasonably to have been suspected at the time of the initial arrest. Finally, as regards the 1939 Act I should mention that the treatment of persons in Garda custody regulations made under section 7 of the 1984 Act apply to all persons in Garda custody, including those detained under the 1939 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2045" /> Deputy McCartan proposed that there should be further reviews of the operation of the 1984 Act.  This Act does not provide for continuing reviews.  Nevertheless, the statistics which I circulated with my speech, in respect of which the Deputy was complimentary will continue to be collected.  I can assure the House that my Department will keep the operation of the 1984 Act under review.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the Garda Complaints Board.  The major improvement in processing arrears, largely due to the additional staff assigned to the board at the end of 1989, resulted in the embargo, to which the Deputy referred, being lifted in February this year.  The Minister for Justice informed the Dáil on 27 November 1990 that there were 1,013 complaints on hand of which approximately 126 were from pre-embargo days and that the true arrears figure then was about 750 complaints. The figure was obtained by substracting from 1,013 the number of complaints received in the previous four months, that is the time it takes for a complaint to go through the system.  At present there are 662 outstanding complaints and the true arrears figure is 483. Therefore, there are 267 fewer complaints now than there were about six months ago.  The Minister for Justice and I are pleased that in a situation where the staffing resources are still not fully satisfactory the board have managed to reduce arrears by over one-third in a six month period.  As I said in my introductory remarks, the Minister for Justice is still actively pursuing the question of providing further staff for the board and the necessary financial provision has been made in this year's Estimate.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the provision in the Criminal Justice Act relating to electronic recording.  It was audio recording, that is, sound only, which was being considered at the time the Criminal Justice Bill was enacted.  Audio recording was in operation on a trial basis in some other countries at that time, including the United Kingdom, to which the Deputy referred.  Research was carried out by the Department of Justice and the Garda <Col N="2046" /> Síochána in relation to those trials and the type of recording equipment which might be used.  However, in view of developments in technology some countries which had introduced audio recording during this period are now trying out video recording on a trial basis.  As I indicated in my opening speech, the Martin committee also considered the question of introducing audio recording which would cost substantially less than video recording but they came down in favour of the latter.  We are now in a position to avail of the experience of other countries in relation to both audio and video recording and to ensure that any system introduced takes account of the lessons learned in other countries. We must most certainly make the best use of scarce financial resources.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can be certain that the strength of the force is being maintained.  Deputy Barrett referred to the drug trafficking problem and the measures being taken both in this country and in the European Community to combat it.  The position is that extra gardaí have been drafted in to deal with the drugs problem and this morning approval was given for the appointment of a detective inspector to the drugs squad.</P>
      <P>With regard to the measures being taken to ensure that the European Community will not become a haven for drug trafficking after 1992, a point Deputy Barrett referred to also and which I agree is a very important matter, it is receiving the ongoing attention from the Ministers for Justice of the European Community, and high level departmental and European officials and police officers right across the member states.  The Ministers for Justice at their meeting during Ireland's Presidency of the EC in Dublin last year agreed and subsequently published a programme of action in this matter.  The programme of action contained a detailed list of measures designed to protect the citizens of the European Community when the internal borders are removed.  This programme includes measures in relation to crime in general and terrorism and gives particular attention to drug trafficking.  Very intensive work is being carried out to give practical effect to the measures proposed and these are subject to further detailed consideration by the Ministers for Justice at their meeting which is taking place today in Luxembourg.  I refer Members to a reply which my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds gave to a question tabled by Deputy Spring on 22 May last in relation to the compensatory measures which will be taken by customs authorities and other law enforcement agencies to combat drug trafficking as a result of the removal of the frontiers within the Community at the end of 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred also to car burning in his constituency.  On 9 June a youth was charged in respect of several <Col N="2048" /> of these offences.  The House will appreciate that I cannot comment further in this regard as to do so would prejudice the rights of the accused but it is to the credit of the Garda that through their intelligence network and their vigilance they have at least been able to apprehend one person.</P>
    <P>Deputies also referred to the need generally for reform in the criminal law area which is very clear.  A number of important Bills have been enacted recently.  I mentioned earlier the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious or National Hatred Act, 1989, the Larceny Act, 1990, the Criminal Justice Act, 1990 &mdash; to abolish the death penalty &mdash; the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, and the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990.  The Criminal Damage Bill, 1991, is before the House at present and will be debated next week. During the past few days the Minister for Justice presented to the House the Courts (No. 2) Bill, 1991 which <i>inter alia</i> allows district court summonses and summary cases to be served by post.  He hopes shortly to be in a position to publish a Criminal Evidence Bill which among other things will provide for the admissibility as evidence in criminal matters of business and computerised records and a Bill to provide for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other serious crimes and the prevention of money laundering.  He will also be bringing forward proposals to amend the law relating to certain sexual offences including homosexual offences and to amend the law in relation to criminal insanity and to replace the Children's Act, 1908.  By any standards this is a very impressive programme of reform and the Government's record is clear, and in particular the commitment of both the Minister for Justice and the Department of Justice to ensuring that we play a key role in reforming the law is absolute.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred to the increase in the number of break-ins to houses in the Shankill area.  Both I and the Minister for Justice are concerned about any increase in crime in any area.  Deputy <Col N="2049" /> Barrett and Deputy Hillery expressed their concern when they brought this matter to my attention.  However, experience has shown that an upsurge in particular types of crime occur on occasions in particular areas.  The Garda authorities monitor the problems and adjust and adapt their strategies to meet changing crime situations.  For obvious reasons I cannot say what the Garda strategy is in dealing with these problems but I have had discussions with the Garda authorities and in particular with some Garda officers in the Deputy's area about the problems experienced and I am satisfied they are taking all the necessary steps to deal with the situation.  The overall position is that the decreasing trends have continued nationally since 1984, as I outlined earlier, in crimes such as attacks on the elderly, which are down by almost 90 per cent, residential burglaries, down almost 20 per cent, unauthorised taking which is down approximately 45 per cent, and larcenies from persons, down about 23 per cent.</P>

      <P>The situation in the Dublin Metropolitan area is being very closely monitored by the Garda authority and a number of measures are being taken by them to deal with the specific problems in that area.  These include the use of additional patrols and check points and for the deployment of Garda resources to meet the special requirements of particular areas.  In addition the Garda are continuing to encourage and promote community involvement in crime prevention activities such as the neighbourhood watch schemes.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that these <Col N="2051" /> measures are proving very effective and we are very happy with that.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the final contribution from Deputy Enright.  He said that the Government were forcing new arrangements for policing rural areas on the Garda authorities under a veil of secrecy.  I thought that Deputy Enright, as a member of the legal profession, always acknowledged that first he is a public representative, and I am sure he would be the first to admit that we cannot continue to operate the system of policing what was there over the decades and centuries.  Indeed I have to compliment both Deputy Barrett and Deputy McCartan on their outstanding contributions this morning.  I cannot quibble with their contributions, they were positive, detailed, and of the highest quality. Deputy Barrett, in particular, acknowledged the new type of criminal and the new situation which people find themselves in.  If we are to be complimented for anything it is surely for effort and innovation.  We must ensure there is a new policy of making 24 hour cover available to all the people both urban and rural.  That has been the theme of the many contributions made here today.  I want to set the record straight.  As I stated in my opening address, the Garda authorities have submitted to the Minister proposals for reform and enforcement of the rural policing arrangements.  Deputy Enright has referred to this and this contradicts the allegation that the Government are forcing a policy on the Garda authorities.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I want to repeat, there will be no closure or downgrading of Garda stations.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, has said it on numerous occasions and I said it in this House.  I say it again on his behalf and on behalf of the Department of Justice and the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to consulting local people in the areas affected, full consideration will be given to any views conveyed by interested parties, including those referred to by the Deputy.  The Garda <Col N="2052" /> authorities already engaged in full consultations with the Garda representative associations before putting their proposals to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright referred to the sale of Garda houses.  Many of them were vacant for some considerable time and were falling into disrepair.  Many of the houses were located a considerable distance from the Garda stations concerned and were provided at a time when gardaí were not in a position to purchase their own houses.  Times have changed very much. Garda houses which are being retained, particularly those attached to stations, are being refurbished so as to encourage gardaí to live in them within their own area.  I was delighted to have responsibility for implementing the decision, following an ongoing battle by the Garda associations lasting over decades to be allowed to purchase the houses in which they lived.  The Government took a decision in 1988 in the interests of security that only Garda houses which were detached from stations would be sold. Members of the Force who occupied those houses would be given first option to purchase.  If the member occupying the house was not interested, members in the station would get the next option. If none was interested, the house would be sold by public tender.</P>
    <P>There is no point in taking out of context what has been said by the Minister for Justice or me or statements by the Department of Justice pertaining to this matter.  Where accommodation is attached or adjacent to a station, money has been allocated for the upgrading of that accommodation.  A voluntary option is being given to gardaí in the various districts to live in those houses.  I attended a meeting in the midlands last weekend at which a Garda sergeant volunteered, after consideration, to take up one of those options.  A number of these houses are strategically located in rural areas. We want to ensure that the gardaí live in the community in which they work and that there is a co-ordinated approach across Garda districts, areas and divisions in maintaining 24-hour cover.  We want to ensure maximum mobility and the <Col N="2053" /> maximum back-up of computer and other technological resources.  Criminals who are finding the vigilance of the Gardaí too much for them in urban areas will find that the 24-hour cover in rural areas will ensure that they will be detected and apprehended there as well.</P>
    <P>I trust we have put the matter in context and I sincerely thank all those who have made positive contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell has been given permission to raise the matter of the circumstance of drivers, especially young drivers, who have to pay increasingly large insurance premiums, despite not having any claims against their insurance policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my thanks to the Ceann Comhairle for choosing this matter for the Adjournment Debate.  I want to highlight the dreadful circumstances of drivers, especially young drivers like the person in my constituency who paid third party, fire and theft premiums of £877 in 1989, £1,299 in 1990 and £1,960 in 1991 on the same car, without any claims whatsoever.  This is an outrageous demand for an insurance company to make on somebody who has not had a claim.  The charge has almost tripled between 1989 and 1991 on a man who has shown that he is a capable and careful driver who does not abuse his insurance cover.  Unfortunately this man, who happens to be 22 years of age, is not alone in this problem.  His car is a 1982 Opel Kadet the value of which is not very <Col N="2054" /> high.  He finds himself, in common with a number of young people of his age, either not able to get a quote or only getting quotes which are beyond his means and those of his family to meet.</P>
      <P>People here are paying to the same companies twice or three times as much for basic insurance cover as people in Northern Ireland or Britain.  I find this hard to understand, particularly given the strife there has been in Northern Ireland for more than 20 years.</P>
      <P>Our response to this problem has been to be inactive in Government and as a House not to come to terms with alleviating the problems of drivers, especially young drivers, who are paying through the nose for car insurance.  We tried to ease the problem by abolishing juries in certain circumstances.  I pointed out in this House that the sub-committee on motor insurance costs which I chaired made an interim report which recommended that no such abolition should take place until such time as the Irish Insurance Federation gave an undertaking that the costs of car insurance would come down.  They were not in a position to give that undertaking but were canvassing hard for the abolition of juries.  The House went ahead with the abolition of juries and we have seen that the cost of insurance has not come down. The federation said in evidence to the sub-committee that within five years the cost of insurance would decrease.  We said we did not believe there would be a reduction and we have been proven right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also sought a unilateral EC derogation for the insurance industry after 1992.  Why should we seek such a derogation?  Is it not time this House looked at the needs of the consumer? The insurance industry is in the business arena.  Their objective is profit and they should be able to operate in the marketplace without the sort of protection they are getting and they should not be able to rip off this young man and people like him who cannot get reasonable motor insurance cover.  Why should we seek a derogation for the insurance industry after 1992?  Why should not somebody from Dublin be able to go to Belfast, <Col N="2055" /> Cardiff or London for a quote since companies from those places come here to do business?  It is scandalous that the Government and this House continue to uphold a situation where the insurance industry is being protected from competition while young drivers and others not so young cannot get cover at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment talks about the problem of uninsured drivers. Many young people are not very experienced and sometimes they do not realise the very serious consequences of driving without insurance.  If they could somehow have an opportunity to show their civic mindedness by being given some cover for the vehicles they are driving for insurance purposes a large number would avail of it.  In other words, we are putting people into situations where they are unable to get cover and for that reason are driving cars without insurance. This is just one more example of a section of the business community who are not being taken on and who are indicating in their accounts that they really are not making money out of this, they are making money from investments.  They cannot make money from investments without taking it in in premiums in the first place.  I ask the Minister to take them on, let us forget about this derogation and give all drivers, particularly young drivers, an opportunity to get a quotation which is half way reasonable or decent for car insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind both the Deputy and this House of what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said on numerous occasions over recent months, in that, as the insurance supervisory authority, he has a responsibility to ensure that insurance companies meet their statutory solvency and reserve requirements. The Government do not, therefore, have responsibility for the day to day operations of insurance companies. The right of insurance companies to make their own underwriting decisions in the <Col N="2056" /> light of their particular circumstances and assessment of the market must be respected.  In the case of motor insurance there is, of course, a legal obligation on all motorists under the Road Traffic Acts to have minimum third party insurance. However, no legal obligation can be placed on any individual insurer to quote in respect of any risk, to quote at any particular premium or to quote in any particular manner.</P>
      <P>The price of insurance, including motor insurance, in this country, as indeed in any other market is directly and substantially dependent on the frequency of claims and the cost of settling those claims.  In 1988, insurers sustained underwriting losses of £48 million on their motor portfolios.  The corresponding figure for 1989 was £116 million and losses for 1990 are expected to be similar to the 1989 figure.  Confronted with losses of this magnitude and in order to maintain their viability insurers have considered it necessary to increase their premiums in line with their claims experience or to exercise more selectivity in the type of risk undertaken.</P>
      <P>The fundamental cause of high insurance prices for consumers in Ireland is the high claims rate allied to the high cost of individual claims.  These factors bear on the level of insurance premia quoted to young drivers as well as those quoted to more mature motorists.  We must get this straight.  Fewer accidents on the road with a consequential lower risk of injury to the individual will bring down insurance premiums and will be the biggest contributing factor to determining the level of premiums not just now but into the future.  I am not going to delay the House by quoting statistics for age groups, accidents and the graph in relation to the annual increase in the claims in these areas.  They are astronomically high and getting very close to unbearable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are aware that when an insurance company quote in respect of motor risks for young people the premiums may be regarded by those concerned as excessive.  The cost of motor insurance for young drivers, however, <Col N="2057" /> tends to reflect the claims experience of motor insurers.  While I sympathise with the situation in which young drivers find themselves, statistical evidence has shown that they are more likely to be involved in accidents and, therefore, to cause claims.  The cost of these claims can only be met by insurers if a realistic premium is forthcoming to cover the risk involved.</P>
    <P>The Government are concerned at the high cost of motor insurance.  An inter-ministerial group, comprising of the Ministers for, Justice, and the Environment, the Attorney General, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce are at present examining ways and means of improving the environment for motor insurance in particular.  This group are focusing on strict and sustained enforcement of existing road traffic legislation, amendments to the Road Traffic Acts designed to reduce the motor accident rate, suggestions to improve the cost and availability of motor insurance and improvements or alternatives to the courts system for the resolution of personal injury claims.  It is hoped that this may result in a number of positive proposals which can be implemented in the very early future.  I would add, however, that Government action of itself will not reduce or stabilise motor insurance costs. Consumers must play their part by increased awareness of the need for safety.</P>
    <P>Turning to where a motorist cannot obtain motor insurance, an arrangement exists with the insurance industry to assist in such cases, through a body called the Declined Cases Committee.  This committee, established under the Declined Cases Agreement, is comprised of representatives of the authorised motor insurance companies.  They examine cases which have been declined by five or more motor insurance companies and nominate one of the companies to quote for the risk involved.  Before a case can be submitted to this committee for consideration, it is necessary to approach and obtain written refusals from five motor insurance companies.  These should then be forwarded to the Declined Cases <Col N="2058" /> Committee, Irish Insurance Federation, Russell House, Russell Court, St. Stephen's Green, Dublin 2, indicating the order in which the insurers were approached together with details of any previous insurance held in the last three years.  It should then be possible to have the necessary cover arranged.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Deputy may be aware that a formal common position was adopted by the EC Council of Ministers under the Irish Presidency on 20 June 1990 on the EC Directive on freedom of services for motor insurance, which is due to be implemented by all member states before 20 November 1992.  The underlying principle of that directive is the creation of greater competition in the areas of policy conditions and premium rates and that the general availability of insurance should improve overall.  While it is hoped that the opening up of the Community market will intensify competition, it should be noted that there is already a massive foreign presence in the Irish motor insurance market.  Over 80 per cent of non-life insurance undertakings operating in Ireland are foreign owned. Increased competition will not automatically lead to a reduction in insurance costs in Ireland.  Prudent insurers, indigenous, foreign established or foreign services must set their premium rates to match the compensation payout.  The compensation levels existing in each individual member state should determine the premium rates charged by both established and services insurers.  The implementation of the motor insurance freedom of service directive should help to emphasise the role of the policyholder in determining the premium paid and minimise any misconceptions about &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; and &ldquo;home&rdquo; motor insurers in this regard.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government are concerned to look at every avenue that could help young people or, indeed, anybody seeking insurance cover, but we cannot turn away from the reality of the statistics that face us in terms of the sustained underwriting losses <Col N="2059" /> and the increased payout in compensation on the individual claims which directly affect and determine the level of premiums today.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Tallaght New Regional Hospital.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The shelving of the Tallaght regional hospital is the single most devastating decision for the Tallaght region made by this Government, and I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his office for giving me the opportunity to raise this desperately urgent issue.  No other decision has caused so much distress, disappointment and dismay to the thousands of parents of young families in the region which includes not only Tallaght itself but Clondalkin, Rathcoole and Firhouse and runs from Brittas to Ballyboden, Whitechurch to Walkinstown to west Wicklow and from Saggart to south Kildare.</P>
      <P>Imagine leaving more than 200,000 people without a hospital.  Imagine the additional hardship imposed on parents who depend on irregular and expensive public transport to take sick children to hospital.  Imagine the disillusionment of the hundreds of unemployed building workers who were promised jobs by Fianna Fáil, starting in 1990, on the building of this hospital.  Imagine the disappointment of the hundreds of ancillary and health care staff who anticipated employment at Tallaght following the transfer of the three hospitals to Tallaght.</P>
      <P>What did Fianna Fáil promise in 1989? I have here a copy of the actual advertisement inserted in the media by Fianna Fáil during the general election campaign of 1989 in which they stated that:</P>
      <P>Building of the massive new Tallaght hospital in Dublin which was to have started in 1991 has been brought forward to next year.</P>
      <P>Chairman of the Tallaght hospital board, Professor R. T. W. L. Conroy said that Health Minister, Dr. Rory O'Hanlon has agreed to accelerate the development programme.  It is now hoped that work would be underway in about 15 months time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2060" /> The advertisement continued as follows:</P>
    <P>By voting Fianna Fáil on the 15th June you will ensure that the improvements which are taking place will continue.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil campaigned on that commitment during the 1989 general election campaign and many people welcomed the news that they were at last, some 30 years later, going to have the Tallaght Regional Hospital.  Since 1989 I have consistently pressed the Government at every opportunity on the hospital.  Notwithstanding the failure to meet their promises to the people of the area, I was assured in reply to regular parliamentary questions, for example, on 6 March 1990 that &ldquo;construction will commence in 1991&rdquo;.  Again, on 29 November 1990 I was assured that the Minister had received &ldquo;a list of selected tenderers for approval&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, on 7 February in reply to a further question from me, the Minister for Health, Dr. O'Hanlon, finally conceded that &ldquo;the capital allocation available to my Department for 1991 does not allow for the commencement of any major new capital project ... Tallaght hospital will not commence in 1991&rdquo;. More alarmingly, the Minister refused to say when the hospital would be built and there is now growing desperation that Fianna Fáil and this Government are shelving the hospital indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Flood, is an elected Deputy for the constituency, the Government seem totally unaware, or perhaps they do not care, about the hardship being endured by so many families in the most populous region of the country.  The entire region to which I have referred earlier has a catchment area of about 200,000 people. This hospital was first mooted in 1961 and decided on in 1968.  Thirty years later there is no hospital and no thought for thousands of young families who are cheated of such an essential facility.  That would not be tolerated in any other region of the country.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister for Health this <Col N="2061" /> evening to set out at a minimum, a new schedule giving precise dates for the construction, commissioning and opening of the Tallaght regional hospital.  I sincerely hope, unlike the last occasion when we raised this matter, that the Minister will not engage or indulge in any personal abuse in his reply.  This is an urgent and pressing issue for the people whom he and I represent.  I have very briefly traced the history in the time allowed.  The deferral was not announced, as a great many people in Tallaght and elsewhere think.  The deferral was elicited by way of parliamentary question from me; otherwise we would have got past the local elections without the matter being made public.  I hope also he will not use the Adelaide issue as a excuse because it is no more than an excuse especially in the context of the unprecedented, welcome and widespread support for the campaign by the Catholic clergy in Tallaght who have banded together and who have decided to highlight and campaign on the issue of the building of the Tallaght hospital.  I have never seen that happen before.  There are other related issues. Tallaght desperately needs the jobs this hospital would provide.  It would help the town to generate its own economy.</P>
    <P>The appointment of Deputy Flood to the Department of Health has been welcomed by me.  I sincerely hope that his presence at the Department of Health will mean that a new schedule will be agreed and that commitment to a date when construction work can start will be announced immediately &mdash; after all the disappointments &mdash; how long the commissioning will take and when we can expect the Tallaght hospital to be opened.  It is an urgent issue for so many people in an area that is badly affected by unemployment and where there are so many young families who need regular access to hospital care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Rabbitte I too am pleased that on this occasion he has not engaged in the sort of personal attacks which he conducted against me when we last debated this <Col N="2062" /> issue.  His more restrained approach to the topic this evening can only be more helpful.  I would like to put on record, since Deputy Rabbitte has touched on a number of these issues, the substantial commitment made to the Tallaght area by the Fianna Fáil Government since 1987.</P>
      <P>When one talks about jobs, education opportunities and environmental improvements in so far as Tallaght is concerned one immediately thinks of the excellent square now built and open; one thinks of the Tallaght Regional College under construction which will provide 1,200 places; of the Jobstown Community College fought for by the parents of Jobstown and provided by a Fianna Fáil Government; of the upgrading of the Tallaght village and the major improvement environmentally of a village that was dying on its feet.  One also thinks, in terms of jobs, of the development of the Whitestown Industrial Estate where £3 million was ploughed into the western part of Tallaght by the Fianna Fáil Government.  All is not bleak in Tallaght. Those of us who represent Tallaght have a certain pride in the tenacity of the Tallaght people to achieve what is their rightful entitlements as far as the development of Tallaght is concerned.  It was because the people of Tallaght believed in their future and gave a commitment to that future that so much development has taken place in such a short time in the Tallaght area.</P>
      <P>Returning to the Tallaght hospital, I am pleased that the Deputy has given me an opportunity to explain the position in relation to the likely start up date.  I want to put on the record again that the original plan for the development of hospital services in Dublin provided for six major hospitals, three on the north side comprising Beaumont Hospital, the Mater Hospital and Blanchardstown Hospital and three on the south side comprising St. James' Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital and the new hospital at Tallaght.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the opening of the new Mater Hospital and the commissioning of St. James's Hospital which will take place later this year, Tallaght will be the only <Col N="2063" /> part of the plan still to be put in place. Both the Minister for Health and I are fully committed to the project.  In this regard I should remind the Deputy that it was on the invitation of the Minister that the three hospitals involved in the move to Tallaght, who are working very well on this objective &mdash; the Meath, the Adelaide and the National Childrens' Hospital &mdash; came together to agree the management structure for the new hospital.  We welcome the considerable progress made in achieving this objective. Soon we will have the group's report.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be interested to know that the Tallaght hospital project will cost an estimated £180 million.  As I have said before in the House, it will be the biggest single health project ever undertaken in this country.  I have also previously <Col N="2064" /> informed the Deputy that the construction period involved will be about four years, following which a further period of about 18 months will be required for commission purposes.</P>
    <P>In relation to the likely start up date, the present position is as I have outlined before in the House and as I have advised the people of Tallaght, that the capital allocation available to my Department in 1991 does not allow for the commencement of any major new project in the health capital area in 1991.  I want to state clearly in this House that the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, and I are at present preparing a programme of capital development for the health services for the next few years.  I want to assure the Deputy and the House that this programme will include provision for the Tallaght hospital.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 18 June 1991.</P>

      <P>The day-to-day running cost of primary schools are discharged by making funds available by means of the capitation grant scheme and the contribution from local sources.</P>
      <P>The capitation grant is not intended to meet the operating costs in full.  A local contribution towards school running costs equivalent to 25 per cent of the capitation grant must be lodged annually to each school bank account.</P>
      <P>As I already pointed out in my statement on the Primary Education Review Body Report my Department are undertaking a unit cost study in the primary and post-primary sectors in order to determine the cost of operating schools. The existing rates of capitation grants to schools will be considered in the light of the results of this study.</P>
      <P>In the meantime I would point out that additional funds are being made available under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> for secretarial and caretaking support in schools.  Commencing in 1992, I will be expanding the provision for caretaking and clerical services to all national schools with 100 pupils upwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to inform the Deputy that £1.5 million is being provided in 1991 to enable special assistance to be given <Col N="1997" /> to schools serving disadvantaged areas under a number of headings.</P>
    <P>Between 1987 and 1990 the capitation grant was increased from £24 to £28 which is an increase of almost 17 per cent.</P>

      <P>I have been advised that, where the operation of a school transport service according to time-table involves children being brought to school in the morning before normal time of commencement of school business, or children waiting at school in the afternoon after conclusion of school business, the board of management may be held liable in the event of an accident to pupils during the period intervening.</P>
      <P>This advice was conveyed to schools at the time by circular letter.  A copy of the circular is included as an appendix in the constitution and rules of procedure of boards of management.</P>
      <P>School insurance cover is a matter for individual boards of management of the schools and I would, therefore, not be in a position to comment on individual school policies.</P>
      <P>In the case of post-primary schools it is a matter for the school authorities to ensure the safety of pupils while on school premises and that adequate insurance cover exists in the event of an accident to a pupil.</P>
      <P>The State provides a general indemnity to community and comprehensive schools in lieu of their taking out insurance cover against liabilities which may arise.  This indemnity cover children from the time they arrive at school in the morning until they leave in the afternoon.</P>

      <P>The allocation of full-time teaching staff to schools is based on the number of recognised pupils and the prevailing pupil/teacher ratio.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the pupil/teacher ratio will be reduced to 19.5:1 from the commencement of the school year 1991-92 and to 19:1 in the following year.  In addition, the programme provides for additional posts for the disadvantaged, for guidance and <i>exquota</i> vice-principal teachers.  The provisions of the programme will create about 900 additional teaching posts at post-primary level.  These arrangements complement provisions already made for additional posts for remedial teachers, teachers for schools in disadvantaged areas, etc.  Overall, therefore, everything possible is being done to assist schools in providing as wide a range of subjects as possible, consistent with school size.</P>
      <P>These arrangements do not preclude secondary schools from employing additional teachers from their own resources, which is entirely at their own discretion.</P>
      <P>There are in excess of 1,000 teachers in the post-primary sector over and above what a strict pupil/teacher ratio would give when one takes into account the variety of <i>ex-quota</i> posts for remedial, guidance, small schools, sole providers, curricular concessions, etc.</P>

      <P>It is not correct that 80 per <Col N="2011" /> cent of national schools have a pupil-teacher ratio of 35:1.</P>
      <P>My Department announced in March of this year improved staffing arrangements for national schools as part of the agreement negotiated under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> These arrangements aim at reducing the overall pupil-teacher ratio, currently at 26.6:1, to 25:1 over a two-year period.</P>
      <P>Under the first phase in the 1991-92 school year, teaching posts which would otherwise decline by approximately 250 due to falling enrolements, will be retained and 250 new posts will be created in September 1991, giving a total of 500 posts altogether.  This will reduce the over-all pupil-teacher ratio to 25.8:1 for the 1991-92 school year.</P>
      <P>In the second phase in the school year 1992-93, a further total of 470 posts will be retained with a balance of further new posts created in September 1992, to achieve the overall pupil-teacher ratio of 25:1 for that year.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will also be aware the pupil-teacher ratio is obtained by dividing the number of teachers into the number of pupils enrolled in national schools.</P>
      <P>The overall pupil-teacher ratio includes, in addition to ordinary class teachers, administrative, non-teaching, principals, teachers in special schools and classes and remedial teachers.</P>

      <P>The eligibility of all applicants for grants under the higher education grants scheme are assessed at present on the basis of parental income. I do not accept that assessment on this basis constitutes an anomaly in the case of applicants deemed to be dependent on their parents.  In the case of eligible students whose attendance at a course necessitates living away from home a higher level of maintenance grant is payable under the scheme.</P>
      <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> an undertaking has been given to re-examine a number of areas of the scheme.  These include the question of the assessment of income of mature students who are not dependent on their parents as well as regarding mature students who secure a place in a third-level institution as satisfying the academic requirements for the award of a grant under the scheme.</P>

      <P>Rule 19 of the rules for national schools prescribes that the manager must arrange that the school premises are insured.  Following the setting up of boards of management in 1975, the Rules of Procedure and Constitution of Boards, published for the first time in 1976, distinguished between functions of the board and functions of the trustees. Section 22 of this document contained the ruling referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Appeal was made to the Department on behalf of management authorities that this provision effectively constitutes a change in existing practice.  The Department re-examined the matter with particular reference to the role of the trustees, Rule 19 of the Rules for National Schools and the most appropriate method of payment and decided to accept the appeal.</P>
      <P>This was conveyed to management authorities by Circular 10/80 of 1980.  This position was then in turn included in the revised edition of the Boards of Management: Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure, published in 1985, which states: &ldquo;under the terms of the lease, the trustees guarantee that the premises and contents are insured against fire and tempest.  The cost of this insurance may be charged to the school account&rdquo;.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that the domiciliary allowance for the parents of handicapped children currently being paid at the rate of £83 per month is adequate; his views on whether it should be abolished and replaced with an allowance like that of a single parent of £66.50 per week; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The domiciliary care allowance for the parents of handicapped children is totally different to the single parent allowance which is administered by the Department of Social Welfare and could be the total income of a single parent.</P>
      <P>The domiciliary care allowance will be increased to £85 per month from 21 July 1991.  Children in receipt of this allowance would normally also qualify for a range of benefits including free drugs, medicines and appliances necessary for their condition.  In addition their parents may be entitled to a tax-free allowance of £600 per annum.</P>
