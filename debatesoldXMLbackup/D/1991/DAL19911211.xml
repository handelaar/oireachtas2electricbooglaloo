      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 16 and 17, No. 17 to be taken not later than 5 p.m.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) business shall be interrupted at 11 p.m. tonight; (2) the sitting shall be suspended today from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.; (3) in the case of the Second Stage of No. 17, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications shall be called on not later than 10.40 p.m. to reply to the debate; the questions necessary to bring the Second Stage, including the making of an order for Third Stage, to a conclusion shall be put successively not later than 11 p.m.; and the order shall not resume thereafter and (4) Private Members' Business, which shall be No. 25, shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business I would like to ask the Taoiseach why item No. 17 is being rushed through the House?  It seems that this business is being taken very hastily and without a lot of preparation.  It is very obvious that there is a very serious problem between the Minister and the board of B &amp; I.</P>

Is it agreed that there be a suspension of business today from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with item No. 17 agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is reasonable and is what I would expect from you, Sir.  The Fine Gael Party object to the attempt to guillotine the B &amp; I Line Bill.  We do so because there are serious issues involved in this Bill concerning the maintenance of surface transport links between this island and the rest of the world and particularly in view of the competitive disadvantage at which Ireland has been placed in regard to the exemption of Britain from the social charter last night. It is very important that Ireland has competitive transport links if our industry is to compete with that of other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We are objecting to the manner in which this Bill has been brought before this House and is being rushed through the House; it is not in the best interests of B &amp; I or, indeed, of the country.  Again, I appeal to the Taoiseach <Col N="944" /> to allow more time for debate on this matter and I will outline my reasons for this request during the debate.</P>

      <P>Given the complexity of the agreements reached at Maastricht this morning, would the Taoiseach make available officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs to provide a briefing this afternoon, before tomorrow's debate?

      <P>I wish to point out that the Estimates are later than they have ever been since 1986.  I do not think that was the Taoiseach's intention.  In the Taoiseach's early days there was an attempt to bring the Estimates forward earlier but since 1986 they have never been as late as they are this year.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Maastricht Summit, I note that two hours are provided tomorrow for statements.  Could I ask the Taoiseach whether he would put down a motion in order that the House may have a debate and ask questions of the Taoiseach to which he could reply at the end of the debate?  I further ask the Taoiseach to extend the time provided beyond two hours.</P>

The usual practice is to deal with the matter at this stage by way of statements but, as I have already said, on the basis of the information that I shall be able to give the Dáil tomorrow and Deputies' reaction to that, consideration can be given to the way in which the Dáil could be further informed of all the various complex issues involved.</P>

      <P>Not wishing to be argumentative in this regard &mdash; and I shall be very brief &mdash; may I draw your attention to the wording of the amendment which proposes the insertion of the words &ldquo;in addition to the proposed colleges in <Col N="956" /> Thurles and Castlebar&rdquo; in line 18, section 2 (1), in other words, something of a futuristic nature?  We are talking about enshrining a general principle on the basis that there has been a clear commitment by the present Government to establish three regional technical colleges, one in Tallaght, at present in course of construction for which we are very grateful, and two others in the provinces, one in Thurles, County Tipperary, and the other in Castlebar, County Mayo.  What we are seeking here is not in any way to impose a charge on the Exchequer, not to obligate the Government to any further revenue raising, but merely to enshrine in this Bill the general principle that it is Government policy that they would establish &mdash; hopefully in the not too distant future, but certainly not today &mdash; regional technical colleges in Thurles and Castlebar.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;elected local representative&rsquo; means a person who, for the time being, is an elected member of the council of a county, a county borough or an urban district;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During the Second Stage debate a degree of concern was expressed with regard to what was seen in the Bill as a diminution of the role of democratically elected local representatives.  I have taken note of these concerns and, accordingly, I am prepared to prescribe that at least five of the eight vocational education committee nominees to the governing body shall be elected local representatives.  This definition is to cover that provision in section 6 dealing with the governing bodies.  It is a move in the direction of meeting the criticisms expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the general thrust of this amendment. Vocational education committees are <Col N="958" /> made up of 14 members.  Then additional people are added from urban district councils and other autonomous bodies within the area of the vocational education committee.  There is a minimum and a maximum elected requirement, thereby enabling people to be co-opted as distinct from elected.  For example, it is established that there should be one clergyman, and sometimes one clergyman for each persuasion.  As a result of the stimulus applied by the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act, 1981, introduced by Fine Gael, a letter was sent from the Minister to local authorities exhorting them to include a parent and a teacher in vocational education committees. That request has been observed by most vocational education committees. There is a differentiation between elected members and co-opted members.  Would it not be more appropriate to include the phrase &ldquo;elected or co-opted local representative&rdquo; to put the matter beyond doubt and ensure that it is technically correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The total is eight and five are to be elected.  The criticism raised earlier was about the lack of representation of elected members.  That was the criticism from the vocational education committees and other bodies.  We have made a genuine effort to include members of the county council, the county borough and urban council, but the right belongs to the vocational education committee to nominate people to the three remaining vacancies.

      <P>The phrase &ldquo;elected local representative&rdquo; means a person who, for the time being, is an elected member of the council of a county, a county borough or an urban district.  If a member of a county council or an urban district council dies, there is not a by-election; instead there is a co-option.  The person co-opted is not elected to the council and, therefore, cannot be one of the three members designated here.  A co-opted member would not seem to be <Col N="959" /> eligible under the wording of the proposed amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins is looking at all sorts of possibilities.  A person who is co-opted to a council is elected by the councillors.  That is one interpretation. The person co-opted would not necessarily replace the deceased person as a member of the governing body.</P>

      <P>I maintain that when the Minister is advised further in relation to the reservations raised by this side of the House, he will be advised that I am technically correct in what I am saying.  I am seeking to have the wording made watertight.  We will consider tabling an amendment on Report Stage to make it absolutely clear that there will be no prohibition on a co-opted member of a local authority being covered by the terms of this amendment.</P>

      <P>It is an unnecessary addition.  Already on the county councils there are members who have been co-opted and, therefore, deemed to be elected.  They are also members of the vocational education committee.  Co-option has not prevented any councillor from being a member of a vocational education committee.</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins is probably correct on this point.  A Bill must stand up in court and a judge's decision as to who is an elected member might be different from ours.  I would agree with the Minister that we could deem a person co-opted to take the place of an elected member as being elected by the councillors.  The parliamentary draftsman might consider the wording to ensure that it will accomplish what we all have in mind.  The wording should cover a person who is a member of a local authority, either elected or co-opted.</P>

      <P>I share the concern expressed by Deputy Higgins and I fear that the wording of the Minister's amendment would be taken to exclude persons <Col N="960" /> who are co-opted.  I had the experience of being a co-opted member of South Tipperary County Council.  On the day we were waiting for President Ronald Reagan to arrive at Ballyporeen, Deputy Davern &mdash; now Minister &mdash; pointed out to me that I was only a co-opted member rather than an elected member of South Tipperary County Council.</P>

      <P>There is most definitely a difference, in the view of the Minister, Deputy Davern.  It was clearly pointed out to me on that occasion.  I wonder if the Minister recalls it.  The question needs to be clarified and I see no reason the word &ldquo;co-opted&rdquo; cannot be inserted to remove any doubt.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that the amendment should cover an elected or a co-opted local representative.  It was pointed out to me that I was only a co-opted member and the same could be pointed out to any other person.  The section needs to be clarified.</P>

I will have another look at the matter between now and Report Stage but I honestly think the Deputy's fears are groundless.  The suggestion may only complicate matters as a person who is co-opted to a vocational education committee may be entitled to be a member of the governing body.  It could be interpreted in that way if I included the words &ldquo;co-opted or elected representative&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 5, after &ldquo;the&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;principal&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>No distinction is made in the Bill between what we term the principal vocational education committee &mdash; the vocational education committee of the area in which the college is located &mdash; and associated vocational education committees.  Many of those involved in regional colleges and the vocational education sector have expressed fear that little or no cognisance has been given in the Bill to associated vocational education committees.  We must remember that we are talking about regional colleges which are supposed to represent the region in which they are situated and surrounding areas.  It is very important that a distinction is made between the principal vocational education committee and more important, that the role of associated vocational education committees be defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little or no mention of the <Col N="962" /> associated vocational education committees in the Bill.  These vocational education committees rightly feel that this will lead to a diminution of their role within the regional technical colleges structure.  We wanted the Bill to be clear and precise and it is for this reason we believe the word &ldquo;principal&rdquo; should be inserted where reference is implied to the principal vocational education committee. Reference is made throughout the Bill to the vocational education committee and I cannot see why the word &ldquo;principal&rdquo; cannot be inserted.  This would clearly define that reference is being made to the vocational education committee in whose area the regional college is located.  It is most important that we define the associated vocational education committees.  The Minister should avail of this opportunity to set out the associated vocational education committees who will be associated with our regional colleges.</P>
    <P>We put down these amendments to clarify this point and ensure that the associated vocational education committees are given a well defined and clear role within the regional colleges structure. I hope the Minister will accept these amendments which seek to clarify the difference between the principal vocational education committees and he associated vocational education committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to ensure an appropriate balance on the governing bodies between representatives of vocational education committees in whose area the college is located, that is, the principal vocational education committee, and other vocational education committees in the college region, or associated regions.  I have sympathy with the general sentiments behind the amendment which seek to ensure the involvement of all vocational education committees in the college region.  However, section 6 (4) (b) provides that up to four of the eight governing body members nominated by the vocational education committee can, <Col N="963" /> by direction of the Minister, be nominated by other vocational education committees in the college region.  It is my intention to use this provision to ensure that the appropriate vocational education committees will be represented on the governing bodies of all colleges &mdash; there will be two in some areas and three in others.  This provision provides for flexibility and at the same time can be used to ensure appropriate representation.</P>
      <P>The difficulty of enshrining in the First Schedule the names of the associated vocational education committees is that this would relate to the present geographical distribution of the colleges.  If a further college or colleges were to be established, as was referred to earlier, the schedule of associated vocational education committees would still apply but would no longer be relevant and the Act would have to be amended to alter it. I do not think we should lock ourselves into this position.  I assure the House I will use the existing provision in section 6 (4) (b) as intended so as to ensure representation on the governing bodies of the appropriate vocational education committees.  The governing bodies will be responsible for the preparation of the operational programmes for the colleges required under section 13.  Accordingly, all the vocational education committees represented on the governing body will have an input into this process.  I should point out that the amendment should relate to line 6 and not line 5 on page four.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the co-sponsors of this amendment I should say that our intention is entirely honourable &mdash; I think the Minister accepts that.  Furthermore we are seeking to establish a clear differentiation between the vocational education committees within the catchment area of the regional technical college in question and the host vocational education committee, the principal vocational education committee. By giving a minimum of four places to the host vocational education committee the Minister is, and we accept <Col N="964" /> this, achieving a numerical balance in relation to the other vocational education committees within the catchment area. We are seeking to ensure that there is a clear distinction between the associated vocational education committees and the principal vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>For example, in the case of Galway, the City of Galway Vocational Education Committee are the host vocational education committee for the Galway Regional Technical College.  The vocational education committees of counties Clare, Mayo, Roscommon and Galway come within the catchment area of the college and are represented on the governing body.  However, there is a clear difference in that Galway Vocational Education Committee are the host committee and they, numerically, have the greatest number of representatives on the governing body. Therefore, in terms of the precise technical wording of the Bill they would seem to merit the title &ldquo;principal vocational education committee&rdquo; as distinct from the other vocational education committees within the functional area of the college.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the example of the south-east region with which I am most familiar.  There will be a representative from each of the four associated vocational education committees on the governing body of Carlow Regional Technical College.  Similarly there will be a representative from each of the four associated vocational education committees on the governing body of Waterford Regional Technical College.  If in the future it is the dearest wish of Deputy Lowry, for example, or someone else, to have a representative from Thurles on the governing body it will be easier to do this under the provision as it stands.  It is our intention to ensure that four associated vocational education committees will have a representative on the governing body.  It would be wrong to enshrine the names of the associated vocational education committees in the First Schedule as this would relate to the <Col N="965" /> present geographical distribution of the colleges.  Rather we should be able to adjust them later.</P>
      <P>Section 6 (4) (b) provides that up to four of the eight governing body members nominated by the vocational education committee can, by direction of the Minister, be nominated by other vocational education committees in the college region.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The word the Cork School of Music and the Crawford College of Art and Design use is &ldquo;school&rdquo;. If the Deputy feels there is a problem regarding whether they are called schools or institutions I would be prepared to look at it between now and Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said but I put it to him that it is a new concept brought in to suit a particular case.  I would ask him to look at this in a general context.  For example, in future if a particular college wished to break into schools or to move a certain section into a school it would be important that a statutory framework and a clear definition exist.  On the basis that the Minister will look at it between now and Report Stage I am prepared to accept that and await the outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were some other points on sectin 2 that I wish to raise.  Section 4 deals with members of the college.  It tells us who members are and what category of person can become a member of the college but the Bill does not define what a member is.  I realise that sometimes this type of terminology is a matter of prestige more than anything else.  If that were defined in section 2 it would be clearer and would give more prestige to what a member is. A major problem relates to the looseness of drafting and who the employer is under the terms of the Bill.  For instance, the vocational education committee appoint and can dismiss members but only on the recommendation of the governing body. My concern is in relation to the Department of Labour Acts, but particularly the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, <Col N="967" /> 1989.  This Act places very stringent and onerous responsibilities on an employer. The Bill is vague and as drafted it is not clear who is the employer.  This legislation does not allow for the following through of the safety of people employed in a particular college.  A definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; should be contained in the Bill and some reference made to it at a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first point raised by the Deputy, the members of a college shall be the members of the governing body, the members of the academic council, the members of the staff, the registered students of the college, the graduates of the college and such other persons as the governing body my appoint to be members.  Membership of a college under subsection (1) (f) shall continue until the governing body otherwise declare.  The Deputy referred to the safety legislation: that will be the responsibility of the colleges and staff, not of the vocational education committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment we sought has been ruled out of order on the basis that it would have involved a charge on the Exchequer.  Basically, the amendment refers to the definition of college in section 2 which reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;college&rdquo; means an educational institution established by or under section 3 of this Act as a regional technical college or as a college to which this Act applies;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The colleges in question are those defined in the First Schedule to the Bill.  As regards the word &ldquo;college&rdquo; and its definition and the locations enshrined in the First Schedule to the Bill, in the cases of Athlone, Carlow, Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Letterkenny, Waterford, Sligo, Tralee and Limerick, the existence of a college in each of those locations has proved to be a catalyst for growth in those areas.  Despite the fact that up to now <Col N="969" /> they have technically been barred from embarking on joint ventures or research and development, it is well known that many of the colleges use their ingenuity to involve themselves in a certain amount of dialogue with enterprise in their areas. It is not a coincidence that in Athlone there are some industries involved in plastics and that there is a plastic research unit in the regional technical college.  In this Bill we are trying to broaden the remit of those colleges to allow them engage in these areas.</P>
    <P>A clear commitment was given by Fianna Fáil and by the previous Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government that they would establish three further colleges. One of those colleges is well under way and nearing completion but the other two seem to be as far from reality as on the day they were promised.  I am delighted that the college in Tallaght is going ahead and we look to it to provide an appropriate level of certification and diploma and degree awards in the Dublin area.  There should be another regional technical college in Dublin's inner city. It should not have been the spending of £9.7 million of taxpayers' money that we will debate at Question Time today.  We should be debating areas more appropriate to the Taoiseach, but because of a personal intervention that is what we will debate at Question Time today.  That money should have been spent on another regional technical college.</P>
    <P>A site for a third level college was bought in Castlebar.  Every September or October about 3,000 students are involved in a mass exodus from the county to Galway, to Sligo, to Letterkenny, to the various colleges, Dublin Institutes of Technology and universities. In Mayo we have the highest level of participation in third level education. For a county that has not an industrial base we look to education to fill the vacuum, to exploit our best resource, our young people.  We have a cast iron case for a third level college in Mayo and for a third level college in Tipperary. Anywhere a third level college has been built it has proved to be the catalyst for development in the area.  If one looks <Col N="970" /> at the population graph, apart from the locations where the colleges are, the west of Ireland seems to be in inevitable decline.  Galway and Sligo, because of their colleges, are the only two areas which have managed to swim against the tide.  The establishment of the colleges in those areas and the liaison that is developing between the colleges and industries in the areas, has been the main stimulus for growth.</P>
    <P>If industrialists are considering coming to an area they will look at all the infrastructure in the area and educational facilities are of paramount importance because it is from third level institutions mainly that they will get their graduates. It is third level institutions with whom they will liaise in terms of research and development, which is sadly absent from a lot of our industries.  We have a lot of torso industries &mdash; the body being here but the head and feet elsewhere so that when the pressure comes on they leave the country.  The two counties which have particularly chronic unemployment problems and which have a high level of participation in third level education need a serious commitment to the establishment of third level colleges.  It has been argued that people have been well catered for in the comprehensive range of faculties provided.  However it is very hard to get into some of the faculties.  We train 20 opticians per year in Kevin Street College of Technology.  It is the only college which provides this course and one cannot get into it.  There is a chronic shortage of opthalmic opticians and people have to wait for from six to 12 months for opthalmic services.  The people in opthalmics do particularly well but we could open up the market and train more opticians.  In a regional technical college in either Castlebar or Thurles this is a prime faculty which could be developed.  We could open up another faculty of opthalmic optics.  In this country we do not have any faculty in astronomy. People who wish to study astronomy must go to England or Scotland. We are not a nation of star gazers but this is an area of considerable growth.</P>

    <P>In response to a further Parliamentary Question on 17 February 1983 the Minister for Education, Deputy Hussey said that she was aware of the decision of her predecessor and that she was satisfied as to the validity and the strength of the case for a regional college in Castlebar.  From that time on all inquiries and representations with regard to a regional technical college in the town were answered on the basis that such projects were being considered in the context of third level investment programmes.  Subsequently decisions on priorities in regard to the various projects would be made in <Col N="972" /> the forthcoming national plan.  At that time the document which laid out the educational requirements, <i>Building on Reality</i> said at paragraph 7.85:</P>
    <P>New Regional Technical Colleges in Tallaght, Dun Laoghaire and Blanchardstown, and the commencement of planning of new Colleges in Thurles and Castlebar have also been proposed. Subject to further examination of the need for each project, and to availability of finance, as many as possible of these projects will be commenced in the Plan period.</P>
    <P>On 16 May 1985 the Department of Finance issued formal sanction to commence planning and design of the Castlebar and Thurles projects and on 7 June 1985 the then Minister, Mrs. Hussey, announced the go-ahead for both colleges at Castlebar and Thurles.</P>
    <P>On 28 June 1985 a design team, architects, a services engineer, a structural engineer and a quantity surveyor, were appointed.  The college was designed to cater for 800 students with a price tag at that time of around £9 million.  There were subsequent meetings with the vocational education committee and the curriculum was determined and various other matters in that regard.</P>
    <P>I myself was appointed as a junior Minister in the Department in 1986 and something like 14 different sites were examined in the town area.  Eventually agreement was reached between the county council, the IDA and the urban council on a very suitable site.  The then county manager, the late Mr. O'Malley, in a letter of 2 February 1987 said:</P>
    <P>I can now state that a site is available located between Travenol Laboratories and Davitt House on the main Castlebar-Claremorris Road.  The site is about 18 acres in area and has a frontage to the main road of 650 feet.</P>
    <P>He went on to indicate the services that were available.  I know the Chair is anxious about this and I will finish quite soon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> Facilities for sewage disposal, facilities for surface water disposal, public water supply, road frontage and footpath access from the public road, public lighting, three phase current and telecommunication services were also available immediately adjacent to it.</P>
    <P>He then went on to issue details of the cost per acre.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to that on 28 January 1987, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, said in a letter to the then Minister for Education, Mr. Cooney:</P>
    <P>I am also agreeable to the purchase of a site for the proposed Castlebar Regional Technical College.  As soon as an appropriate application is received my Department will sanction it.</P>
    <P>That official reply from the then Minister for Finance is on the record.</P>
    <P>On 16 November 1989 after further negotiations the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, said in reply to a parliamentary question:</P>
    <P>Pending receipt of the committee's report, a number of capital projects were deferred, including the proposed regional technical college at Castlebar, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>It went on from there until her colleague the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, changed tack slightly with the Minister for Education and they proposed third level courses in the town.  In the course of an interview given by the then Minister, he said &ldquo;Negotiations are going on and it is my intention to further these talks and hopefully to bring them to a happy conclusion with courses starting at the end of this year&rdquo;.  That was last year.  In a reply this year the Minister for Education said:</P>
    <P>With regard to course approval, any outcentre provision of courses would have to be under the aegis of a regional technical college.  Therefore, the question of approval of specific courses does not arise at this time.  I will be keeping an active interest in this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="974" /> I have no doubt that Minister Davern will maintain an active interest both in Castlebar and Thurles.  As a person who has served on vocational education committees, who understands the complications and the pressure that is placed on parents in sending their children to third level institutions, I ask the Minister, during his tenure as Minister for Education, to look seriously at this and, if he is not in a position to take up the commitments that were there initially, to have a purpose built regional technical college and at least see to it that third level courses would be allocated under the aegis of Galway Regional Technical College or Sligo Regional Technical College in the shortest possible time.  There are facilities provided and County Mayo has the third or fourth highest participation level in third level institutions.  This is of great concern and imposes financial pressure on many students.  I would ask the Minister to look at this matter very seriously.</P>

      <P>Coming from Tipperary which was promised a regional college, and which now seems to be in the distant future, I cannot but view with a certain degree of envy the contents of Schedule I.  I congratulate those centres on the work they have done.  Nevertheless there is a compelling case for the establishment of regional colleges in both Castlebar and Thurles.</P>
      <P>As in the case of Castlebar, a regional college to provide technical education in engineering, science and technology was approved for Thurles in 1982.  Because of that a 20 acre site was bought in 1987 and a design team was appointed.  Unfortunately, as a result of Government cutbacks, Thurles was one of the places to suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the disappointment in 1987 a very interested group, the Regional Technical College and Rural Development Institute Action Group, have not rested on their laurels but have continued to plan for the proposed regional technical college in Thurles.  Their studies and planning for that college makes an even more compelling case for a college in <Col N="975" /> Thurles as a priority.  There would be no overlapping with the colleges mentioned in Schedule I because Thurles intends to go down a separate road with a rural development institute, a new and unique concept and one that is urgently needed in this country.</P>
    <P>There are several reasons that justify the establishment of a regional technical college and rural development institute in Thurles.  There is a shortage of third level places in this country.  In 1989 the Minister for Education said there would be a need for an extra 10,000 places by the year 2000.  Steps must be taken to provide those places in strategic locations.  If the Minister decides, as I hope he will, to have Thurles as a priority, 800 extra places could be provided there.</P>
    <P>The most important point I want to make in the case for the college at Thurles is that it is a unique concept.  It would be a rural development institute serving Tipperary, West Laois, South Offaly and West Kilkenny.  More important, we also intend to have sub-centres based in second level schools in the catchment area.  The proposals for Thurles are based on community development.  The proposed courses are based on agriculture, forestry, alternative income generating farming enterprises and technology transferred to rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is important to have an institute that provides courses in rural development. Now, more than ever before, we need such an education centre.  We need education courses based on our natural resources which, in our catchment area, are agriculture, forestry, peat and coal. The proposed rural development institute would provide post-leaving certificate courses to cater for the growing demand which is not being met outside the large urban areas.  It is also proposed that this college should provide a mix of programmes which could be adapted to meet changing national needs and demographic trends in the area.</P>

      <P>I am keeping to the amendment which refers to the proposed college in Thurles.  It was pointed out in the 1988 Clancy report that Tipperary had the fourth lowest participation rate nationally among the lower socio-economic grouping.  We, in South Tipperary, did not need any report to point out that fact to us because we knew it already. We note also that in those areas where a college is located a greater number of students move from second level to third level education.  It is no surprise, therefore, given that we have no regional technical college in Tipperary, that we have the fourth lowest participation rate among the lower socio-economic grouping.</P>
      <P>The proposal submitted on behalf of the action committee spearheaded by the chief executive officer in North Tipperary, Mr. Luke Murtagh, and the Leas-CEO in South Tipperary, Mr. John Slattery, is unique in that there would be a mix of development and education.  Not only would this project be of benefit to South Tipperary it would help to exploit the potential of not alone Tipperary but the country as a whole and lead to a very important link between education and rural development.</P>
      <P>The Minister should commit himself to implementing this proposal and provide regional technical colleges in Castlebar and Thurles.  I will leave it up to him to decide which should be given priority. We should take this opportunity in discussing the Regional Technical Colleges Bill to identify those areas where there is an urgent need to establish a third level college.  Given that the proposed development in Thurles would be unique and is urgently needed, I ask the Minister to give Thurles and Castlebar the attention and priority they not only require but deserve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to secton 2 and the definition of the word &ldquo;college&rdquo;. For snob value, a high class secondary school can be, and is, referred to as a &ldquo;college&rdquo;.  In this Bill it is defined as a regional technical college.  We also have the National University of Ireland, which includes Dublin, Cork, Galway and, belatedly, Limerick, formerly the NIHE. The definition of &ldquo;college&rdquo;, therefore, is extremely loose.  If one is a mere secondary teacher in a high class school one classifies oneself as a &ldquo;professor&rdquo; but in the local CBS or run of the mill school, one is an ordinary teacher.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We need a clear definition of &ldquo;college&rdquo; given the wide variation in interpretation from the ordinary secondary school to university level, and it has not been clearly defined which has the greater status.  In this instance, we are talking about regional technical colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can sympathise with the representatives in this House from Thurles and Castlebar who have been promised new regional technical colleges for many years.  There should be a system for grading colleges.  They should be upgraded, or downgraded on the grounds of their performance.  Not alone should we have a system of regional technical colleges but we should have also an organised system of make sure that those colleges do the best work possible in the national interest.  In other words, what I am saying is that each college should provide basic courses but, they should specialise in a particular area because what we have at present is a mixum-gatherum.  There is no planned format.  For instance, the set of courses available in Dundalk might also be available in Athlone and Waterford. I am saying that each should provide a core of subjects, to give everyone living in a particular locality a reasonable chance of availing of advanced education courses in those colleges, but in addition they should specialise in areas such as <Col N="978" /> agriculture, business studies and computer training to ensure there is no overlapping which is happening to present.</P>
    <P>If a college shows by its excellence and performance that it should be upgraded then it should be upgraded.  We should have ratings &mdash; to draw an analogy, we could call them TAM ratings &mdash; between colleges which are performing exceptionally well and those which are not.  In particular, I am thinking of the performance of the NIHE, Limerick, which is due in no small measure to the leadership of Dr. Edward Walsh who brought that institution from what was considered ordinary to the status of university college. His work and the work of the staff has been recognised.</P>
    <P>I wish to make the point, very briefly, before you rule me out of order, that the performance of the regional technical college in Waterford has been seen to be so effective that it deserves a higher grading.  It should be included as one of the colleges of the National University of Ireland.  The Minister should appreciate this given that the college is located in his own region.  Each region, if it has not already got a university college, should have one.</P>
    <P>Those living in the major centres of population &mdash; Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick &mdash; can avail of third level education at a relatively cheap price &mdash; economics form a major part of education.  It is heart-rending to see brilliant students being precluded from taking up advanced courses because their parents cannot afford to send them to college where they can pursue their particular vocation and duly qualify.</P>
    <P>Each region should have its own college associated with the National University of Ireland if its excellence justifies that standard.  People who cannot afford it should not have to pay in the region of £4,000 to £5,000 per year to stay away from home.  The cumulative cost of educating to degree standard a student not resident at home is in the region of £15,000 per annum.  If two or three children in the same family are attending university simultaneously one can well imagine the financial burden involved. <Col N="979" /> It is beyond the means of most people, especially when our tax system does not allow relief for educational expenditure.</P>
    <P>Where excellence is shown, as in the case of Waterford Regional Technical College, the Minister should use his influence and seek the advice of his senior officials in the Department of Education to ensure that the people in the region benefit from the institution's excellence. The people of south Tipperary, Kilkenny, Carlow, Wexford and Waterford city and county would applaud his decision.  We should not be in a straitjacket in so far as colleges and universities are concerned; we should have an open mind and be able to adapt, change and upgrade.  The system is too rigid and because of that it is downright unfair.</P>

      <P>I have no hesistation in making a case for Dún Laoghaire because I was interested to hear the spokes-persons for Fine Gael referring to commitments given in the mid to late eighties to Thurles and Castlebar about the construction of regional technical colleges in those areas.  The promises to which I am referring in relation to Dún Laoghaire go back much further than that, to 1980, when a firm commitment was given that a regional technical college would be provided in Dún Laoghaire as one of four new regional colleges which were to be built in the greater Dublin area to address the under-representation of Dublin people in third level education.  It has already been well documented in the Benson and Clancy report and others which have documented the extent to <Col N="980" /> which participation in third level education is under-represented in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>I have seen practical evidence of this as in my own constituency people travel to Waterford &mdash; which, if Deputy Deasy's wish is granted, may soon be a university &mdash; to participate in courses which they cannot get in Dublin.  Young people, neighbours of mine, get up at 6 a.m. to travel on the DART from Shankill to Connolly station to connect with a train going to Maynooth because they cannot get places in the greater Dublin area.  I know of many cases of young people having been deprived of the opportunity of getting into third level education in the greater Dublin area because of the shortage of places.  It is an established fact that it is much harder for a young person to get into a third level course in Dublin than elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The idea was that the new regional technical colleges &mdash; of which Tallaght was one and I am glad it is now going ahead &mdash; were to redress the balance and one was to be located in Dún Laoghaire.</P>

When the local elections were over the plan was <Col N="982" /> shelved and we have not heard a word about it since.  The 25 acre site is still there, there is a building on it, and there is still no information from any Government quarter as to what will happen in regard to the promise to establish a regional technical college in Dún Laoghaire.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not speak for long. I am disappointed that the amendment was ruled out of order on the basis that it imposes an additional charge on the Exchequer.  I question the validity of that decision because we are not asking for an immediate charge on the Exchequer in the current year.  Any charge on the Exchequer would apply in the future. Therefore, it is unacceptable that this amendment is being ruled out of order. It is the only mechanism available to us to persuade the Government to come off the fence and make a decision on the establishment of a college in Thurles.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the amendment has been ruled out of order when I see an advance business school in Carysfort College getting funding, particularly when there was such a waste of public funds.  I have no doubt it would be better that there be a charge on the Exchequer to establish a college in Thurles than to waste money on speculators and or on lining the pockets of individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case for a regional college in Thurles has been well documented and proven.  We have identified an niche in the educational market and that was to be encompassed in the concept of a rural and business development institute.  The Government parties, particularly Fianna <Col N="983" /> Fáil, for the past 14 years have been making promises in relation to a college in Thurles.  Every positive and constructive move that was made in regard to such a college was made by Fine Gael Ministers in the Coalition Government and every negative step &mdash; every time the college was put on the back burner &mdash; was by a Fianna Fáil Minister in Government.</P>
    <P>A regional college is badly needed in Thurles.  The town is geographically well placed and a college there would cater for a hinterland which is at present disadvantaged in terms of access to a third level college.  Thousands of young students from Tipperary and adjoining counties travel long distances to attend third level colleges, at enormous inconvenience, hardship and considerable expense to them and their families. Establishing a college in Thurles is of vital importance in filling that educational need and in catering for the additional places that are required.</P>
    <P>When there were industrial closures in Thurles the Government emphasised that a regional college would be provided there in the future.  That commitment was reiterated at the time of the closure of Thurles sugar factory.  We were told we would get something to replace that factory.  We were told that we had ministerial clout, a voice at the Cabinet table and that the Government would deliver. We did not get an industry or a college. As a result the unemployment level in Thurles is about average, there is massive emigration and we are faced with industrial stagnation.  The establishment of a college would be a major boost to the educational, economic, industrial, cultural and social life of the area, and the Minister for Education recognised that a long time ago.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister is genuine in his concern for the establishment of a college which would benefit not only Thurles but the county of Tipperary.  This project has received the unanimous support of all parties, educational and industrial interests in the area.  On a number of occasions I attended committee meetings <Col N="984" /> with the Minister at which the establishment of a college in Thurles was advocated. While I accept he is concerned about this matter he is now in a position to do something about it.  I hope that in response he will outline his commitment to the college, the role he sees for Thurles in the third level education sector in the future and, particularly, the time scale for the setting up of a college in the town. I am disappointed that the amendment has been ruled out of order because there were no real grounds for doing so.</P>

      <P>I too am surprised that the amendment has been ruled out of order because it simply refers to proposed colleges.  I am also disappointed that the proposers of the amendment did not include all the proposed colleges as read out by Deputy Kenny.  The college in Tallaght has been already accepted but there are four other proposed colleges &mdash; Castlebar, Thurles, Dún Laoghaire and Blanchardstown &mdash; and a good case can be made for all of them.  I agree that the best case can be made for a college in Castlebar.  There is a very active group there who lobbied Deputies last year, and previous years, and put forward an excellent case for a regional technical college in the town.  The case has now been made for colleges in Thurles and Dún Laoghaire but no case has been made for a college in Blanchardstown, a new town with 55,000 people.  A proposal for two second level schools for this area has also been turned down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A strong case can be made for these four regional technical colleges.  In each case there are different reasons why a regional technical college is essential. The strongest case can be made for Castlebar and that should receive priority.  Blanchardstown in my constituency, the most rapidly growing town in the country, is a very deprived area. Houses are being built there at a faster rate than in any other area in the country, and the need for a regional technical college is increasing daily.  I agree that an amendment of this kind is not necessary because there is provision in the Bill to include any colleges that come on-stream <Col N="985" /> in the future.  However, the Minister should take cognisance of the points made in the debate and make a strong case to the Minister for Finance that it is bad economics to cut back in this area of education.</P>
    <P>Regional technical colleges have proved very important economically for the areas where they are located and for the country as a whole in attracting industries and expanding existing concerns. This Bill is an indication of the role of regional technical colleges in the economy and in the cultural life and development of local areas.  The Minister should make a strong case to the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet for these regional colleges, particularly for the four mentioned.  I hope the Minister will take on board the points made and, even if he does not accept the amendment, he should keep them in mind in debates on Estimates and in the provision of funding. He should push for the establishment of these colleges.</P>

      <P>Section 2 defines a college and section 4 outlines the constituents of a college.  The Deputy has referred to the provision of colleges in Thurles, Castlebar, Dún Laoghaire and Blanchardstown and, as far as I am aware, no <Col N="986" /> other place was mentioned.  The content of the amendment is unnecessary because provision is made in section 3 (2) to bring future colleges within the scope of the Bill.  I respect what the Deputies are trying to do but the Bill makes provision to bring new colleges within its scope.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lowry asked about the time schedule for the proposed regional technical college in Thurles.  Deputies Mac Giolla, Gilmore and others asked about the capital allocation for the proposed colleges.  Capital resources, as Deputies are aware, have been very limited since 1987 and are fully committed up to 1993.  Let me say, particularly to Deputies Lowry and Ahearn, lest they should try to bring it out under another pretext, prior to my assuming office, capital moneys were committed up to 1993. The provision of extra student places is ongoing.  Since 1987 the number of third level places has increased from 56,000 to 75,000 and when the proposed college at Tallaght is completed there will be an additional 8,000 places provided.  We are very concerned about the increasing need for third level places up to the year 2000 and we will continue to make efforts to ensure that additional places are provided. The capital moneys for an expansion of third level facilities are committed up to 1993.  I cannot be any more helpful than that.</P>

      <P>We are now only twelve and a half months away from 1993.  Could the Minister give some indication whether it is still the Government's intentions to proceed with the proposed regional technical colleges and the order in which it is proposed to proceed?  We are not expecting miracles but we need to have some indication of the state of play.  Have the Government abandoned their proposals for all or some of these regional colleges?  Is it still the Government's intention to proceed with them, and if so in what order is it envisaged that the colleges will proceed?  I think we are entitled to know where we stand and have some idea of what the future will hold.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's point.  It would be a very bad policy if we did not plan for when money will become available.  In the context of the establishment of a new regional college it would not be considered an extraordinary length of time to have to wait until 1993 for the allocation of funds. While all capital is fully committed until 1993, now is the time to plan for post-1993. I hope the Minister has turned his attention to this in the short time he has been Minister for Education.  I, too, join with Deputy Gilmore in asking the Minister to give us some indication on the proposed regional colleges in Thurles, Castlebar, Dún Laoghaire and Blanchardstown and the order of their priority.  The local action committees are continuing to work with the same degree of determination and commitment, but in fairness they deserve some indication of the plans for the proposed college in their area.  Although capital is not being injected into these projects, a great deal of time and energy is being put into the project by the local action committees in order to prepare their case for the establishment of the college.  The Minister should tell us his plans for proposed regional colleges.</P>
      <P>In response to the amendment tabled by Deputy Higgins and myself regarding the associated vocational education committees, the Minister asked whether there were more than four associated vocational education committees in any one location.  Carlow comes to mind because, as far as I know, there are five associated colleges together with Carlow Regional Technical College, which makes six.  The reason we tabled the amendment was to ensure that associated vocational education committees would have a place on the governing body.  Let me pose the question: how will the representation from the associated vocational education committees of the Carlow Regional College be assured?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not reaffirmed the commitment to the establishment of a regional technical college in Thurles.  The fact that <Col N="988" /> all capital resources are committed up to 1993, serves to highlight the fact that even when we had two Ministers from North Tipperary sitting at Cabinet, they were not able to have Thurles included in the proposals for funding under the EC Social Fund.  That is the past but it highlights the neglect in their attempts to further the idea of a college for Thurles. What concerns me is the Government policy as outlined by the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke.  What, in effect, has happened is that the need for additional places was identified. However, additional places were made available by the expansion of the existing colleges.  Millions of pounds have been spent in expanding the facilities at the existing colleges but this in effect is undermining to a great extent the proposals put forward for additional places to be provided in the proposed new regional colleges in the four places mentioned, and particularly Thurles.  I can see the situation arising where, in a year or two, the Government will say that considerable resources have been spent in expanding the existing colleges and that the necessity for the new colleges no longer exists.  I have no doubt that was the strategy behind the Minister's proposals.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will reaffirm the commitment to the establishment of a regional technical college in Thurles and give us some indication of the priority of Thurles in relation to the four other centres.  Are there any interim proposals for providing third level courses in other colleges in Thurles, such as St. Patrick's College, or some other centres?  Finally, the schedule of courses to be provided in Thurles has been identified; a site has been purchased and all that needs to be done is to commence the physical planning of the college.  I believe this could commence immediately irrespective of whether the capital has been committed to 1993.  If something tangible happened, it would be a source of hope for the future establishment of the college.  I ask the Minister to be more specific on his commitment to the proposed college in Thurles.</P>

      <P>We can all appreciate the Minister's difficulties in the present tight financial situation.  However, my specific request does not require any financial expenditure whatsoever.  On the basis of their record and achievements and the number of degree courses which are on offer in Waterford Regional Technical College I am asking the Minister to upgrade their status from that of regional technical college to a university college. No expenditure whatsoever is involved. There is no cost to the Exchequer.  It just involves a recognition of their achievements.</P>

      <P>Before we move on to the next section could I again endeavour to extract from the Minister a clear statement that it is Government policy to proceed, when resources become available, with additional regional technical colleges in Thurles, Castlebar, Dún Laoghaire and Blanchardstown?  While appreciating the difficulty in relation to scarce resources, I ask the Minister to undertake &mdash; as a definite indication that it is part and parcel of government thinking &mdash; at least stage one of the commitment given by his predecessor and start third level courses in those areas?  I understand that there is adequate rental accommodation available in Thurles.  In Castlebar there are vacant, top-quality buildings that would be functional and could be used to provide third level courses.</P>
      <P>If there were to be a definite commitment that come next September-October at least an embryo of third level courses would start, that would do a lot to allay the anxieties that have been expressed by various Members about a lack of clarity in Government thinking and policy in this regard.</P>

In the context of that legislation I asked the Minister who the employer would be.  I asked on the basis that the employer is not defined in the Schedule. The Minister told me that the employer would be the college.  I ask the Minister how he reconciles his answer with section 2 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, which states:</P>
      <P>In this Act&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;employer&rdquo; in relation to an employee, means the person by whom the employee is employed under a contract of employment; for the purpose of the definition a person holding office under or in the service of the State or of the Government shall be deemed to be employed by the State or the Government (as the case may be) and an officer or servant of a local authority or of a harbour authority, health board or vocational education committee <Col N="993" /> shall be deemed to be employed by the local authority, harbour authority, health board or vocational education committee (as the case may be);</P>

The Deputy mentioned harbour authority, I am not aware of the position in that regard.  Staff will be officers of the college and only for limited purposes will they be staff of the vocational education committee.

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="994" /> In page 4, subsection (1), lines 19 to 22, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  Coláiste Ealaíne agus Deartha Crawford (the Crawford College of Art and Design) and Ceol-Scoil Chorcaí (the Cork School of Music) are hereby established as schools of the Regional Technical College, Cork, established by subsection (1) (a) and each of them shall continue to bear and to be known by, the name in the Irish language or in the English language by which it is referred to in this paragraph.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, as initiated, provision is made in section 3 (1) (b) for the amalgamation of the Hotel Training and Catering School in Killybegs with the Letterkenny Regional Technical College, the Crawford College of Art and Design and the courses of higher education in the Cork School of Music with the Cork Regional Technical College.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on Second Stage, strong views were expressed and good arguments advanced by Deputies Coughlan and McGinley as to why the Killybegs amalgamation should not go ahead.  This matter was raised with me also by way of private representations around the House by other Members.  At the time I indicated that I was impressed by the arguments advanced and would table an appropriate amendment.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed to me also that a mechanism should be found so that the Crawford College of Art and Design and the Cork School of Music, institutions of long standing, could retain their individual indentities.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to delete section 3 (1) (b) which, with the consequential amendment No. 179 to the First Schedule, ensures that the Killybegs amalgamation will not go ahead.  The paragraph proposed to be inserted by this amendment, together with amendment No. 177 to the First Schedule, provides that, while the two institutions in Cork will become schools of the Cork Regional Technical College, they will continue to be known by their present names.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> Amendment No. 173 in the heading to column (2) of the First Schedule is required since the Schedule does not now include any institution being amalgamated with a regional technical college on its establishment under this Bill. An entry under this column could arise in the future if an order is made under section 3 (3) amalgamating an institution with a regional technical college.</P>
    <P>There are also consequential amendments to section 12, for example, amendment No. 130 proposing to delete from section 12 (1) (a) the words &ldquo;or part of an institution&rdquo; in relation to the First Schedule.  Those words are no longer relevant since the amendment provides that the Cork School of Music, in full, and not only the higher education courses provided there, will become a school of the regional technical college.  Amendment No. 131 to section 12 (1) (a) provides that those employed in the two institutions in Cork, which are being established as schools of the regional technical college by this amendment, will become employees of the Cork Regional Technical College.</P>
    <P>The final consequential amendment, No. 136, to section 12 (1) (b) proposes the insertion of a new subsection (c) to provide that the persons who are heads of the two institutions in Cork will continue to be heads of the two schools of the Cork Regional Technical College being established by this amendment.  The rights of existing staff in relation to salary and conditions of service, of course, are protected under section 12 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea in his amendment No. 7 to section 3 (1) (a) and the associated amendment No. 175 to the First Schedule, seek to establish the three institutions I have mentioned as regional technical colleges by inserting them in column (1) of the First Schedule.  All three are far too small to be included in that area.  Therefore, I consider Deputy O'Shea's amendment to be inappropriate and cannot accept it.  In addition, The Workers' Party amendments seek to do the same with the Crawford College of Art and Design but are flawed since <Col N="996" /> amendment No. 7 seeks to delete section 3 (1) (b) but yet makes no provision for the two other institutions, that is, Killybegs and the Cork School of Music. I might add that Deputy Gilmore, in amendment No. 8, effectively is seeking the establishment of the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design as an Regional Technical College.  I cannot accept his amendment either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer specifically to amendment No. 8 in my name.  I was surprised and disappointed when I saw the Bill published in that there was no reference in it to the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design.  The Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design is now located in Carriglea House in Dún Laoghaire, which was the site for the proposed regional technical college in Dún Laoghaire.  It is a college that has 250 full-time students specialising particularly in the design and communications areas and has achieved much commendation and awards, particularly in the arena of film and animation.  Indeed, films produced by students of the college feature regularly on RTE, BBC, Channel 4 and many other television stations and are of a very high quality.  The college is located strategically in terms of the film and communications industry, being close to RTE, to Ardmore studios, linked into the developing industry of animation which has been improving for some time past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very high demand for places in the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design, with approximately ten applicants for every place.  There is scope for the expansion of that college into the existing Carriglea House building which has been left virtually derelict for ten years by the Department of Education since the building and the grounds were bought in 1980 for the proposed regional technical college.  I have seen evidence of the building having been subjected to vandalism, for example, evidence of an attempt to set it on fire.  It is a fine building which, with the limited resources available to the Minister, could be put to very good use because the College of Art <Col N="997" /> and Design have already indicated their anxiety to develop into that building contending that, if they were given access to it, they could expand.  I know they and the vocational education committee have put proposals to the Minister to the effect that given access, they could expand to accommodate 50 full-time students catering for a very high demand in this area of art and design, particularly in the communications arena.</P>
    <P>I know there were discussions with the Minister's predecessor about the inclusion of the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design in section 3 (2) of this Bill.  My concern is that the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design will not be forgotten.  The purpose in tabling my amendment was to seek to have the College of Art and Design, at this stage, listed properly as a third level college.  I am disappointed at the flat rejection of that by the Minister.  I hoped he would have offered some prospect of a future commitment, at the very least, in relation to the College of Art and Design.  I am disappointed, he has given what appears to me to be a firm, flat refusal that the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design is not to be included.  I await his response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to remove the Hotel Training and Catering School in Killybegs from Column (2) of the First Schedule.  I acknowledge that he has listened carefully to the views of people in the area in that regard.  Nonetheless, I regret that the views of the Cork School of Art and Design and the Cork School of Music have not been listened to and regarded as important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question the wording of the Minister's amendment in that he seeks to establish the Crawford College of Art and Design and the courses of higher education provided in the Cork School of Music as schools of the Cork Regional Technical College.  I believe they should remain separate entities in that the ethos of the colleges is different, the first being artistic whereas the regional technical college is technical.  In addition the staff, students <Col N="998" /> and the TUI are fearful that these small colleges will not be adequately represented on the governing body which could be to their disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider his terminology establishing those colleges as schools of the Cork Regional Technical College because, I suggest, in so doing, one is diminishing their status. For example, could they not be described as constituent colleges of the Cork Regional Technical College?  It must be noted that the Minister is relabelling the Crawford College of Art and Design as a school of the Cork Regional Technical College.  We are talking here about third level education, about third level institutions that deserve to be termed colleges.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about regarding those establishments as schools.  They should remain separate entities, but the Minister has not conceded that point. I ask him to reconsider the word &ldquo;school&rdquo;.  It lowers the status of the colleges concerned and the students, the staff and the unions will not be satisfied with this terminology.  It would be regrettable if we used this Bill to reduce the status of some colleges.  On the one hand we are giving the regional colleges greater status as third level institutes of education, but on the other hand we are reducing the status of the Crawford College of Art and Design and the Cork School of Music.  I would regret any dissatisfaction caused by such a minor error in the wording of the amendment.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with a number of amendments here.  The purpose of amendment No. 177 in my name and that of the Minister for Education and Deputy O'Shea is to delete the entry at column (2).  I have an amendment providing that the Crawford College of Art and Design be put in column (1).  If my amendment were not accepted, I would be happy if references to both the Crawford College and the Cork College of Music.  were deleted from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should drop amendment No. 6 and accept amendment No. 177. Amendment No. 6 means absolutely <Col N="999" /> nothing.  There is no such thing as a school of a regional technical college. It simply gives them a name but they are in effect amalgamated with the regional technical college.  The Minister is trying to give the impression that he is conceding to the pressure for independence.  I suggest leaving them as they are and dropping references to them in the Bill, unless the Minister is prepared to include them as separate colleges.  What exactly does the Minister mean by establishing them as schools of the regional technical college in Cork?</P>
    <P>Why has Killybegs been treated differently? There are many questions which require to be answered.  What demands is the Minister responding to?  Has he spoken to people in the Crawford College or the College of Music?  What is their response to their being established as schools of the regional technical college? My impression is that they do not like it.  Let us leave it as it is and drop amendment No. 6 completely.  It will not do any good.  He should agree to drop from column (2) the Crawford College of Art and the Cork School of Music.  I do not know what the Minister means by making them schools of the regional technical college.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 7 proposes the deletion of column (2) in the First Schedule.  It opposes the amalgamation of these colleges.  This is another example of over-centralisation. We need far more independent schools, technical colleges and so on.  The Minister in amendment No. 6 is endeavouring in a kind of way to deal with two of the three colleges mentioned, the Crawford College of Art and Design and the Cork School of Music.  He proposes to set them up as a kind of hybrid.  The Minister's amendment refers to them as schools of the Cork Regional Technical College. That is just a veneer.  They will have a name but no status and no independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as there is just a little gesture towards these colleges, I note that in the case of the Hotel Training and Catering School in Killybegs even that minimal <Col N="1000" /> gesture has been omitted.  Under the Bill as it stands, that training college will disappear as a separate entity, very much to the detriment of County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I commend amendment No. 7 to the House.  If it is not accepted I will with great reluctance, have to accept the Minister's amendment No. 6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned earlier that I am not sure what exactly a school means. This is a new concept to deal with a legitimate problem which has arisen in Cork.  Unlike Deputy Mac Giolla, I am not aware of the response of the people in Cork to amendment No. 6, but I urge the Minister to deal with the matter with much greater clarity, bearing in mind that legislation catering for exceptional circumstances makes bad law.</P>
      <P>This amendment is being made to the Bill, not to the Schedule.  Would it not be better to deal with this problem in another Schedule rather than by bringing in this amendment, which gives the impression of something that was cobbled together?  He is leaving column (2) in the First Schedule, which allows for the listing of institutions which can be amalgamated into regional technical college's.  If this provision is made for one college in particular circumstances, the provision should be there for any other college which might be in a similar position in the future.  In Waterford there is Kildalton College, a third level college under the control of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  It could happen at a future date that the college would want to become involved with Waterford Regional Technical College and, like the Crawford College of Art and Design and the Cork School of Music, would wish to retain their individuality and independent identity.  I ask for a clear definition of what exactly a school is.</P>

      <P>I support the basic thrust of the amendments put down by the Opposition parties.  I concur, in particular, with the observations made in relation to the Minister's amendment which deals with the Cork College of Art and Design, Crawford College.  As <Col N="1001" /> Deputy McGiolla said, the amendment is little more than window-dressing in terms of playing around with terminology. Instead of engaging in an exercise in semantics, I ask the Minister to withdraw his amendment.</P>
      <P>Essentially what we are doing here is setting up first and second division colleges. As my colleague, Deputy Ahearn, said, the term &ldquo;school of the regional technical college, Cork&rdquo;, will further denigrate the status of one the oldest colleges in the country.  I want to point out to the Minister that long before the regional technical colleges were established, Crawford College was in existence, was developing and had established itself as a third level institution, albeit under the management of the vocational education committee.  It has carved out a niche for itself in the education area and it is essentially a third level college.  The minimum which should happen in terms of designation is that it should be described as a constituent college of the regional technical college, if not as an autonomous body.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment which deals with the status of the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design.  This college has evolved to the level where it is essentially a third level college.  It is doing excellent work and should be recognised in its own right as a third level college in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  I do not have any great problem with the other amendments and I ask the Minister to be receptive to them. The spirit and intention behind the amendments are positive and there is no reason the Minister, in his inaugural Committee Stage presentation to the House, should not be receptive to the points made by Opposition speakers.</P>

      <P>I wish first to refer to the points made by Deputy Gilmore in regard to the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design.  I did not rule out the possibility of giving third level status to this college in the future.  I simply said this could not be done under this Bill which seeks to give autonomy to the regional technical colleges so that they <Col N="1002" /> can improve their position.  The question of giving third level status to this college could perhaps, be considered in the context of another Bill.  For example, it could become a constituent college under the Dublin Institute of Technology.  This Bill deals with the regional colleges and seeks to clear up the anomaly in this area.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied from representations I have received that the people of the area are happy with the decision not to amalgamate the Hotel Training and Catering School in Killybegs with Letterkenny Regional Technical College.  There were logistic and distance reasons for this.  The college is carving out a niche for itself in education and is happy that the proposed amalgamation will not go ahead.  There may be other difficulties involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate the arguments put forward by the Deputies opposite in regard to the Cork School of Music and Crawford College.  We discussed the title &ldquo;school&rdquo; with the relevant people in Cork, including a member of Deputy O'Shea's party, and they are happy with it for an interim period: when they decide on a different title it can be changed.  The Cork School of Music has a high standing throughout the country. The words &ldquo;school&rdquo; and &ldquo;institution&rdquo; are regularly used.</P>
      <P>I put my amendments to the people who are directly involved with these institutions and they are happy with them in the knowledge that their titles can be changed at a later stage.  Too much emphasis is being put on the word &ldquo;school&rdquo;.  I am prepared to change it if the institutions involved want to.  It has been implied that these institutions should not be part of Cork Regional Technical College. We cannot have a separate set-up for institutions which have only 200 students.  This has to be done on a practical basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to stick with the proposal in my amendment.  We all agree that the amalgamation of the Hotel Training and Catering School in Killybegs with the <Col N="1003" /> Letterkenny Regional Technical College should not be ahead.  The amalgamation of the Crawford College of Art and Design and the course of higher education in the Cork School of Music with the Cork Regional Technical College is being done for the best reasons.  If the word &ldquo;school&rdquo; suggests any diminution in their standing or status within the regional technical colleges structure, I will examine this matter on Report Stage. I have already pointed out to the people concerned that this title can be changed. It is not my intention to demean them in any way; rather I am seeking to give them status within the regional technical colleges structure while at the same time ensuring that they keep their own individuality.</P>

      <P>I suspect that much of the debate on these amendments will centre on the proposals dealing with the institutions in Cork and Killybegs.  I do not wish to go into this except to say I support the points made by Members of this side of the House on the amalgamation of the colleges in Cork with Cork Regional Technical College and the decision not to proceed with the amalgamation of the Hotel Training and Catering School in Killybegs with Letterkenny Regional Technical College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to concentrate for a moment on the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design.  This college, which has had a long and difficult history, has evolved into a third level college.  It effectively operated for many years as a third level college but without the Department's expressed recognition as a third level college. For many years, the teachers in this college provided third level courses of an extremely high quality while they were paid second level salaries and without recognition as a third level college.  This college has survived as a third level college because of the extraordinary commitment of its staff and the support it received over the years from the Dún Laoghaire Vocational Education Committee and the local community.  This first class third level college is about to take <Col N="1004" /> off in an area of educational endeavour which will expand in the future, that is, films and communications, and this college can be the flagship of that expansion.</P>
    <P>Because of the denial of third level status to this college and the denial of the appropriate salaries which go with third level status for the teachers in the college, there is concern that there is no reference in this Bill to the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design.  I have been informed by the staff representatives in the college that at a meeting with the Minister's predecessor the Teachers' Union of Ireland obtained a commitment that the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design would be added to the First Schedule under section 3 (2) which provides that:</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister considers that this Act should apply to any other educational institution, the Minister may, by order, made with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and following consultation with the vocational education committee, amend the said First Schedule by inserting in column (1) thereof the name of the institution and any other particulars relevant to the Schedule ...</P>
    <P>My understanding is that a commitment as given by the Minister's predecessor to the Teachers' Union of Ireland that the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design would be added to the First Schedule under the provisions of section 3 (2) within 12 months.  I am surprised the Minister did not make reference to that in the course of his contribution.  Had he done so I might have been disposed towards withdrawing the amendment and settling for a firm commitment on the record that the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design would be added in the way that was originally intended.  The suggestion that it might become a constituent college of the Dublin Institute of Technology is new and one that raises a number of other issues.  We are talking about two different vocational education committees: for example, Dublin Institute of Technology comes under the City of Dublin vocational education committee and Dún Laoghaire College of Art <Col N="1005" /> and Design is under the Dún Laoghaire Borough vocational education committee. That suggestion, what ever merit may be in it, is raising a number of other issues which may have to be teased out. Will the Minister address himself to the commitment I was given?  If he can do so in a way that gives some satisfaction it will determine my attitude to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I support amendment No. 8.  We are talking about a college which in essence is a third level college but there appears to be a reluctance to give that recognition.  That is regrettable. Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design has an excellent reputation due to the quality of the courses but, more important, the quality of the graduates. By excluding it entirely from the Bill we are retaining it as a second level institute of education.  There is no reason this amendment cannot be accepted in view of the arguments put forward by Deputy Gilmore and the reputation of that college. It is extraordinary that it did not merit getting into column (2) of the First Schedule.  The Minister for Education would be doing a good day's work in accepting this amendment.</P>
      <P>I regret that at different times this morning we were told that something can be done tomorrow or at a different time. Now is the time to deal with these issues. If we do not they will not be dealt with. While we are debating the Bill is the best time to deal with the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design.  I agree with Deputy Gilmore that it is a third level education college in totality.  We must do it a service by giving it the recognition it deserves and has earned.  I am opposed to deferring any decision on this matter. We have waited long enough to get this Bill on the floor of the House and now is the time to deal with every college that relates to it.  If the Minister says it can be done tomorrow or at some time in the future I appeal to him to do it now.  This amendment should be accepted on those grounds and Fine Gael support it.</P>

      <P>I understand the principal <Col N="1006" /> that the Crawford College of Art and Design in Cork has a difficulty with the use of the term &ldquo;school&rdquo;.  I put it to the Minister that the Dublin Institute of Technology model be used so that we would be talking about an institute and colleges rather than the regional college and schools.  In its own context the word &ldquo;school&rdquo; does not present a problem.  It can be defined as part of a university or part of a regional college.  This amendment deals with a specific problem and appears to have been cobbled together without taking an overview of what this model could produce in another context. The School of Music at Waterford Regional Technical College was a separate entity but became absorbed in the college long before this Bill was heard of. Another argument is that at present in Waterford Regional Technical College 46 per cent of the students are pursuing degree courses but if this trend continues and the number of degree courses increases &mdash; the Minister and everybody else in the region would like to see a greater degree provision in the south east &mdash; it could well be at the expense of the basic services provided by the college: in other words, diplomas, certificates and other education awards.</P>
      <P>Should provision be inserted in the Bill to enable a regional college to divide into schools at a particular stage, or if a school could be formed or if the degree courses were advancing rapidly?  Such a school could be taken out of the main stream and left separate and at the same time the main college could provide the full range of certificates and diplomas as required.</P>
      <P>The amendment has not taken into account the overall context.  I take my direction in regard to the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design from Deputy Gilmore who knows the areas.  If the Minister gives an undertaking to put the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design into column (2) of the First Schedule &mdash; and Deputy Gilmore considers that that covers the situation in his constituency &mdash; I will be happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties I see arising unless the school concept is put solidly in context <Col N="1007" /> are immense.  This amendment came late.  I take the Minister's point that the people from Cork were happy with it.  I do not want to be obstructive of that position but we are dealing with legislation. For example, the Minister said the school could be changed at a later stage. The name of a school can be changed but should the amendment be accepted established schools of the regional college would remain.  That concept would be framed in legislation albeit for a single instance but it could be only changed by amendment.</P>

To the best of my knowledge the commitment referred to by Deputy Gilmore was not given by my predecessor.  I am not aware of it.  The Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design could be brought under the provisions of section 3 (2) but other than that I cannot do anything at present.  I will have to look up the record.  In regard to Cork I should like to say that the people I met were reasonably happy.  The name may be changed later.  I appreciate the <Col N="1008" /> point raised by Deputy O'Shea about leaving it open in the Bill.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I met the President of University College Dublin on 12 December 1990.  I was accompanied by the then Minister for Education and the president was accompanied by Mr. Laurence Crowley, chairman of the UCD Graduate Business School.</P>
      <P>That meeting took place against the background of concern over a considerable period by the Government, the third level institutions and the social partners under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> about the need to provide more places at third level to meet the unsatisfied demand each year for entry to third level.  For example, the presidents of the universities, at their request, met with me and the then Minister for Education in September, 1989, to express their concern and ability to provide extra places if additional Government funding could be provided and if the universities could retain the extra fee income without prejudice to their HEA grants.  As a result of that meeting, 3,600 extra places are being provided over three years and the Government have approved capital grants of £15 million and annual grants of £3 million.  Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provision is made for 8,800 extra third level places, including the 3,600 I have mentioned and over 600 extra places to be provided at Belfield as a result of the location of the graduate business school in Carysfort.</P>
      <P>The meeting on 12 December, 1990, therefore, discussed these extra 600 places and also discussed the importance of the proposed school of business management for the development of improved management education in Ireland which is relatively underdeveloped by comparison with larger economies.  It is a common criticism of Irish business development that we are lacking in modern management training and education.</P>
      <P>The meeting also took place against the background of the fact that the Government, in July 1988, had asked the then Minister for Education to seek to find a third level use for Carysfort College with particular reference to UCD.  The then Minister has already in her speech to this House on 18 October 1991 given a full account of her efforts in that regard culminating in the decision, in principle, by the Government on 4 December 1990 to grant aid UCD to use Carysfort College as the location of its school of business management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the meeting on 12 December 1990, therefore, an issue was the amount of grant required by UCD to enable it to <Col N="1011" /> acquire, adapt and equip Carysfort College in the light of the Government decision already taken on 4 December 1990.  It was established that the grant needed by UCD to supplement its funding of £2 million was £9.7 million of which £6 million was towards the cost of acquisition. This grant of £9.7 million was sanctioned by the Minister for Finance on 18 December 1990.  He also sanctioned the introduction of the necessary supplementary Estimate which was, in fact, passed by the Dáil on that day.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputies do not want the information, that is all right with me.  The position was that this organisation, the business graduate school, was in the fund raising business.  They were setting out to raise considerable funds from the private sector to enable them to establish the sort of business management school they wish to have.  I fully supported Laurence Crowley in his efforts to do that.  I discussed it with him and gave him support and offered full support to him in his endeavours in that regard.  I had nothing whatsoever to do <Col N="1014" /> with the transaction of the purchase of Carysfort.  That was a matter which was handled by Laurence Crowley, the business management school and the UCD authorities.</P>

Does the Taoiseach not realise that he and the Minister totally usurped the role of the Higher Education Authority, that he failed to disclose to Cabinet that there was an independent valuation done by the State Valuation Office of £3.8 million that, effectively, he handed a profit of £1.5 million to a friend of his, Mr. Pino Harris, and does he not furthermore realise that in doing so he flouted the advice of the Department of Finance?</P>

I involve myself in countless numbers of projects which I think are desirable and which I think need my assistance as Taoiseach to get them advanced as quickly as possible through the normal Government process.  I was fully supportive of the Carysfort proposal. I backed it in every way.

      <P>With regard to the <Col N="1015" /> Higher Education Authority, both the former and the present Minister for Education have explained fully the situation in that regard, but I can recall for the Deputy, if he is interested, that in 1973 when a Fine Gael Minister for Education made announcements about developments in third level education in this country and was taken to task by the then Chairman of the Higher Education Authority, that Government sought and received adice from the Attorney General and were told that it was none of the business of the Chairman of the Higher Education Authority to dictate to the Minister for Education what he or she might do.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for the Government to provide additional third level education places.  The second was the decision of the Government that some educational use should be found for Carysfort, preferably in a UCD context.  The third was the fact that I have known the President of UCD for many years.  I meet him three, four or five times every year. Since he has taken over as President of UCD, he has maintained constant contact with me.  He is a dynamic, active President of UCD.  He has far reaching, enlightened plans for the development of a centre of excellence in UCD.  He has kept me fully informed of those plans and meets me from time to time to tell me about them and seek my support for them.  It was against that background and those factors that I have mentioned that <Col N="1016" /> I met Deputy O'Rourke as Minister for Education, President Masterson and Laurence Crowley at a final meeting to make sure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Then we decided what the State's contribution would be and how it would be provided.  It was a perfectly legitimate exercise of Government authority to promote a well worthwhile project which will provide extra third level education places, which will be responsible for providing us with an excellent business management school.  In any other parliament in the world, the Government involved would be commended for such efforts.</P>

      <P>In my reply to this House I spoke about the transaction and I said I was not involved in the transaction, nor was I involved in any way in the transaction.  I knew nothing about the details of it but I fully supported the project because it was a good project and it was completely in harmony with the Government decision to provide extra third level places in education.  It was completely in accordance with that.  It was an ideal use for Carysfort.

      <P>The Taoiseach now seems to be drawing a distinction between what he now calls &ldquo;the transaction&rdquo; and the process which led to the Government decision to purchase Carysfort. May I ask him, first, when did the Government change their mind about buying Carysfort given that for 18 months prior to that the Government had quite clearly indicated that they did not wish to buy Carysfort?  Second, may I ask him if the idea to buy Carysfort came from him and if he suggested to the then Minister for Education that she should contact UCD about the purchase of Carysfort? May I further ask him, since we have now established that there were meetings with the president of UCD and the chairman of the graduate business school, if he had any meetings, contact or discussions with the owners of Carysfort or with the estate agents acting on their behalf prior to the Minister for Education contacting UCD?</P>

May I ask him, in that context, when he addressed this matter on 16 October, why he did not tell the House about his meetings with Mr. Crowley on 11 October and 3 December 1990?  May I further ask the Taoiseach, in view of his obvious intimate knowledge of this project, why he did not insist that the Valuation Office valuation of the site be communicated to the full Cabinet, to both parties, at the time the Cabinet approved the Supplementary Estimate? In view of the fact that the Taoiseach agreed;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the last question. In view of the fact that the Taoiseach <Col N="1024" /> agreed, in respect of similar questions in regard to Greencore, that he would be willing to give evidence on oath before any tribunal on that matter, would he agree to give evidence on oath before the Committee of Public Accounts on this matter on his involvement in it?</P>

There is no need to do so.  I am quite prepared to give the House the fullest information at my disposal about every aspect of this transaction because they all stand up fully to public scrutiny.

      <P>&mdash;the reference to the Carysfort transaction came in the middle of a longer speech which covered a whole variety of matters.  There was no particular need or purpose to mention any particular meetings in that connection.  I simply made the statement that it was an upfront, straightforward transaction in which I was not involved and that I adhere to now.  There was nothing secret about any of my meetings in this matter. The meetings with Laurence Crowley and the meetings with president Masterson were in my office, going through my usual secretarial procedures, known to everybody in my office and known to lots of other people as well.  It is an absolute negation of truth to add these sort of words about secret meetings; there was nothing secret about them. They were open meetings with people I knew and trusted and with whom I was working very closely to bring a very important educational project to fruition.</P>

Níl aon phost sa Bhrocaigh, mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit, Ní shílim gur cuireadh aon phoist ar bun ansin le blianta anuas.  An bhféadfadh an tAire Stáit a rá an bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Údarás réamh-mhonarcha a chur ar bun ansin agus poist a chruthú an bhliain seo chugainn, mar is soiléir nach bhfuil sé chun é a dhéanamh i mbliana.</P>

      <P>Caithfidh muid bheith praiticiúil faoi seo.  Ní dóigh liom gur féidir monarcha a thógáil idir seo agus deireadh na bliana.  Ach tá monarcha ansin &mdash; b'fhéidir nach réamh-mhonarcha é &mdash; agus tá Údarás na Gaeltachta ag déanamh a ndíchill chun tionsclóirí a mheal-ladh go dtí an mhonarcha sin.  Níl mise sásta, os rud é go bhfuil an mhonarcha sin ina suí folamh le blianta beaga anuas, agus tá gach iarracht á déanamh acu. Mar a dúirt mé, tá cainteanna ag dul ar aghaidh i láthair na huaire maidir le tograí don cheantar sin.  Tá thart faoi 47 ag obair sa cheantar sin le comhlachtaí a fuair cuidiú ó Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>

    <P>Ní féidir a rá go bhfuil an ceantar féin iargúlta, agus níl mé a rá go ndúirt an Teachta é sin.  Cuireann sé iontas orm féin, nuair a fheicim ar thíreolas an chontae sin, go bhfuil sé níos cóngaraí do Bhaile Átha Cliath, níos cóngaraí don Tuaisceart, do Latharna.  Is é an deacracht, b'fhéidir, gurb é an t-infrastruchtúr ginearálta a chuireann isteach air.  Mar sin féin, tá daoine sásta dul níos faide siar sa chontae le jabanna a <Col N="1036" /> chruthú.  Admháim go bhfuil fadhbanna ann.  Tá fadhb na himirce agus fadhb na dífhostaíochta ann.  Tá monarcha ansin agus caithfear í a líonadh ar dtús, ach tá an tUdarás ag breathnú ar an taobh eile den Ghaeltacht Lár, ceantar an Bhrocaigh maidir le suíomh agus le réamh-mhonarcha.</P>

Níl sé sin déanta san am atá thart ach tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire Stáit ábalta a insint dúinn anseo inniu go ndéanfaidh sé é san am atá romhainn. Tá géarchéim eacnamaíochta ansin mar go bhfuil na daoine ag brath ar an fheirmeoireacht agus tá deacrachtaí móra ag baint leis an fheirmeoireacht anois.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 34 and 54 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland acknowledges the legitimate aspirations of Slovenia and Croatia to independence.  It subscribes to the policy of the Twelve members of the Community that the independence of those republics in Yugoslavia wishing it should be envisaged in the framework of an overall settlement to the Yugoslav crisis that includes adequate guarantees for the protection of the human rights of national or ethnic groups.  The efforts of the European Community and of the UN to bring about a negotiated settlement are continuing. These efforts and the prospects for the peace process will be reviewed <Col N="1038" /> by Foreign Ministers of the Twelve at a meeting next week at which the Twelve's policy on recognition is likely to arise. In this connection I believe it will be important to maintain the close cohesion that has characterised the Twelve's approach to the Yugoslav crisis to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister, like myself and most people in the country, is appalled at the awful attacks in Croatia, with Croatian towns and villages being pulverised by the federal forces there.  Would he not agree that we as a small nation should have a special feeling for the Croats and that, even if we want to go along with the EC line, we should join those at the EC Council such as the Germans and Italians who are pushing for recognition of Croatia and Slovenia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I too, like every Member of this House, have very great concern for the level of violence in Yugoslavia.  The matter will be discussed by the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve at their meeting on Monday.  Since the beginning of the crisis our aim, in conjunction with our partners in the Community, has been to assist in bringing about a comprehensive settlement of the Yugoslav crisis which will be acceptable to all.  This is the prime consideration which should guide our approach through all aspects of the crisis, including that of recognition and independence of Slovenia and Croatia.  In the present circumstances deferral of recognition would be more conducive to the search for a peaceful and durable solution and to the ability of the Twelve to contribute to its achievement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>While I would like to see an EC solution leading to recognition of Croatia and Slovenia, will the Minister tell the House what we as a country will do in the event that the Germans, Italians and some of the other member states independently recognise Slovenia and Croatia?  Will Ireland row in with that or will we hang back?</P>

      <Quest>whether, he sought a repudiation of the statement reportedly made last week at a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Parliamentary Body by the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, claiming to speak for the Northern Ireland Office, that commitments in the communique issued with the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 to the early implementation of the agreement, specifically in this instance the early implementation of Article 7c of the agreement through the application of the principle of accompaniment, save in the most exceptional circumstances, of the armed forces in Northern Ireland by the RUC on occasions when they are likely to come in contact with the community, are not under the agreement binding international obligations.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority <Col N="1040" /> Question No. 6 and Question No. 43 together.</P>
      <P>Both Governments are fully committed to the principle, enunciated in the Hillsborough communique, that the armed forces &mdash; which include the Ulster Defence Regiment &mdash; operate only in support of the civil power in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government attach very great importance to the application of this principle with the particular objective, as set out in the Hillsborough communique, &ldquo;of ensuring as rapidly as possible that save in the most exceptional circumstances there is a police presence in all operations which involve direct contact with the community&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The British Government have reaffirmed their commitment to the principle of police accompaniment of army and UDR operations which involve direct contact with the community.  They have pointed, moreover, to progress which has been achieved in increasing actual levels of accompaniment in certain areas.  However, they have indicated also that a number of practical, logistical or resource constraints made it impossible to guarantee a continuous police accompaniment in all areas.  As I stated to the House as recently as 7 November, I have made clear to the Secretary of State that I do not regard the current position as satisfactory.  The Irish Government hold firmly to the objective of ensuring that the principle of accompaniment is seen to be implemented fully in line with the commitments which have been made at the highest level in the Hillsborough communique, and on many other occasions subsequently, and I shall be pursuing this issue at future meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the statement referred to by Deputy Bruton was made at a private meeting of the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary Body which took place on 3 December and that it was strongly contest by others present, including both Irish and British parliamentarians. Remarks by members of the body meeting in private sessions are a matter for <Col N="1041" /> themselves.  No report on this or any other private meeting has been communicated by the body to the Government, and it would not be appropriate for the Government to seek to intervene in the affairs of the body.</P>

      <P>I accept that the meeting of the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary Body &mdash; at which I was present &mdash; was in private session so I am referring only to the newspaper reports rather than to what occurred.  Would the Minister confirm that contrary to what Mr. Ken Hind, MP, the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Secretary of State, Mr. Peter Brooke, is reported as having said there is a binding international obligation between Ireland and the United Kingdom in relation to the principle of accompaniment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the newspaper report referred to in the Deputy's question. The account of the incident in that report is corroborated by other sources, including in particular a report by the UN Secretary-General to the Security Council. The incident occurred during an incursion by the Israeli sponsored <i>de facto</i> forces and by the Israeli defence forces itself into the UNIFIL area at the village of Majdal Silm on the night of 19-20 November last.  A local family, the Yassins, were forcibly removed from their home and the male members separated from the females and taken away. During the course of the abduction, ten-year old Amal Yassin attempted to follow her father and was shot 20 times.  When the female family members attempted to return to their home, it exploded as they approached, inflicting severe injuries on several of them, including injuries to their other children.</P>
      <P>I strongly condemn this outrage committed against innocent Lebanese women and children, as well as the kidnapping of civilians from their homes.  Actions of this nature, by whomsoever committed in Lebanon, can only add to the suffering endured by the Lebanese people and serve to undermine the current peace process which holds out the genuine prospect of a political settlement in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in Lebanon, including that in the South, is kept under regular review in the framework of European Political Co-operation.  Foreign Ministers of the Twelve will continue to assess the <Col N="1043" /> situation there, especially in the context of the current peace process and will convey their views as appropriate to the Israeli Government.  The Israeli authorities can be in no doubt as to the position of Ireland and the Twelve in regard to Lebanon and to the wider issues of the need to respect and uphold human rights.</P>

Will he confirm that he has conveyed the views of the Irish Government to the Israeli ambassador, who is in town at present?  Indeed, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I conveyed our views to him this very day.  Will the Minister confirm also that he will raise issues such as this at EC level?</P>

      <P>As I said in my reply, there is continuous monitoring of the situation in the Middle East in the framework of European Political Co-operation, and by the Foreign Ministers involved.  Our position in regard to the situation generally is clearly outlined on behalf of the EC by the president of the Council of Foreign Ministers, Mr. Van Den Broek, at the opening of the peace conference in Madrid recently.  I am aware that tomorrow I will have an opportunity of personally conveying on behalf of the Government our total condemnation of outrages such as this.</P>

      <P>My Department have no direct responsibility for recruitment to international organisations each of which operate independently.  However, it is <Col N="1044" /> Government policy to actively encourage and assist suitabily qualified Irish applicants for posts in international bodies. Primary responsibility for implementation of this policy lies with the Department of Finance and the position in relation to maintaining and, where possible, increasing Ireland's representation is closely monitored by that Department in consultation with my own Department and the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Because each international organisation operates an independent recruitment policy and because applicants pursue a number of different channels in applying for posts that become vacant, my Department are not in a position to say how many Irish candidates have gained employment with international bodies in the past five years, nor is it possible to accurately forecast how many such posts will be filled by Irish applicants in the next five years.  I am, however, in a position to indicate, based on the best information available to my Department at present, the current number of Irish personnel employed in various international organisations.  This information is contained in the table which I will circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made by the international recruitment section of the Department of Finance, in consultation with my Department, to give as wide a circulation as possible of all advertised vacancies in international bodies and to assist and encourage suitably qualified Irish candidates to apply.  In addition, the Overseas Development Co-operation Division of my Department circulate a monthly abstract of technical vacancies in international bodies.  Copies of this abstract are available to interested inquirers on request from the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank the Minister for the information.  Is the Minister in a position to say how many officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs in the period to which my question refers sought such vacancies and those who were successful?  Will the Minister agree that it is a requirement of all the bodies within the United Nations and other agencies referred to in my question that such vacancies be advertised publicly? Will he interpret for me what is meant by the phrases, &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo; and &ldquo;as wide a circulation as possible&rdquo;?  For example, does the definition &ldquo;as wide a circulation as possible&rdquo; include the placing of public advertisements in newspapers, as occurs in other countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that all vacant posts in the Community are advertised in the official journal of the European Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position in relation to the United Nations and other related international bodies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of vacant technical posts in the United Nations are notified to my Department and to the Department of Finance.  They are circulated by both Departments.  The Department of Finance give them the same circulation as EC vacancies, while my Department circulate each month a document called <i>The Abstract of Technical Assistance,</i> which contains all vacancies notified to them by the United Nations agencies.  That document is sent to between 250 and 500 Irish people who have indicated their interest in such jobs.</P>
      <P>As I said we are notified of the majority of posts.  While that is so, I understand that the organisations involved would, of course, fill a number of posts locally or from within present staff.  I hope the position is satisfactory and if I have any reason to believe it is not I shall be glad to examine the matter to find out whether the list should be expanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to tidy this matter up.  I am glad to receive the information from the Minister.  What takes place in other countries is that the interpretation of &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo; and &ldquo;as wide a circulation as possible&rdquo; include making it possible for all suitably qualified members of their citizenry &mdash; graduates and others &mdash; to apply for such posts as for any other post through advertisement in the public press.  Will the Minister agree that Ireland is out of step in its practice and that in view of the number of very highly qualified, highly motivated and idealistic people who would apply for such jobs, it would be better to advertise publicly rather than to use a somewhat private and, as many would view it, somewhat unaccountable list?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am not saying I would not be prepared to consider the system and determine whether it can be improved, I would not want any Member to believe that the list is private.  The list <Col N="1047" /> should not be private, I would not want it to be private nor would I have it private.</P>
      <P>As I understand the position, any person who expresses an interest in vacancies of that kind is put on a list and when the Department have information in relation to such matters it is circulated to those people.</P>
      <P>I shall discuss the matter and determine whether the system should be expanded.  If I believe the system should be expanded it will be.  Like Deputy Higgins, I would not want any person to think there is an exclusive list and that one has to be on it or has to have special qualifications to get on the list.  I would not have that.</P>

      <Quest>the specific steps the Government intend to take to honour the commitment given in the review of the Programme for Government that they would work to find a general acceptable basis to relaunch the process of dialogue in Northern Ireland which ended last July; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take priority Questions Nos. 9 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>As the Government have repeatedly made clear, we will spare no effort to ensure that political dialogue resumes at the earliest possible date.  We do not believe that the forthcoming British election should be an obstacle in the way of talks.  Intensive efforts are continuing with the aim of restarting dialogue.  At the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference on 20 November the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I had a further in-depth discussion on how progress might best be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will, of course, be aware that <Col N="1048" /> the Taoiseach met the British Prime Minister in Dublin on 4 December.  At that meeting the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister reaffirmed their determination to do everything possible to promote agreement and reconciliation and their support for a process of political dialogue. They expressed the determination of both Governments that efforts to help find a solution would be fully commensurate with the gravity and complexity of the problem and reaffirmed their commitment to do everything possible to ensure that agreement is reached on fresh political talks addressing the relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the Taoiseach's meeting with the Prime Minister, I availed of the opportunity to have further detailed discussions with Mr. Brooke regarding the prospects for relaunching the political talks.  Contacts are continuing with the political parties and I would expect to discuss the matter again shortly with the Secretary of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the urgency of the situation and of the killings that continue by the day, will the Minister agree that there is a need for an initiative? Will he agree that there is need for the Government to do a little more than make statements that they will not be found wanting and so on?  In that context, will the Minister consider the proposal made by Deputy John Bruton, the Leader of Fine Gael, for a declaration to be signed by the leaders of the constitutional parties of these two islands asking the parties in Northern Ireland to get around the table again?  Will the Minister consider an initiative of that kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the recent upsurge in violence the need for progress on the political front has never been clearer than it is now.  In my view, there are inescapable responsibilities on all political leaders.  The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have endorsed at the highest level of government an appeal to <Col N="1049" /> all parties involved to continue the search for a solution, taking into account the three vital relationships involved.</P>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that there was an agreed basis for talks last March, a basis that took account of the sensitivities of all of the participants and that was painstakingly negotiated over some 15 months.  I remain convinced that the quickest route to launching political dialogue is for the parties to reconvene on this basis rather than to launch a new and probably equally lengthy and difficult search for a different basis acceptable to all concerned.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister made it very clear that both Governments are most anxious that political dialogue should get under way as quickly as possible.  In recent times there have been talks between the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the leaders of the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland with a view of getting these talks under way.  As I said in my initial reply to Deputy O'Keeffe, I propose to meet Secretary of State Brooke before Christmas to see how we can make progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 51 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen reports of the incidents to which the Deputies refer, which must reflect the depth of feeling and anger <Col N="1050" /> of Cambodians at the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge.</P>
    <P>Under the comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian conflict, which has been endorsed by the UN Security Council, a Supreme National Council was established as the unique legitimate body and source of authority in which throughout the transitional period the sovereignty, independence and unity of Cambodia are enshrined.  The Supreme National Council bring together the four Cambodian parties and is therefore essential for the successful implementation of the peace process.</P>
    <P>After the incidents referred to, the supreme national council met in Pattaya, Thailand, on 3 December and agreed security arrangements to permit the council to meet in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, at an early date.  These arrangements were endorsed by the representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. Prince Sihanouk, as President of the Supreme National Council, has also undertaken to make the SNC Secretariat operational as soon as possible.  While the events of 27 November, therefore, looked as if they might jeopardise the functioning of the SNC and consequently of the peace plan for Cambodia, this danger was averted.</P>
    <P>Ireland has consistently supported the UN plan for Cambodia embodied in the Comprehensive Political Settlement which was signed by all parties to the conflict in Paris on 23 October 1991.  The holding of free and fair elections under international supervision is a central element of the settlement.  Ireland is already contributing to this process in a practical way by sending two military personnel as part of the United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC).  It is expected that the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), which will oversee the election process, will be established early next year.  Ireland would consider sympathetically any request from the UN inviting us to participate in this operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the Cambodian peace plan in effect is an imposed plan; that the involvement of the Khmer Rouge in the Supreme National Council is the same as if the allies, in 1945, had established a Coalition Government in Germany and had included Hitler, Dr. Mengele, Goebbels and so on; that it is perfectly understandable that the people of Cambodia, who have been the victims of the Pol Pot genocide, would react very angrily to these people being involved in the Government of their country?  Is the Minister concerned about its implications for the peace plan and for the understandable unwillingness of the people of Cambodia to accept the involvement of the Khmer Rouge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore probably would be best advised not to forget that the particular comprehensive political settlement about which we are talking has been endorsed by the United Nations Security Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says, that the peace plan, whatever its background, has been accepted by all as constituting the only way forward in Cambodia.  But given that every adult Cambodian alive remembers vividly the killing fields of the Khmer Rouge would the Minister give the House a commitment that he will do what he can to ensure that Pol Pot, and the leaders in those killing fields, will not be to the forefront in negotiating peace in Cambodia? Would the Minister not agree that there is a grave risk of the United Nations role being discredited if people like Pol Pot are presented to the people in an election?  I agree with Deputy Gilmore that it would be the equivalent of asking the United Nations to support the return of Idi Amin to Uganda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the sentiments expressed by Deputy Owen here today and have the same concerns, which I know are shared by the Government. The Deputy can rest assured that we will <Col N="1052" /> make our views known and ensure that our concerns are taken on board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said on many occasions in this House that he is giving consideration to the sending of an Irish observer mission to Cambodia. Has he come to a conclusion on this point?  Will he now agree to the sending of such a mission?  My second question is in relation to his reply in which he mentioned the forthcoming elections in Cambodia.  Would he agree that there is need for an observer mission to arrive there before the electoral process begins, for example, to deal with the forced enlistment from refugee camps, the marching back of people from camps to certain areas for the purposes of rigging the electoral register and so on?  Would he not agree that the most useful exercise for him and the Government would be to decide once and for all to send an observer mission to examine these matters which are pre-electoral?  Would he agree that it will be too late to send some people when the formal election has been announced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In this House before, in the course of discussions on this issue, I have been asked whether I would consider sending a fact-finding mission to Cambodia in view of the important developments taking place there.  I am satified with the information on Cambodia, which I continue to receive from a variety of sources.  Therefore, I feel that a fact-finding mission would not be called for at present.  But if I felt there was need for one or that we would benefit therefrom.  I would certainly give the matter further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that Pol Pot and his scoundrels were responsible for wholesale genocide? Would he say what steps our Government are taking to have these people brought to justice and tried for their crimes?</P>

    <Col N="1053" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On many occasions in the past, when we discussed the Cambodian issue, as the records of the House will show, I have roundly and strongly condemned the regime there who were responsible for genocide of such frightening proportions.

      <P>When we adjourned before lunch we had been dealing with amendment No. 6, specifically with the <Col N="1099" /> definition of the word &ldquo;schools&rdquo; contained in that amendment.  I had put it to the Minister that a more appropriate model for the circumstances prevailing in Cork and in other circumstances that could arise, would be the Dublin Institute of Technology model, that is the institute and the colleges of the institute.  My amendment No. 12 provides for the insertion of enabling powers to cater for these types of circumstances.  Since the Minister may have had some time to consider the matter would he say whether he has anything further to add to his earlier comments?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thinking the matter over during lunch, since we have the School of Engineering and various other schools, I contend this would not amount to any diminution.  In fact one of them is called a school already.  This amendment has been tabled in agreement with the people concerned in Cork city, people who are in authority in that area, who discussed the matter and agreed with this amendment only on Friday last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there was substantial agreement to the tabling of the amendment.  However, I gather that the representatives who met the Minister would have preferred the Dublin Institute of Technology model.  I do not have a particular problem with the word &ldquo;schools&rdquo; but I do have a problem with its definition and the fact that it appears in the Bill without definition.  I should prefer to see this problem dealt with in terms of a Schedule to the Bill so that if similar circumstances arose in the future, as arise now in Cork, say, in circumstances in which sections of a college wanted to formally divide into schools, having the Schedules and enabling provisions in place would be much more effective than dealing with the problem in a piecemeal fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to make two separate Regional Technical Colleges.  That is the <Col N="1100" /> advice I am given.  In all, we would have three regional technical colleges in Cork rather than one.  The purpose of this Bill is to establish the Regional Technical Colleges and give them autonomy which will allow them to reach even greater heights and greater achievements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take issue with the Minister. The thrust of my amendment, No. 12, is that the regional college could become an institute with its own colleges, as distinct from its schools.  That is a much more appropriate model than that proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputies Ahearn and O'Shea.  There is a risk that in calling these two colleges a school and putting them in a tier under the management of the regional technical college they will be subordinated and that the vital work they are doing in the arts and culture area will be lost.  The managers of these colleges fear that their ethos will be subsumed in the wider areas of engineering, mathematical sciences, computer studies and so on and that the College of Art and Design and the College of Music could disappear.  By calling them schools they become subordinate animals of the larger body.  They would prefer to retain their own boards of management as full colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>To give three regional technical colleges to Cork city would defeat the whole purpose.  We could not declare schools which have 200 students each to be regional technical colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

One massive regional technical college in Cork city and two smaller ones, each with 200 students, does not make sense.  There is divided opinion but I believe people are quite happy with the proposal.  They will retain their own principals and staff.</P>

      <P>When we were discussing FÁS and CERT some years ago a very strong case was made that CERT should be kept separate in order to retain the identity of the kind of work they were doing.  I would see much the same correlation here.  Because art and design and music are seen as very distinct areas of expertise, there is a danger that they will be subsumed in the more &ldquo;popular&rdquo; student choices.  Not everybody has the talent for art and design or music.  My fear is that those talents will not find voice if they were part of a bigger regional technical college.  I am surprised that the Taoiseach has not taken an interest in this area since he is so interested in the arts and culture.</P>

      <P>When he takes an interest, he is criticised; when he does not, he is criticised.  What should the poor man do?  On the question at issue, either they are in the regional technical college system or they are not.  I will not create two more regional technical colleges in Cork.  They want to be in, therefore the conditions of the governing body apply.  They will retain their own principal and ethos.  That is specifically given to them in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister is indicating now that he is not prepared to consider <Col N="1102" /> adopting the Dublin Institute of Technology model and we still have the problem as to the exact definition of the word &ldquo;school&rdquo;.  There are schools in other regional technical colleges and there is need for a tidying up.  There are schools in Cork already, but now extra schools are being implanted in the Cork Regional Technical College.  There is a need for clear definition.  The Minister may talk about colleges with only 200 students in each, but we must look to the future. Colleges may want to create schools and give them a particular standing.  I instanced earlier Waterford Regional Technical College, where about 46 per cent of students are pursuing degree courses.  It could be in the interests of the evolution of the college that a school would be provided for the degree area, enabling it to grow in its own right, while protecting the basic functions of the college which would relate to certificates, diplomas and business awards.  There is a need to tighten up terminology and to put provisions into the Schedules.  This question does not relate solely to Cork. We must consider the future development of the colleges.  This legislation must not be designed to suit the interpretation of the current Minister.  It will be operated by future Ministers and by officials of the Department.</P>
      <P>I referred on Second Stage to section 7 (5) which enables the Minister to instruct a college by way of letter not to provide a certain service or to desist from a certain service.  If the colleges are in conflict with the universities, for instance in certain degree areas, I am concerned that the sympathies of the Department will be on the side of the universities. There is also a problem regarding apprenticeships and I hope the Minister will expand on this matter at a later stage. Apprenticeship training will, I believe, move more and more towards FÁS and away from the colleges, if present Government policy is followed.</P>

      <P>In defending his amendment the Minister stated that he did not want to create three regional technical colleges in Cork.  I fear from that statement that the Minister may view this Bill as a means by which he can amalgamate or rationalise these institutions. This Bill should have nothing to do with amalgamation or rationalisation.  This Bill should be about giving autonomy to institutions which provide third level education so that they can operate more effectively and efficiently.  I would regret if Crawford College of Art and Design was not regarded as a separate entity.  I am very fearful that any attempt would be made to amalgamate or rationalise <Col N="1104" /> that college in this Bill, and I infer that from a statement the Minister made.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers on this side of the House, I am not happy with the proposal to establish Crawford College of Art and Design or the College of Music as &ldquo;schools of the Regional Technical College, Cork&rdquo;.  I think all of us on this side of the House have reservations about this proposal.  We are worried about the terminology used in the Minister's amendment No. 6 and I again ask him to reconsider it.</P>

      <P>I should like to complete the point I was making when progress was reported.  I was commending him on the large number of amendments he has put down.  In particular, I want to thank him for including the proposed regional technical college in Tallaght in the Bill.  I could not understand why this college was omitted in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to be given some latitude in this debate as we are dealing with 12 amendments, some of which deal with the sections and others which deal with the Schedule.  It is a question of trying to relate these amendments to the Bill. Much more thought needs to be given by the Minister to his amendment No. 6 which simply is a statement and does not relate to any other sections of the Bill. The Minister said that this amendment would give the institutions in Cork a certain amount of independence or status &mdash; I cannot remember the exact word he used &mdash; and they could call themselves anything they liked.  If they are given this independence will they have a separate building?  How will they relate to the governing body?  Will they be able to appoint somebody to the governing body to represent their interests?  The same applies in relation to the academic council. If the Minister's amendment is agreed Crawford College and the Cork School of Music will not count: they will be amalgamated into Cork Regional Technical College and will not have any say at any tier.  If they are lucky they may have a staff representative on the governing body.  Where exactly will they stand and <Col N="1105" /> what type of independence will they be given?</P>
    <P>Giving these institutions some status in their own right would require amendments to other sections of the Bill.  Otherwise they would be no different to the regional technical colleges.  Cork Regional Technical College will run the show and the Crawford College of Art and Design and the Cork College of Music will be regarded as other faculties. If they are not to be merely other faculties of the regional technical college how will they be different and what extra functions will they have?  No reference is made to this in section 5 which deals with the functions of colleges or in section 2.  The only place reference is made to these colleges is in the Minister's amendment No. 6 which proposes to delete section 3 (1) (b) and replace it with a new paragraph. I do not think this amendment has been properly thought out.  The Minister should go back to the parliamentary draftsman and see if his own proposals in regard to giving these colleges extra functions and powers can be included in other sections.  As the Bill stands they will have no independence or extra functions, and we will be opposing the Minister's amendment No. 6.  He should leave section 3 as it stands if he does not intend giving these institutions extra status.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla has praised the Minister for tabling a large number of amendments to the Bill.  Prior to the break I also had attempted being nice to the Minister in the hope that it would produce a positive response in relation to the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design.  However, I have to say that his response so far has been less than satisfactory.  As of now the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design is not being included in the Bill and is consequently not being considered as a third level college.  For all of the reasons I stated earlier, for example, historical reasons, this is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated my willingness to listen to any firm commitment the Minister might give to including the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design in column (1) of <Col N="1106" /> the First Schedule.  No commitment was given by him in relation to this college other than a statement that perhaps it could be considered for designation as a constituent college of the Dublin Institute of Technology, which is a new issue.  The people of Dún Laoghaire are understandably reluctant to be lumped in with a greater Dublin scene.  We pride ourselves on having a certain degree of independence from the Dublin scenario. There may well be other implications in that.</P>
    <P>The only reason the Minister offered for not including the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design in the Bill and for rejecting my amendment was that my amendment would make the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design a regional technical college.  I do not understand that explanation because while the short Title says that this Bill is the &ldquo;Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1991&rdquo; the long Title says that it is &ldquo;An Act to Provide for the Organisation and Development of Regional Technical and Other Colleges ...&rdquo;.  Clearly the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design would not be a regional technical college but could be regarded as an &ldquo;other college&rdquo; for the purpose of this Bill.  It is clearly the intention of the legislation to add colleges other than the existing regional technical colleges and to give them the same status as regional technical colleges by including them in column (1) of the First Schedule.</P>
    <P>My objective is to get the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design covered by this Bill and to secure for the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design the formal recognised statutory third level status to which it is entitled and which it has earned over the years. The only way open to me to do that was to table an amendment which I have done.  The Minister has so far shot down that amendment although, in the course of a later contribution, he conferred deserving praise on the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design and acknowledged that it was a third level college but a Minister's acknowledgement here in the House that it is a third level college <Col N="1107" /> does not make it a third level college.  I am afraid we will need something more than that.</P>
    <P>I am quite happy to await any further good news the Minister may wish to give me or some further reason as to why I should not press this amendment.  I am surprised to find myself in the situation where I will have to press this amendment if I do not get a commitment from the Minister.  I am sure he would not want to have conveyed to the staff, the students and the supporters of Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design and the local people, the view that the Government had shot down and defeated an amendment which would have Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design covered by this Bill and made a third level college.  I cannot imagine how the Minister's local parliamentary colleagues will be able to explain that, even to colleagues in their own party, many of whom, particularly those who are members of the vocational education committee, have worked very hard over the years on behalf of this college.  It would be a kick in the teeth for those people if this amendment were defeated or for me to have to leave this House without a firm commitment and a time limit as to when the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design will be designated and granted third level status.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you have asked us to avoid repetition and I hope I have complied with that request.  If the Minister has not something satisfactory to say to me about the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design I will have no option but to press my amendment.</P>

I understand that my predecessor did not give any such commitment as alleged by the Deputy but said that under the provisions of section 3 (2), what was being proposed could be considered at a later stage of the development of the college.  That is as far as I am prepared to go at this point.</P>

If they are in, they are in the system where they have their own heads and their own particular ethos and conditions.  Deputy Mac Giolla asked whether anyone would represent these schools on the governing body.  Of course there will be the vocational education <Col N="1109" /> committees.  Their principal vocational education committee will be Cork City vocational education committee to which four representatives of the colleges will be appointed.  I am sure they will be pleased to continue to represent Crawford College and the Cork School of Music and they may, as the Deputy said rightly, have people from the staff side selected for the governing body.</P>

His promise is much too long fingered to be of any use to me as a Deputy from Dún Laoghaire, to the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design or to the people of Dún Laoghaire.

      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), line 23, to delete &ldquo;Minister considers&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;vocational education committee recommends&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Our point is in relation to a local democratic input.  The power rests with the Minister in terms of making orders relating to this section.  We are seeking in both amendments that the recommendation should emanate from the vocational education committee in the first instance and not from the Minister.  I should like to hear the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>This is a very simple, short amendment but it enshrines a very important principle, that the decisions should be made at the lowest effective level.  That is the principle of subsidiarity which I think is accepted by all parties in this House and which is particularly dear to the heart of The Green Party (Comhaontas Glas).  Surely there is no greater example of the principle of subsidiarity than this subsection?  It is a fairly simple matter of educational administration and <Col N="1117" /> yet the Bill does not provide for this. The vocational education committee, a democratically elected body, should make decisions at local level but the mandarins in the Department of Education have, presumably, persuaded the Minister that they must have power over the smallest detail in this legislation.  There are many examples of excessive power being taken by the Minister and this is just one of them.  I feel very strongly about this matter and I hope the Minister will consider the amendment very seriously.</P>

      <P>Amendments No. 10 is in my name; it relates to subsection (3) and I fully agree with amendment No. 9.  In the promulgation of these Bills last June the former Minister made it quite clear that their purpose was to retain the regional technical colleges within the vocational education committee structure while establishing them as self-governing institutions.</P>
      <P>These two subsections do nothing for the regional technical colleges; they do not give them any powers, they are not even mentioned.  However, they take power from the vocational education committees.  In other words, they do not adhere to the initial purpose of the Bill, which was to give them a structure within the vocational education committee while establishing them as self-governing institutions.  The power is given to the Minister.  There are phrases like: &ldquo;Whenever the Minister considers that this Act should apply to any other educational institution, the Minister may, by order, made with the consent of the Minister for Finance....&rdquo; etc., and &ldquo;whenever the Minister considers that an educational institution or part of such an institution should form part of a college the Minister may, by order....&rdquo; etc. Neither the colleges not the institute - presumably the Dublin Institute of Technology &mdash; have any power to make a recommendation or decision.  The same applies to the vocational education committees.  The Minister should look into this matter because it is not in accordance with the previous Minister's intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> I have commended the Minister on introducing amendments &mdash; some of which we have not yet reached &mdash; and if the Minister examines this matter he will see that it is an area in which the vocational education committees can make a recommendation.  They know the educational institutions in their areas and what colleges or parts of educational institutions should form part of a college. They know the score in their own regions.</P>
    <P>There is a great growth in some second level institutions which are now almost third level institutions through the development of the post-leaving certificate. The vocational education committees will know where the growth is, which institutions have taken on such courses and what is happening in an area.  They should be able to make the recommendations to the Minister.  It is consistent with the purpose of the Bill and the vocational education committees and the very rapid development of the regional technical colleges.  Consequently, this should be altered.  &ldquo;The Minister considers&rdquo; should be deleted and &ldquo;The vocational education committee recommend&rdquo; inserted in its place. In other words, when the vocational education committee recommend that this Act shall apply to another educational institute the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, act on that.  The position is similar in subsection (3).  I support amendments Nos. 9 and 10.</P>

      <P>In my contribution last night I covered most of the points I wish to make.  As a number of Members wish to contribute to this debate I will curtail my remarks.  One matter that concerns me is the question of the pension fund.  I referred to the £6 million from the pension fund being used as back-up money for financing one of the deals.  I am opposed to interfering with the pension fund.  I checked with the Department of Social Welfare today as to who can discharge the money from the pension fund and I was told that under legislation introduced by Deputy Woods permission must be given by the trustees before any money is paid out.  When one considers the vast sum of money &mdash; £300 million &mdash; that was misappropriated in a short time in Britain, we should be concerned about these matters.  If we look back at what happened with Irish Shipping we will see that it is not only the people involved who are affected by interference with pension funds but also their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned that the offer of £8 million for the company was a giveaway price, while others said the offer of £5 million was the correct price.  There are many problems facing the shipping business throughout the world.  I have no doubt that if the staff and management <Col N="1120" /> and the new company work together in the interest of B &amp; I this time next year that company will be in a position to reemploy some of the people who are being made redundant.  I can see a great future for this company.</P>
    <P>In the Single Market it will be much easier to move from one state to another and it follows that there will be a huge increase in demand for shipping.  If B &amp; I are put on a good financial footing, with the excellent staff in the company, the fleet will expand in a few years' time and there will be an increase in the number employed.  The main consideration should be that then the company will be almost wholly Irish owned. They are at present 70 per cent Irish funded.  As was stated earlier, if the Danish group purchased part of the company, 50 per cent of it would be foreign owned and that would not be in the interests of Irish shipping.</P>
    <P>I wish B &amp; I and their staff success in the future.  I have no doubt that the next time I travel by B &amp; I, as I often do, they will be an excellent shipping line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of my party was ably outlined last evening by our Transport spokesman, Deputy Yates.  His speech was well researched and he ably demonstrated his control over the brief which he holds.  He made many relevant points and I will add to them.  Deputy Stafford last evening spoke about Dublin Port.  I agree that the port needs to be developed and updated.  We know that B &amp; I over the years have played a major role in supporting the port.  The traffic generated through the port by the company has been most welcome and beneficial.  Much work needs to be done to the port, but perhaps that is a matter for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My contribution will echo major concerns regarding the future of the employees of B &amp; I.  Those people have served the company well over the years and have been very loyal.  Most will admit that the company's problems were not the fault of the employees.  They worked hard and one must recognise the service they gave over the years.  Many of the <Col N="1121" /> employees of B &amp; I come from my constituency, from Howth, Baldoyle and Sutton.  For many of them their first experience on the sea was in the Howth area as fishermen and they learned their trade very well there.  I look on the B &amp; I as the carrier for the north side of Dublin.  We are very proud of the job the company have done.  Many of their employees served their time as seamen and fishermen in the Howth area and became excellent employees of B &amp; I. They worked very hard on behalf of passengers and carried out their business very well.  Traditionally many seamen have come from the north side of the city.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a very good friend of mine, an employee of B &amp; I, who lost his life in the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i> collision.  He served his time as a fisherman and skipper in Howth.  I refer of course to Dave Harding, one of the excellent employees of B &amp; I.  He worked very hard on behalf of the company and was very proud of the company.  I was privileged to know him.  I would like to extend sympathy to his family and friends.</P>
    <P>I compliment the B &amp; I employees who turned out in Howth on the day of his funeral &mdash; they were indeed a comfort to his family.  Mr. Harding and I were school friends and we played football together.  He was a proud, decent man who worked very hard for the company. As I said, he learned his trade in Howth, as did other fishermen who then went on to work for the B &amp; I.  I am very proud of all those in the Baldoyle, Sutton and Howth areas who work for the company and I want to ensure that they are treated fairly.  I want to ensure also that they will have a job in the future.</P>
    <P>Dubliners depend on the service provided by the B &amp; I Line.  Tourists travelling from Britain use the B &amp; I Line and this is an important source of money for Dublin.  It is not that the well-off travel on the B &amp; I, but they carry the tourists who spend money in the country. The B &amp; I cater for the man or woman who wants to take a camping holiday &mdash; I think the Americans refer to them as backpackers.  They use this service in <Col N="1122" /> great numbers because it is cheaper than travelling by air.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I have also been to the forefront in catering for the motorist who may wish to bring his car and caravan with him. Over the years I have noticed that we cater for caravans and B &amp; I deserve to be congratulated for the way they have served this segment of the tourist trade. They ensured that people wishing to take their car and caravan were able to get here and enjoy their holiday before returning home safely.  B &amp; I play a very important role in the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The company should have been more market oriented, but they failed in this regard in some respects.  Aer Lingus, for instance, were able to diversify and over the years they went into various businesses, including the hotel business.  A group from Aer Lingus visited members of my party in order to update us on the company's performance.  I have been told that Aer Lingus enjoyed a business growth from 1986-91 of 100 per cent, for which they deserve our congratulations. Their core business, the passenger business, makes a loss of approximately £40 million but due to their diversification measures they achieved a profit of £22 million last year and have forecast a profit of £23 million this year.</P>
    <P>If one were to criticise B &amp; I, one could criticise their failure to diversify.  I know they have made great efforts in the duty free business, which has generated some money for the company.  They also tried to introduce other money making ventures on board the ships and they have to be congratulated for that.  It is well known that the fares on B &amp; I are cheaper than air fares and it should be possible to attract more people to travel by sea. It is nice to take a trip to Holyhead, spend the day there and then travel home.  One can buy duty free goods on such a trip. B &amp; I have tried to market these trips, but they should have done more and perhaps a better advertising campaign would have made it a more successful venture. Indeed, this question will have to be addressed again and the company will have to become more market oriented. Aer Lingus went into the hotel business, <Col N="1123" /> catering and aircraft maintenance and they are making money at a time when they are losing £40 million in their core business.  B &amp; I, the Irish carrier, should be doing likewise and they should look at other outlets associated with sea-going business.</P>
    <P>Some years ago one felt a sense of excitement when the company decided to introduce a hovercraft service.  They ran a marvellous advertising campaign and I well remember the claims that one could take a trip from England and land right in the middle of Dublin.  That was a marvellous innovation and I thought the company were going places because there is nothing like coming from a foreign company and arriving at the centre of a capital city, practically beside O'Connell Bridge.  Indeed, one could conduct a marvellous campaign and English people could be encouraged to come to Ireland at Christmas, Easter or during the holiday period, to do their shopping. Indeed, one reads from time to time that Europeans travel to England by ferry and spend lots of money shopping in London and in other cities.  However, the vessel that the company had decided to purchase was not suitable for the Irish Sea and unfortunately they were not able to achieve the customer confidence that would enable the company to sell this service.  Somebody will have to look at the possibility of providing a similar service again.</P>
    <P>With the technological advances in recent times there must be a craft that would service this type of operation &mdash; that is a service that brings people right into the centre of Dublin, they travel up the Liffey and land opposite the Custom House.  I know that the depot used at the time is still there.  I think this offers an ideal opportunity to make money.  It offers an ideal opportunity to boost the tourist industry and I suggest that the company should not feel embarrassed that the previous venture failed but should try it out again.  Even if the State had to support such a venture, I am sure that all parties in this House would support that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> Ireland is a nation that depends solely on its ability to export in an efficient manner.  In order to serve Irish industry, Irish exporters and Irish tourism, and as a nation on the periphery of Europe, with our neighbour and competitor having direct access to European markets through the channel tunnel, which will commence operations in the very near future, Ireland should and must have control of shipping.  The B &amp; I Line have fulfilled that role over the years and have serviced the vital container service and cargo links from Dublin Port to Antwerp, Rotterdam and Le Harve as well as our vital links with England, especially Holyhead.</P>
    <P>In 1965 the Government bought the B &amp; I Line to protect delivery to export markets.  Today the line is still a vital shipping conduit to our European markets. At that time the line was purchased as a strategic national interest in the State having involvement with shipping services. We in Fine Gael maintain that the Government should retain the stake in the B &amp; I Line and protect our vital interest by holding a golden share.</P>
    <P>When the Government heretofore set about privatisation under measures such as the Irish Sugar Company Act, which established Greencore, the State ensured that its ownership would be reduced on a gradual basis.  The Government currently retain 45 per cent ownership in Greencore.</P>
    <P>I believe that Ireland must safeguard its vital markets abroad.  They will be protected by retaining State control in Aer Lingus and in the airports and sea ports.  I wonder why the Government are abandoning such vital interests in the flog off of the B &amp; I Line.</P>
    <P>An amount of £26 million of taxpayers' money is being written off.  I consider that Irish Continental Group have succeeded in the softest takenover in the history of the State.  The B &amp; I Line, a State company, this year made a trading profit of £2.5 million and it is to be sold off for just under £8.5 million while its debts totalling £35 million will be written off by the Government.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the Government's <Col N="1125" /> haste in selling off the company when one takes into consideration the fact that this vital State shipping company has been turned around from an operating loss of £3.5 million in 1987 to a profit of £2.5 million this year.  Over the same period the company were successful in reducing overheads and reduced staff numbers by nearly 400.</P>
    <P>It is the workers who suffer &mdash; 400 employees have been laid off.  They are the decent people who served their time in Howth, as I said before, they are sea-going people who offer expertise and tradition. It is not right that they are the people to suffer all of the time and be laid off.</P>
    <P>What is the future for the present staff of the B &amp; I Line, numbering about 1,000, including 123 temporary employees?  In the new set up it is intended to reduce staffing levels to about 650.  Again, it is the employees who are suffering.  The great tradition of seafaring will be lost.</P>
    <P>I know that Britain always prides itself on being a seafaring national, but so do we.  As an island nation Ireland produces some of the best sailors in the world. This country has excellent institutions for training seamen, and most of them who start in the fishing industry get the best general seamanship training in the world. They are the people who make up the personnel of B &amp; I.  Through all of the lay-offs our nation is losing the vital ingredient of personnel who work on the sea, know the sea and know how to look after passengers.  The staff lose out all of the time.</P>
    <P>I understand that senior management is to be virtually eliminated and replaced by ICG staff.  Also to be eliminated is 42 per cent of clerical jobs.  Maintenance employees are to be replaced by contractors. Will the Minister protect those jobs?  Will he ensure that those jobs will be there in the future?  Can he guarantee the protection of the pension fund and the rights of pay and continuity of service for those workers in the new set up?  I think not.  If the workers are to avoid a bleak future on the ever lengthening dole <Col N="1126" /> queues, the Minister must make it a condition of the purchase deal that any job losses will be strictly on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Government were in such a hurry to flog off the B &amp; I Line in the first place.  In my opinion, ICG is a smaller company with a turnover of £40 million, 250 staff, assets of £30 million and a fleet of two vessels.  How could that organisation acquire a company such as the B &amp; I Line, with a turnover of £70 million, a much larger fleet and a staff of approximately 1,000 persons?  This deal is not a merger but, as I said before, one of the softest takeover deals in recent times.  Surely the staff-management buy-out would be in the best interests of preserving a truly Irish shipping line and thereby protecting and maintaining the vital interests of Irish manufacturers, Irish exporters, Irish tourism and, more important, Irish jobs.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are opposing this Bill because we feel that the purchaser of the B &amp; I Line has obtained a bargain basement buy.  In the deal £36 million is to be written off, all of the assets of the B &amp; I Line are to be clear of liabilities, there is a pension fund valued at £60 million and B &amp; I have a surplus of between £6 million and £13 million.  ICG will have the freedom to bargain away up to 350 jobs by way of redundancy, they will have access to the EC for shipping grants and they will be able to use the argument that Ireland will be the only State without a land link after the channel tunnel is completed in 1993.  ICG will get all of that for a mere £8.5 million.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael believe that that price is much too low.  We feel that the Minister is simply abandoning the B &amp; I Line. That is completely unacceptable.  Irish Ferries say that they will invest £32 million over the next five years and that they intend upgrading the <i>m.v. Leinster,</i> which serves the Dublin-Holyhead route. They also intend replacing the <i>m.v. Munster</i> at a cost of £20 million.  The organisation anticipates making losses for the first three years but making money in the fourth year.  It is also proposed that Irish Ferries will spend £1 <Col N="1127" /> million on upgrading facilities at the North Wall terminal.</P>
    <P>I am not out to condemn the company proposing the takeover.  I know that they do an excellent job.  I know that they are a small company.  I know that they are good at business &mdash; they must be because they have proved it with profits, which is the way to measure any company.  If a company are making profits then they have a right to succeed, they have a right to go ahead and buy out other shipping lines.  However, I consider that ICG are not paying enough for the B &amp; I Line.  It is my opinion that the Minister was very foolish to allow such a good company as the B &amp; I Line go for such a small price.</P>
    <P>All of the above proposals are very welcome in the context of the future of the B &amp; I Line if the merger takes place and the kind of money referred to is spent.</P>
    <P>We should now consider the possibility that the company's competitors would ever be in a position to force a takeover. Perhaps competitors would have ambitions to create a monopoly in Irish shipping.  What if the company's competitors were faced with a price war and the company could not compete, the end result being closure?  Would the Government have power to act in the protection of our vital shipping interests?  In that respect I am talking about competition. For any company to succeed they must be aware of the need to make profits.  If a monopoly were created on the Irish Sea there would be no encouragement for any company to compete and make profits. That would not be good for Ireland.  As I have said before, we depend on our shipping lines.  If there is no competition then shipping would be expensive and our export goods and tourism would be much dearer.  We should not allow that. We should ensure that competition on the Irish Sea remains.  I know that the B &amp; I Line are well able for that competition if they are given the wherewithal to compete.</P>
    <P>I suppose what we are talking about is proper investment because the employees have worked very hard on <Col N="1128" /> behalf of the company for many years. Perhaps there was not the proper investment in the company.  Perhaps the State did not give them the proper support in money terms; that may be the reason.  We know that the management have been excellent and have done a great job in turning the company around into a profit-making one, for which they should be congratulated.  We should not discard management, who slaved over the years to convert the company into a profit-making one.  It would not be fair that they should be placed on the scrap heap. Rather their position should be examined and protected.  It is the business of the State to do so.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that the B &amp; I's competitors on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route have superior vessels in the <i>m.v. Stena Hibernia</i> and the <i>m.v. Felicity</i> operating on the Rosslare-Fishguard route.  Over the next five years Irish Ferries will have to replace the <i>St. Killian</i> and the <i>St. Patrick,</i> involving the company in a large outlay.  In such circumstances, will the company be able to survive or will the Government have to mount a rescue operation with large amounts of money?</P>
    <P>The Minister has rushed the introduction of this Bill.  I am convinced that had he spoken in greater depth with the management and staff about their buy-out, he would have obtained the money he required; I am sure it would have been forthcoming from them.  The Minister should be aware that any Bill rushed through inevitably amounts to bad legislation.</P>
    <P>We will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage.  We will be voting against this Bill because the buy-out has been struck at such a cheap price.  We contend that, had the Minister managed his business better, he could have got more money for the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot over-stress the importance of shipping in general and specifically the sale of this company. Speakers said last evening and again today that it is most important that we have competitive shipping lines since <Col N="1129" /> practically 99 per cent of all our freight is carried by sea.  In fact we need competitive shipping lines consistently, not just at certain times of the year when, at others, they might be constricted through industrial action or whatever.  Indeed, we need a fair spread of shipping facilities nationwide.  Many Members who have spoken have been representative of what has been described as the east coast section, having their specific mandate.  I would emphasise that the three shipping corridors, the northern one encompassing our colleagues in the North and the central and southern ones are worthy of equal support, guidance and, at times, guarding.</P>
      <P>I am shocked at some of the figures being revealed <i>vis-á-vis</i> treatment of what might be described as local shipping facilities in the local harbour area.  One matter that needs to be examined in the context of the change of ownership of this company is the reason the volume of freight traffic transmitted through the northern channels, that is northern ports generally, amounted to 140,000 40-foot containers in one year.  These would be containers transferred from areas within, say, five miles of Dublin, or even within Dublin city boundaries, through Larne, Warrenpoint and so on.  If the B &amp; I Line is such a great company, so efficient, doing a great job and bearing in mind the huge investment in the local port, why should these transfers take place?  It appears that people, particularly those involved in the roll-on, roll-off mode of shipping, can transfer freight to northern harbours, ship out of them and still contend it is a viable alternative.  That is a matter that will have to be addressed even after the passage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear that things are very wrong in Dublin port and need to be highlighted.  Indeed, it would appear the remainder of the country suffers as a result.  I read a recent report by the management of Dublin port in which they complained of difficulty with planning applications, roads access, slow customs clearance, gross under-capacity but, most of all, labour relations problems.  We <Col N="1130" /> must remember that in this respect, inevitably birds come home to roost.  People who may have gone on strike hitherto, on the basis that they could hold the gun to the customers' heads, the passengers, may have felt they were in charge or control but they too should remember that birds have a habit of coming home to roost.  Indeed, we are seeing that in action with the former losses incurred by the B &amp; I and the present buy-out circumstances.</P>
    <P>I represent a southern port area.  We are very proud of the record of Cork port and of our latest ferry service, to which I will revert later.  Nonetheless, at times we feel we do not get a fair crack of the whip, that like is not compared with like. At present we understand the European Commission were investigating the possibility of having one preferential corridor for Irish-United Kingdom exports.  I know their eyes are on the central corridor. Anybody involved in such decisions should take a very careful look at the record of the various ports before settling for such a central corridor.  We are aware that the southern corridor will consist of the three lower harbours, including ours, then Dublin and its adjacent harbours and the three in the North.  I would warn that careful consideration should be given to any such decision before moneys are invested. Huge amounts of finance will be available for port facilities, possibly for mobile assets, such as shipping tugs and so on.  It would appear that the dice are at present loaded in favour of the central corridor, not based on efficiency, good value, good work practices or the like, but rather based on political support.  I would appeal to the Minister and others to carefully examine the track record and production in each of those areas.  I must reiterate that practically 99 per cent of our exports are transported by ship.  I might question again why it would appear to be cheaper, more efficient, timely, to transport 40-foot containers from harbours adjacent to Dublin through Larne and Warrenpoint.  This and other issues will need to be examined.</P>
    <P>The issue at present is not whether <Col N="1131" /> we sell this company.  The last speaker referred to the possibility of not selling the company.  Each Member who has contributed has accepted that there is need for change, that something must happen so that it then becomes a question of which group one should sell.  If all things were equal and I were selling, say, a factory or commercial practice my natural inclination would be to support a worker buy-out.  But in this case all things are not equal.  Apart altogether from the price differential, which is quite substantial, we must examine the need for re-investment.  The primary reason for selling is the need for a re-investment of a minimum of £25 million and an unknown maximum figure.  It is worth pointing out that the last ferry bought by the shipping company involved in the route from Cork to Roscoff cost £58 million.  That type of investment must be examined.</P>
    <P>We have heard contributions from Deputy Yates and others in Fine Gael.  I was not in this House in the early eighties but I checked to see if what I had read about Irish Shipping was correct.  That company collapsed while Fine Gael were in office.  When I heard them say yesterday that it was scandalous the way the workforce were being treated, being thrown out of work at Christmas, I regarded it as pure hypocrisy.  Deputy Yates commented on the Minister's efforts to ensure a solid, viable shipping line for the future.  I must measure those comments against the criticism which might be levelled against Deputy Jim Mitchell for his handling of the Irish Shipping affair.  He simply washed his hands of the matter and walked away, making no effort.  The best solution was not sought in that case but in the case of B &amp; I every effort is being made.</P>

      <P>I did not want to wrong Deputy Yates last night with regard to the Irish Shipping fiasco and I was careful <Col N="1132" /> not to interrupt him in case I was mistaken in what I had read.  The required effort was not made, nor was there the requisite ministerial commitment. Instead there was either total disinterest or lack of ability.  I leave that to Fine Gael to decide.  There was no attempt to make Irish Shipping a viable shipping line.  We were told last night that we must have alternatives and must not allow one or two groups to have total charge.  How do Fine Gael reconcile that statement with their record on Irish Shipping?  The Labour Party are not without criticism in this regard since they were partners in Government.  I would ask the public to evaluate the two cases and to see who are making the greater effort and who are the hypocrites.</P>

      <P>Deputy Yates had his opportunity last night.  I am glad that there is no comparison between the two approaches.  I congratulate the Minister on the fact that there is no comparison between his efforts and those of Deputy Mitchell.</P>
      <P>We are told that the figure of £8.5 million represents bad value.  Figures of up to £20 million have been mentioned. Recently there was a similar argument about a farm in Cork sold by the health board.  It was generally claimed that it should have been sold for five or ten times the amount received.  In this case, how does one value the shipping company? Is the value related to the company's assets?  Is the value decided by what people are willing to bid?  We had only one bidder in the case of the land in Cork, despite six months of advertising. In the case of B &amp; I five companies were originally interested, three of whom were foreign.  ICG made the best offer at the outset and their's is still the best offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to look at the history of B &amp; I.  I appreciate that sacrifices have been made.  Deputy Byrne claimed last night that it was unique for people to take a pay freeze.  It was not.  I and other <Col N="1133" /> employees of Irish Steel endured a three-year pay freeze, thanks to the then Minister, Deputy Bruton.  I know that people worked hard in B &amp; I, particularly in the latter days.  We have ten or 12 of their employees based in Cork.  An excellent container service is provided out of the city and these people work hard.  Up to £106 million of taxpayers' money has been paid into this company and there are two vessels to show for it, a ferry and a freight vessel.  We must question where all the money went.  It has been said that the company did not get quite as much money during the past couple of years. In fact they received £17 million in the past three years.  It took 20 years to use up the first £53 million and only six years to use up the second £53 million.  Are we to keep putting in that kind of money? To my knowledge, although I cannot prove it, some of their chief people at director level objected strenuously to Cork getting a pittance of £500,000 by way of repayable loan.  Irish Ferries probably objected also.  They altered their fare structures to ensure that the little boat out of Cork, the Swansea-Cork ferry, would not be viable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne asked how I could support the sale of B &amp; I.  I look on B &amp; I as the company who decided in 1982 to pull out of Cork and stop taking tourists into Cork and Kerry.  Deputy Mitchell, then Minister, gave them <i>carte blanche</i> but they were persuaded, due to local efforts, to bring back a limited service in 1983.  This company walked away from Cork and left us on our rear ends.  That is the story of B &amp; I.  They were unwilling to do what was necessary for the nation by supporting the tourism industry in the southern region.  They certainly were not willing to become involved in assisting an alternative, a ferry run by the local authorities.  They did not want competition of that order.  I am hoping that following the merger the company will not adopt a policy of trying to do down this small competitor on the Cork-Swansea route.  I reiterate that B &amp; I received a subsidy of £106 million, while Cork had great difficulty in obtaining a loan of £500,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> I should like to avail again of the opportunity to thank the Minister for changing the attitude adopted by the Government towards this port.  I traipsed up to Dublin, first as Lord Mayor and then in various other capacities, with some of my colleagues to meet with the then Minister, Deputy Mitchell.  We got a very cool reception from him.  As a result Cork had a ferry service for three years. I would point out to those who say we are whingeing and crying that there is a big disparity between the level of investment in ports along the east coast and the level of investment in ports along the south coast.  Other than the loan of £500,000, anything which has been achieved in relation to the Cork port was due to local effort.  That money has been paid back but I hope it will be made available again if it is needed.  In the context of the money invested in the B &amp; I line this is only pennies.  Deputy Yates was worried about, the reaction of the staff.  In this context I would refer him to what obtained earlier.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised about the guarantee that the company would remain, even partly, in Irish hands.  The Irish Continental Group are 70 per cent owned by Irish people.  As Deputy Stafford said, the management-staff buy-out proposal had a 50 per cent Danish input. It can be seen from this that we are getting the best deal.  The Irish Continental Group have given a commitment to the Minister, the B &amp; I staff, the Stock Exchange and the general public that they will seek to ensure the success of the Irish routes.  If they fail, so be it; we should remember that any company can fail.  I believe the future of the Irish routes looks promising.</P>
    <P>The proposal to invest £30 million in the B &amp; I line over the next five years was of vital importance in deciding between the two offers on the table.  This investment is crucial to the future of the shipping line.  I am aware that the two ships and much of the equipment is in poor condition.  If the management-staff buy-out proposal had been accepted <Col N="1135" /> where would the funding for reinvestment have come from?</P>

      <P>Money from the pension fund would have had to be used if the management-staff buy-out proposal had been accepted.  That is a fact.  Did the Deputy's colleague suggest that the Irish Continental Group would use a portion of this fund and that it was more or less all right to do so?  I understand that following pensions legislation introduced by the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, that this cannot happen. I should like this point to be clarified. Pension funds in the UK in particular have been abused by individuals.  I was shocked to learn that a portion of the pension fund would be used in this proposal. Even though it has been said that <Col N="1136" /> the pension fund was over-subscribed I believe the pension fund should be kept intact so that proper pensions can be paid to employees.  The Minister needs to copperfasten the rules in relation to pension funds.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there was friction between various employee groups about the buy-out proposal.  I am not privy to inside information but I am aware that there was disquiet among the different groupings.  I saw a person last night carrying a placard which suggested &mdash; this is most unusual &mdash; that there may have been a split in the camp on the buy-out proposal.  It is important that we ensure we will have a proper shipping service in the future.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the best offer has been accepted in the sale of the B &amp; I Line.  When one is selling something one looks at the offers on the table and selects the best one.  I am aware that changes will be needed.  It was suggested last night that EC legislation on mobile assets would be of benefit to shipping companies. However, I want to see an efficient punctual and cost-effective method of shipping.  To date our record in this regard has not been very good. When one considers our history in shipping and related matters one would think that as an island nation we would be more efficient.  We have much ground to make up.  I believe extra funding will be made available from the EC in view of our peripherality and the fact that after the completion of the Channel Tunnel we will be the only country in Europe without a land link.  Talks are taking place with our other countries in this regard. The massive changes which will have to be introduced will put the onus on us to ensure that we have an efficient shipping service.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the strike at Dublin Port.  I believe the back to work proposal was rejected by the strikers today. I do not think we can afford such strikes.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the Cork-Swansea route.  We were advised that this route could not be profitable.  Last year that ferry brought in 125,000 passengers from the UK, 8,000 passengers from France, 34,000 cars from the UK and 1,000 cars from France.  That is what an efficient and well-run operation can achieve.  This is what we should be looking for from the new company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>We were refused all subsidies because we were on the south coast.  As a result we have had to work on our own.  However, I should point out that we have done a good job.  Last night people quoted figures in regard to tonnage. They were worried about the port and the roads to it.  It got so bad at one stage that I thought it might be better if we phased it out, thereby save taxpayers' money.  We can be sure that discussions on the preferential corridor are under way at present.  I wish to emphasise that efficiency in the different areas should be rewarded.</P>

      <P>I refer to two comments <Col N="1138" /> made by Deputy Byrne last night who said that the sale of B &amp; I was literally privatisation.  He was most anxious that the management-employee offer be taken up.  In the matter of privatisation is there a difference between the two? Surely both would be taking the line out of State hands.  I think the term privatisation was used in an emotive fashion to throw in one extra argument.  I objected to the Deputy's vicious attack on the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and their role in the whole affair.  I am aware that Deputy Byrne's party lost a great deal of their influence within the ICTU in the past couple of years but I do not think he should be too harsh with those members who rejected that level of control and who are still there.  As a long time trade-unionist I considered the attack uncalled for.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions do the job to the best of their ability.  It is easy to criticise their decisions but they are drawing on their own experience and knowledge of related matters to support the action that needs to be taken to secure the best possible option for the future.  I am sure they would consider all aspects and not just the narrow political perspective as Deputy Byrne did last night.  For a long time they had a level of influence which was very much out of proportion to their membership strength, politically speaking, but that may be an indication of how times are changing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt earlier with the position in Cork but I would like to refer to it again in the context of development and of the decisions to be taken about the primary port servicing the UK.  We still have spare capacity in Cork.  We can handle much more traffic there.  We have a 24 hour port service which is probably unique.  If some people were told they had to work on a Saturday or Sunday they would probably put a picket on, there and then, without even discussing the issue of breaking the Sabbath or whatever.  We are extremely competitive and efficient. I have been told there are accumulated debts of £16.5 million for stevedoring losses in Dublin Port.  I wonder whether <Col N="1139" /> the State will be asked to bail them out again.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy had his way they would get the money because I am sure he would look after the local field first.  The question of structural funding could be related to all of that.  As a Cork Deputy, having regard to the treatment we received from B &amp; I I would look at all this from a different perspective than would local Deputies who are obviously happy enough with what was done but we were let down badly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the company need major reinvestment. The way to obtain that is by means of outside funding rather than from the taxpayer: that was the kernel of the argument.  We must have the best shipping service available for our exporters and manufacturers.</P>
      <P>I mentioned before the break that 99 per cent of our exports is shipped out.  In that context I would ask why it is necessary to move thousands of 40 foot containers from the Dublin area and further north out through the ports of Larne, Belfast and Warrenpoint rather than through Dublin Port.  I have been told that is a separate issue but I do not think so.  We are talking about the future of shipping, infrastructural needs and the mobile assets that will be funded and all of this needs to be examined quickly. They have got to get their act together because the State cannot continue to pump finance into inefficient areas in the future.  From the perspective of the south of the country we will be checking and questioning a great deal more in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context I support strongly the view expressed by British and Irish parliamentarians only last week when they said that: &ldquo;the interests of exporters and <Col N="1140" /> importers and their customers, the citizens of the State, are best served by free competition between the Irish sea ports.&rdquo; By that they meant there would be no artificial fostering of any one port by the EC or otherwise.  Such funding cannot be provided any longer.  There will have to be a fair share-out for each of the 17 ports.  It is important, as has been stressed, that the vessels are always kept under the Irish flag.  The proposed sale will ensure that that happens.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates asked what the Government's response would be if the company collapsed and they were approached by exporters, business people and those in the tourist industry.  There would be a lot more to say if they allowed the situation to continue as it is, allowed another Irish Shipping situation to happen in the case of B &amp; I and did nothing about it.  I firmly believe there is a far greater likelihood of the merged company surviving than of the two smaller individual units surviving. The merger is a major and a logical step to take.  The benefits which, as the Minister outlined, can accrue from the acquisition of B &amp; I by ICG are: the maintenance of a shipping fleet, and of maritime skills; the maintenance and development of critical shipping routes, vital for tourist and national transport needs &mdash; that is the most critical aspect &mdash; and the creation of a platform for an increase in capacity and improvements in the quality of service.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about dealing with our unemployment problem and becoming more viable we will have to get our act together in that area.  Transport costs for Irish manufacturers is 9 per cent, which is exactly double that of mainland UK or the continent.  All the programmes, those to help overcome the problems of peripherality and those designed to aid regional development will take out only 25 per cent of the differential.  If you are an Irish manufacturer you are competing with a major handicap and for those in the tourist business it must be costing more.  The only way we can become competitive is by being efficient and that includes, too, a guarantee of the provision of services whether at our sea ports <Col N="1141" /> or our airports.  There is nothing more distressing than to see 300 or 400 people, who may have saved for a year, for their holidays, sitting around with their children, with packs on their backs, and being told that somebody has decided to pull the plug.  That is not on and it cannot be on for the future because, as I said, the birds come home to roost.  There may be short term gains and while the battle may be won in the short term, it is lost eventually for those concerned.</P>

      <P>If we are serious about dealing with unemployment we have to examine every aspect of competition. Shipping and transport are crucial aspects in competition.  We simply cannot export without an efficient shipping line and we simply have not been efficient to date. Some areas are excellent and other areas are diabolical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister is anxious about the overall service on the central corridor, that is the Dublin-Holyhead-Liverpool side rather than the service on the southern corridor which the Minister described as the Rosslare-Pembroke service. The southern corridor, as I have already emphasised to the Minister, extends a bit further.  At times people could feel that the Border was at the <Col N="1142" /> wrong end of the country, but the southern corridor consists of the three lower ports.  The Minister has aimed to remove the requirement for ongoing Exchequer funding.  There is no getting away from the fact that the figures are horrifying.  If the company has expanded from six ships to 12 ships one could accept that it was a viable company and that we had to keep improving the assets, but the company has gone back to two ships.</P>
    <P>I do not have any ideological hang-ups about this merger.  I hope we will have a viable shipping service which will become more competitive and which will grow.  If somebody makes profit along the way, so be it if they are providing gainful employment and ensuring the maintenance of a shipping line for the future. There is a question about the number of redundancies under the two different contracts and that will be dealt with.  I gather that the Minister referred to it last night.</P>

The Deputy has done fairly well in that respect himself. I seldom interrupt him or his colleagues when they are at it here for hours.  I would not dare to even come into the Chamber most of the time with them and especially not at prime television time.</P>
      <P>Once the sale is completed I am sure Deputy Rabbitte will join with me in wishing the new company every success in the future.  The work involved in shipping is by its nature treacherous and the people working in that area deserve the best possible conditions.  I often wonder if the sea-going people, who are really those at risk, get as much benefit as many others do from this business.  I wish the company every possible success once the merger goes through.</P>

That probably gives him an excuse for not knowing all the facts about Irish Shipping at that time with particular reference to the reaction of his political party to what happened.  We all regret what happened and the circumstances which allowed it to happen.  I would remind the Deputy since he was not in the House at that time that his party were very loud in their condemnation of what happened at that time.  Repeatedly they made strong promises to the people of Irish Shipping and to the general multitudes outside; they entertained the public with their promises in regard to what would transpire when they were returned to office. Alas, I am afraid the unfortunate people to whom they made those promises were just as disappointed as we in the House were at their failure to deliver.</P>

      <P>I was referring to what Deputy Dennehy said about crocodile tears being shed on this side of the House. He compared our present stance with our alleged position in the mid-eighties in relation to Irish Shipping.  His party made <Col N="1145" /> serious, carefully thought out promises at that time.  In the time that elapsed since those promises were made, absolutely nothing has happened.  The attitude of his party at that time contributed greatly to the erosion of public confidence in the political system.  It was because action was not taken soon enough that a group of people were left in serious difficulties. They were let down by those who made promises to them.  It would have been better for Deputy Dennehy not to have mentioned that incident.</P>
      <P>I have no ideological hang-up on the question of using private or public transport. However, it is essential from the point of view of the country, the business sector, holiday makers and the general public that there should be ready access to the continent of Europe.  It is essential that we have a reliable means of gaining access.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of time has been spent over the last few hours discussing the various corridors and which one should be used.  As a member of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities I know we are now the only country cut off entirely from Europe.  It is even more important to us to have a system of sea transport that will give all the people, North and South, ready access to the continent of Europe and access to this country for continentals. Businesses cannot survive unless that access is provided.</P>
      <P>The best means of access to Europe must, from our point of view, be by means of a good sea transport system.  Our friends in the UK have the channel tunnel but I believe that events will prove that a sea bridge system will be much better, will be less likely to be clogged up and, probably, will prove to be cheaper. Deputy Dennehy spent some time setting out the merits of the Cork-Swansea route &mdash; I have no doubt that they are meritorious and will stand up to scrutiny &mdash; but notwithstanding this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your generosity as time is precious.  I welcome the Minister to the House tonight for the debate.  Last night, I mentioned that 325 residential places are required in the Eastern Health Board area for people with a handicap.  Both the Minister and her predecessor have failed to realise that there are elderly people who are no longer able to cope in providing full-time care for their adult handicapped children at home.  There are about 600 families in this plight, many of whom are at breaking point and crying out for residential places for their children.  At present respite care facilities are very limited and availability is not guaranteed.</P>
      <P>It is rather ironic that some of the parents who are now under enormous pressure may have turned down the offer of a residential place when both they and their child were younger.  Yet, their life spent in caring not to mention the considerable amount of money saved for the State, seems to count for nothing at a time when they urgently need a residential place.  The Government appear to be oblivious to the fact that these families are in crisis and have nowhere to turn. In their recent policies the Government have done nothing to provide these families with back-up services.  Instead, they are forcing parents to carry this burden alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the report of the review group set up by the Government entitled &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo;, over 600 people are officially listed on acute waiting lists for residential care, the problem being most severe in the Dublin area.  In addition, 1,000 day places for people with a mental handicap, who urgently need services, are urgently required.  Given the growing number of people with a handicap, according to this report, an extra 40 residential places and 200 day places will be needed each year for the next five <Col N="1148" /> years.  In practical terms, the Government will have to be prepared to invest £15 million in capital facilities during a five-year period and increase current spending in staffing the new centres at a cost of £4.65 million in the first year of the programme and eventually an extra £20 million a year by the end of the five-year period.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party firmly believe that it is time a charter of rights was enacted to provide both children and adults with a mental handicap with an equal opportunity of gaining access to education, training and of playing as full a role as possible in society.  With this as a priority, during the past few days the Labour Party have published a Private Members' Bill entitled the International Law (Rights of Persons with a Mental Handicap) Bill, 1991 which sets out to confer a range of positive rights on people with a mental handicap.  It would write into Irish law the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons which was adopted by the United Nations in 1971 but never before written into Irish law.</P>
    <P>We had two reasons for introducing the Bill, first, to change the perception of the area of mental handicap which presently is seen too often as an area where charity has an exclusive role and not often enough as an area where fundamental rights are involved and, second, to exert pressure on the Government to take the appropriate policy initiatives to give expression to those rights.</P>
    <P>The rights contained in the United Nations Declaration are as follows: (1) the mentally handicapped person has, to the maximum degree of feasibility, the same rights as other human beings; (2) the mentally handicapped person has a right to proper medical care and physical therapy and to such education, training, rehabilitation and guidance as will enable him or her to develop his or her ability and maximum potential; (3) the mentally handicapped person has a right to economic security and to a decent standard of living and he or she has a right to perform productive work or to engage in any other <Col N="1149" /> meaningful occupation to the fullest possible extent of his or her capabilities; (4) whenever possible, the mentally handicapped person should live with his or her own family or with foster parents and participate in different forms of community life, the family with which he or she lives should receive assistance and if care in an institution becomes necessary it should be provided in surroundings and other circumstances as close as possible to those of normal life; (5) the mentally handicapped person has a right to a qualified guardian when this is required to protect his or her personal wellbeing and interests; (6) the mentally handicapped person has a right to protection from exploitation, abuse and degrading treatment and if prosecution for any offence he or she shall have a right to due process of law with full recognition being given to his or her degree of mental responsibility; (7) whenever mentally handicapped persons are unable, because of the severity of their handicap, to exercise all their rights in a meaningful way or it should become necessary to restrict or deny some or all of these rights, the procedure used for that restriction of denial of rights must contain proper legal safeguards against every form of abuse and this procedure must be based on an evaluation of the social capability of the mentally handicapped person by qualified experts and it must be subject to periodic review and to the right of appeal to higher authorities.</P>
    <P>This Bill, if adopted by the Dáil or preferably, by the Government, would inevitably require the Government to take a range of actions to give effect to the rights contained in the Bill.  Many of the actions required are already set out in the policies adopted by most of the political parties in the Dáil and, more importantly, in the Government's own review body's report which was published earlier this year.</P>
    <P>When we attended the launch of a policy document in the Mansion House today by parents of people with a mental handicap they begged us not to turn this into a party political issue.  They urged us to reach a consensus across the floor of <Col N="1150" /> the House.  I join with them in making that call.  Indeed, in my previous statements on this subject matter, I indicated that I would support the Government in seeking the funds required to protect the rights of people with a handicap.  For this reason we are hopeful that the Bill which we published recently will be moved at the earliest possible opportunity and receive all-party support.</P>
    <P>Finally, the measures outlined in the Bill should not be seen in isolation. The Labour Party have also published another Private Members' Bill, entitled the Equal Status Bill, which would, among other things, prohibit discrimination in a wide range of areas against people with a mental handicap. In addition, we will shortly publish a Bill which is wider than the present one, which will be aimed at giving legal effect in Ireland to a number of United Nations Declarations and Conventions.  Taken together, these initiatives and the policy measures which must flow from them would, finally, address the situation in which too many people with mental handicap and their families, who have given them all the love, care and attention that they require, find themselves.  I felt ashamed that anyone in public life would have allowed the parents who addressed us today to put up with some of the problems they have to put up with, given the inadequate service delivered by the Government and by their predecessors. None of us is exempt because we have never made sure that priority would be attached to the need to provide sufficient funding for this area.</P>
    <P>We heard about children &mdash; who are now adults &mdash; who have been cared for by their parents for years.  We learned that there are almost 1,500 adult handicapped people in psychiatric hospitals although they do not have a record of psychiatric illness.  These are the only facilities available to house these unfortunate people.  It is an indictment of all Members and I hope that the Bill I suggest will be addressed specifically by the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1151" /> Last night, in the absence of the Minister, I mentioned a health agency whose officials want to meet the Minister because it is going bankrupt.  I hope she will address this problem.  We are not surprised that the agency who deal with the handicapped are seeking an urgent meeting with the Minister.  I will convey the name of the institution to the Minister afterwards in case she is unaware of it.  I hope that there will be a consensus in regard to this issue and that there will not be a necessity to vote.  I am sure there will be an acceptance by all that we have a responsibility to those who voted for us, and to those unfortunates who cannot vote but still need us to take care of them, to address this matter.</P>

      <P>I am very glad of the opportunity to speak on the Private Member's Bill because it will give me an opportunity to study the whole matter in as much depth as time allows.  It will also give me a chance to respond to points made and to declare my commitment, that of my party and the Department of Health, to this matter.  I apologise for my absence last night but I will obtain the transcripts of Members' contributions.  I should also be interested to learn the name of the agency to which Deputy Ferris referred.</P>
      <P>In my short time as Minister for Health &mdash; and in my previous career as Minister for Education &mdash; I have been acutely aware of the needs of people with mental handicap.  I have a difficulty with the term &ldquo;mental handicap&rdquo; as I had got into the way of other terminology when I was in the Department of Education.  However, the motion is couched in particular words and I will follow its terminology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are committed to meeting the needs of people with mental <Col N="1152" /> handicap and it is my firm intention to translate this commitment into enhanced services for people with mental handicap. I want to outline to the House the extent to which the Government intend to strengthen their support for people with mental handicap and their carers.  I want the House to reject the motion and to support my amendment and my efforts to enhance services for people with mental handicap and their carers.</P>
    <P>Last night in the House, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Flood, referred to the the fact that, under successive Governments, services for people with mental handicap have improved beyond all recognition. These services have been built up over the years, mainly by lay and religious voluntary agencies.  At the foundation of the State there was only one centre specifically caring for people with mental handicap but now there are nearly 70 voluntary agencies providing a wide range of services.</P>
    <P>The key contribution of voluntary agencies was simple but radical.  They believed in the dignity of the person and that, with extra help and love, children with mental handicap could develop their personalities and skills far beyond the bounds of what many thought possible. Initially those agencies received little support from the State for their efforts. However, today the State provides almost the entire funding for services. The voluntary sector continues to play a leading role in pioneering new services and new approaches to service delivery.</P>
    <P>Mental handicap services have changed radically and for the better over the last 20 years.  High standards of service have been achieved, notwithstanding the fact that our country's economic resources are lower than those of most of our European partners.  This is in itself an achievement due to the efforts of various Governments as well as the sustained efforts of the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>A substantial amount of money is being spent on a range of services to people with mental handicap.  In 1991 over <Col N="1153" /> £170 million will be spent on these services. Of this, £138 million is being spent on the provision of day, residential and support services.  A further £33 million is being spent on cash allowances.  The domiciliary care allowance is being paid to 3,500 families and over 10,000 people with mental handicap are receiving the disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>Relative to other public services, funding for the mental handicap service has been protected.  The allocation to agencies funded directly by the Department of Health increased from over £39 million in 1981 to over £77 million in 1990.  The increase demonstrates the commitment of the Government to people with mental handicap.  I pledge that this commitment will be contained and strengthened.</P>
    <P>Of course problems exist and they must be faced.  We all sympathise with an elderly parent caring for an adult child with a mental handicap; Deputies referred to this.  I understand the concern of such parents about the future welfare of their son or daughter.  These parents made great sacrifices to keep their mentally handicapped children at home and the least they expect from society in return is the reassurance that the person they love will continue to be cared for when they have passed on.  It is an aspiration with which this House can readily identify and I am committed to making it a reality.</P>
    <P>Before outlining what I intend to do to meet the existing needs I should like to look at what is available at present and demonstrate that these are excellent services.</P>
    <P>There are about 25,000 people with mental handicap in this country.  These people have a mild, moderate, severe or profound degree of mental handicap. Some have additional physical handicaps and the kind of service they need varies with their age, degree of handicap, dependency level and the kind of home support available.  Some lead independent lives and need little or no special assistance.  People with severe or profound handicap and a physical disability require most care.</P>
    <P>Services currently being provided <Col N="1154" /> include the early identification of infants whose development is delayed.  Services for children up to age three are delivered mainly in the home.  After this children attend pre-schools to develop their abilities and prepare them for school.  There is a growing and welcome trend of children with mental handicap attending local pre-schools.</P>
    <P>During the school-going age, educational services for nearly 8,000 children with mental handicap are available in 81 special schools and 162 special classes. Over 600 teachers are employed in these services.  Child educational and development centres cater for children who are unable, because of the severity of their handicap, to attend a special school or class.  In addition to those attending special schools and classes, 950 children attend these centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Vocational training assists school leavers to acquire selfcare, social and work skills.  These skills are essential to maximise the young adult's potential to lead an independent life.  Long-term training centres cater for people who have not been able to find work after vocational training or who are not suited to open employment.  Over 4,500 adults attend training and activation services.</P>
    <P>These services enable people with mental handicap to continue living in the family home.  However, it is not always possible for the person with a mental handicap to live at home.  Alternative accommodation may be provided in group homes or in foster homes.  Almost 1,500 people live in this type of accommodation. At present most residential services are provided in domestic scale accommodation, often in bungalows in the grounds of a residential centre.  As the more independent people move to the community, these centres will mainly accommodate people with the highest levels of dependency.  At present, 4,548 people live in these residential centres.</P>
    <P>The value of respite care has been overwhelmingly demonstrated in recent years in supporting families who want to care for their son or daughter but who find the burden of caring without a break <Col N="1155" /> too much.  Respite care takes many forms.  It may be in a residential centre, a hostel in the community or in another family which has offered to care on a short term basis.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Education, I had responsibility for and took a particular interest in the education of children with special needs.  This experience will prove valuable in my new role as Minister for Health.  During my term as Minister for Education, I became keenly aware of the need for a radical review of special education provision, both for children with disabilities and for those with other special needs.  The Primary Education Review Body, chaired by Dr. Tom Murphy, recommended that a detailed analysis of the issues involved.  As in many other countries, separate educational provision for a variety of categories of children has evolved over the years.  Numerically, children with mild and moderate mental handicap form the largest single group.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the trend both nationally and internationally has been towards a policy of integration.  The policy of the Department of Education is now one of integration of children with handicaps, where this is possible, while retaining the option of separate teaching where necessary.  However, it became clear to me that the time had come to take stock of the situation and to develop an appropriate policy framework for the future.</P>
    <P>Last September, I acted on the review body's recommendation and established the Special Education Review Group under the chairmanship of Mr. Declan Brennan, former secretary of the Department of Education.  The committee include representatives of school managements, the teachers' associations, the National Parents Council and the Departments of Education and Health. Their role is to make recommendations on the best arrangements for meeting the educational requirements of children with special needs, including the provision of remedial and other teachers and support services.  I understand that the <Col N="1156" /> committee are working very actively and I am confident that they will produce a blueprint for the future direction of educational provision for these children.</P>
    <P>I do not like to pre-empt the findings of any committee but when this committee were set up I spoke with them at an inaugural meeting and it seemed that, certainly in the education and health spheres, there was a greater need for a bringing together of the services on offer. Often in education one finds &mdash; I understand that Deputy McCormack spoke about this last night although I did not hear him &mdash; that when one inquires about child care assistance from one Department one is told that it is not their responsibility and that they should contact a different Department.  It was Dr. John Murphy, in his review, who pointed to his fact, and that is one of the reasons for setting up the committee.  I hope that one of the recommendations of that committee will be that the services should be co-ordinated in a more practical and sensible fashion.  The services which have been developed are of a high standard but I recognise clearly that there is much to be done.</P>
    <P>Since becoming Minister for Health, I have taken a particular interest in the needs of people with mental handicap.  I am aware of the major challenge facing our services.  The nature of this challenge has been outlined by the federation of bodies providing services to people with mental handicap.  It has been outlined by the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland.  It has been addressed in the report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services, <i>Needs and Abilities.</i></P>
    <P>The fundamental problem which we face is that the number of people with mental handicap has been growing faster than the capacity of services to meet their needs.  In 1981, a census was carried out of the mental handicap population in this country and 23,000 people were identified as having a mental handicap.  It is estimated that this population have increased by 2,000 ten years later.  The number of people with mental handicap is increasing and people with mental <Col N="1157" /> handicap are growing older.  Between December 1981 and December 1991, the number of people with mental handicap over 15 years of age in receipt of services increased by more than 50 per cent. Nearly 90 per cent of clients in receipt of mental handicap sevices at pesent are over 15 years of age.  The population of people with mental handicap is going to continue to grow and to age.  It is the increasing population of people with mental handicap that is putting pressure on our services.</P>
    <P>Up to 20 years ago, the life expectancy of children with mental handicap was low.  Many died in infancy and few survived their twenties.  Thanks to improvement in medical care, I am glad to say that the life expectancy of people with mental handicap is approaching that of the general population.  We must ensure that this increase in life expectancy is matched by a corresponding increase in the quality of life of these people and their carers.</P>
    <P>The increasing population of people with mental handicap is affecting our services in other ways.  The number of people with mental handicap receiving services funded by my Department increased by 34 per cent in the past ten years.  This increase shows that mental handicap agencies have responded to the need for more residential and day places. However, their capacity to provide additional places within their resources is now extremely limited.  They find themselves unable to respond to crisis needs which they could easily have met in the past.  In some centres, adults are occupying places intended for children.  As a result, children in some areas are not receiving as full a service as they should. I am sure that everyone in the House would agree that every child with mental handicap should receive as comprehensive a service as possible.  Experience shows that if the full potential of the child with mental handicap is developed, the child becomes much more independent as an adult.  The quality of life for the child and the family is greatly enhanced.</P>
    <P>There is one other challenge in services <Col N="1158" /> for people with mental handicap to which I would like to refer.  I attach great importance to the decline in the use of psychiatric hospitals &mdash; Deputy Ferris referred to this in his speech &mdash; as centres for the care of people with mental handicap. One of the implications, however, of this policy is that parents and mental handicap centres have to cope with an increasing amount of disturbance within their own resources.  I accept the need to develop specific expertise in relation to the care of people with mental handicap who are also disturbed.</P>
    <P>The nub of the challenge is to develop services for people with mental handicap in the way that matches their needs and promotes their abilities.  The Government have outlined their commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to the provision of adequate and appropriate services for people with mental handicap as recommended in the report, <i>Needs and Abilities.</i>  It is my task as Minister for Health to make progress towards implementing this commitment. The ideal to which we aspire is the provision of a residential and a day place for people with mental handicap who have been assessed by professionals as in need of such places.</P>
    <P>I recognise the need to accelerate the provision of additional residential and day places to meet the backlog of need for services.  Most of these places will be offered to people on the priority lists in each health board area.  The remaining places will be used to expand respite care to families caring for a person with mental handicap at home.</P>
    <P>I recognise the need to provide, as a matter of urgency, additional support to families caring for a person with mental handicap where that person is waiting for a day or residential place.  I would like to see these families receive much greater assistance with the burden of caring. Assistance could be in the form of a respite break on a regular basis.  It could be a home help or a nurse to help change and feed the person with mental handicap.  It could be someone to babysit to allow the family shop together or go to the cinema. For others it could mean someone to <Col N="1159" /> bring the person with mental handicap out of the home so that he or she can participate in a recreational activity.  I would like to see these home care services meeting the needs of the carers and people with mental handicap in as flexible a way as possible.</P>
    <P>I also want to put in place a service to deal with emergencies arising from family breakdown.  If family caring breaks down because of death, illness or fatigue, the emergency service would provide a place until a permanent place becomes available. This service will help to reassure the elderly parents of whom I have already spoken that, if the unexpected happens, their child will be cared for.</P>
    <P>It is also my intention to improve services for people with mental handicap who are disturbed.  A small number of special units with specialised staff is required to provide intensive treatment and therapy.  The team would try to manage the disturbance in the home or in the residential centre in the first instance. The special unit would provide a residential service for those clients requiring intensive treatment.  Even then, it would be the intention that every client would return to his/her home or centre following the intensive treatment.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious of the need to enhance early intervention and development services for children with mental handicap as recommended in &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo;, It would be my intention to increase the number of intervention teams to improve assessment and support services.  These services will help parents cope with the trauma of having a child whose development is delayed and guide parents how best to nurture their child's progress.  I would also like to see an expansion in the number of child education and development centres.</P>
    <P>The centres have been extraordinarily successful in maximising the development of children with a mental handicap and achieving their potential for independence.</P>
    <P>I hope also to initiate next year a genetic counselling service.  This service will be of great benefit to couples who have <Col N="1160" /> already had one child with a mental handicap or where there is a person with a mental handicap in either partner's family.  It is vital that we give couples in this situation the information on which to plan their families.</P>
    <P>There is a need to develop the services about which I have spoken throughout the country.  However, I recognise that for historical reasons and because of the size of the population particular problems exist in the Eastern Health Board region.  I understand that speakers referred to this last night and tonight.  It would be my intention to make special provisions for the eastern region in measures to expand services.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Flood, referred last night to the Government's policy in relation to services for the mentally handicapped.  I would like to emphasise that this policy is based on the recommendations of the report of the review group on mental handicap services, <i>Needs and Abilities.</i> This report is the first major report since the 1965 review.  The review group believe that with adequate support services the overwhelming majority of people could be catered for within their own community.  The Government agreed to the recommendations of the report in principle and are committed in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to their implementation.</P>
    <P>In the 1990 budget my predecessor allocated an additional £2 million for services for the mentally handicapped.  This enabled approximately 150 residential places and 21 respite places as well as other services to be provided.  It was because of the particularly serious situation in the Eastern Health Board region that half of the £2 million was allocated to the region in order to provide extra places.  This year a further £1 million was allocated in the budget to build on those developments.  This will enable 20 places to be commissioned in Cheeverstown House and has funded the opening of 25 places in Aras Attracta, Swinford, as well as additional places in each health board area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> I am well aware that there is a gap between the policy and the developments. I am conscious of the great burden which families carry in caring for a mentally handicapped member.  Neither do I underestimate the challenge I face in providing for those needs.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that in each health board area plans are being prepared in response to the recommendations of the report, <i>Needs and Abilities</i> and the commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> These plans are being prepared in consultation with the voluntary bodies providing services in each area.  The voluntary organisations are keeping apace and carry out their work with great commitment and dedication to the task in hand.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to go through the rest of my speech, but it is available for those who wish to read it.  Let me state emphatically &mdash; I know that Deputy Bruton would have said it with the same fervour last night as Deputy Ferris said it this morning &mdash; that there is a need for across the board co-operation and consensus on matters such as this.  There will always be political difficulties in supporting a Bill presented by the Opposition but that will not stop us having a consensus thrust in our proposals.  The general feeling shared by all Members is that no matter what services we provide in the different areas be it social, economic or any other policy area, the needs of those in greatest need should be addressed first.  I always felt that when I was in the Department of Education and the same will hold true in the Department of Health.  I have set myself on this path and have expressed what I hope to do as best I can but I hope to be able to develop it further in the year, when I will be coming back to the House with my ideas and plans.  We should put all our energy into helping those who can least help themselves.  I welcome the chance to put on record our social commitment.  I welcome also the opportunity to respond to the Fine Gael motion, the Labour Party amendment and the opportunity to comment on the Fine Gael charter for the <Col N="1162" /> disabled and the Labour Party Bill.  I commend my amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset may I say that I have a personal aversion to the words &ldquo;mentally handicapped&rdquo; in the context in which they are generally used. This description has too often been applied to a range of conditions which includes, for example, cerebral palsy. Victims of cerebral palsy are afflicted with severe physical disabilities, including a lack of co-ordination, frequent spasms and a marked inability to communicate and so on.  Not many years ago such people would have been confined to what was then known as a lunatic asylum in spite of the fact that there was no mental disability involved.  This fact was dramatically highlighted in the case of two of our most distinguished writers, the legendary Christy Brown author of <i>My Left Foot</i> and the award winning author, Christopher Nolan.  Both had cerebral palsy and they had to go through a tremendous amount, yet with their caring mother's support they were able to cope. However, most people watching these young men grow up would have regarded them as being mentally retarded.  I would prefer to see the word &ldquo;disabled&rdquo; being used to describe all those who are handicapped either physically or mentally.  The Oxford English dictionary defines &ldquo;disability&rdquo; as &ldquo;physically or mentally impaired&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;disabled&rdquo; does not imply a stigma in the same way as would &ldquo;mentally handicapped&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of claiming that everything in the garden is rosy as far as these services are concerned.  Having listened to Deputies Bruton and Ferris, I have to say I agree with a great deal of what they had to say.  However, I do not agree with Deputy Ferris' implications that all the shortcomings in this regard must be laid at the door of the Government or their immediate predecessor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>This smacks too much of political point scoring.  I could, just as easily examine the record of the Fine <Col N="1163" /> Gael-Labour Coalition Government and come up with practically the same speeches but I would prefer to deal with it in the spirit that the House approaches this serious matter in a positive frame of mind.  Too many of us are handicapped because we have been handicapped by our blindness to the real plight of the disabled in our society for far too long. It is not that we lack compassion, as Irish people as individuals are among the most generous in the world in subscribing to every good cause under the sun.  When we dig deep into our pockets at the Church gates or whatever, perhaps we assume too easily our contributions mean that the particular group have been taken care of for another year by the voluntary organisations and the use of State grants. Things are not that simple unfortunately. We are a small and relatively poor country and the provision of extra resources is always a major problem.  It is cynical in the extreme that Members, when in Opposition should demand large amounts of money for just about everything. All parties have been guilty in that respect.  This is supposed to be good politics but I think it is quite the opposite. Even if we could pick a further £100 million out of the hat in the morning it would not guarantee that the problems we are discussing could be solved to any great extent.  What we need to do, as Deputies Bruton and Ferris said, is to establish our priorities and do our best to ensure we get value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution charges us with the responsibility of cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  If we have to discriminate, we should have positive discrimination in favour of the disabled rather than discriminating against them. Those of us who enjoy good health would have no objection to that way of thinking. Therefore, I agree with those speakers who have referred to the multitude of Departments involved one way or another in this area.  Apart from the Department of Finance, the Departments of Health, Education, Labour, Social Welfare and the Environment are involved. I could supply the Minister with details <Col N="1164" /> from my constituency where resources have been needlessly wasted because of the duplication or overlapping of services between the health boards and various Departments.  Therefore I was delighted to hear the Minister say that one of her priorities will be to achieve co-ordination between all of those various bodies.  It seems that we could certainly put the money available to better use.  The services involved provide for a wide variety of conditions including mental impairment of varying degrees, from a mild condition to very profound disability.  All people with disability are entitled as a matter of right to the maximum education possible in each case and to the opportunity to work to the limit of their capabilities in either the public or the private sector.  There are also those who are physically disabled for whatever reason, and in particular those who are confined to wheelchairs or who are of very small stature.</P>
    <P>As individuals, when we meet disabled persons we must never treat them as morons by ignoring them and talking over their heads.  In some instances the person concerned has full or at least partial use of his or her mental faculties and it must be a shattering experience to be treated as a vegetable.  All of the money in the world could not compensate for that kind of experience.  We are not dealing with statistics, we are talking about sensitive human beings who should not have to experience further hurt on top of their already tragic circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should also like to comment on the involvement of the Department of the Environment.  Access is a very important factor and I wish to speak very briefly about the access group, which was formed several years ago.  I congratulate the former Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, on introducing legislation on 5 December.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I have run out of time. The Minister is new to the health portfolio but I know her to be a very capable and caring person and I am fully confident that she will tackle the massive problem with her customary zeal and the <Col N="1165" /> compassion that she has shown in the past.</P>

      <P>The hallmark of any civilised society is the way in which it treats the weakest and most vulnerable of its members &mdash; the old, the very young, the ill, the infirm and the handicapped. Judged against that yardstick, the policies of cutbacks in health pursued by successive Governments in recent years cast grave doubts over our right to describe this as a civilised society because it is those categories of people who have suffered most from Government economic policies.</P>
      <P>It is hard to think of a more vulnerable and defenceless group in society than the physically and mentally handicapped, who are generally not in a position to defend themselves or to fight for better conditions or medical care.  It is to our eternal shame as a society that not even the mentally handicapped have been spared the lash of the cutbacks.</P>
      <P>The fact that mentally handicapped people have not suffered even more is due largely to the love and care lavished on them by their families and the Trojan work done by the many voluntary organisations active in that field.  What causes the most anger and frustration to those voluntarily involved in the care of the handicapped, whether they be families or groups, is that the more work they do and the harder they try the more content the Government seem to be to wash their hands of their obligations and load even more work and responsibility on to families and the voluntary sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Cork there are 140 young, chronically sick, disabled people &mdash; and there were 140 three years ago &mdash; and there is an urgent need to provide a better home help service for those who care for them. Has that been provided?  No.  There is a need to increase the number of respite <Col N="1166" /> care beds so as to give relief more frequently to those caring for disabled people.  Has that happened?  No.</P>
    <P>A separate scheme is operated by the Irish Wheelchair Association, who pay home care attendants to visit and help mothers of children with physical handicap. In the Cork area the operating costs of the scheme for the three years 1989, 1990 and 1991 was about £25,000.  Of that cost, £5,000 was provided in the past three years by the Southern Health Board and £20,000 was raised by voluntary contribution.  The Southern Health Board contributed only £5,000 towards the cost of having people available to go out and help the mothers of physically handicapped children and give them relief.  As a result, the number of hours' help available has been reduced and relief has been taken from those mothers who so badly need it.</P>
    <P>Fundraising, which provides the bulk of funding for voluntary organisations, has become more difficult since the advent of the national lottery.  It is contended that more funds from the national lottery should be provided and redistributed to voluntary organisations by an umbrella body.  There seems to be a clearly strong consensus for that opinion.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the extent of the problem is so great that families and voluntary organisations alone simply do not have the capacity or the resources to deal with the problem and the level of handicap suffered by some people is just so severe that institutional care will always be required.  Of course, the cost involved in caring for the handicapped and ensuring that they receive the treatment they need is enormous and requires substantial central funding; the core funding must come from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>As any parent can confirm, bringing up children is a demanding task even when one's children enjoy the full bloom of good health.  When a child suffers from a handicap, either mental or physical, the task and the commitment required are altogether more daunting.  For most of us the responsibility and commitment required ends when our children grow up, leave the family home and start to <Col N="1167" /> earn their own living.  For parents of many of the handicapped, however, the responsibility, worry and financial and emotional commitment required go on and on until they or their children go to the grave.</P>
    <P>As an understanding of mental illness and mental handicap has improved we have, thankfully, moved away from the 19th century attitude that viewed people with mental handicap as a public threat and who should be locked up.  In recent years the trend has been to move away from institutional care where possible and practicable and towards the provision of care in the community.  The Green Paper on Services for Disabled People: Towards a Full Life, published in 1984, described the broad objective of services for those with physical, mental or sensorial handicap as being &ldquo;to equip them to realise their full potential and to participate to the greatest extent possible in the life of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A document published by the Eastern Health Board in 1986, Specialist Services for the Mentally Handicapped, put it this way:</P>
    <P>A handicapped person should develop in an environment as normal as is practicable.  In this regard it is appropriate that the mentally handicapped person should be maintained in his home as long as is possible, with appropriate support services and that facilities as near as possible to the domestic environment are available when the handicapped person can no longer be maintained at home.</P>
    <P>It is in regard to persons who can no longer be maintained at home that the main difficulties arise.  There are simply not enough places available to meet the demand.  The Government's own report published last year, Needs and Abilities: A Policy for the Intellectually Disabled &mdash; Report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services, estimated that there was a need for 600 residential places and 1,000 day places for people with mental handicap to meet a backlog of urgent need for services for those with <Col N="1168" /> none.  It suggested that growing numbers would mean that an extra 40 residential places and 200 day places would be needed every year for the next five years to cope with emerging needs.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the response of successive Governments in the crisis has been totally inadequate.  For example, the cutback in the eighties came at a time when continued growth was necessary to avoid a disastrous build-up in waiting lists.  Instead of expansion of services there were cutbacks, which is the basic cause of the terrible position in which many parents now find themselves. &ldquo;Health Cuts do Hurt the Handicapped&rdquo; a poster produced today by the parents Association of People with Mental Handicap sets out the scale of the financial commitment required to deal with the crisis.  They are seeking a commitment over the next five years of extra capital expenditure of £22.5 million and a phased increase in current spending to reach an extra £27.5 million annually on the mental handicap services.  Of course, these are substantial sums of money but the level of need is so great on the part of the handicapped themselves and of their parents that the expenditure of such money is not alone justified but essential.</P>
    <P>We are happy to support the Fine Gael motion.  The Labour Party addendum is also commendable and worthy of support. The Government amendment is a totally inadequate response and takes no account of the urgency of the overall position.  The commitments given in <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the review of the Programme for Government are vague and unspecific.  Parents of the handicapped have wisely learned from previous experience that promises not backed up by firm commitments of cash are of little value.  We regularly hear the Government pay lip service to the principle of providing community care for the handicapped. That is often advanced as an excuse for not developing institutional care.  Institutional care is being starved of resources and the community care services are not being developed to compensate for that.  We must support the <Col N="1169" /> concept that the provision of adequate support services for those with handicaps, and those who look after them, is not a charity but a right.  They are not asking for any favours but simply that their particular and unique needs as citizens be met.</P>
    <P>In that context I particularly welcome the call of PAM in their document published today calling for the introduction of a charter of rights for those with mental handicaps which would guarantee to every person born with a handicap that appropriate services will be available as and when needed.  These should include a right to early assessment and a place in an appropriate school or centre for every child with a mental handicap, a right to a day care or training place on leaving school, a right to employment or a day care place on leaving training, a guarantee of a suitable long term residential place as soon as needed in a group home, foster care or special centre, as appropriate; and services for people with a handicap should be structured around consumers' needs, respecting the dignity of every individual.</P>
    <P>If the Minister or other members of the Cabinet were unaware of the extent of the problem confronting the handicapped and their families they cannot claim that in the light of this debate.  The obligation is now clearly on the Government to act quickly and decisively.  I have no doubt that, if they do so, they will have the support of every Member of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into any great detail because most points have already been covered about the plight of people with a physical or mental handicap and their carers, since, very often, people must care for those suffering from both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Were it not for groups like PAM, the Walkinstown Association for Handicapped People or the Action for Mobility campaign, very many politicians would not be conscious of the terribly inadequate resources available in this area.  It is fair to say that the shocking reality of the types of lives led by people caring for <Col N="1170" /> the disabled are highlighted for many politicians only when they have seen, spoken to and been lobbied by those campaigning for a better deal for the disabled and their carers.</P>
    <P>As a recently elected member of the Eastern Health Board I have been exposed for the first time to the plight of handicapped men, women and children who are being cared for, ranging from the mildly handicapped to the profoundly physically and mentally handicapped. For example, I visited St. Raphael's in Celbridge run by the Brothers of St. John of God.  One can say, without fear of contradiction, that the staff building, equipment and training workshops there are good as can be found anywhere worldwide.  Meeting the staff of the Eastern Health Board, people like Mr. Harmon and Mr. Walsh, the programme manager for the special hospital care programme and familiarising ourselves with their work, dedication and sincerity, we become aware there are caring bureaucrats. In addition, reading the report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services, <i>Needs and Abilities,</i> we realise there are people who know how to go about solving the problem.  However, the sad reality for those of us who are getting to know and understand the services is that, for every child or adult in St. Raphael's, there are 10 or 20 more seeking admission, that even taking into account the energies of the officials of the Eastern Health Board, their dedication and sincerity, they cannot provide the requisite service without adequate funding. Bearing in mind the good intent of the report to which I have just referred, without political goodwill and determination coupled with a plan to implement the recommendations of that report, no progress can be made.</P>
    <P>Sadly, people like Brother Leo Clancy of the Order of St. John of God, Sr. Angela Magee, Mr. John O'Gorman of NAMMI, Br. Aloysius Shannon of St. Raphael's House and officials like Mr. Michael Walsh of the Eastern Health Board, all of these professionals at the coalface who speak with dependants <Col N="1171" /> daily, with desperate and distraught parents, are slowly but surely moving away from a position of agonising in quiet desperation over the inadequacies of the service to one of unrestrained anger, frustration and fear for and on behalf of the people with disabilities and their carers.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to reject their legitimate demands but to begin a planned implementation of the recommendations of that review group report.</P>
    <P>I want to give the remainder of my time to Deputy McCartan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Sherlock, spokesperson for The Workers' Party in this area, for allowing me a few moments to contribute to what is an important debate, taking place at a time of year when we should all be smitten with a sense of charity and fair play. However, I fully agree with the campaign of the Parents Association of People with Mental Handicap on two points: first, that they are not seeking charity but their rights, which have been fully identified in the recently published report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services, <i>Needs and Abilities,</i> that had been with Government for over a year before being published because of the condemnation, by implication, written into their findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other aspect on which I agree with the parents of the mentally handicapped is that they have no embarrassment or hesitation about the name they ascribe to their loved ones, namely, the mentally handicapped.  I do not see why anybody in this House should question the use of that term in any debate other than perhaps to create a framework within which one can establish a concern above and beyond that of all the Members of this House at the problem we are endeavouring to address.  Therefore, like the report referring to the mentally handicapped and the Minister's amendment to the motion before the House, I have no difficulty referring to the people on whose behalf I make this short contribution as the mentally handicapped, <Col N="1172" /> those who probably more than anyone in this society are looking to this House this evening for a lead and some hope.</P>
    <P>I commend the Fine Gael Party, and Deputy Richard Bruton in particular, on tabling what is a timely and reasonably-worded motion, seeking no more than a five-year planned response to the findings and recommendations of the Government-commissioned report referred to time and again by other speakers.  What can be wrong with such a proposition?  I can see no difficulty in supporting it and The Workers' Party will be doing so.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in her new portfolio and I hope that the aspiration she expressed in regard to the development of services for the mentally handicapped will be carried through to the full. If the Minister was responsible for the drafting of the Government amendment to the motion, I am a little worried.  The Government amendment looks to that very dubious document, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> as the basis of a commitment to providing services adequate to meet the needs of the mentally handicapped.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is in tatters and amounts to no more than aspirations.  I appreciate that the Minister did not have a direct input in regard to the health area but if this amendment is the best the Government can do in meeting a reasoned proposition by the Opposition, I am dismayed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's intention to introduce a programme of genetic advice services for parents who may already have a mentally handicapped child or a person within either or both families suffering from a mental disability.  I would ask the Minister to put the house before the cart to provide us with a reasonable system of family planning legislation before beginning to talk about advice services for any sector of the community, least of all the mentally handicapped. Having given education and advice, I wonder how the Minister would hope to equip a large number of people to go out into the Community and make <Col N="1173" /> use of that advice and education.  The Government seem to be in a quandary.</P>
    <P>I represent a Dublin constitutency and I wish to address in particular the problems in the Dublin area as highlighted to me by parents of the mentally handicapped. We have the single greatest concentration of population in the country and likewise the single greatest concentration of parents who have to deal with the problems of mental handicap in the absence of the requisite services.  Is the Minister aware that possibly 700 places are currently required to accommodate people with mental handicap who need residential placement?  Does she accept that figure for the Dublin region?  I should like to hear her response so that we would know whether the Department are aware of the extent of the problem.  The Minister's predecessor had a very much more provincial view. Whenever one argued the cause of the greatest centre of population, he seemed to have little or no concept of or regard for those problems.  There is a need for 534 day care units within the EHB Dublin region alone.</P>
    <P>On the north side of Dublin, which I consider to be the blackest of the national black spots, there is an urgent need for speech therapy services.  There are two speech therapists at St. Michael's in Ballymun, covering the entire north Dublin area as far as Balbriggan.  One other speech therapist at St. Mary's is employed by the Mater Hospital.  Two public speech therapists and one private speech therapist are required to cover the entire area.  The result is that nobody gets adequate speech therapy.  Nobody needs to be told how this impacts on parents and their children who have a major difficulty in speech communication.  It is a harrowing experience to visit homes, as many of us do in the course of our work, and see parents literally imprisoned because of their love and care for their children.  They are obliged to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  There is not adequate community support to give a respite on a weekly or monthly basis to allow them a break.  Such services <Col N="1174" /> do not exist in the north Dublin region for a vast number of parents.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to look into the domiciliary care allowance which amounts to £85 or £86 per week to parents supporting at home children suffering from disability, including mental disability.  All those cases are being systematically assessed and re-assessed by the Department.  There seems to be a vindictive, penny-pinching attitude towards people who have problems enough without enduring prying investigating officials trying to cook the books and make the picture somewhat better. The Minister should investigate this as a matter of urgency and as a practical response to the problems being aired in this House.</P>
    <P>The motion asks the Government to respond in a concrete and planned way over five years by implementing a most pressing programme of work.  The question has been raised as to how the funding can be obtained.  It is very difficult for people who have these problems to look at the excesses of expenditure in the aggrandisement of a Government.  They can spend millions in improving offices for the Taoiseach and Ministers and then find that so little can be made available to meet the recommendations made in a Government-commissioned report.  It is time to bring before the House concrete proposals to meet the Government's commitments.  It should be a matter of priority.  There would not be criticism from any quarter if the Government were to act as called upon in this motion, having been informed by the report completed by experts in this area.  If there cannot be an acceptance of the motion or of the Labour Party addendum, I call on the Minister to signal that the Government accept the spirit of the motion and intend to act urgently.</P>

      <P>I have listened with interest to the various speakers and I have read the motion, the amendment and the addendum put down tonight by the Labour Party.  I have met people of all political persuasions and people involved in the provision of services for persons <Col N="1175" /> with a disability.  Most Members who met those people with me on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis are present in the House tonight.  This is an indication of their commitment to try to upgrade, enhance and provide a better service for people with a handicap.</P>
      <P>I have an indepth knowledge of the workings of the Eastern Health Board.  I am Chairman of the Eastern Health Board and I was involved in the special hospital care programme run by the health board.  I can honestly say that the Eastern Health Board have made major strides over the past five or six years in the provision of services for people with a handicap.  Of course, I can only speak for the Eastern Health Board.  However, having met with the parent associations, Members of this House and others on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis I am more aware of the need to improve the services provided not alone by the Eastern Health Board but also by the other seven health boards.</P>
      <P>I know &mdash; I was somewhat surprised at the comments made by the previous speaker in this respect &mdash; that the people who care for those with a handicap believe that this issue should not be politicised. Public representatives have heard this at public meetings.  Even more importantly, the people we have met do not want to hear that language.  I have not spoken to them but &mdash; I say this with respect to the Labour Party &mdash; it is my belief they do not want a motion or an amendment to it.  They would prefer if there was no motion or amendment before the House.  I know they would like to see the provision of a proper and adequate service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the policy document launched today by the PAM association.  Deputy Ferris referred to the message given to the political representatives who attended the launching of that document, that they do not want this issue politicised.  They do not want this issue to be addressed tomorrow. Deputy McCartan stressed the need to provide money for buildings and mentioned a figure of £500 million.  These people do not want to hear that type of language.  Even though they know it will <Col N="1176" /> not be achieved in 12, 24, 36 or even 48 months they want a policy.</P>

      <P>It is not just a matter of finance.

This House would be better off if it withdrew the motion and the amendment instead of putting them to a vote.  We have made some progress in this area and if we implemented some of the recommendations contained in the report of the review group on mental handicap services, <i>Needs and Abilities,</i> over the next number of years the people from whom we have received correspondence would be very happy.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank my colleague, Deputy Bruton, for giving me five minutes of his time.  I should like to commend him for tabling this motion and on the policy document launched this week.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  While I was very pleased at the detail of her speech I was disappointed at the lack of practical action contained in it.  We need a breath of fresh air in this area and I trust the Minister will be the one to bring this about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> I listened to the speech of the Minister of State last night and to say that it was tired and much used material would be complimentary.  He seemed to hope that this problem would yet again disappear and that the subject of this motion would go away.  This problem will not go away and the sooner the Minister, and the Government, take the needs of the handicapped and their carers seriously the better.</P>
    <P>For years these people have been paid lip service by various Governments mainly because they were part of the hidden silent Ireland.  Handicapped people had no voice and their parents and carers were so exhausted and stressed that they did not have any energy to mount the kind of political campaign they now seem to be able to put together. Under our parliamentary system they were treated as a low priority and were not regarded as deserving of any special treatment.  An army of voluntary workers, members of religious orders and women, mothers in the home, gave up their lives to care for our handicapped population.  We are talking about people with severe and profound handicaps who require 24 hours a day, seven days a week care and nursing.  This care is not required only for children.  It is also required for adults up to 35 years of age who may weigh 10 stone or 12 stone or heavier.  The burden of responsibility borne by such families is a disgrace in any civilised society, and, particularly, in a society which supports and voted overwhelmingly for a pro-life environment.</P>
    <P>This means in practice that a higher proportion of children born here will have a congenital handicap than children born in other countries where pregnant women can undergo amniocentesis tests to identify whether there are any abnormalities, where there is proper genetic counselling and where abortion is available. We have to be consistent and follow through on the electorate's expressions of value for human life.  It is wrong that a minority of relatives should have to carry the burden of care for those who are physically and mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in the debate <Col N="1178" /> to statistics, the cold hard realities of need such as the need for 200 residential places and 400 day care places and that fact that 1,500 people have been wrongly placed in psychiatric institutions.  Today at the launch of the PAM policy document, Health Cuts Do Hurt the Handicapped, held in the Mansion House, we heard the human side of the statistics when the mother of a seven year old handicapped girl gave us details from her diary for the past year.  This was a chronicle of desperation, constant nursing, visits to emergency out-patient departments, wakeful nights and constant screaming for three weeks.</P>
    <P>It is time this problem was articulated in the House and that everyone here shared the responsibility for past neglect and the duty to take realistic action.  It would be better if the Government did not have to be shamed into action. Members on this side of the House will pursue this issue to a proper resolution. We have had sufficient studies and reports; we now need action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be said that the services are not there to match the needs of those persons for whom the Minister has expressed sympathy.  We heard today about how a carer was strained beyond breaking point and could no longer cope and how there was no service to accommodate her child.  Contrary to what Deputy Callely said, people who care for people with a handicap are angry, bitter and frustrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contributions we had last night from the Minister of State was extremely <Col N="1179" /> poor.  There was little preparation undertaken by the Department and the Minister of State for this debate.  We heard repeated last night what we had heard a thousand times before about developments in the services.  The Minister went back to the foundation of the State to talk about how services had improved. Bright eyed and bushy tailed he came in here and recited the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> document and quoted at length from it and from the <i>Needs and Abilities</i> document and expected us to accept those as tokens of the goodwill of the Government.  He did not mention that the Government reneged on the commitments in both the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the <i>Needs and Abilities</i> document immediately on their publication.</P>
    <P>In 1991 only one-quarter of the residential places required as outlined in that document, were provided by Government. None of the 450 day places, indicated as required, was provided.  He had the gall last night to boast of a £2 million allocation in 1990 and a £1 million allocation in 1991 from the national lottery. There was no mention of the fact that the national lottery itself had siphoned off £50 million from the resources of voluntary agencies providing assistance for those with disability.  There was no mention either of the fact that the minimum requirement set out in those documents, on the recommendation of their own officials and advisers, was £30 million if we were to meet our responsibilities to existing policy commitments in that area. We heard a very tired recital of what we have heard a thousand times before.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed tonight that the Minister did not make the sort of break I had hoped for.  The Minister seems unaware of the extent of the crisis in the services for people with a disability, unaware of the deterioration in the last few years in the Eastern Health Board area &mdash; of which Deputy Callely speaks so highly &mdash; where the waiting lists for residential places have doubled.  There are twice as many people now waiting for <Col N="1180" /> residential places than there were in 1989 when the <i>Needs and Abilities</i> document was drawn up.  The same is true, as Deputy McCartan cited, of day centre places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a far better placement record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear expressions of concern from the Minister tonight but those expressions of concern were heard from her predecessor as well but he came back and produced budgets that did not match those concerns.  The Minister will be judged not by the expressions of concern, which are deeply meant, but by her actions and her willingness to confront this issue in a meaningful way.  As Deputy McCartan said, we do not get great hope from the amendment in the name of the Minister of State. She again cited the joint Programme for Government of the two parties.  In 1989 the programme made no mention whatsoever of the needs of persons with a disability.  The review of that document in 1991 made one single mention of the needs of persons with a disability and that was the need for day centres.</P>
      <P>That is not a commitment to the <i>Needs and Abilities</i> document which has been on the Minister's desk and that of her predecessor since July 1990.  The review of Government carried out a couple of weeks ago did not recognise that document and did not mention a commitment to honouring it.  As the Minister is aware, her predecessor indicated, as soon as the document was published, that he would not honour its five-year programme, that he would push out to 1999 the date on which he would hope to achieve some of those commitments and not 1994 as was suggested in the document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister in her contribution made no mention of the needs of persons with a physical handicap. It was as if the motion was solely devoted to the needs of persons with an intellectual disability.  That is not the case, there are large scale unmet needs <Col N="1181" /> of persons with a physical handicap also. There are 300 persons with a physical handicap who are in urgent need of placement.  They are the realities, and the needs of persons with both physical and intellectual disabilities must be confronted in a coherent plan.</P>
    <P>A coherent plan must have three crucial elements which we have not seen up to now: it must have a clear commitment to the funding which has never been honoured; it must have a legislative basis, a legislative charter for people with a disability.  As we have said repeatedly on this side of the House, we are talking about people's rights &mdash; not chance occurrences that a vacancy would come and that one might get a suitable place &mdash; that must be underpinned legally in a charter.  We are talking also about the need for a coherent framework.  As Deputy McDaid rightly pointed out, we have services scattered throughout six or seven Departments, supposedly providing service for people with a disability. There is no framework within which we can know that the needs of those persons are being met as they go through life. That is why Fine Gael and the Labour Party believe it is so important to have a Minister with overriding responsibility stretching across those different Departments to provide that coherent response. The time has long passed when persons with a disability will accept a token sum from the lottery in next year's budget as a measure of the commitment and the response to the crisis today.</P>
    <P>The demands that have been laid before Government on behalf of persons with a disability &mdash; demands for education for their children, for therapy when it can ease a disability, for a break from the task of caring, for placement when the task of caring is no longer bearable, for access to public buildings, for a chance to ride on our public transport, for financial support commensurate with the extra costs to be borne by carers, for an end to discrimination which is so <Col N="1182" /> rampant for persons with a disability &mdash; are all demands for basic rights and are not for discretionary extras.  It is not acceptable that it be left to the vagaries of the lottery to provide the funds to underpin a five-year coherent plan for the needs of persons with a disability. The only response that can be accepted from this Government is a clear commitment to a five-year programme to deal with this problem.  It is sad that we are not getting that commitment from the new Minister tonight.</P>
    <P>We now have on the table renegotiation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> but let no one here forget that the Government reneged on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commitment to persons with a disability within seven days of its signing. When we came into the House seven days after the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was signed and listened to the Budget Statement read out by the Minister we discovered that £90 million which was to go to the development of community services was not to be provided in 1991.  There was not even to be a first start in 1991; we saw instead in the budget provision a reduction of £10 million for community services for elderly persons with a disability.  Persons with a disability had their hopes dashed 12 months ago and do not have to be told about renegotiating those terms.  It will not be accepted in this House if that happens again.  We believe it is important that people with a disability must be included as equal social partners in the negotiation of programmes, social and economic, for this country &mdash; partners who participate in a coherent plan to meet their needs, partners whose rights are underpinned in a charter and enshrined in law, partners who get first call on available moneys, not the crumbs that fall from the table, when the stronger groups have finished.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are concerned about the manner in which this sale was brought before the House.  It was obviously done in a great hurry.  Those of us who have been watching the proceedings here during the past few weeks will readily recognise that the legislative programme was suddenly changed about a week ago. We were led to believe that the reason for this change was that we had to have a discussion on European union and so on.  It appeared however that something had happened or was about to happen which led to this legislation being brought forward at this time.  There are one or two points that I would like to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one is to be successful in buying out a company one needs the goodwill of the staff.  I put it to the Minister that this goodwill will not be forthcoming because of the manner in which both he and his Department have gone about, hurriedly, unceremoniously, selling the company in the week before Christmas in the knowledge that this would be a source of concern to the staff and Members of this <Col N="1192" /> House and that uncertainty would be created in the marketplace.  Given its vital role, the Minister should have taken some considerable time to consider the implications of a decision to transfer ownership of this major company to another group bearing in mind the processes that have to be gone through in the ordinary course of events.  Having regard to the fact that this company would face stiff competition the Minister should have ensured the necessary structures would be in place so that the measures being taken would last for many a long day.</P>
    <P>In this instance, a relatively small company are taking over another company of similar size.  I am exaggerating slightly but in any buy-out situation, one would not expect a company to take over another company of even half its size as that would be a big undertaking and involve a big financial commitment, while many difficulties could rise in the future.  I note Members on the opposite side of the House are shaking their heads and that is not at all unusual but I should say that the sale has been handled in a very amateurish way.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister was asked quite a number of questions and that he asked a number of questions to which I hope he received the answers.  If this sale goes through, will problems be encountered and questions be asked at a later stage, for example, in relation to any liabilities hanging over the company at present? What is the position in relation to any outstanding liabilities or claims against the B &amp; I?  Who will have to carry the can and accept responsibility for these &mdash; the Minister, the Government or the taxpayer?  Will the company, which will be either strengthened or weakened as a result of this buy-out have to accept responsibility?  I should like the Minister to answer these questions tonight because it may have implications later on and it would be an advantage to Members of the House, when the time comes to vote, if we had that information.  I emphasise the importance of that question which I hope the Minister will answer because it could have serious <Col N="1193" /> consequences, depending on how it is answered.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I wish to refer is the Minister's failure to exercise the golden share option available to him and which should be an obvious choice. This provision was put in place for a purpose, to ensure that the Minister would have some control over what is likely to happen in future.  For example, the new company could be taken over by somebody else; the Minister and the House may have no control over it; maybe in the not too distant future we could have serious difficulties and we might have to go back over the ground which the Government covered in the sixties when the B &amp; I were bought.</P>
    <P>Another point which has caused concern on this side of the House, and of which the Minister has been made aware by Opposition Members, is the pension fund.  There has already been a reference in the House to security and guarantees so far as pension funds are concerned.  It was said that when this Bill is enacted there should be no threat to the contributors. However, that is not the case because, despite the best efforts of the Minister and the person charged with responsibility for overseeing and supervising pension funds, it is virtually impossible to monitor the activities of all the companies to ensure that the rights of the contributors are guaranteed.  That was confirmed to me in this House by the Minister for Social Welfare a few weeks ago in a reply to a parliamentary question. Furthermore, the difficulties in relation to the security of pension funds in other countries not far away, especially one which has arisen in the past couple of weeks, should further underline our concern at any transfer from one company to another of pension funds, which appears to be the case in this sale.</P>
    <P>A substantial pension fund is obviously an added attraction to the buyer.  In any situation there should always be considerable discussion, investigation and analysis of the company buying but particularly when taking over a company with a relatively healthy pension fund.  I <Col N="1194" /> know that quite a number of other speakers wish to contribute to the debate but I have another few questions to ask the Minister.</P>
    <P>With the exception of air transport, sea transport is the only method by which people here can travel abroad or by which foreigners can visit this country.  Deputy Dennehy referred to the importance of the various corridors and of course he was speaking with a certain bias towards his native county, which is understandable. However, Members who represent midlands constituencies also have a slight bias; while there are very few harbours in Kildare, with the exception of the canal harbours, I assure the House that quite a number of business people need ready access to ports and shipping routes which are efficient, have a fast roll-on roll-off service and so on.  With that in mind, Dublin port about a year ago brought a number of public representatives from my constituency to a meeting to point out the importance of those routes.  It is no harm to reflect on the fact that although midland constituencies are not maritime counties they still have a vested interest in an efficient shipping service.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister met the board of the B &amp; I yesterday morning and that a number of questions were put to him, which I hope he answered.  If he did not I hope he will answer them in the House tonight because Final Gael are very concerned to know whether the Minister was given all the necessary information and guarantees.  Has he covered and investigated all the options available to him?  For instance, did the Minister consider the options, apart from the immediate sale, which would give a better return to the Exchequer?  That was referred to by a number of speakers in the House yesterday evening and tonight. The Minister knows these options and the work done by the staff-management committee who are interested in a particular proposal and who have done considerable work in that regard.  They gave the Minister information which was very beneficial to him and to anyone thinking <Col N="1195" /> of buying a company, with particular reference to the B &amp; I.  I listened with interest to the Minister's speech yesterday but I did not hear confirmation in this regard.  Did the Minister go through the process of looking for the various competitive bids that might have been available to him?  Did he make relevant inquiries?  Where were those inquiries made?  Were the staff and management of the existing company aware of the inquiries and from where bids were being sought?  How many companies or interested parties from outside were aware of the Minister's anxiety to obtain information in relation to such bids?</P>
    <P>Has the disappointment at the manner in which this sale has been brought forward at an unusual speed been conveyed to the Minister?  Did he provide for discussions through the board and their independent committee which could have contributed to the process leading to decisions?  In other words, did the Minister use the facilities available to him and to B &amp; I to investigate and evaluate all the options, with particular reference to the need to ensure that the staff of the company being sold were aware of what was happening, that he had their confidence and that they had his?  Is the Minister aware of the widespread disappointment and anger at every level throughout the board, staff and management at the manner in which the decision was made and announced?  Is the Minister fully aware of the hurt and frustration of the existing board and management at the way he rushed this Bill through the House to sell their company, having regard to the work which the members of the board and the staff in general put into the various proposals which were laid before the Minister over the last few weeks?</P>
    <P>Did the Minister consider all the implications of bringing the matter into the House in this fashion?</P>
    <P>Did he seek assurances or was he given any assurances or guarantees that there was adequate protection against the reintroduction to B &amp; I by the new owners of practices unacceptable to the unions? <Col N="1196" /> I understand that the implications were conveyed to the Minister.  There is a possibility of difficulties in that area.  The Minister should give careful consideration to this and should reply to these questions as a matter of urgency tonight.  Did the Minister give any assurances in respect of the protection of the rights of individual staff members and of staff participation opportunities?  Was the Minister aware of the willingness of the existing staff to participate in the event of a buy-out?  Is he prepared to allow similar participation as regards the proposal before the House?  Has he been given any assurances about the involvement of existing staff in the new company and the protection of their rights?  Are there any proposals in relation to the long term prospects for the existing staff of B &amp; I?</P>
    <P>We believe that the Minister did not receive any assurances in this regard. That is an indication that the legislation was brought before the House in an unrealistic and hurried way, and rushed legislation is never good legislation.  I have just heard that agreement has been reached between the Whips and, that being the case, I will bring my contribution to a close as soon as possible. However, I wish to make one or two brief points before I conclude.  I would again ask the Minister to reply in detail to the questions asked.  I asked whether he was given any assurances or whether assurances have been sought in respect of the existing staff and whether the Irish Continental Group have given an indication of their willingness to accept the suggestions made by the Minister or through him by the existing staff of B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>I would like to know why this legislation is being rushed through the House. Why could the Minister not have waited until further investigations had taken place?  Why, in a matter of such magnitude, did the Minister not wait until after Christmas to introduce the legislation when more time would have been available to debate it and it would not have to be rushed through the House?</P>
    <P>I would like to know whether anybody raised with the Minister the question of <Col N="1197" /> holding an annual general meeting. When was the last annual general meeting of B &amp; I held or when should such a meeting be held?  Should it have taken place recently or should it have taken place on 25 July?  Is a meeting due now or is it overdue?  Are there implications in relation to the Companies Act, 1963, due to a failure to hold an annual general meeting within a specific period of time? All these questions need to be answered. I would like to have dealt with other issues but due to the number of speakers who wish to contribute to this important legislation I will conclude.  I would ask the Minister to please address in detail the various points raised because the replies to those questions are eagerly awaited, especially by this side of the House.</P>

      <P>The B &amp; I headquarters are in my constituency of Dublin Central and I am delighted that many of the staff of that company as well as of the Irish Continental Group are constituents of mine, although none of them holds a managerial or an officer position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nub of this matter is that the Minister's proposed Bill on the B &amp; I is the only acceptable proposal put forward. Discussions have taken place throughout today and yesterday on Ireland's need for native owned and native crewed shipping lines.  Great play has been made of access corridors to the EC.  Deputies spoke about the southern corridor, the central corridor and so on.  At present the <Col N="1199" /> Government cannot get money for floating assets.  I hope that as a result of the Maastricht Summit and with a review of Structural Funds, the Irish Government will get support for floating assets such as ferryboats, ships and so on.  Access to France and England is essential.  Unfortunately, the road and rail routes from Holyhead to London are not of a sufficiently high standard that we would benefit fully from them.  I hope that the British Government will press for Structural Funds to develop these routes.</P>
    <P>A former Secretary of the Department of Transport and Power, the late Dr. Theckla Beere, had a major say in buying B &amp; I in 1965 on the Government's instructions.  She was a lady of outstanding ability but, to my knowledge, she does not feature prominently in the feminist canon but perhaps in later years this will be redressed.  She was an outstanding lady in the history of the Civil Service and of transport and management.</P>
    <P>The problems facing the Minister were many and varied but, in the end, they boiled down to money and providing a good transport service to Ireland.  Since the Government took over the B &amp; I in 1965, £106 million of taxpayer's money has been injected into the company. When one considers that a new ferry costs in the region of £60 million one can see the scale of the problems facing the owners of the company.</P>

      <P>If the Government are taking over debts of £30 million and a new ferry costs in the region of £60 million, one can see the scale of the problems facing any company taking over the B &amp; I Line, whether the company are run by ICG, by a staff management consortium or even by the trade unions.  The problems will not go away.</P>
      <P>The major problem I had with the staff-management buy-out offer was the proposed use of the company's pension fund for severance payments and working capital.  That money would come from the future pensions of people who are not endowed with many worldly goods. In my area, the wives of the workers and the workers, were very anxious about this fund.  I have had representations made to me about the use of the pension fund. One cannot play lotto with someone else's money.  Going into the shipping business, no matter how one looks at it, is a gamble.  It is a cyclical business; there are good years, and bad years.  The B &amp; I have experienced mainly bad years since the early fifties.  On the other hand, the Irish Continental Group have managed to turn their company around and have gone from a nett debt of £19 million in 1983 to a nett cash surplus of £9.5 million in 1991.  This Irish owned company appear to have the ability to manage.  We should support them and wish them luck in their buy-out of B &amp; I.  Having read through the offers that were made, their offer was the best and we should accept it.</P>
      <P>I take the opportunity to wish the staff, the future staff and management of B &amp; I the best of luck; they are going to need it.  There will be a great deal of hard work involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take the opportunity to thank my good colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick, for allowing me a few minutes of his time, although I have to say I am not on the same side as he anticipated in his earlier remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put on record my absolute <Col N="1201" /> opposition to the sell-off of B &amp; I Line to ICG.  I am opposed both to the principle of privatisation of the B &amp; I company and also to the unseemly haste with which the decision was taken and the equally unseemly haste with which the Bill is being rushed through the House tonight.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have shown little more than contempt for the aspirations of workers and management of B &amp; I.  They do not deserve this contempt.  Many of the workers are constituents of mine and, as a result of the Government's action, they now face a most uncertain future.  There will be at least 250 compulsory redundancies as part and parcel of the Minister's deal with ICG.  This effect of privatisation demonstrates yet again that it is the small group of greedy profiteers who benefit most and the decent hard-working employees suffer most.  For the workers and their families this is a most unjust decision and one can easily understand their sense of outrage.</P>
    <P>The most striking aspect of the whole affair is undoubtedly the unseemly haste with which it was pushed through, so much so that the modified staff-management buy-out proposal was given little more than a cursory glance by the Minister. A few hours after the modified proposal was presented to him he rejected it.  No reasonable or worthwhile consideration could have been given to the proposal in the short time.  It seems to me that workers and management were used as a pawn in the Minister's game. What is most surprising about this is the fact that the same staff and management were responsible for transforming B &amp; I from a loss making concern with an operating loss of £3.5 million in 1987 to a profit of £2.5 million this year and a projected profit of £4 million for 1992. That transformation was the result of a five year rescue plan involving a major reduction in the workforce; a three year pay freeze and a pay cut of 5 per cent. The workers, by their commitment, dedication and self-sacrifice, achieved this remarkable success which should, in all fairness, have paved the way for staff <Col N="1202" /> and management taking control of the company.  Having saved the company it was then hi-jacked by the Minister and handed over to those who have no commitment or motivation to anything other than self advancement, profit and corporate greed.  That certainly must be a terrible travesty of justice.  Little wonder that the workers, management and the boards are expressing their anger and resentment at the very harsh treatment they have received.</P>
    <P>It is no coincidence that the sell off is being rushed through at this time in view of the very likely event that increased moneys from the Structural Fund will be ear-marked for shipping transport following the Maastricht agreement.  In this context the ICG's investment of £8 million in a company estimated to be worth more than £20 million must be seen as easy pickings for the profiteers.  There was, of course, no satisfactory answer to explain the rejection of the staff-management buy-out proposal.  The withdrawal of the Danish company was used as an excuse to question the viability of their plan, yet it was conveniently forgotten that AIB Corporate Finance were prepared to back their bid without the Danish involvement.  Clearly, the Minister never intended to take the staff-managmement buy-out bid seriously.</P>
    <P>The Government are not noted for their concern and solidarity with workers anywhere.  I am confident that the workers will remember this when the approaching general election takes place.</P>
    <P>I have one final question to ask, and it is a question I put particularly to the trade unions.  Where does the deal leave the commitments given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>?  What about the commitment that any changes in the ownership structure of State companies would take place only if it was in the public interest and in the best interests of the company and its employees and following consultations with the social partners?  What consultation has there been with the social partners?  In particular, what consultation has there been with the trade union movement?  The lesson, at least as <Col N="1203" /> far as workers are concerned, must be that the Government cannot be trusted and their commitments are worthless.</P>
    <P>I will finish by paying tribute to the workers, management and trade union representatives of B &amp; I, who struggled so hard for something that I believe was their right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to record the Labour Party's opposition to the proposed sale and privatisation of B &amp; I.  I believe that the workers of B &amp; I have been sold down the river by the Government under this Bill.  On Thursday afternoon when I listened to the Minister speaking at Question Time I heard that it had been decided to sell off B &amp; I to Irish Continental Group.  At that stage I stated that I felt that the Minister had effectively stuck a knife into the back of the management and staff of the company. Having listened very attentively to the Minister's contribution yesterday and having read through the contribution on several occasions, I am more convinced than ever that the staff/management buy-out proposed was never &mdash; as a constituen colleague of mine has said several times &mdash; on a level playing pitch and that the proposal, originally initiated by the Minister himself, or, indeed, by his Department, was in the main for the purpose of putting additional pressure on Irish Continental Group and thus increasing their offer.  Surely there is a message in that when one considers that the current bid shows an increase of £2 million in a number of months.  I know that many of the public are taking that message on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure of the Minister to go down the road of the MSBO will prove to be a monumental national disaster.  The Minister had a unique opportunity to try something different, an opportunity that <Col N="1204" /> was particularly valuable when one considers the economic climate with nearly 300,000 people unemployed.  The Minister had unique opportunity to try something new, something that promised an alternative to redundancy.</P>
    <P>The buy-out proposal would have brought together the expertise and skills of an experienced and committed workforce that had secured the support of AIB Corporate Finance.  I know that earlier the Minister shook his head when the same comment was made, but when the Minister responds I should like him to speak in detail about the commitment of AIB, on the withdrawal of the Danish consortium, to go ahead and give full financial support to that venture.  Was that not a major vote of confidence in the proposal by a financial institution, particularly given the natural aversion of financial institutions to risk taking?  Is it not a pity that the Minister did not have the same confidence in the workforce and their proposal, given the expertise of the personnel in B &amp; I and what they have done in recent years?</P>
    <P>In the past three years of the plan B &amp; I changed a deficit position into a £2.4 million profit.  The number of passengers carried increased from 839,000 to well over one million in that three year period.  I could go on in detail about the achievements of the staff and management of B &amp; I in bringing about the improvement.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the only way to establish the best value for any company is to seek competitive bids. However, when comparing the two bids for the company &mdash; £8.5 million versus £5 million &mdash; the Minister should have taken into consideration the total net benefit to the Exchequer.  If that were done then deductions should have been made from the ICG bid to take account of at least 100 additional redundancies.  In 1993 the knock-on effect of redundancy would result in £900,000 in lost income tax and PRSI contributions plus additional social welfare contributions. In 1994 and following years £600,000 per annum would go on social welfare payments and entitlements to other State <Col N="1205" /> benefits.  Therefore, the apparent £3 million difference between the two bids would disappear after five years.  The Minister might put forward the view that the additional 100 workers made redundant would not necessarily remain on the dole.  As a Dublin TD and in the light of a live register of nearly 300,000 and the present lack of employment opportunities in Dublin, he would be a foolish man to make such a claim.</P>
    <P>The present Coalition Government and the previous Fianna Fáil Government have tended to take on board the Thatcherite philosophies of the British Government in the areas of health and social welfare and, indeed, right across the board.  I do not lightly give Margaret Thatcher praise, but is the Minister not aware that even she approved the decision of the management and staff to purchase the National Freight Corporation in the United Kingdom several years ago?  I understand that at that time the corporation were in difficult financial circumstances.  It should be further noted that the staff of that corporation have had a significant return on their investment since they purchased the corporation several years ago.  In fact, that decision and the success of the organisation was an inspiration to the staff and management of B &amp; I in coming to their decision &mdash; a decision that was in line with the supposed philosophy of Fianna Fáil throughout the years of involving people and workers and giving them opportunities in the State sector.</P>
    <P>I was involved directly in a take-over of a semi-State organisation by private concern.  In CIE I negotiated for the very successful Spa Road section of coach building works, which was hived off to the private sector because it was successful. I have seen the workers there. That is why I contend we must safeguard workers' interests.  Prior to that hiving off to which I have referred there were various commitments on paper in regard to continuity of employment, conditions of service but, when things changed and it was privatised, very different circumstances obtained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his introductory remarks the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I want to acknowledge and publicly thank the board, the management and all the staff of the company for their efforts in making the plan of action work.</P>
      <P>Since 1987 the company was turned around from having had an operating loss of £3.5 million to a profit this year of £2.5 million.  Over that period staff numbers have been reduced by some 400 and, since 1990, a staff reduction of a total of 1,500 has been secured.  It should be noted that existing staff have accepted substantial modifications in their terms and conditions of employment, accepting a 5 per cent pay cut in 1988 and foregoing several pay rounds as part of their contribution towards securing the future of the company.</P>
      <P>The Minister will agree that that amounts to real sacrifice but what have they been given in return?  In the light of those sacrifices and the achievements of the company were they not entitled to a formal hearing, a fair opportunity, to be afforded every opportunity to ensure that this enlightened proposal could take off?</P>
      <P>In his earlier contribution the Minister stated that he was not satisfied that the MSBO consortium had the full support of the workforce of the B &amp; I.  I would disagree with that, as I am sure would the staff.  I should state very clearly that a general meeting held with the staff on the day before the Minister took the decision, 4 December, the ordinary grassroot members of the Seamen's Union of Ireland who were present were in full support of the buy-out proposals. Irrespective of what the Minister has been hearing the feedback clearly is that there was general support for that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take issue with the Minister when he said he was given the impression that industrial relations within B &amp; I are unsatisfactory.  That is not the case at <Col N="1207" /> present although it may have been some years ago, as major improvements in industrial relations practices have taken place in recent years.  Indeed I would ask the Minister to ensure that such would be the case under any new ownership.</P>
    <P>I might now refer to the pensions scheme.  Recent events in the United Kingdom in regard to the pension funds of the <i>Daily Mirror</i> group, alleged to have been pilfered by the late Robert Maxwell, places even greater onus on the Minister to introduce safeguards in the Bill to secure the accumulated pension fund of the B &amp; I staff.  I understand that negotiations have taken place but that representatives of the proposed new owners have not given any commitment to the present staff of the B &amp; I in regard to future proposals, about which many questions have been asked.  For example, what would be the position of new employees or of new employers in the pension fund, the funding of early retirement benefits, the position with regard to trustees and actuaries?  These matters will have to be clarified in employees' interests.  If there is to be any change in the usage of the pension fund the membership of the B &amp; I should be given an opportunity of expressing their wishes to a general meeting of members, any decisions being taken by 75 per cent of membership.</P>
    <P>This Government were afforded a unique opportunity of providing something new and worthwhile for these people who have given of their skills, talents, knowledge and experience over the years and the Minister has failed them.  I believe it will lead to a doomsday position.  I hope I am proved wrong.  I hope the staff will make a success of the venture in the interests of their jobs.  With regard to industrial relations within the company I would ask the Minister to take on board what has been said here, particularly by the Opposition, including amendments we have proposed to ensure that we will have a viable company whose staff will be prepared to continue to render the company successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ryan and regret very much that I have only five minutes because I am the one Member of the House who has considerable affection for this company based on my past involvement with it.  I should like to have had more time to have spelled out in more detail why I believe the Minister has done a sweetheart deal with ICG. Regrettably I am confined to posing questions to the Minister he has not yet answered.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask him why he did not ensure that there was a proper competition? Why did he exclude the board from the entire process?  Why was there a full-scale confrontation yesterday morning between himself and the board? Why did he prevent the annual general meeting taking place this year?  Why did he veto the Chairman's report for 1990? Why has he ratified a proposal involving zero return for the Exchequer when another course of action has been recommended by the board that would involve an estimated return to the Exchequer of in excess of £20 million?</P>
      <P>Having decided to sell the B &amp; I why did the Minister sit on his hands for about nine months and then give the MSBO proposals a clear impractical deadline of two weeks?  Why did he twice extend that deadline in a fashion contrived to hinder rather than help finalisation of the proposal? Why did he veto an inspection of the company's affairs by the visiting interested Danish representatives, he having invited their interest in late September? Why did he then, on 29 October, give the consortium in which the Danes were partners until only 5 p.m. on Friday, 8 November, that is &ldquo;eight working days&rdquo; to make their offer?  Why did he try to railroad the board of B &amp; I yesterday morning, December 10, into signing over the share purchase agreement in advance of the legislation going through this House and in advance of the details of the agreement with ICG being known?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why, having earlier praised the turnaround in the company's fortunes, has he latterly effectively rubbished the company at every opportunity?  Why did his office seek to stop the issuing of a <Col N="1209" /> letter from the chairman of the company on 9 December to all staff?  Why did he not correct the record of this House of 3 December, &mdash; column 1953 &mdash; when the Taoiseach told me that the Bill would not be taken in this session when he, the Minister, knew it was already with the printer and would be published the next morning?  Why did he feel it necessary to seek but ignore the advice of Mr. John Cooke, Senior Counsel, on his manner of handling the sale?  Why has the Minister refused to protect the pension fund surplus and permitted circumstances to prevail in which legal advice has warned the unions that they are exposed to the risk of ICG simply winding up the three funds and having made the transfer to the ICG fund, walking away if they were so minded with a surplus of up to £12 million?  I have in my possession a copy of that advice.  I hope to have the opportunity to place it on the record of the House and ask the Minister to explain it.</P>
    <P>I wanted to put on the record of the House also, had I the time, the last chairman's report to the annual general meeting if it had not been countermanded.  I wanted to avail of his opportunity also to put on public record the points presented to the Minister by the board yesterday morning which provoked a full-scale confrontation with him because of the extent of the board's displeasure at his handling of the sale.</P>
    <P>The points put to the Minister yesterday morning by the board included:</P>
    <P>1.  Conveying to the Minister their concern that he did not consider options other than immediate sale which would give a better return to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>2.  That there was not an effective process of competitive bids.</P>
    <P>3.  Conveying to the Minister their disappointment that he did not provide a forum in which the board &mdash; through its independent committee &mdash; could contribute to the process leading to decisions.</P>
    <P>4.  Conveying to the Minister the <Col N="1210" /> widespread sense of disappointment and anger felt at every level throughout board, staff and management at the manner in which the decision was made and announced.</P>
    <P>5.  Seeking assurances that there is adequate protection against unacceptable union practices being reintroduced into B &amp; I under new owners.</P>
    <P>6.  Seeking assurances in respect of the protection of the rights of individual staff members in respect of staff participation opportunities.</P>
    <P>7.  Conveying concern that public indications that the plan had failed have not been corrected.</P>
    <P>8.  Ascertaining from the Minister the terms of the proposed sale to ICG and the timing of proposed completion.</P>
    <P>9.  Ascertaining from the Minister an early date for their AGM and the publication of their 1990 accounts.</P>
    <P>In the limited time available, that is the best I can do to put succinctly to the Minister the major questions surrounding his decision to do a sweetheart deal with this company.</P>
    <P>I would particularly have liked the opportunity to put on the record of the House the advice of his civil servants to the Minister which has been provided to me and which includes the advice from John Cooke.  This advice states <i>inter alia</i> that the purpose of the changes being recommended to the Government is &ldquo;to remove any appearance of acquiesence in a claim by ICG which they would presumably like to reserve as a fall back position that there is an existing agreement to sell to them&rdquo;.  The Minister should deal with these points when replying. This raises a shadow over the manner in which this deal has been handled.  Why the headlong rush to sell to ICG only and to pull the rug from under the management and workers who have struggled successfully to turn this company around in the face of adversity, changing market conditions, air fare deregulations and so on?  I greatly regret that I do not have adequate time to expand further.</P>

      <P>Deputy Yates, opening the debate for Fine Gael, said his party were opposing the Bill on the grounds that the sale of B &amp; I represented very bad value whereby the taxpayer gets the worst of all worlds.  What stunning hypocrisy.  We recently passed another anniversary, that of the dismemberment and destruction of Irish Shipping.  Let us consider the cost of that débacle to the Exchequer in the past decade.  In so doing we can illustrate that at least on this occasion some thought is being given to handling the issue of a shipping company who have been in difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Irish Shipping guarantees cost this nation £38.5 million.  The <i>Spruce</i> lease cost £12.9 million.  The care and maintenance of the <i>Spruce</i> under a foreign crew in Marseilles when Labour and Fine Gael refused to allow Irish Shipping Limited personnel to man the ship cost £2.8 million.  The total direct cost associated in the immediate aftermath of that débacle was £54 million.  The sale of the <i>Spruce</i> yielded £3.6 million, leaving a net direct cost of £50.6 million.  I make the point for Deputy Howlin who does not seem to see the parallels, as well as Deputies from Opposition parties who were then in Government, that the Irish Shipping workers, and their management, begged to be allowed to retain at least the <i>Spruce.</i> Deputy Rabbitte recognises the truth of that.</P>

      <P>At least Deputy Ryan has the honesty to admit that what his party did in Government cannot be explained away.  It is worth reminding ourselves that Irish Shipping Limited was an inherently profitable company and that tragically the same cannot be said of the B &amp; I.  For reasons which were not always within their own control, and some which cannot in all honesty be said to have been outside their control, B &amp; I have had problems virtually since the day they were taken over by the State.  I would argue that one of their greatest problems was that they were taken over by the State.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for B &amp; I, while not ideal, at least display some more humanity and common sense than was displayed when the Fine Gael-Labour Government threw Irish Shipping Limited, their staff and their families to the wolves.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is sensitive to that but was certainly not sensitive when the Irish Shipping Limited workers were thrown out.  We see her priorities.  It was said on that occasion that the wives and the mothers of Irish Shipping Limited workers suffered most.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Had the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Jim Mitchell, held his nerve, shown a jot of common sense and striven with anything like the energy which this Minister has put into this issue, we would have a fleet by now and would possibly be in a better position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates and other Fine Gael speakers went on to say that the timing is wrong, although there is apparently nothing wrong with the principle.  If we only waited, said Deputy Yates, until 1992 the trading profit of B &amp; I would be better and we would get more.  Therein lies the nub of the issue.  At least one speaker opposite has adverted to the fact that this company have been burdened with debt and operate in an inherently unstable market.  They will always have difficulties unless they can be related to some other shipping company in finding a profitable niche in which to operate. Unfortunately there have been many false dawns for the B &amp; I since they came into existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On each and every occasion when it looked as if there would be a turnaround there was some setback or disaster. Sometimes these disasters were of the company's making but more often than not they were not of their making.  During the period from 1966 to 1977 things went relatively well for the B &amp; I.  The aggregate losses during those 12 years amounted to no more than £207,000 on a total turnover of £154 million.  This was very good.  However, over the next 12 years things went from bad to worse.  Overexpansion in the last seventies resulted <Col N="1215" /> in increased financial charges and severe and damaging overstaffing.  Substantial fuel price increases during the late seventies and through the eighties affected the operators on long cross-channel routes.  The general economic recession cut into the company's earnings.  The depression in the tourism market during the time of petrol shortages led to difficult market conditions right up to 1985.  Service disruption because of industrial disputes &mdash; and I am conscious that Deputy Ryan made the point that there has been a remarkable turnaround in industrial relations in the B &amp; I Line over the past three years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not acknowledge this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would have to admit that up to three years ago the situation in the B &amp; I Line bordered on scandalous on occasion.  However, this has not been so in more recent times. The introduction of air fares deregulation caused problems for the B &amp; I Line. Substantial provision for losses associated with extraordinary items and high financial charges throughout that period right up to 1988 caused major catastrophic structural problems for the company. There was always an unequal struggle given the debt burden they had to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of the B &amp; I during this period &mdash; one could go into their history in great detail &mdash; illustrates just how slippery the ground is on which Deputy Yates and his party are basing their opposition to the Bill.  The reality is that there is never a best time to make a decision in the shipping business.  As we all know, the shipping business has gone through a continuous period of decline and increased competition since the second World War.  With the introduction of technology the situation has gone from bad to worse.  In addition, foreign crewing has meant that cost structures within the shipping industry have not been equal.  Therefore, there is little point in putting off the decisions which have to <Col N="1216" /> be made in the hope that there is a more fortuitous time just around the corner.</P>
    <P>Some Opposition speakers have argued &mdash; and there is certainly more sense to this argument than the argument put forward by Deputy Yates &mdash; that we should look at the other alternatives so as to ensure that this company remains in Irish hands.  One could argue in favour of that.  The net profit of the B &amp; I Line during the period to which I am referring peaked in 1978 but has effectively been in decline ever since.  I want to deal specifically with the question of valuation which goes to the nub of the arguments put forward by Deputy Yates.</P>
    <P>In arguing that we should wait a while before moving to privatise the B &amp; I Line Deputy Yates questioned the price for which the company is to be sold.  Other Deputies, sometimes for more logical reasons, also questioned the price.  It has been suggested that this is a soft price. By castigating the Minister because the Irish Continental Group have made an offer which he believes is too low, Deputy Yates effectively suggests that the State should go further and effectively sell the asset for the lower price offered by the management and staff.  The reality is that two separate prices have been quoted for this company, one is £8.5 million and the other is £5 million.  If the original management-staff buy out offer, incorporating the Danish partner, had gone ahead, would the Fine Gael party be suggesting that the assets should be sold&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;50 per cent to a foreign company, for £3.5 million less?  Are they seriously suggesting that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates's failure to grasp the process of company valuation was well illustrated by his contribution yesterday. He said at a crucial point in his contribution &mdash; I pointed this out to him today to give him the benefit of being present to correct it &mdash; that the share price for the Irish Continental Group is 12p at present and that it would go up to <Col N="1217" /> 24p.  Anyone in this House who holds an Irish Continental share would have been startled to hear that, because the price for Irish Continental shares quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> of today is 110p.  So much for his calculations of valuation.  The price quoted yesterday for ICG shares by Deputy Yates in his contribution could at best and most charitably be described as rubbish.  As I said, the price quoted for these shares today is 110p.</P>
    <P>A related and perhaps more germane point is the way we value a shipping company. In the case of the Irish Continental Group the valuation is approximately £18.5 million.  That arises because of the ratio of price to the operating cash flow, which is not an uncommon way of calculating the valuation of a shipping company. It is worth carrying out the same exercise on the B &amp; I Line.  The Irish Continental Group have a ratio of price to operating cash flow of the order of four.  That is a relatively high figure because, contrary to some of the comments made here, ICG have an excellent track record and have had very good industrial relations.  Because the ratio is high it would be generous to apply that ratio of four to the B &amp; I Line.  However, if it is applied in the case of the B &amp; I Line a very interesting figure emerges.</P>
    <P>The current profits of the company stand at approximately £2.5 million. Adding back depreciation we get a figure of £3.4 million.  I do not think anyone here would dispute that.  That would be the operating cash flow before depreciation.  However, we must deduct a standing charge of £1.4 million because of works at Milford Haven.  This reduces the figure to £2 million.  Applying the multiple of four gives a price valuation of £8 million for the B &amp; I Line.  I think everyone here accepts that we could trot out different valuation systems until the cows come home and we probably would not agree on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no multiple of four in relation to Greencore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is that that is <Col N="1218" /> one valid approach to establishing a valuation for this company.  It gives us a figure of £8 million which is very close to the figure quoted in the tender by ICG.</P>
      <P>I want to make a final point on valuation. The price quoted for the B &amp; I Line was in response to a tender.  The only other price quoted was £3.5 million below that price and was put forward laterally by the management and staff with the support of Allied Irish Investment Banks.  As Deputy Ryan said, Allied Irish Investment Banks were taking very little risk because the B &amp; I Line have among other assets the pension fund.  That was the reality for the MSBO bid as it is the reality for the ICG bid.  I do not think anything further than that can be said about it.</P>
      <P>The reality is that at present there are four possible ways of dealing with the problem of B &amp; I: first, to continue the <i>status quo</i> and keep the company within the State regime as at present; second, redevelop it with major capital investment &mdash; and if the money were available that is the option I would favour; third, liquidation of the company; and, fourth, sale of the company.  The first option is untenable.  We cannot allow the company to struggle on as it is.  We all accept that there needs to be a change in the B &amp; I Line.  The second option, however desirable, is unfortunately not possible.  The third option, the concept of liquidation of the company, is totally unacceptable to everyone on all sides of this House. The fourth option, sale, is the only real option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, many years ago as a young civil servant in the then Department of Transport and Power I worked on the accounts of this company. That was shortly after the establishment of Irish Ferries as an operating company within the Irish Shipping Group.  Like many others I thought at that time that it was a great tragedy the company which became Irish Ferries and the B &amp; I Line were not merged.  It would have made sense from day one if the two ferries operated within the State sector under the same management.  I felt at that time that it was sensible because there was <Col N="1219" /> synergy there.  There is, and we all know, an historical administrative load on the B &amp; I.  When they came into operation they had a very cumbersome administrative structure.  They have done a great deal over the years and have shed a huge number of staff but proportionately there is a very high management level.  It makes a great deal of sense to put the two ferries under one roof.  It is easy for people here to say this particular solution is not the best one.  None of us actually knows whether there is a better solution but at present it is the only solution that presents itself.  Rather than raise spurious arguments and rather than raise a series of doubts about the validity of this company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point made.  If I had more time I would have dealt in greater detail with issues such as the golden share or putting protections into place for the pension fund.  The reality is that this is the only real solution available to us.  We cannot sell the assets for £3.5 million less, we would be rightly criticised if we did that.  Together we should wish this new Irish owned shipping line all the best and we should hope they will have calmer waters to traverse than the two State shipping lines when they were in the ownership of the nation.</P>

      <P>If his reason for discussing the Irish Shipping debacle was to remind us of what had happened in order that lessons could be learned I would say to him that clearly he has not decided to take any lesson from what has happened. I would remind him that when the Irish Shipping debate was taking place here &mdash; he was not in the House so I suppose I had better give him some benefit for that &mdash; it was an extremely painful time for many Deputies from all sides of the House because of what it became necessary to do with Irish Shipping.  There were many acrimonious debates here as many of us, from Government parties at that time, too, sought to get the very best deal for the workers of Irish Shipping Limited.  I would suggest to Deputy Roche, and perhaps the Minister would benefit from this also, to read the debates of that time, because, whatever the validity of some of the points made by the present Minister for the Marine, Deputy Wilson, who was then in Opposition, they are even more valid now.  Deputy Wilson said on 14 November 1984, column 2082 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>The company was conceived and born in dangerous times.  No one can say with certainty that at present we do not need a company like Irish Shipping. No one can say that peace is assured or what tomorrow will bring.</P>
      <P>He was making a case that we needed a shipping line which was State owned under an Irish flag.  He went on to state at column 2086 to say:</P>
      <P>Are we going to be left unclothed in the shipping sense, are we going to be on our own and at the mercy of other powers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever the justification for saying that when B &amp; I was still State owned there certainly is a huge justification for saying it now when we are being asked to preside over the selling off of B &amp; I.  I and the Fine Gael party have no ideological <Col N="1221" /> hangups about privatising companies but I do not believe in selling off something that is beginning to make a profit, because of the actions of the workers. We are being asked to preside over the consumation of a decision which was taken by the Minister at the beginning of this year.  All that has happened in between was an illusory cosmetic exercise to give the Minister an opportunity to show how magnanimous he was in allowing the workers and management of B &amp; I have a say but that he had made up his mind.  If we want proof of that during February and March of this year spokespersons from all sides of this House and the management and staff of B &amp; I warned the Minister of the difficulties they saw if he sold off this company to Irish Ferries.  He ignored all that or he went through a facade or a cosmetic exercise of seeming to allow them have their say.  He even went so far as to say in his contribution:</P>
    <P>I want to acknowledge and publicly thank the board, the management and all the staff of the company for their efforts in making the plan of action work.</P>
    <P>What he is really saying is: thank you very much management and staff for fattening up the company, for getting it ready to pass on to somebody else.  If the Minister really meant what he said he would be acknowledging that the plan of action was at last beginning to take effect.  Further in his contribution he highlighted the fact that operating profits of £1.8 million, £2.8 million and £2.3 million were recorded in the last three years of the company.  I accept that the Minister was still paying some equity to them.  If the Minister is now saying he can, with the stroke of a pen or a wave of his hand, write off the £35 million debt for ICG, who are now going to buy this company, why can he not write it off and take that burden off the management and staff of B &amp; I and allow the growth we are beginning to see in terms of trading surpluses until they become more profitable and become a good asset for this country.  There is evidence to suggest that the profitability <Col N="1222" /> curve was in the right direction during those three consecutive years.</P>
    <P>What did the Minister do just when the company were beginning to make a profit?  He decided he had enough and that he would get rid of it.  It is like a farmer who decides to buy some bonhams and fatten them for sale.  He knows he will have to put in some input by way of feedstuffs in order to receive some benefit from his investment.  That is the equity the Minister has been putting in to B &amp; I.  The farmer begins to see his bonhams fattening and the time approaches when he will be able to sell them and make a good profit and, perhaps, carry out some improvements on the farm but he gets tired and decides that it is troublesom getting up in the mornings to feed them and so on.  Half way through the feeding programme he decides to sell them off but he does so at a lower price than if he kept them for some further time.  He then has to sit and watch while the new farmer who has bought the bonhams proceeds to complete the feeding programme and when he has them fattened up sells them at a profit and makes the effort worthwhile.</P>

      <P>The Minister will, in a few short years, regret that he will not have control of B &amp; I because I believe that over the next few years ICG will make enormous profits out of this company. They have managed to get from this Government for the sum of £8.5 million a company that is worth more than their own company at a price which, if they were to build a company from scratch, and had to buy the assets, the ships and so on, would cost three times that amount. They are getting a nice sweet prize from the Minister.  On top of that, the Minister has given, not only in this House and outside it, but to the British-Irish Parliamentary body which he addressed last week an assurance he has been pressing for EC funds for mobile assets.  He has given a clear commitment in that respect. But he got rid of the one company that <Col N="1223" /> would have enabled him to reap the benefits of his efforts.  Those benefits, should they materialise, will go instead to ICG and I can only say good luck to them in that regard.</P>
      <P>Why should the State not get those increased funds to improve the shipping quality and the freight quality B &amp; I?  It is utterly incredible that the Minister at this stage can decide that this is the right time to do this.  I do not have an ideological hang-up and I agree that in 1965 this company were set up to ensure an adequate level of capacity and to maintain competition in sea transport between Ireland and the UK.  I agree that that can be easily done by private enterprise, but if it can be done with more value to the taxpayer, by the State, why throw that opportunity away now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  The Minister will regret this decision.  At the British-Irish parliamentary meeting last week one of the expert committes at that meeting set about examining freight transport between this country and the UK.  It is clear that with the opening of the channel tunnel far more emphasis will be put on transporting freight to the mainland of the UK through the channel tunnel and that there will be opportunities for increased freight travel across the Irish Sea.  That is where profitability will come from a company like this.  The Minister admitted that at that meeting.  It was estimated that there will be a 10 per cent shift from the long sea crossing to the land bridge which will be created by the channel tunnel.  Freight shipping is about to increase between Ireland and the UK because of the channel tunnel and we are getting rid of the last company in which the taxpayers can have some pride and from which we can gain some benefit.  At that meeting the Minister spoke about his hopes for increased tourism.  I do not say that ICG will cut down on the car and passenger ferries but we do not know the <Col N="1224" /> fine print of the deal which the Minister will do with the Irish Continental Group. That is an indictment of the Ministers haste in this deal.</P>
      <P>If the Minister had examined the management and workers proposals more carefully he would not find a substantial difference between the two offers.  As Deputy Ryan said, the Irish Continental Group proposed to shed approximately 250 people, many of them in middle management, in their middle years, who will not be able to get more work, who will go on to the dole.  Even allowing an average payment of £60 a week to 250 people, and many will get more, that is about £7 million to £8 million per year.  If the management staff buy-out was agreed they would have shed fewer than 100 jobs, thereby saving £3.12 million on the deal which would bring their offer up to the value of the Irish Continental Group. I cannot understand how the Minister says that the deal being offered by ICG is substantially better for the State.  In both offers the Minister was going to write off a £35 million debt and a certain number of jobs and as a result of the ICG offer there was to be a greater number of staff lost.</P>
      <P>What did the Minister expect from Stokes Kennedy Crowley Corporate Finance? They are the body the Minister consulted with and asked them to prepare a report on the B &amp; I.  They advised the Minister to sell it.  The Minister then asked them, like asking a judge to judge himself, to look at the two offers from the ICG and the management and staff. What other result did the Minister expect but to take the offer from the ICG?  There would have been more merit in asking some other independent body to look at this.  I know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I will leave it at that because I know Deputy Barnes wants to say something. I do not have an ideological reason for opposing this Bill but this is a foolhardy, unwise and hasty decision by the Minister. The people in B &amp; I will suffer, their families will suffer and as a result the Minister will suffer.</P>

      <P>I am glad I was able to share at least one of my minutes with Deputy Lyons, even if it was not productive. Deputy Roche claimed that there would never be a more fortuitous time at which to carry out this transaction. I challenge him on that.  Was it a fortuitous time with regard to not just the future profitability of this company but with regard to staff relations, given the acknowledgment accorded to the workers, whom the Minister praised, when the board only learned about the sale when it was reported by RTE at lunch time on Thursday last, when the B &amp; I management and State consortium, MSBO, were still putting together details of their bid and believed they were involved in a productive constructive exercise, while they were just being given the run around?  Does the Deputy still believe it is a fortuitous time when observers have expressed since <Col N="1226" /> then their absolute surprise that the Minister did not decide to hold on to the company for at least another year, considering its promise and profitability? Given the praise attributed by the Minister and everybody else to the staff and management of B &amp; I, how is it that the board can convey to the Minister their disappointment that the Minister did not provide a forum in which the board, through their independent committee, could contribute to the process leading to decisions?  That is the least any company about to be taken over and promised such constructive discussion could have expected.  The board conveyed to the Minister the widespread disappointment and anger feltl at every level in B &amp; I at the manner in which the decision was made and announced.  If Deputy Roche believes there was not a more fortuitous time for this exercise, he knows nothing about industrial relations, much less any acknowledgment of the work and dignity of the people in a company, but that comes as no surprise to me.</P>
      <P>The pension fund has been referred to and we must take this very seriously. Deputy Roche was most understanding with regard to that.  There is a surplus in the existing B &amp; I pension fund.  What safeguard is there for that pension fund? Will it be used or will some of it be used as a cross-subsidy from B &amp; I to Irish Ferries and the new company?  What confidence can people nearing pension age, who have paid into the pension fund, have that they will be looked after?  An outstanding question asked by the board was is in regard to an early date for an AGM and the publication of the 1990 accounts.  Astonishingly, the Minister, and the Government, did not allow the publication of those accounts.</P>
      <P>The Government did not allow the publication of those accounts in contravention of sections of the Companies Act, 1963.  At a time of doom and gloom when we all hope for some good news it seems strange that that AGM and the accounts are denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Above all else we must ask what legal claims against B &amp; I will be taken and by whom?  For instance, we do not yet know <Col N="1227" /> the implications of the recent collision between the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i> and the <i>m.v. Hasselwerder.</i></P>
    <P>Everything about this deal flies in the face of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> of the social contract, of social partnership, of discussion and of the dignity and recognition due to workers and management and staff-management relationships.  I find it a fine irony that the Taoiseach should return to this country in triumph because he and ten other countries had held out in Maastricht for a social charter exactly along the lines we are asking for in the treatment of the workers in B &amp; I.  If the social charter is adopted we will find ourselves, if Fianna Fáil are still in Government, traipsing to Europe to get the justice that has been denied in this shabby deal.</P>

      <P>This Bill is before the House because the Minister indicated last year that he was carrying out a detailed examination of future options for B &amp; I and whether the Exchequer could continue to fund B &amp; I to the extent as in previous years.  There is an option to carry out that examination or to allow B &amp; I to continue until they were crippled or went into liquidation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The report also strongly recommended that B &amp; I should be sold. The Minister took this recommendation on board and exhausted all avenues to ascertain as to who in the marketplace would purchase it.</P>
      <P>It is also my understanding that five companies expressed serious interest in the B &amp; I.  The best offer was from ICG which was £8.5 million.  Some speakers criticised the sale price of £8.5 million. With a £36 million write-off, with assets in excess of £20 in a company heading for good profits &mdash; this year £2.5 million &mdash; that company will be much stronger and more viable without the debt.  It sounds crazy that all this is selling for £8.5 million; it is definitely good value for money.</P>

      <P>Many questions on the management-staff buy-out have been posed.  B &amp; I played a very important role in terms of employment and so on.  I would welcome answers to the many questions on the management-staff buy-out.  I have great admiration for the way the staff tackled some of the difficulties that B &amp; I faced over the years.  The workforce was reduced from 1,500 to 900, they accepted a pay cut of 5 per cent and a pay freeze to get the company back on the rails.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that throughout the entire debate during the past two days I did not interrupt any speaker even though I was taking some stick.  I would, honestly, like to be given 16 or 17 minutes to say what I have to say.  If the Deputies feel they cannot do that, I will understand but I would much prefer if they could agree because everyone is entitled to have their say.  People can take it or leave it, but interruptions get us nowhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first issue that needs to be addressed is the price.  It has been claimed consistently by speakers that the sale represented bad value.  A number of speakers said that it was a sweetheart deal, but almost in the same breath they alleged that the management staff buy-out consortium were cynically used by me to force ICG to increase their offer. <Col N="1232" /> They cannot have it both ways.  This line of argument stands logic on its head. As I said before, any reasonable person would agree that the only way to establish the best value of any company is to seek competitive bids.  The chairman of the B &amp; I advised me to do just this in a letter dated 8 October 1991 in which he said:</P>
    <P>We agree that, given a decision to sell now at the best price available, fair value is whatever is the best price that can be obtained in the marketplace. We support the view of the consultants that a true competitive bidding process between more than one buyer is likely to produce the best price.  True market value will only be obtained where each bidder has confidence that if his bid is the highest it is likely to be accepted.</P>
    <P>That is exactly what I have done in the case of the B &amp; I Line.  During the past year or so, two trawls of the international shipping market have been carried out. Apart from ICG and the earlier management-staff buy-out offer, which was also unsuccessful, two major international shipping companies looked at B &amp; I.  Both decided that they were not interested in making a bid for the company. A further foreign-owned company did make a bid about a year ago.  They offered the Government a nominal sum of £1 for the entire issued share capital of B &amp; I on the basis that the Government would assume responsibility for their liabilities which my advisers estimated to be in the range of £29.5 million to £43.5 million.  I would prefer not to give the names of the companies involved at this stage for commercial reasons.</P>
    <P>These are the hard facts which I am putting before the House.  ICG's latest offer of £8.5 million is clearly superior to the management-staff buy-out consortium offer of £5 million, £3 million of which would be deferred.  Indeed, the consortium's offer is inferior to even the previous ICG bid of £6.5 million.  Let nobody therefore tell me that the sale to Irish Continental Group has not been made on the basis of the best price available in the market.  The analysis put forward by Deputy Roche this evening in <Col N="1233" /> regard to the stock market valuation bears this out.</P>
    <P>If I sold the B &amp; I Line for £3.5 million less than the amount on offer would Deputies in the House not accuse me of squandering taxpayer's money and demand inquiries into why I did not take the best offer?  Would they be as interested in the taxpayer's money in those circumstances as they appear to be in other circumstances where millions of pounds are at stake?</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt any speaker.  I would ask The Workers' Party to give me an opportunity to say what I have to say.  I listened very carefully to what each of them had to say.  Let me give a few facts to show why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When SKC spoke to the Danish backers of the consortium on 2 October they clearly stated that they would only require two weeks to make a final bid. The reason no doubt was that they had already been associated with the previous bid made a year earlier and that their <Col N="1234" /> partners in the consortium were the company's existing management.  In my own view, the existing management of any company should be able to make an informed bid for their company within two weeks.</P>
    <P>On 21 October the chief executive of the B &amp; I Line informed me that he could have a firm and final bid with me on behalf of the consortium within three weeks.  I agreed to give him five weeks. Therefore those who wanted to make a bid got more time than they sought. Furthermore, the industrial relations officer of the Irish Congress of Trade Union, on behalf of the B &amp; I group of unions, requested a period of one month within which to attempt to prepare a bid with the management consortium.  I gave them five weeks.  By any standards, that was adequate and well in excess of what they had sought from me.  ICG were given the same five week period in which to prepare a revised bid.  In many ways they were outsiders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

      <P>I would now like to deal with the question of the B &amp; I pension funds.  I wrote to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 1 November 1991.  I want to read what I said to them into the record of the House.  I said:</P>
      <P>I wish to assure you that the Government will not accept that any sale transaction be conditional on the company liquidating the assets of B &amp; I pension schemes for any amount.  In my view, the control and management of pension funds are the responsibility of the trustees of such funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sale to ICG is fully consistent with this commitment which I repeat this evening.  I should remind the House once again that the management/staff buy-out consortiums offer hinged on the use of £6 <Col N="1235" /> million from the B &amp; I workers pension funds.</P>

      <P>The Deputy claimed that I had pulled the plug on management and staff at a time when they could have reached agreement with the Danish interests within a matter of days.  Again, this is simply not true.  On 4 December, I received a copy of a letter, sent to my advisers by AIB Corporate Finance Limited, in which it was indicated that the management and staff had withdrawn from the consortium bid and that an amended bid was being submitted on their behalf.  This letter stated quite clearly that management and staff were still very attracted to the idea of a partner for B &amp; I.  However, they believed that discussions with possible partners, including Irish Ferries, could be postponed for at least 12 months.  At that stage they believed they would be able to do a much better deal with a potential partner.  This clearly shows that the suggestion that a deal could have been done with the Danish interests within a few short days, weeks or even months was simply not true.  I have the letter here which I can read into the record if anyone is interested.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of time, it is over one year since I announced publicly the Government's decision to sell B &amp; I to the Irish Continental Group.  I issued a public statement on that occasion in which I indicated that I had reached agreement with the trade union movement. The trade union representatives confirmed that they were prepared to positively co-operate in the sale of the B &amp; I to Irish Ferries provided they were given adequate assurances on key conditions affecting their members.</P>

      <P>There was little or no reaction at that time.  I cannot lay my hands on any statements made by a number of the Deputies who spoke here this evening, but I reject the notion that this matter was rushed.  This country, everyone in this House and all the parties involved had a year's notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was said that AIB Corporate Finance has stepped in to fill the vacuum left by the removal of the Danish interests on the consortium.  This, like some of the other statements made earlier, is not true.  The bank merely confirmed that they were willing to offer the same day-to-day banking facilities to a management-staff bid as they were previously offering to the consortium bid. They were not offering to replace the Danish investment, just to maintain the usual and similar banking arrangements. The Danes represented some 50 per cent of the funding and, without them, or even without the possibility of their funding within a year, as indicated in the letter which I have here, the management-staff buy-out was greatly weakened, as any objective commentator would conclude.</P>
      <P>Various speakers referred to the B &amp; I as being highly profitable.  I am surprised at their liberal definition of that word because there is no point in saying that if you ignore the debt, the company are profitable.  Any successful company must be able to carry some debt and still be profitable so that they can renew their assets, develop their business and so on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates said last night that B &amp; I had moved from a loss of £9.4 million in 1984 to a projected profit in 1992 of £4.2 million.  He went on to quote various trading figures which are not accurate.  I have the correct figures here and I will read them into the record when I have more time.  Suffice it to say that, after interest charges, all the so-called operating profits turned into losses.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the same period, from 1984 to 1990, the Exchequer injected a total of £59 million equity in the B &amp; I.  Indeed, as many speakers pointed out, since their acquisition from the private sector in 1965, a total of £106 million of taxpayers' money has gone into <Col N="1238" /> the company.  At the end of all that, the fleet needs to be renewed.  SKC Corporate Finance Limited advised me that, on the basis of figures supplied by B &amp; I, this could cost over £70 million.  B &amp; I have been &mdash; and continue to be &mdash; saved from liquidation by the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>Despite the £106 million of equity injections there are still debts of £35 million to be removed from the company before they can be sold. They are hardly a profitable company.  In spite of what some Deputies said, I wish to express my appreciation to the staff of the B &amp; I who, over many years, put up with a lot of pressure and difficulties.</P>

      <P>I should now like to comment on the question of redundancies. Let me be clear about one thing; there is no question of people being put out of a job before Christmas.  The MSBO consortium and ICG indicated that they would assume responsibility for rationalisation after completion of the sale.  ICG indicated that they would seek redundancies of about 250 people and they have assured me they will all be voluntary, if possible.  Indeed, Irish Continental Group previously advised the union that they would guarantee existing rates of basic pay.  I have no doubt that, following completion of the sale, ICG will sit down with the unions and negotiate a reasonable agreement.</P>

      <P>The first MSBO proposal involved 300 redundancies, the current number involves 150 to 250 from the management-staff buy-out.  The level of consultations with the trade union interests in relation to this sale is possibly unprecedented.  To date my Department have had approximately 20 meetings with trade union representatives, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, as well as numerous bilateral contacts.  I met trade union representatives on three occasions.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to what Deputy Rabbitte said in regard to the document on which he laid his hands and which was on its way from the office of the Chief State Solicitor to me.  The document which the Deputy waved around yesterday is simply advice to me after the Government took the decision to sell the B &amp; I.  It was advice about implementing the decision; I did not ignore the advice.  It was purely legal and technical advice about how to implement the Government decision and it played no part in the decision.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Gablaim buíochas leat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as ucht an deis seo a thabhairt dom an t-ábhar seo a phlé.</P>
      <P>A number of disturbing reports have been issued this year on the condition and status of some of our Irish emigrants in Britain, particularly in London.  The latest of these reports, launched at a reception in the House of Commons yesterday, entitled &ldquo;An Agenda for Change&rdquo; was commissioned by Haringey Council in North London.  The findings of this report make sad and alarming reading, showing that the Irish, as a group, are among the most disadvantaged and discriminated against ethnic minorities in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report concentrates on three main areas of concern, namely, health, housing and unemployment and indicates that the Irish population die younger than any other group in the United Kingdom.  In fact it shows that their mortality rate is 20 per cent above that of the United Kingdom population in the 20 to 69-year old age group.  The report also indicates that they have a shorter life expectancy than those who remain in Ireland.  The Irish are the only migrant group whose life expectancy worsens on arrival in <Col N="1251" /> Britain.  For all other migrant groups life expectancy increases on arrival there.</P>
    <P>Another disturbing finding is that Irish emigrants in Britain had higher rates of psychiatric admission than any other ethnic group.</P>
    <P>The position in respect of housing is alarming.  Again the Irish, along with the Bangladeshi community, were found to have the lowest share of owner/ occupation, that is 34 per cent in the case of the Irish and 32 per cent in the case of the Bangladeshis.  The report further indicates that the Irish and Asian communities were the groups most likely to be living in unfit accommodation.  Both groups also suffer high levels of disadvantage in terms of lacking or sharing basic housing amenities.  The incidence of homelessness is another indicator of the Irish experience of disadvantage in Britain.  In addition, they constitute a disproportionate share of the single homeless in Britain.</P>
    <P>In the 1981 United Kingdom Census there were shown to be 850,000 Irish-born people resident in Britain.  The size of the Irish population in Britain increased substantially throughout the eighties on account of large-scale emigration from here.  It is estimated that 500,000 people emigrated from Ireland in the past decade.  It is also estimated that the majority of these people emigrated to Britain.  In fact the Irish comprise one of Britain's largest ethnic minority communities.  However, in the last Census of Population taken in Britain on 21 April last, everybody resident there was requested to identify their ethnic group but the format of the question did not include an Irish category.  The fact that the Irish there are not officially recognised as a distinct ethnic group is a severe handicap to them.</P>
    <P>The main national body in Britain charged with responsibility for race relations is the Commission for Racial Equality.  However, because of the fact that we are not recognised as an ethnic minority, we do not come within the jurisdiction and protection of that commission. All ethnic groups are entitled to <Col N="1252" /> certain quotas related to their numbers in the areas of employment, housing, education, health and so on but the Irish are excluded from tapping into these quotas.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government should make it one of their urgent objectives to have this recognition extended to the Irish in Britain as soon as possible.  It should be taken up at inter-governmental level as such recognition and status would extend the protection of the Commission for Racial Equality to Irish people resident in Britain and would grant them the same rights and benefits as other ethnic groups. It would mean that the Irish would be constantly monitored in all monitoring programmes conducted by the Commission.</P>
    <P>Irish Government funding for those in the front line working with our emigrants in the UK is channelled through DÍON. The total grant has been frozen for the past two years at £500,000.  In view of the economic recession in Britain and the hardships experienced by our people there, the Government must consider increasing the allocation in the coming budget.  I am not stating that more money will solve the problems and lessen hardships, but it would at least give some encouragement to those people and organisations working with and for the welfare of our emigrants.  When the economic situation begins to improve in the UK we can once more expect a steep increase in the number of our people heading there, particularly when there are so few employment opportunities at home.  It is imperative that we should have a comprehensive and effective programme in our schools at post-primary level illustrating and explaining the difficulties faced by Irish people seeking employment in Britain and elsewhere. Inadequate preparation is cited by many as one of the main reasons why many of our people find themselves in such difficulties in Britain.</P>
    <P>We must be grateful to Haringey Council for commissioning this report and also to the Action Group for Irish Youth in London for their surveys, particularly their report earlier this year <Col N="1253" /> on the plight of the Irish in London.  As politicians we would be failing in our duty if we did not do everything in our power to see that these recommendations were implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGinley for the opportunity to comment on this matter.  I understand the report to which the Deputy referred was prepared by Haringey Council and was launched yesterday in London.  My Department were made aware of the publication of the report through the Embassy in London.  An officer from the Embassy attended the launch of the report, and forwarded a copy to my Department.  The report contains a number of conclusions and recommendations relating to the position of the Irish community in Britain.  Obviously the contents of the report will have to be carefully studied before any detailed comment can be made.</P>
      <P>As Deputy McGinley will be aware, the Government maintain close contact with the Irish community in Britain through the Embassy in London.  While it is clear that the vast majority of Irish people in Britain are well established members of the community there, the welfare of those who do need assistance remains a high priority of the Government and expression is given to this through action in a variety of areas which affect the well-being of Irish people in Britain.  Two officers of the Embassy work full-time on matters concerning the Irish community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour attaché, on secondment from the Department of Labour, is the chairperson of the DÍON Committee, which is the principal vehicle for the provision of Government financial assistance to organisations dedicated to the welfare needs of Irish people in Britain.  This officer also maintains close contact with British Government Departments, statutory bodies, and local government authorities on matters of concern to the many voluntary bodies who act on behalf of recent emigrants to Britain as well as those who are established there longer. <Col N="1254" /> The community liaison officer, who acts as secretary to the DÍON Committee, is also specifically charged with maintaining the closest possible links with representatives of Irish community organisations throughout Britain and with individuals active in the field of Irish community welfare.  Through such regular contact, the Embassy seeks to remain aware of problems which can arise for members of the Irish community in relation to such issues as housing, employment, health, or social welfare.</P>
    <P>Through these arrangements, the Embassy draws the attention of the appropriate authorities to matters of concern to all sections of the Irish community in Britain.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the DÍON Committee as the principal mechanism by which the Government provide financial assistance to voluntary organisations active on behalf of Irish emigrants in Britain.  The DÍON Committee were established in 1984 to advise the Minister for Labour on matters related to emigrant welfare.  In recognition of the importance of the work and extent of the problems involved, the Government responded by significantly increasing in 1989, from £250,000 to £500,000, the funding made available to the committee. This year the Government again made available a sum of £500,000 to the DÍON Committee for such assistance, despite an apparent fall in the numbers emigrating.</P>
    <P>The bulk of DÍON funds, which are released by the Minister for Labour on the recommendation of the committee, have been directed towards improving and developing reception services for newly arrived emigrants.  The extra funds made available since 1989 enabled a total of 32 organisations to receive grant assistance in 1991.  The additional funding was allocated moreover, to a range of projects intended to assist families in crisis and also to projects which will serve to promote access for young people to employment and accommodation.  The DÍON Committee seek to ensure that Irish Government support is used for projects which attract matching funding from <Col N="1255" /> British statutory bodies and private charitable trusts in the UK.  It also encourages Irish welfare agencies to co-ordinate their activities and co-operate together in developing information and training programmes which can assist their work.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, the Government seek to ensure that people contemplating emigration are provided with comprehensive advice and help and, where necessary, dissuaded from emigrating where their interests might be at risk.  FÁS have been specifically charged with responsibility to provide a comprehensive range of predeparture information and advice services. Through the recent establishment of a transfrontier committee, FÁS are liaising closely with their UK counterparts on matters relating to the provision of information to emigrants to Britain on employment prospects there, and the employment-related services which are available to them.</P>
    <P>Reaching those who most need this help is by no means a straight-forward operation.  It can only proceed on the basis of information, training and the development of a co-ordinated strategy embracing the activities of Irish community bodies and the private, voluntary and public sectors in Britain.  The Irish Government are fully conscious of the needs of Irish emigrants to Britain, and will continue to provide targeted and relevant assistance in co-operation with the many excellent bodies who work in this field.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy McGinley that when the Department have given careful and urgent study to the report they will discuss the findings with the relevant British authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me permission to raise this matter and I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to listen to a simple and straighforward request on behalf of 36 householders who live in a curiously named road, north of the city sprawl <Col N="1256" /> of Donaghmede which I represent, called the Hole in the Wall Road.  There is a cluster of cottages known as St. Michael's Cottages and other artisan dwellings along the road, 36 in all, which were built between 1903 and 1940.  It is an area of the city within the remit of Dublin Corporation, but if one could ignore the encroaching urban spread it has the appearance of a very rural setting.  Many old artisan families and people who work in the market gardens further to the north in the Kinsealy area live there.</P>
      <P>The cottages were built without any main sewerage system being available to them.  Over the years only a few of the cottages have been able to put in septic tank systems, although they have the required area of land available to them. The local authority are stringent in the conditions laid down for septic tank systems because of the absence of good drainage.  The houses are at sea level or, perhaps, marginally below it and very close to the Malahide estuary, with the main river running to the front of them. Drainage is virtually non-existent, except in a few cases where septict tanks have been installed.  The majority of the cottages use the dry toilet system.  Many elderly and infirm people have to empty and bury waste on a daily basis.  This has led to the pollution of many open drains in the area, due to the discharge or seepage of sink or toilet waste.</P>
      <P>I understand this is the last scheme of houses in the corporation's area of responsibility without a proper main drainage system.  This is despite the fact that almost on their doorstep there are massive developments at Newgrove, Grange Abbey, Donaghmede and Airfield, to name but a few.  A developer recently put forward a proposal to build 970 houses practically in their back gardens. The residents are asking the Minister for the Environment to take the necessary steps to provide the funding for this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this matter with the Minister for the Environment by way of question in the House on 3 December.  He advised me that he had received the scheme from the corporation but had sent it back to <Col N="1257" /> them for further details.  The corporation had not advised other councillors or me of this.  The day before they advised us that they had submitted the scheme to the Department and it was estimated that the proposals would cost approximately £631,000.  Quite frankly, I find this figure remarkable in view of what is expected. The figure may well be accurate and I should like the Minister to clarify this point.  There is some confusion about whether the scheme is with the Minister or the corporation.  If the scheme is with the corporation I should like the Minister to outline the basis for this.</P>
    <P>In short, I am asking if the Minister would be agreeable to meet with the residents in the very near future so that these issues can be teased out and a firm commitment given that the work will be undertaken on their behalf in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy McCartan for his excellent contribution on this matter.  I shall endeavour to give him whatever information I can.  However, as I am not the appropriate Minister I cannot say whether the Minister for the Environment will meet with the residents.  I shall certainly put his request to the Minister for the Environment or his Minister of State for whom I am replying.</P>
      <P>As Deputy McCartan said, Dublin Corporation submitted a revised preliminary report for this scheme to the Department of the Environment in August 1991.  The revised proposal involves the drainage of 31 houses, and not 36 houses as Deputy McCartan said, and a sports complex at a cost of about £631,000.</P>

    <P>The corporation's report examines several options.  Connecting to an existing county council system was ruled out on technical grounds.  Instead, the report favours the drainage of the houses and the sports complex through the Grange College treatment works.  This involves the provision of: 2,431 metres of gravity and trunk sewers; a pumping station; and an extension of the existing treatment works serving the Grange College so that <Col N="1258" /> the effluent would receive secondary treatment before discharge to the Mayne River.  Dublin Corporation have been requested to provide additional information to enable the Department of the Environment to evaluate this proposal. Until that exercise has been completed, I cannot say what the final decision will be.</P>
    <P>However, I can assure Deputy McCartan that as soon as the additional information is received from Dublin Corporation it will be urgently examined and the possibility of approving the proposal will be considered as sympathetically as possible.  We will, of course, also have to take account of the capital provision for the water and sanitary services programme generally, the demands arising on foot of other schemes, and the existing levels of capital commitments.  As I said, I will pass the Deputy's request for the Minister to meet a deputation to the Minister of State.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Tralee (Kerry) CBS Extension.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank the Minister for being present in the House tonight.  This is an indication of the seriousness with which he takes his new portfolio.  Long may this continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tralee CBS is rightly regarded as one of the outstanding schools not only in County Kerry but in Ireland.  However, the authorities in the school are very concerned about the lack of progress regarding the proposed extension to the school. It was hoped that the rescheduled extension to the school would be occupied by September 1991.  However, this has not been the case.  The accommodation in Tralee CBS has deteriorated to such an extent that it will not be possible to cope with the increasing numbers in September 1992 unless extra accommodation is provided.  The student population of the school has increased significantly over the years.  In September 1990 there were 723 pupils in attendance.  By September 1991 the number had increased to 768. The projected figure for September 1992 is 792 plus.  This will depend on keeping <Col N="1259" /> the number of new entrants down to 150 which will be very difficult because of the large number of first year applicants.</P>
    <P>The school authorities have already had to accommodate one class in a cloakroom, two classes in the lunch area and one group in the library.  Junior classes have over 30 pupils.  One first year class has 38 pupils, two junior certificate classes have 36 pupils, and three pre-leaving certificate classes have 30, 31 and 32 pupils.  The oversized junior classes study science and some study technology. The numbers in these classes do not meet the standard required by the teachers union, the Department of Education or the insurance companies.  Indeed at one stage the Department stipulated that schools should have an assistant in all science classes which had over 24 pupils. Unfortunately, those days are gone.  The school will be entitled to extra teachers in September 1992.  However, there will be no rooms in which to accommodate the extra classes.</P>
    <P>The original proposal for an extension was far more elaborate than the one now on the Minister's desk.  Some years ago the Department made a special arrangment with a number of schools, including Tralee CBS, regarding extensions.  Most of these extensions have been completed. The authorities in Tralee CBS are prepared to provide 50 per cent of the cost involved.  This means the Department will only have to contribute £178,000, which is a very good arrangement because usually funding is provided in the ratio of 90 per cent from the Department and 10 per cent from local contributions.</P>
    <P>The new extension will include a physics room, a technology room, a drawing room and a staff room.  However, the six prefab classrooms will have to be retained.  Although they are now 23 years old they are in relatively good condition. Two of these rooms are used for drawing and technology at present.  When the extension is built these rooms will be converted into three classrooms.  The last time a grant was allocated by the Department of Education to Tralee CBS was in 1971.  Since then the school authorities <Col N="1260" /> have had to carry out major repair work on the roof of this extension.  A furnace had to be replaced at a cost of £7,000 and underground piping is being replaced at present at a cost of £10,000.  All of these improvements have been carried out at no cost to the Department.</P>
    <P>The school authorities deserve some positive treatment from the Department at this stage.  I suggest that the modified extension which was agreed as a special arrangement between the Department and the school whereby the Department would pay £178,000 and the school would pay the remainder of the cost should be taken in hand immediately.  As the completed documentation is now in the Department I ask the Minister to please allow the project to go to tender so that work can begin in the early spring. Even at this late hour, I look forward to a positive response from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to outline in some detail the progress being made in the planning of an extension for Tralee CBS.  By way of background, I should explain that a much larger extension had been proposed for Tralee CBS and architectural planning by the school's design team had been well advanced.  However, following a review of demographic trends for the area, it was decided that a somewhat smaller extension would meet the needs of the school.  Since agreement was reached on this the school authorities have been proceeding with the detailed planning of the modified extension.</P>
      <P>The extension proposed now is a block of specialist accommodation which will provide the school with a science laboratory, woodwork-technology room, a mechanical drawing room and also some ancillary accommodation.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that the recent architectural planning of the extension which is being undertaken by the school's design team is proceeding satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department received the most recent stage of planning, the detail <Col N="1261" /> design-contract documents, in September last and these were found to be acceptable, subject to some small amendments. The amendments have since been carried out and together with further documentation, recently received, are now being examined in my Department.</P>
    <P>While I am very much aware of the urgent need for the extension, at this stage of the planning, I am not in a position to indicate when construction will start.</P>
    <P>When the architectural planning is completed tenders will have to be invited and examined.  The placing of the contract will then have to be considered in the light of the capital funds available and in the context of the Department's other commitments.  I would like to assure the Deputy, however, that every effort will be made to ensure that the required accommodation is provided as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take this opportunity to congratulate the new Minister on his promotion and wish him every success in this portfolio.  I should say that in the past, in his other ministerial capacities, I found him very good, very efficient and very co-operative.</P>
      <P>During the week, in the course of my constituency work, I had a visit from a small farmer who had been turned down for unemployment assistance because of his farm income, as calculated by the Department of Social Welfare.  There is nothing unusual about that nowadays. Naturally, I asked my constituent what was his estimation of his income and his reply was the following: &ldquo;Deputy Nealon, the kind of place I have it does not keep you, you have to keep it&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was as neat a summary as one can get of the present plight of small farmers in the west.  Sadly, it is a fact of life that no one seems to be able to get across to the Department of Social Welfare.  The Department, for all their merits, have a <Col N="1262" /> blind spot in this area.  Once they find a cow then they claim that cow is making a designated profit.  Once they find a store animal for the mart, then they say that animal is going to make an ordained profit, even if its bones are coming out through his hide.  The same applies to sheep.  Worse still their assumed profits are calculated on prices that obtained two to three years ago so that the dole or the old age non-contributory pension is lost or reduced.  There is no allowance for what happened to prices in the meantime. I will give some examples.  In the North Connacht Farmers' Co-op area &mdash; Sligo, north Leitrim, Mayo, north Roscommon, north Galway and south Donegal &mdash; in 1990 milk prices were down 18 per cent, store cattle were down 20 per cent and sheep were down 35 per cent. The co-ops's payments to farmers in 1989 were £87 million, this year they will be £72 million; that is when input costs have increased.</P>
    <P>In the last month, November, total prices paid by North Connacht Farmers' Co-op for cattle was down by 21 per cent while the number of cattle sold by them was up by 15 per cent.  Teagasc, the organisation responsible for official farm returns, acknowledge this drastic downturn in the income of the small farmers of Sligo, Leitrim, Mayo and the west generally.  However, as the Minister knows from his constituency work &mdash; he is a diligent constituency worker &mdash; the Department of Social Welfare have not readjusted to reality.  They do not appear to have the flexibility to deal with these changes.  The impression I get is that they regard the present price recession as temporary and are basing their findings on the past and on an assumed future pickup.  That pickup is not going to happen.  The present Common Agricultural Policy proposals are for a further 10 per cent drop in milk prices and 15 per cent in beef.</P>
    <P>I am not asking for any allowance for that until it happens.  What I am asking for is a directive from the Minister to the Department to work with the prices that now exist, not the historic high of a few years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank Deputy Nealon for his good wishes.  Certainly, I can assure him that I will endeavour to deal efficiently with whatever complaint he has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>He has raised a specific case. If he supplies me with details of the case I will have it examined as a matter of priority and deal effectively with it.  The legislation has the flexibility to deal with fluctuating farm incomes.  The Department are always willing to re-examine the means of any client whose income from farming has fallen.</P>
      <P>Means from farming for unemployment assistance and for non-contributory pension purposes is assessed under specific provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.  The legislation provides that the yearly value of any advantage accruing to the claimant from the use of property &mdash; other than property personally used and enjoyed by the claimant, such as a dwelling &mdash; is assessable for means.</P>
      <P>The value of the yearly advantage is essentially based on the income from the farm less any expenses actually and necessarily incurred in earning that income.  The basis of the calculation is the net, income from the farm over the 12 months preceding the date of the investigation adusted where necessary to reflect significant changes in farm prices or any other factors which will impact on farm incomes.  From time to time there are cases where farms are infected by animal diseases which seriously affect their incomes.  There is provision for taking that deterioration in income into account.  This means that in assessing means, account is taken of the current level of and emerging trends in farm incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to state for the benefit of Deputies that it is open to smallholders in receipt of unemployment assistance or non-contributory pensioners who consider they may be entitled to a higher rate of payment as a result of a significant <Col N="1264" /> reduction in their means due to a decline in farm incomes to apply, in the normal manner, to have their means assessment reviewed.  Such cases would generally be reviewed at some later date so that the ongoing means assessment would reflect the normal situation.  Smallholders who now consider that they might be eligible for unemployment assistance as a result of a fall in their incomes should also apply to the local offices of the Department of Social Welfare to have a re-assessment of their means carried out.  Pensioners should apply to the pension services office which, as the Deputy is aware, is in Sligo, his constituency.</P>
    <P>The relevant legislation and the interpretation of this legislation are kept under review to ensure that it accurately reflects changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would point out also that despite the deterioration in farm incomes there has been no upsurge in requests for means reviews from existing smallholder claimants nor is there any upsurge in fresh applications from smallholders.  I would not say that the great bulk of small farmers &mdash; about 12,500 &mdash; in receipt of assistance are all satisfied but there has not been any upsurge in new claimants nor is there any upsurge in applications to have means re-assessed on the basis that incomes have declined because of changes in farm incomes during the past year.</P>
    <P>This matter cannot be dealt with in a general way.  Each case will be examined on an individual basis and will be treated on its merits.  If the Deputy has details of the claimant with whom he spoke I will have it examined thoroughly and will communicate the outcome to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise a very important national issue.  Before dealing with it I join with Deputy Nealon in wishing the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Daly, every success in his new portfolio. As Minister for Defence I found him very co-operative and forthcoming.  This matter does not relate to the Minister for <Col N="1265" /> Social Welfare but rather to the Minister for Justice.  With all due respect to the Minister for Social Welfare I regret that the Minister for Justice, even at this late hour did not come to deal with this important issue which relates to the liability attached to farmers and landowners nationwide when people us their land for any reason.</P>
      <P>The people of rural Ireland have always extended goodwill to visitors whether from at home or abroad who wish to use the countryside for sport, game shooting, hunting or who wish to have access to rivers and lakes.  The liability attached to this good will is more than farmers should be expected to take. If somebody is injured on a person's property, the owner of the property can be held liable.  For his goodwill a farmer could find himself having to sell out. Farms in this country are small and some are picturesque and are open to tourism which is a vital national interest we are trying to develop but to develop tourism we need the goodwill of farmers and land owners.  People should be able to park their cars in laneways, driveways and farm yards and go across country to pursue whatever sport they wish.</P>
      <P>The goodwill is there at present but it has come to my notice that many farmers have been advised by their farm organisations or solicitors that they should notify guesthouse owners who house visitors, that the visitors are no longer welcome on the land.  Notices to this effect have been posted on many farms, and gates have been locked.  This is a retrograde step.  The farmers have the right to protect their property but, with or without permission, if a person is injured on private property, the farmer can be held liable.  The Minister should introduce legislation to amend this outdated law so that the goodwill can continue and tourism develop unhindered.  If the Ministers takes my comments on board as well as comments made on the radio and in the national newspapers recently he will realise that concern is being expressed and that it is time for legislation to be brought in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his remarks.  The Minister for Justice is aware of concerns expressed by farmers in relation to their possible liability in law for personal injuries which may be sustained by entrants onto their property. Farmers are particularly worried about their legal obligation to sportspersons in particular and are threatening to deny them access to farmlands.  This anxiety arises from a perception that the law as it stands is unclear and that the farmer is vulnerable to claims for injury.  Whatever about the accuracy of that view farmers want a statutory provision which would exempt them from any liability or duty of care to any person who uses their land for sporting or recreational purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of the law concerned is occupiers' liability.  It is complex and involves many groups other than farmers including all people who own property, industry and business interests, ordinary householders, sporting organisations, local authorities and the State itself.  For this reason I took the view that the subject is an ideal one for consideration.  I experienced this as Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works. People who had monastic settlements and historic sites on their property had problems with people gaining access to these areas.  For this reason the Minister took the view that the subject is an ideal one for consideration by the Law Reform Commission.  The problems posed are topical and practical and directly affect many different and opposing interests. The commission by following their usual practice of publishing a consultation paper on the subject, would be in the best position to elicit the views of the many interests involved and to make recommendations for changes in the law. Conscious of farmers' concerns the Minister for Justice discussed the matter with the Attorney General in recent weeks and he agreed to request the commission to examine the law relating to occupiers' liability and to prepare a report for him with recommendations.  That is the present position so far as the Minister for Justice is concerned.  This relates to <Col N="1267" /> occupiers' liability, a very complex and involved area, and the Minister feels that the Law Reform Commission are the best people to examine this and to make recommendations on it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe was founded in 1947 to promote the economic reconstruction of Europe and strengthen East-West economic relations.</P>
    <P>The profound political and economic changes which have taken place in Europe in the past few years, particularly in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, have prompted a reassessment of the ECE's role.  This review has led to agreement in 1990 among the member states on its future activities which are to be concentrated in five priority areas, namely, environment, transport, statistics, trade facilitation and economic analysis.  It has also been agreed that the ECE should be active in a number of areas of lower priority but nevertheless of importance to the Central and Eastern European economies in transition.  These areas include undertaking analytical work on the difficulties associated with privatising enterprises and the adjustment of government institutions, policies and methods to conform to a market oriented economy.</P>
    <P>The ECE is a valuable forum for East-West economic dialogue and co-operation. This is particularly so because it brings together all countries of Eastern and Western Europe, as well as the United States and Canada.  In addition, dialogue and co-operation will be enhanced by ensuring that the ECE and the various other bodies in East-West economic co-operation co-ordinate their activities.  These include the OECD, the Council of Europe and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development as well as the activities carried on in the CSCE framework.  The European Community takes the view that the activities of the ECE should dovetail with those of other organisations.  In this regard the representation of the ECE at CSCE meetings serves an essential purpose, as does the participation of the Community and the member states in the annual sessions of the ECE.</P>

      <P>Ireland shares fully the attitude of the Twelve to the Ukraine, as expressed in the declaration issued by Foreign Ministers on 2 December.</P>
      <P>In that declaration, the European Community and its member states took note of the referendum in the Ukraine and welcomed the democratic manner in which the Ukrainian people declared their wish for their republic to attain full sovereignty.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that, as the transformation of the Soviet Union enters a crucial phase, it is incumbent upon the representatives of Ukraine, of the Union and of the other republics to take matters forward in a peaceful, democratic and orderly way.  They called upon the Ukraine to pursue with the Union and the other republics an open and constuctive dialogue intended to ensure that all the Soviet Union's existing international obligations and commitments are carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Twelve expect the Ukraine to honour all commitments undertaken by the Soviet Union in the CSCE process, <Col N="1057" /> especially those concerning the protection of persons belonging to national minorities.  They also expect the Ukraine to honour and, as appropriate, implement all the Soviet Union's international obligations in respect of arms control and nuclear non-proliferation, and to do nothing which might call into question control of nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory.  They expect Ukraine to join the other republics in accepting joint and several liability for the Soviet Union's foreign debts.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach met the former President of Lebanon, Amin Gemayel, during his visit to Ireland in October. Amin Gemayel was paying a private visit to this country and on 14 October he made a courtesy call on the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government and the other governments in the European Community have consistently supported the Taif Accords which were adopted by the Lebanese Parliament in October 1989. These accords envisage the Lebanese State extending its authority over the entire Lebanese territory by means of its own internal forces assisted by Syrian troops.  Lebanon and Syria concluded a defence and security agreement on 1 September last, which provides for security and military co-operation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that both Syrian and Israeli troops continue to be present in Lebanon but the Taif Accords have provided a framework which I believe can restore greater stability to Lebanon and help to bring about a Lebanon free of foreign troops.</P>

      <P>The welfare of migrant workers was not discussed at the recent meeting of Foreign Ministers to prepare the European Council at Maastricht.  The only provision of the new Treaty which is related to this subject is the proposal to give the European Parliament an increased role in processing of legislation on migrant workers from within the Community.</P>
      <P>The rights of Community migrant workers are guaranteed by the EC Treaty and by a series of Council Regulations which provide them with social security rights, such as health and pension benefits and the transferability of these rights within the territory of the Community.</P>
      <P>The welfare of migrant workers from without the Community is a matter for each member state to regulate.  In Ireland a migrant worker who pays PRSI is entitled to full social welfare benefits on the same basis as an Irish person.</P>
      <P>The Community has made clear its abhorrence of discrimination against migrants whether from the Community itself or from third countries.  In 1986 the Council, the Parliament and the Commission jointly adopted a declaration against racism and xenophobia.  This declaration has been attached to the basic texts governing the Community.  In the course of its meeting this week, the European Council reaffirmed this declaration. The Heads of State and Government also reaffirmed their revulsion against all aspects of racism and xenophobia including in particular expressions of prejudice and violence against foreign immigrants. In doing this they were restating the condemnation which was adopted in Dublin at the European Council in June of last year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Head of Mission provides regular reports to the EC Presidency on the various matters relating to the work of <Col N="1060" /> the mission.  These reports are confidential in nature, and it would not be appropriate for me to make their contents public.  To do so would make the work of the monitors more difficult and could, in certain circumstances, endanger their safety.</P>
    <P>The Government welcome Security Council resolution 721/91 in which the Council undertook to examine and take appropriate action without delay upon any recommendation of the Secretary-General for the possible establishment of a United Nations peace keeping operation. No decision has yet been taken by the Security Council to establish a peace-keeping operation in Yugoslavia.  The Secretary-General's Special Envoy, Mr. Cyrus Vance, has visited that country on two occasions to assess the prospects for such an operation which is dependent on a number of essential factors, including a durable cease-fire respected by all the parties involved.  It remains to be seen what decision the Security Council will take on foot of the recommendations that the Secretary-General will make.  The question of participation by Ireland in any peace-keeping operation that may be established does not therefore arise at this time.  Should any request for participation in a UN operation be received, it would, of course, receive very careful consideration by the Government.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that a separately convened summit meeting of the type described by the Deputy would confer at this time benefits that would be additional to those obtainable under existing arrangements.</P>
      <P>Within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) the participating states from Europe and North America met at the highest level at the Paris summit in November 1990.  The Helsinki follow-up meeting, which will also involve Heads of Government, is due to take place in March 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition various more specialised <Col N="1062" /> meetings within the CSCE process provide valuable fora for the discussion of co-operation.</P>
    <P>The European Community and its member states are involved centrally in the international effort to encourage and support economic and political reform in Central and Eastern Europe.  I have detailed the Community's own contribution in a reply to Deputy Deasy on 7 November.  The Commission also serves as chairman of the Group of 24 co-ordination framework for assistance to Central and Eastern Europe.  The G24 provides a most useful point of contact between the donors and recipients of economic assistance.  The most recent ministerial level meeting on 11 November was attended by representatives of Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania and the Baltic States as well as by G24 Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Community's own contacts with the Central and Eastern European countries are already intensive.  The signature next week of association agreements between the EC and Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia will mark a further stage in the development of relations. These agreements cover a wide range of co-operation and provide for regular political dialogue including consultations at the highest level.  It is envisaged that similar agreements will be negotiated in due course with all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Soviet Union is rapidly evolving and further developments could well have implications for representation of that area at international meetings.  Economic aid is being supplied by the Community in the form of food aid and technical assistance. Formulation and implementation of EC measures of assistance involve intensive contact between Community officials and Soviet and Republican representatives and these are continuing.</P>

      <P>My Department attach a very high priority to the promotion of Irish economic interests abroad.  In the training and development of members of the Irish diplomatic service and in their direction of the work of our diplomatic and consular missions abroad, the Department lay great emphasis on all aspects of the promotion of foreign earnings, including help to Irish exporters, tourism and the attraction of foreign investment to Ireland.  Close liaison is maintained in this work with the home economic departments and with the offices of the main promotional semi-State agencies at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>All officers are aware of the importance of this work and missions abroad are expected to give it particular attention.</P>
      <P>Before going abroad, a number of officers at junior level will have had the opportunity to serve in the foreign earnings division of the Department.  In the course of its work that division maintains close contract on a range of issues relating to Irish economic interests abroad with the Department of Industry and Commerce and other home Departments as well as with semi-State agencies such as the IDA, the Irish Trade Board and Board Fáilte.</P>
      <P>At a more senior level, officers of the Department, and in particular the heads of our diplomatic and consular missions, make it a practice to call on the relevant economic Departments at home, on the head offices of semi-State agencies and, where relevant, on some of the business firms in Ireland with interests in the country concerned before taking up a new posting abroad and again when home on leave in Ireland.  In this way they have the opportunity to brief themselves fully on the opportunities for Irish exports and other broader Irish economic interests in the countries in which they serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Abroad, the particular nature of the <Col N="1064" /> economic work of an embassy or consulate will depend on a number of factors, including the economic system of the country concerned, the opportunities it offers for Irish economic interests and whether or not the main Irish promotional semi-State agencies maintain offices in the countries concerned.  Wherever there are such offices our missions work in close co-operation with the local representatives, and in certain cases, where local circumstances make this desirable or necessary, a representative of the Irish Trade Board or of the IDA may be based in the Embassy premises or nominated as a member of the diplomatic staff of the Embassy.  In certain of the more important embassies, officers of home economic Departments such as Agriculture and Food and Industry and Commerce work on secondment as part of the staff of the Embassy.</P>
    <P>In countries where Irish promotional agencies are not represented, the officers of our embassies and consulates have a more direct role in promotional work and in facilitating Irish exporters and other business interests, in liaison as necessary with the relevant Irish semi-State agencies.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to give a high priority in the work of my Department to the promotion of foreign earnings and will ensure that, so far as possible, the training and development of officers of the Department will be such as to ensure that they will be capable of advancing our economic interests abroad to best effect.</P>

      <P>In 1988, my Department began an internal market information campaign directed at all business sectors. Seminars on the challenges, the opportunities and the implications of the completion of the Single European Market were held at 16 locations throughout the country.  A total of 10,000 copies of a Departmental booklet on <i>1992: the Opportunities and the Challenge for Business</i> were circulated and a number of leaflets on specific business topics were also prepared and circulated.  In addition, information packs on business development generally, on domestic and export market implications and on technology <Col N="1072" /> and standards implications were prepared and circulated by the agencies under the aegis of my Department.</P>
      <P>Since then, I and my officials have continued to keep Irish industry informed of new developments.  In particular, as is the usual practice of my Department when specific measures under my responsibility are being negotiated, the views of the relevant industrial and commercial interests are sought and subsequently taken into account in formulating the national position.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the Minister for Trade and Marketing hosted a series of seminars, in seven regional locations, entitled <i>Countdown 92</i> which focused on the marketing challenge which will be presented by the completion of the Single European Market.</P>
      <P>My Department's agencies for their part ensure that the requirement and demands of the Single Market are fully taken into account in their ongoing relationship and dealings with Irish companies. For example, in the case of An Bord Tráchtála a key focus of the organisation is the growth and integration of Irish business in the internal market.  To that end, considerable additional resources have, with the support of the Structural Funds, been allocated to the marketing support area since 1989.  These resources are being targeted on programmes, such as ABT's regional markets and targeted marketing consultancy programme which are geared to improving Irish firms ability to compete in the Single European Market.</P>

      <P>Up to 1970, retiring forestry workers were only entitled to a pension under the Social Welfare Acts.  From 1 January 1970 a non-contributory pension scheme for non-established State employees was <Col N="1073" /> introduced to supplement their social welfare pensions.</P>
      <P>Forest worker pensions are co-ordinated with the particular type of social welfare pension or benefit applicable on the retirees last day of paid service.  A worker retiring on age grounds has his forestry pension co-ordinated with the social welfare retirement pension or old age pension as appropriate.  A worker retiring on ill-health grounds has his forestry pension co-ordinated with social welfare disability benefit or invalidity pension as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The person concerned retired on ill-health grounds in 1986 and his initial forestry pension was co-ordinated with social welfare disability benefit.  He was awarded old age (contributory) pension by Department of Social Welfare from 23 September 1988.  The forestry pension fell due to be reduced then in accordance with the terms of the pension scheme because the old age pension rate is higher than the disability benefit.  However the combined pensions, in general in such cases should remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>The pensions of all forest worker pensioners who retire on ill-health grounds are due to be reduced from the time they receive from Department of Social Welfare, either the retirement pension (age 65) or the old age pension (age 66).</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed a carer's allowance on 22 April 1991.  Her claim was refused as the person for whom she was providing care was in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance (DPMA).  Those caring for persons in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance did not come within the scope of the carer's allowance at that stage.</P>
      <P>However, in July 1991 the carer's allowance scheme was amended to include carers of DPMA recipients.  As part of the general arrangements to bring the extension into practical effect, a claim form for carer's allowance was then sent to the person concerned for completion. There is no record of this form having been received back in my Department. The client telephoned my Department in September 1991 and, on the basis of this telephone call, the client's original application for carer's allowance was fully reactivated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The claim was sent to a social welfare officer for investigation in October 1991. This officer will be calling to the client <Col N="1075" /> on 16 December 1991 to complete this investigation.  When the officer's report is received a decision will be made on the client's claim without delay.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for unemployment assistance on 28 June 1991.  Her claim was investigated and under the terms of the legislation governing the scheme a deciding officer assessed means against her of half the weekly value of her husband's pension.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme, as her husband's income is over £55 per week, she is not entitled to an adult dependant's allowance in respect of him and she is entitled to only half the appropriate child dependant allowances.  This means that the maximum rate appropriate to her and her children is £68 a week less half the value of her husband's pension which leaves her entitled to payment of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £34.80.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to the combined entitlements of the person concerned and her husband who had previously been entitled to disability benefit is being reviewed at present and it is likely that an improved overall entitlement position can be authorised for the June to September period.  I will communicate with the Deputy shortly on this matter.</P>
      <P>If her income is not sufficient to meet her needs, the person concerned should apply to her local community welfare officer for supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 75 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>In assessing means for unemployment assistance purposes, the Social Welfare Acts provide that a disability pension under the Army Pension Act must be assessed as means except in so far as such amount does not exceed £80 per annum.</P>
      <P>When the person concerned applied for unemployment assistance in 1984 his means were assessed as nil.  He was subsequently awarded an Army disability pension retrospectively to 1982 and this pension was first paid in 1985.  He was paid unemployment assistance at the maximum rate applicable in his case to 16 March 1991.</P>
      <P>In January 1991 it came to notice that he had been awarded an Army disability pension from the Department of Defence from September 1982.  As a result of a review of his means he was assessed with weekly means of £66.40 from the date of his original claim on 29 August 1984.  This assessment was based on the information received from the Department of Defence.  However, due to a misreading of the Department of Defence communication it was assumed that the Army disability pension was in payment from September 1982 and the person concerned was assessed with an overpayment of unemployment assistance amounting to £16,099.98 in respect of the period 1984 to 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> It has now been confirmed that the person concerned received his first Army disability pension payment in April 1985 retrospective to 1982.  There is a general obligation on all claimants to notify my Department of any material change in their circumstances.  Accordingly, under a strict interpretation of the legislation, a substantial overpayment seems to have occurred and to be repayable.  It is accepted, however, that the claimant did not make any false or misleading statement at the time of his application and I am having the case re-examined to see what latitude can be applied in the very special circumstances of this case.</P>

      <P>Since the introduction of the loan guarantee fund, over 320 families have been introduced to credit union membership by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and loans, which are guaranteed by the fund, have been arranged on their behalf.  In addition, the society have assisted some 500 people with financial problems through their debt advisory clinics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal objective of the fund is to break the borrowers's reliance on expensive credit sources such as moneylenders. This is done by assisting the client to develop a budget which takes account of his or her commitments while at the same time providing access to cheaper credit sources via the loan guarantee fund.  Participation in the scheme is open to those who are prepared to accept this budget based approach to their financial <Col N="1078" /> difficulties.  However, each case is decided by the society on its own merits.</P>
    <P>The amount of money utilised in 1991 is not yet available.  However, the overall fund is now in excess of £225,000 all of which has been lodged with credit unions in surety accounts for the purposes of guaranteeing loans.  The amount in excess of £200,000 arises from interest payments on the original fund of £200,000.</P>
    <P>My Department are at present conducting a review of the operation of the loan guarantee fund which will be completed shortly.</P>

      <P>The information in the format sought by the Deputy is not available to my Department.  As I indicated to the House recently, I am concerned to ensure that action is taken to tackle the most pressing problems in this area.</P>
      <P>As a first step, I consider it vital that accurate and reliable data is available to my Department from all the agencies concerned.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware that the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, under the chairmanship of Professor David Kennedy, addressed the whole question of the effective organisation and delivery of out-patient services. The group, in their recently published report, recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that a number of important steps should be taken as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each hospital should immediately undertake a systematic review of their <Col N="1086" /> out-patient services, focussing on patient need and the manner in which the service is provied.</P>
    <P>Each hospital should immediately establish, where it does not already exist, and out-patient services group, representative of medical, nursing and administrative staff, to assist in the co-ordination and day-to-day operation of out-patient services and to devise strategies to tackle key problems.</P>
    <P>The appropriate method of organising out-patient clinics should be through specific rather than block booking of patients.</P>
    <P>Booking times and intervals should be reviewed and measured regularly by the out-patient services group as a key indicator of the performance of the service.  Such information should be brought to the attention of individual consultants on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Consultants should be notified regularly of the average waiting time for a routine appointment in their clinics. Furthermore, in order to minimise the disruption caused by non-attenders at clinics, each consultant's list should be regularly validated where patients are waiting six months or more for a first appointment.</P>
    <P>This group have recently been re-convened and part of their new remit is to pursue the implementation of the recommendations in relation to out-patient services in the Dublin hospitals.  In addition, health boards and hospital authorities in the area outside of Dublin have been asked by my Department to consider the good practice recommendations contained in the report and to report back to my Department on their plans for the implemenation of the recommendations, including those in relation to out-patient services.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to an oral question on this subject, on 28 November 1991, in which the matter is fully dealt with.</P>
      <P>Regarding questions (2) to (12) the information requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P>2-3.  Contracts of sale were exchanged on 19 April 1989 and completed on 20 April 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4-5.  A deposit of £22,500 was lodged to the health board account on 4 May 1989, the balance of £202,500, less legal <Col N="1089" /> fees and expenses, was lodged to the health board's account on 4 May 1989.</P>
    <P>6.  These funds, together with other capital moneys, were used to fund the development of nine specific projects in the health board area.</P>
    <P>7-8.  My predecessor gave his agreement in October 1988 to the proposed sale, subject to the reversion condition. Because of the circumstances of the sale which I have outlined in my reply on 28 November auctioneers were not notified of the proposed sale.</P>
    <P>9.  The health board obtained valuations from both the valuation office and from local auctioneers and valuers. The valuation office valued the land at £550,000 which &ldquo;might be regarded as an optimistic figure or `asking price' leaving some leeway for negotiation&rdquo;, on the basis that half of the land was at development value and the remainder at strong agricultural price.  The local auctioneers and valuers valued the total property at £285,000 &ldquo;on an existing use basis for agricultural purposes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>10-11.  On 1 May 1989, with the closing of the sale, title to the land passed to the purchaser.  However, a section of the purchaser's organisation had occupied the land some weeks previously in the mistaken belief that they already had title to it.  The health board immediately pointed this out to the purchaser who gave a written commitment to refund any rents received by them from any letting of the land, to the health board in the event of the sale falling through.</P>
    <P>12.  The reversion terms can only be activated after 19 April 1992 in the event of the purchaser failing to comply with the condition in the contract of sale.</P>

      <P>Children are assessed by the health board <Col N="1090" /> for the provision of orthodontic treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department.  There are no category A cases, which is the category of greatest severity, currently awaiting treatment in the Longford/Westmeath area.</P>
      <P>I understand from the board that a total of 462 children in other categories are on the waiting list for treatment in the Longford/Westmeath community care area.</P>
      <P>Orthodontic services for the Longford/Westmeath area are currently provided by the health board through sessional arrangements with two private orthodontists.  Despite the recently improved salary and conditions approved for consultant orthodontists the board were unsuccessful in recruiting a person to fill the vacant consultant post in a recent competition.  The board are now considering what other options are available to them to improve the service being provided.</P>

      <P>There are nine public elective orthopaedic centres in the country and each of these carries out a wide variety of elective procedures including hip replacements.</P>
      <P>The cost of a hip replacement operation reflects a number of variable factors such as the age of the patient, the complexity of the patient's medical condition, the length of stay, and the occupancy rate in the unit.

      <P>The total cost of the refurbishment in question, including fitting out the new facilities, is £1.67 million approximately.</P>
      <P>The project involved the provision of a new centre for boys and the addition of a new long-stay unit to the existing short term facility for seven girls at Oberstown Girls Centre.</P>
      <P>The new centre for boys has an initial capacity to take ten boys on remand and a further four on long term detention. This capacity will increase to 12 remand places and to 24 long-stay places in the coming months.  The new unit for girls has an initial capacity of four long-stay places and this will rise to eight such places in the coming months.</P>
      <P>The care staffing complement in the new unit for girls will be as follows: one team leader, nine care staff and three night supervisors.</P>
      <P>However, as an integral part of Oberstown Girls Centre, the unit falls under the control of the centre's overall director and deputy director.  It also has access to medical, maintenance, cooking and cleaning services which are provided to the centre on a part-time basis.  Occupants of the new unit also avail of a comprehensive educational programme which services both the boys and the girls centres.</P>
      <P>The projected annual running cost of Oberstown Boys Centre is £1.7 million. The corresponding figure for the Girls Centre is £0.8 million.</P>

      <P>The provision of a new school for Scoil Chríost Rí, Dún Dealgan, Contae Lú has been approved and the preparation of tender documents for the project is in hands.  These will be completed at the earliest possible date and the question of the invitation of tenders will then come for consideration in the context of the 1992 capital allocation for primary school building.  I am not in a position at this stage, to say when building works will commence.</P>
      <P>This school received permanent recognition from my Department in 1984.  The Deputy will appreciate that the various formalities in relation to a building project i.e. site acquisition and architectural planning including local authority approval are necessarily time consuming.</P>
