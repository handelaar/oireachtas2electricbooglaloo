May I ask the Taoiseach in respect of prospective delegated legislation if the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications proposes to issue a directive under section 110 of the Postal and Telecommunications Acts to An Post in respect of their viability plan?  In particular, does he propose to make any provision for Exchequer support for that body, as envisaged under section 110 of that Act, to enable them to meet the financial requirements of any Government directive not to do things which they would otherwise do on the basis of financial considerations?</P>

    <Title>Marine Institute Bill, 1989: Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 25, after &ldquo;social sciences,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;hydrography and oceanography,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Before I refer to my amendment I would just acknowledge the Minister for the Marine opposite me.  I hope that during our term in this area we will have very productive and constructive dialogue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was argued by the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Noonan, during Committee Stage, that the words proposed to be inserted were redundant and did not <Col N="7" /> need to be part of the Bill as it stands. However, this Bill is of enormous importance, and I know that everybody in the House, particularly the Minister, will agree that the whole future of the marine, its protection and productivity, and the implementation of an Act that will allow research and development into the marine is vital, particularly taking two points into consideration.  First, we are an island nation surrounded by the sea and I hope that more and more in the future we will be able to consider the sea as one of our main areas of productivity; second, when other industries are coming under tremendous pressure and are being cut back, the development of the marine must be one of our primary objectives, so that job creation in this area will make up for what is being lost in other industries.</P>
    <P>I would urge that hydrography and oceanography be included in the Bill.  We have not paid enough attention to these matters up to now.  Within the whole context of the Single European Market and competition within Europe, the market with regard to fisheries will be very competitive.  We have been told by world researchers that we have not yet begun to exploit the potential with regard to minerals and other products which come from the sea.  Therefore, rather than hydrography and oceanography being seen to be redundant it is worth highlighting their importance and providing for them in the Bill.  The Marine Institute should carry out research in this area and use it in a practicable and productive way.  I urge the Minister to consider this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Madeleine Taylor-Quinn asked on Committee Stage that hydrography and oceanography be included in the Bill.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, replied: &ldquo;As requested by the Deputy I will have it examined&rdquo;.  I would like to think that upon examination the Minister will accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to put on the <Col N="8" /> record of the House my great pleasure in having Deputy Monica Barnes, an intelligent, articulate daughter of Breffni, appointed as spokesperson in the House in matters of the marine.  With her, as she said, I look forward to a combination of skills to improve matters in the marine area throughout her spokespersonship.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Barnes has said, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who has been bereaved and consequently could not take this Report Stage, indicated that he would examine the amendment as put down on Committee Stage and see if it was necessary to have it included in the Bill.  I note what Deputy Barnes said about the importance of the sea and the sciences connected with it.  I know what she said is true and we should be committed, as she said, to harvesting the sea and using it sanely in accordance with environmental principles for the development of productivity.  I agree that hydrography and oceanography are two important sciences connected with the sea and I think that a distinguished Member from the Deputy's party had expertise in that area which my Department used in a number of projects.</P>
      <P>I am not underestimating the importance of the two disciplines but the point was made on Committee Stage &mdash; and which I am now repeating &mdash; that those two disciplines can be quite adequately covered within the terms of the Bill and the scope of the activity laid down for the Marine Institute.  It would be superfluous to include these two because they are already covered by the terms of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome Deputy Barnes as spokesperson on the Marine for Fine Gael although I will miss Deputy Taylor-Quinn who contributed enormously, in my short time in the House, to marine affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> I support the amendment and the Minister's reply did not change my mind.  It is of great importance to include the two words in the Bill and I cannot see why they cannot be applied to the Bill.  This section very clearly states that &ldquo;research and development&rdquo; includes research into all pure and applied sciences, including economics and social sciences, investigations, tests, experiments, analyses and other studies and the application of science and technology to innovation and development.  I cannot understand why the Minister cannot accept &ldquo;hydrography&rdquo; and &ldquo;oceanography&rdquo; because they are very important.  Obviously the Minister will not reconsider his decision but I should hate to go through Report Stage of the Bill in the way we debated Committee Stage, when not a single word was taken from this side of the House in any amendment or form.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that all the brains in relation to the Marine Institute and marine development do not lie on that side of the House.  Our contribution has been modest but very productive in the sense that we tried our best to table amendments which complemented the Bill.  I am disappointed that we are starting this morning with a Stonewall Jackson stance by the Minister.  I had hoped he would have adopted a different approach.  I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to hear that the Minister of State suffered a bereavement and cannot be with us.  I join in the welcome to Deputy Barnes.  One of the liveliest debates on this Bill on Committee Stage concerned the location for the institute and, given the renewed advantage which the claim for Dún Laoghaire now has, I am very tempted to reopen discussion on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I did not get very far with it on Committee Stage so I had better leave it.  Like Deputy O'Sullivan. <Col N="10" /> I am sorry that we have lost Deputy Taylor-Quinn as spokesperson but I am sure we will be able to keep in touch with her exploits by listening to Saturday radio.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister has not responded positively to this amendment. We had a very frustrating Committee Stage as not a single amendment was accepted by the Government.  We were given a couple of indications that some amendments would be reconsidered for Report Stage and we hoped for a positive response from the Government which would have meant that Committee Stage was not as frustrating as it seemed at the time.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed for a second reason in that the Bill is very narrow, much narrower than that recommended by the task force which was set up to recommend on the establishment of a Marine Institute.  The definition of &ldquo;marine&rdquo; is very narrow and we discussed it on Committee Stage.  The areas for research are defined in a fairly narrow way.  The Minister's argument that the definition is all encompassing could equally be applied to the references to economics and social sciences which would qualify as applied sciences just as oceanography and hydrography qualify according to the Minister's all embracing definition.  Yet they are specifically included to make a point that the role and research brief of the institute would include these areas. Deputy Barnes's case for the inclusion of hydrography and oceanography is very well founded and their omission, particularly the Government's explicit exclusion of them, may be interpreted at some future stage as meaning that the Marine Institute may not involve itself in these areas, which is greatly disappointing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I probably would have been excluded from that.  I also wish to thank Deputy Taylor-Quinn for her thorough briefing and support here this morning.  That also applies to the other Deputies and, like them, I express my disappointment because the Minister in his reply recognised that our arguments were valid.  As we know, there are vast resources in the ocean which have not yet been tapped.  Indeed, globally, it is seen as one of the great resources left to us because we have undermined and indeed destroyed so many of the other natural resources.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for paying tribute to the fact that the two sciences of hydrography and oceanography are specialised and specialist.  I am sure the Minister will agree that it is an area into which we did not have much input.  As other Members said throughout the debate, we welcome the Bill and realise how fundamentally necessary it is to us because of our dependence on the sea and because we have not used it as productively as other countries, with far less water and seas available to them, have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my hope that the Minister will give us a pledge that he will provide the necessary investment, staff and resources for this institute to allow them carry out the research we want to see carried out but what concerns us on this side of the House is that since these two important sciences are not specifically named in the Bill they might not be given priority and the institute will be able to say with some validity, particularly if the investment and resources are not as generous as both we and the institute would like them to be, that these areas were not highlighted in the Bill and they have to give priority to those areas mentioned.  It was with <Col N="12" /> that in mind that we on this side of the House strongly argued in favour of the amendment on Committee Stage.  We believe that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, was moved by our arguments and we had hoped that the Minister would have been more positive in responding.  I would suggest to him even at this late stage that it would be worth including this amendment as it would ensure that these very important sciences are given the right priority and importance having regard to the fact that little research has been carried out in these areas in this country to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make the point that just because they are not specifically mentioned it does not mean that they are excluded.  I could not accept the principle that anything which is not mentioned specifically in the Bill is excluded because if I did I would be going against the meaning of the wording of the section.  By mentioning hydrogrpahy and oceanography in the amendment she has put down, the Deputy is indicating that this is marine research.  If we examine section 4 carefully we will see that marine research and development is mentioned in subsection (1) and in paragraphs (c), (f), (g) and (h) of subsection (2) while marine resource is mentioned in paragraph (d) and marine matters in paragraph (e).  What I am saying is that I have no doubt that hydrography and oceanography are covered by the wording of the section.  What leads me to accept that fully is the fact that both branches of marine science are being developed within the State and will come within the ambit of the Marine Institute.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="13" /> In page 4, line 7, after &ldquo;employment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and protect the environment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment was considered briefly on Committee Stage when the Minister of State gave an undertaking to consider it further before Report Stage.  Since then the overall picture with regard to the body of legislation dealing with the environment has become somewhat clearer. The Environment Protection Agency Bill is now before the Seanad but that Bill does not contain any provision dealing with the marine environment.  It would appear that its brief stops at the high water mark.  The Sea Pollution Bill, which will come up for consideration in this House separately, deals virtually exclusively with pollution from ships and falls short of dealing in a comprehensive way with the wider issue of pollution at sea.</P>
    <P>This Bill, which will establish an institute which will have responsibility for research and development, does not deal with the marine environment.  The section that I seek to amend deals with the general functions of the institute which as far as they go are quite correct but it is disturbing that there is no acknowledgment of the environment.  It seems that the functions as set out reinforce the traditional exploitative attitude towards the sea, which regards the sea as a great fish pond which can be exploited for economic gain or for its seabed resources for economic purposes.</P>
    <P>There is no acknowledgment of the sensitivity of the sea even though we are now aware of the great dangers posed to the marine environment.  There are many examples one could give.  As we speak we are aware of the ecological devastation being caused in the Gulf as a result of the war and of what happens to the sea when it is not treated sensitively.  We are also aware of the dangers posed by radioactive pollution in the Irish Sea and that an amendment which dealt specifically with the threat posed by Sellafield was not accepted by the Government on Committee Stage.  We are further aware, and <Col N="14" /> this matter has been raised with the Minister for the Marine, of the environmental problems associated with fish farming.  It is a serious omission that there is no specific reference in the Bill to the marine environment.  Such a reference should be included, otherwise I fear we will end up with a Marine Institute which will lay emphasis on research and development, with an over-economic bias, and not acknowledge the sensitivity of the sea and the problems associated with the marine environment.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will respond positively on this occasion to the commitment given on Committee Stage to look at the amendment again before Report Stage and agree to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Gilmore when he says that this is one of the more important amendments to be retabled on Report Stage.  He also outlined the progress which has been made in the area of environmental protection since then and argued that the responsibility for environmental protection could slip through the net of both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Sea Pollution Bill.  One of the lessons we have learned at great cost to ourselves in the recent past is that we have exploited the natural resources of this planet to such an extent that they are not self-sustaining and not even money will make a difference.</P>
      <P>If any lesson is to be learned for the future of this planet, and particularly for legislation which refers to the four-fifths of this planet, the seas and marine life therein, it is that whereas we have destroyed forests, we have acid rain, nuclear stations and radiation polluting our waters, we must make sure that at least part of the sea remains unpolluted and unexploited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of our experience, and of what can be done on the economic side, as Deputy Gilmore pointed out, short cuts can be taken.  We can act in the short term without realising even politically that the long-term gains are not very <Col N="15" /> popular, hence many of the environmental difficulties we are now experiencing. However, we have no excuse now.  Failure to protect our environment up to now could be said to be due to ignorance and not realising the long-term effects.  No longer can we make that claim and that argument is not valid now.  Legislators in every parliament and forum in the world have a responsibility to give priority to protection of the environment. All legislation we introduce from now on must be considered in the light of the impact it will have on our environment, how it endangers it or how it protects it.  The best way to emphasise this is to include a reference to it in the Bill.  Then it will have the necessary legal standing. The protection of the environment must be seen as a priority in all our legislation.</P>
    <P>In my short experience as spokesperson for the Marine I have been amazed at the very different stands that can be adopted.  On the one hand there is a tremendous argument in favour of fish farming and on the other hand environmentalists may take a consistent stand against it.  The whole progress and process of producing and harvesting from the marine are characterised by conflict, tension and argument.  It is important that we as legislators make the correct decisions in such regard and this is where the institute will be of importance.</P>
    <P>In an area so complex and to some extent unknown it is all the more important that written into the Bill must be a provision for protection of the environment. Fish farming, marine life, mono-filament netting, the future of species of fish, and the effects of radiation on such species, can be packaged in one term, protection of the environment in which these species will not alone survive but will be healthy.  That is important not only for the sake of the species because none of us has the right to destroy any species, but for humans who are being urged to eat more fish for a healthy life and so on.  It would be a fine irony if in urging healthy living and healthy eating we damaged the health of our people.  As guardians of the environment we should <Col N="16" /> do our best to ensure the health of marine life.</P>
    <P>We will be pushing this amendment to a vote.  I would welcome the Minister's understanding of the importance of the amendment and I hope we will not have to divide on it.  I appreciate the Minister's co-operative stance on the Bill and I hope he will be able to agree with us and accept our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported the amendment on Committee Stage and I felt it was very important that it should be included in the Bill.  In the short time since last we discussed the Bill, in November, awareness of the environment has grown particularly with oil pollution and so on.  It is important that the protection of the environment be provided for in this section.  For far too long we have seen abuse of the sea and marine life, particularly in coastal areas.  For instance, rubbish has been tipped into the sea around our coast as it was considered to be a convenient way of disposing of it. It was a classic case of, &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo;.  The sea was the natural rubbish bin.  I hope those days have gone forever. People now realise that the sea cannot forever take our refuse.</P>
      <P>I see the institute as a body to carry out research and protect the environment. That should be included in the Bill.  We have coastal erosion and we have no exact policy on it.  The institute could contribute enormously in this regard.  The west coast has been battered by storms and on the south coast, in my county of Cork, terrible damage has been done by heavy seas.  The institute have a role to play in protecting our environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sea Pollution Bill is at Committee Stage and the Bill we are discussing today dovetails into it.  I see the institute working hand in hand with other authorities to protect the environment.  Last November when the Minister gave a commitment to consider this amendment which was tabled by my colleague I thought that at least we were moving in the right direction.  I am sure the Minister realises the importance of protecting the <Col N="17" /> environment but he must put it in writing. I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have considered this amendment very carefully and they contend that the remit of the institute, as defined in section 4, is more than adequate to encompass the Deputies' concerns, which do them credit, about marine environment matters. I share those concerns.  Under the Foreshore Act, 1933, and the various Fisheries Acts, apart altogether from the Act referred to by the Deputies, my Department and I have powers in this regard.</P>
      <P>It is important that we have and exercise those powers because, as has been said, serious damage has been done to the environment in various seas.  Despite the fact that, naturally, we here look at our faults and failings first, and rightly so, we are not that bad at all.  The position in the North Sea is horrific from the point of view of the damage to the environment suffered by the sea, surrounded as it is by heavily industrialised countries.  That has impacted not merely on the environment but also on fish supplies, although over-fishing is regarded as the chief culprit in what has happened in regard to the supply of fish in that area, where very strict limits have been set on the amount of fish that can be taken from the North Sea.  In Europe in general and in the United States, I am glad that the very words &ldquo;Atlantic fish&rdquo; are regarded as a plus as far as exports of fish from this country are concerned because they regard our Atlantic coastline and fish taken therefrom as being free from pollution and contamination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Barnes that very often ignorance on the part of bona fide people with regard to certain consequences and developments has caused damage to our environment here and there.  For example, we have not the concentration of population of some other industrialised countries.  Consequently, the onus is on us to be even better than most.  For example, we have the advantage of not having, as in the Netherlands, 15 million people in an area the size of <Col N="18" /> the province of Munster; we have a more scattered population.  Consequently, we should be able to care for our environment to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>I wanted to put on record that there are powers available to me, as Minister for the Marine, in the Acts I mentioned. Of course the Environmental Protection Agency is another body fully concerned with the environment, as its name implies.  Consequently, the tendency would be for me and my Department to indicate that this was covered.</P>
    <P>If Deputies Gilmore and Barnes could insert the word &ldquo;marine&rdquo; so that the words to be inserted would read: &ldquo;and protect the marine environment&rdquo; I think I could then accept their amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 12, to delete &ldquo;as may be specified by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are what I might call the apron strings amendments.  They deal with the extent to which the Marine Institute is tied to the Department of the Marine and the Minister.  We dealt with them at some <Col N="19" /> length on Committee Stage.  I do not propose to repeat extensively what was discussed then, but we did identify at that point, first that the institute &mdash; as it is being established under the provisions of this Bill &mdash; is considerably less extensive than the institute recommended by the task force in their report.  The range of responsibilities the institute is being given &mdash; and we shall deal with this later to some extent &mdash; is considerably less than that recommended by the task force. Worse than that, the limited areas of responsibility the institute is being given are being tied solidly to the Minister and the Department of the Marine: for example, to carry out policy as may be specified by the Minister on Marine research and development; to co-ordinate and control proposals for marine research and development requiring funding from the Exchequer or from any State owned or conrolled body or such other body as the Minister may from time to time direct; to evaluate for the Minister proposals for marine research and development requiring funding from the Exchequer... as the Minister may from time to time direct; to advise the Minister on proposals for marine research and development requiring funding from the Exchequer or from any State owned or controlled body or such other body as the Minister may from time to time direct.  What is the point in establishing a separate Marine Institute to undertake all this work for the Minister if, from time to time, the Minister must direct them virtually in their day to day activities?  Would not it have been simpler for the Department of the Marine to have established a section within that Department which would undertake this work rather than establish a separate agency to do so if it is the intention that, from time to time, the Minister will direct them in the carrying out of what are their normal routine functions, such as co-ordinating and controlling proposals for marine research, comprising the body and soul of what the Marine Institute is established to do?  Yet the carrying out of those functions will require the time <Col N="20" /> to time direction of the Minister for the Marine.  Of course this will render the work of the institute virtually impossible.</P>
    <P>We should remember we are not just talking here about this degree of control by the Department of the Marine; we are talking about the chairman and members of the institute being appointed by the Minister and being removed by him.  The funding will be provided by the Minister so it will readily be seen that there will be ministerial control at that level.  There are the normal kinds of controls one would expect there to be over any State agency, that is the requirement to report and so on.  Really, there is no need for this degree of the Minister's hand in the normal working of the institute.</P>
    <P>In practice, when this institute will have been set up, after the Minister has cut the ribbon and been photographed on television attending the first meeting of the board of the institute&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, and no doubt a very enjoyable day will be had by all concerned.  I hope we will be invited. When all that is over and the institute has settled down to their work, when in the normal course of things the institute do not get the degree of funding they seek annually when they may want to carry out various research projects or engage in various types of activity, what will happen will be that the Department of the Marine will require them, on an ongoing basis, to constantly refer back to them.  Every proposal will have to be resubmitted to the Department for approval or sanction before it can go ahead.  That will have the effect of slowing down the work of the institute, possibly of their arriving at a position at which they will miss opportunities for carrying out various projects.  Worse than that, it will mean that ultimately the final say so on whether a project can go ahead will not rest on the people most familiar with the project and the institute but with people in Leeson Lane who may not be familiar, with all due respects to them, <Col N="21" /> with the detail of the project being proposed.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Bill provisions which place the Minister's hand firmly on the board table of the institute.  That should not happen.  The Minister should have confidence in the institute we are now establishing and should let them do their work independently.  They will be making an annual report.  They will be dependent on the Minister for funding, so in that way he can exercise control. There is no need for this kind of detailed nervousness on the part of the Minister that the institute will go off and do something rash or possibly embarrassing to him.  The Minister should have confidence in them and allow the institute to work independently.  He should only exercise ministerial control by the normal means of the annual report and the financial accountability the institute will have.  The Minister should give them the vote of confidence they deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Gilmore that centralised power has been shown to have been disastrous.  Experts react well to confidence in their expertise and their ability to use it.  As Deputy <Col N="22" /> Gilmore pointed out, when other countries are dismantling centralism because it has not been productive either in human or economic terms, we are displaying a tendency to centralise everything.  Perhaps we are still coming from a very authoritarian system in which people in authority, particularly legislators, do not trust semi-State agencies or any body they are funding.  I agree that we must get value for money and I can understand why Ministers and Departments worry. However, as Deputy Gilmore pointed out, there are enough controls and boundaries for all State agencies to ensure that if a body goes very much against political or national needs with regard to research and development they can be quickly controlled.  As Deputy Gilmore said, these are the apron strings amendments.</P>
      <P>The Minister holds the purse strings, which is also a controlling mechanism. The Minister must have such control but a strong argument may be made for giving independence and autonomy not just to a State agency but to a State agency involved in research and development requiring a high level of specialist knowledge and a need for expert opinion and research qualifications.  Too much control on people carrying out that kind of work could be counter-productive; experts would be hindered in their work and they would see that the open market would welcome them, giving them far more freedom.  Too many controls could be counter-productive in relation to the level of expertise and commitment we would get from employees of the Marine Institute.  The people involved will have excellent qualifications, a high level of confidence, self-esteem and autonomy in relation to their work.  Research demands that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hasten to emphasise that I would not suggest that this Minister would give in to force but we all know that in certain areas there are political constraints and demands which would make it expedient to order certain kinds of research which would not be advantageous with regard to the national interest or the long-term development of the Marine Institute.  A <Col N="23" /> Minister or a Government could have too restraining an influence on the institute. I include all Ministers and all Governments in this.  We are talking about an institute which must have autonomy and independence in the long term to work in the best interests of the country and the marine environment.</P>
    <P>I would not allege that this very independent minded Minister would succumb to such pressure, but we must legislate to close every loophole, weakness or abuse that might arise.  We should trust and give independence to the experts working in this area.  This would be more productive because they would enjoy their work and stay with it.  I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment, and, knowing the vision of the Minister, I know he will seriously consider what we are saying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Gilmore is trying to do in his amendment.  It is similar to what I tried to do on Committee Stage when I suggested that the institute would formulate policy with regard to marine research and development.  If we are to properly develop marine research and development, the people involved should have independence.  Marine experts should be able to independently promote policies to develop marine research in the future. This new legislation will be like a breath of fresh air so far as our antiquated marine laws are concerned.  The institute and their employees would, of course, be subject to the Minister and the Government of the day but we should not stifle their productive approach in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drafting of the Bill appears to bring about a reversal of the role I had envisaged the institute would play.  The heavy hand of the Minister will be ever present, preventing the formulation of new ideas. It is a manifestation of the &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; syndrome; we are subject to the Minister at all times.  If we are in earnest about this Marine Institute and want to go forward to the year 2000 with good legislation and a good working arrangement between the institute, the Government and the Minister we should let <Col N="24" /> these people do the job they are supposed to do.  The Bill specifies that the institute are to carry out policy as may be specified by the Minister.  I would hope the institute would formulate the policy and put it to the Minister, acknowledging, of course, that he is the man in charge.  If we are serious about a Marine Institute which will be productive, we will have to give them independence, autonomy and the right to put forward to the Minister the policy they believe should be followed.  I do not think the Minister should be able to tell the institute what they should do and where they should go.</P>
    <P>Taking into consideration all aspects of our history, the Minister should go easy on this type of intrusion into the affairs of the institute.  Deputy Gilmore's amendment compares with mine on Committee Stage and I will be supporting it.  The Minister should look again at the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The very nature of research demands a certain freedom. Unless researchers have an opportunity to explore freely and carry out the necessary work and study, we will not necessarily get the best results.  To achieve innovative and creative results, freedom is fundamental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully support Deputy Gilmore's amendment.  At the earlier stage one of the major criticisms expressed on this side of the House was related to ministerial control of the Marine Institute. There is need for confidence, trust and a good relationship between the Department and the institute, which should be enhanced by civilised behaviour.  It is not necessary to legislate for a supportive attitude between the Department and the institute.  Putting this into legislation and almost dictating has a certain odium about it which is unfortunate.  We need to strike a balance.  I appeal to the Minister to recognise that those involved in research are people of tremendous skill and intelligence who have pride in their work.  Above all, there is peer pride within their own group.  They will be commended if they produce fine work and <Col N="25" /> innovative results.  Legislation will not get the best out of people in this situation.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity to maintain this provision in the Bill.  If in years to come the Marine Institute turned out to be a law unto itself, unaccountable to anybody and acting against the national interest and the overall development of the marine, the Minister would have it within his power to bring in tighter controls in amending legislation.  This type of rigidity at the outset is detrimental.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment as he accepted the previous one and to show the same breadth of vision in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House because this matter has been adequately debated by previous speakers.  I broadly support these amendments. This institute needs to be as independent as possible of the Department of the Marine.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister or to the Department, but if the institute is to carry out properly the various functions set out in the Bill it must be independent and able to take the initiative.  There is sometimes a feeling that people should sit on their backsides until such time as the Minister directs otherwise.  The Marine Institute must be innovative and must be able to carry out research or other work without waiting for the Minister to give instructions or directions.</P>
      <P>The Minister should reconsider this matter and delete the words in the Bill which direct the institute to operate as specified by the Minister.  I commend these amendments to the Minister.</P>

I know he did subscribe to a philosophy at one stage where hooks of steel rather than apron strings would have been the correct terminology as far as Government was concerned. I thank the Deputy for joining the club.  As the chancelleries over a whole area of Europe fell, by deft footwork Deputy Gilmore and others removed themselves from the danger and <Col N="26" /> are now in what we call the libertarian phase of their political development.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the arguments here that the deletions suggested would improve the Marine Institute in any way or that the terminology of this Bill would inhibit in any way the scientific development.  I have in the Department of the Marine a highly sophisticated science section which works under me. This is the ogre that is painted by the people who are trying to push these amendments.</P>
      <P>This section has been very successful both in the internal development of marine science and on the European scene.  It is linked to ICES, to international research.  I can give an example from the most recent meeting of the Council of Ministers when fish quotas were established at the end of December. The research by the science section of my Department resulted in having a Commission decision on quotas changed because they had done up to date research on the availability of herring in the Celtic Sea.  In practical terms the result was a considerable boom for the herring fishermen in the Celtic Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I give that example to indicate that there is a thriving section in the Department involved already in marine research and development.  That should be taken account of in the context of the deletion amendment we have here.  It is important in the context of the European scene that the first person to become cognisant of <Col N="27" /> developments, if there are such developments, will be the Minister.  It should be possible for the Minister to call such developments to the attention of the Marine Institute when the vital interests of the country and its development are concerned.</P>
    <P>There can be no question of a Minister or his Department interfering in purely scientific areas.  The Minister, and the Department, should have power, since the institute are sustained by taxpayers' money, to indicate where research is necessary for the development of our economy.  I want to put it on record that the independence of the board cannot be impugned; the research carried out by the institute cannot be interfered with. Scientists have their own principles, their own methodology, and would resent such interference.  Nobody could sustain the idea that every loophole could be watched, as Deputy Barnes said, and that the Minister, and the Department, should be cast in the role of some kind of ogre or that everything should be closed off because of the danger of the Minister doing damage.  There will be no interference with the freedom of the institute and it could not be deducted from the Bill that there will be.</P>
    <P>I liked what Deputy Garland said, that scientists are not quiescent people.  They are self-starters for the most part.  There would be no question of scientists lying back waiting for the Minister to prescribe areas of scientific research to fill their idle moments.  My experience with the science establishment we have in the Department is that there has been a quick response to indications from the Department. I am rejecting the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are at the heart of what the institute will turn out like.  They are about the independence of the institute.  The institute first surfaced as an idea in this House <Col N="28" /> when the previous Government established a task force to look into the possibility of establishing a marine institute. What we have in the Bill is a far cry from what that task force recommended.  The task force first recommended that the institute would be an integrated body which would incorporate all the existing agencies engaged in marine research and development.  That is not in the Bill.  The Bill provides for some kind of federated umbrella body which will oversee the research and development work being carried out by the various bodies which are doing fine work.</P>
      <P>Even in carrying out that kind of overseeing and co-ordinating role, the institute are not being given the freedom to do so. I am not in any way impugning the work or the integrity of the people in Leeson Lane.  I have far too much respect for them to do that.  I really do not think, however, that their time, or the Minister's time, should be taken up examining individual proposals for research that are coming forward through this body.</P>
      <P>Let us look at what will happen in practice.  We have about a dozen organisations, mostly State organisations, engaged in marine research.  They will come forward with some proposal for research either on an individual or on a combined basis.  It will then go to the Marine Institute for consideration before it is funded, because it is the Marine Institute who will decide on the funding. That is fine, but the real problem then is that the institute will not have the authority, in certain cases, to make that decision without the approval of the Department of the Marine.  That is imposing on the institute an additional layer of bureaucracy which is unnecessary, which will tie up the institute, restrict their freedom and restrict the academic and research freedom of the staff involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see, and neither does the Minister see, that his time as Minister should be taken up with examining proposals from the Marine Institute because he has other levels of control over them.  In the first place, he decides on the money and <Col N="29" /> that is the most powerful control of all. Second, if the members of the Marine Institute go off the rails and make some outrageous decision he has, ultimately, a further recourse open to him because he has retained for himself, within the provisions of the Bill, the right to dismiss the chairperson and the individual members of the institute.</P>
    <P>For the life of me, I cannot see why the Minister also wants to retain this degree of detailed control on the work of the institute. I think it will bind-the institute hand and foot and will prevent it from availing of the opportunities that present themselves, such as funding from the private sector.  Let us look at what the Bill says: the institute cannot enter into an arrangement with an outside body without the approval of the Minister.  If some private company want to become involved with the institute in a joint venture for research in an area of marine <Col N="30" /> resources, this cannot be done without the say so of the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is the whole question of funding available from Europe.  We have pointed out in this House that the delay in establishing this institute has possibly contributed to the fact that this State has not been availing to the degree that it should have been of moneys that are available from Europe for marine research.</P>
    <P>Our amendments strike at the heart of what the institute will be about.  These amendments will decide whether the institute will have a degree of autonomy and independence and will be able to go about its business in a normal way, or will we have a puppet that will have to refer back to the Minister for every significant decision that has to be made? These amendments are critically important to the future of the institute, and I wish that they be put formally.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from the report of the task force.  One of the curious things about the Marine Institute Bill which has not been explained by the Minister of State on Committee Stage, or, indeed, by the Minister in the course of <Col N="34" /> today's debate, is why the Bill before us falls so far short of the recommendations of the task force which recommended the establishment of a Marine Institute.  I have already referred to some of the shortcomings in the Bill and the principal shortcomings are in the area of the functions of the Marine Institute.  My amendment is taken directly from the report of the task force.  It lists the functions recommended for the Marine Institute by the task force but which are not being given to the Marine Institute in this Bill. I cannot understand why these functions have been omitted from the remit of the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the function in paragraph (k) of my amendment &mdash; Deputy Barnes' amendment also covers this function &mdash; in regard to the delineation, mapping and quantification of Ireland's marine and fisheries resources.  We are in the absurd position in that, unlike smaller countries, for example, Ireland, we have not yet delineated our claim to the Continental Shelf.  It is absolutely incredible that at a time when the world's resources are in decline and there is a great deal of talk about the need for economic development the Government have not staked a claim to marine resources in the Continental Shelf.</P>
    <P>The reasons put forward over the years for not staking a claim to the Continental Shelf is that we do not have the resources to send people there to map it out and identify the exact extent of our claim. The Marine Institute should be given the function of doing this without delay.  Not alone are we talking about an area of the sea which might be potentially important for us from the point of view of our economy but we are also talking about an area of the sea which could be potentially disastrous to us from the point of view of ecology or the environment.  It is well known that the major military superpowers, in particular the United States, are using portions of the Continental Shelf to which we should properly have a claim to bury various kinds of used military weaponry and nuclear weaponry.  This could be potentially disastrous for Ireland and other states along <Col N="35" /> the Atlantic costline, as it is also known that this part of the Continental Shelf is quite volcanic.</P>
    <P>We have a very strong interest in ensuring that our claim to the Continental Shelf is mapped out and delineated.  It is a bit like a farmer who does not fence off an extra piece of land to which he is entitled but allows everyone else to use it.  I do not think too many farmers in this State would fall into that category.  It is remarkable that the Government have ignored the pressing need to delineate and map out our claim to the Continental Shelf, although other smaller states have staked claims to portions of the Continental Shelf to which we should properly lay claim.</P>
    <P>This important amendment sets out the functions of the Marine Institute as identified in the task force report.  These functions are very important from the point of view of our economy and the country generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to amendments Nos. 7 and 8.  I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment which sets out the functions of the Marine Institute as identified in the task force report.  Some of these functions are covered in a general way in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Gilmore I believe the Marine Institute should be given the function of organising the delineation, mapping and quantification of Ireland's marine and fisheries resources.  As an island nation we constantly face the threat of pollution of the waters around our coast without being able to take any action against those countries which cause such pollution.  We cannot lay any claim to future marine harvests in the Continental Shelf until we have legally delineated Ireland's share of it and quantified Ireland's marine and fisheries resources.  It is remarkable that the Government have not done this before now.  We need to give greater consideration to the future opportunities which exist in this area, particularly as some of the resources and industries available to us until now are running out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> During the past 15 years much research has been carried out into the opportunities which exist in the development of marine fishery resources.  It has been predicted that future food supplies will not come from the land but from the sea, which has not been exploited to the same extent as our land and forests.  We need to give more consideration to the vast potential of our marine resources.  I am sure that, like me, other Members of the House have read articles about the food which can be harvested from the sea if there is a scarcity of present food supplies.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to our exploration rights.  Some people argue that our natural gas supply which comes from the sea is only a small example of the resources there.  From an environmental point of view, it is vitally important that we protect our supplies of this clean energy. However, we will not be able to do this if we do not delineate, map and quantify our share of the Continental Shelf and marine and fishery resources.  We are not just talking about our fishery resources, and I will come back to them in a moment because they are of the greatest importance.</P>
    <P>There are probably energy and mineral resources off our coast which we have not yet tapped.  Resources found off the coasts of other lands may be an indication of the measure of resources around our coasts.  There will be a race by people wishing to take up these resources and unless we define, delineate and protect our resources we could find ourselves invaded with those people.  It is important that we tap our energy and mineral resources and carry out research into potential resources about which we have had exciting indications.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right when he says that research is all important with regard to our fishery resources.  This morning he told us that because of the scientific information his researchers uncovered and laid before the Council of Ministers, we gained substantially from what Europe was prepared to offer us.  The Minister put his finger on the need for that type of research, delineation and protection.  It <Col N="37" /> is only by having our own scientific basis and delineation that we will be able to offset the exploitive attempts of others to gain access to what they would rightly say is not really mapped off, and that there could be a legal argument whether the resources belonged to this nation.</P>
    <P>It is important that this amendment be included in the Bill, not only for the Marine Institute but also for our future policy and for the protection not only of our resources but of job creation for the present as well as for the foreseeable future.  I hope there will be more enlightened research and discovery of our marine resources.  By the end of this decade I think we will have identified resources that have not come to our attention yet.  Marine research is in its infancy compared with research in other areas.</P>
    <P>To the disappointment of Members on this side of the House, the Minister has been able to justify keeping powers in this area; he has assured us that he or his Department will not impinge on the rights or the work of the staff of the Marine Institute.  If the Minister and his staff believe it is important to include those powers in the legislation then surely, in the context of the potential we are talking about, it is even more important to accept these amendments.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's extended list.  As has been mentioned, it is of great importance that we delineate, quantify and map Ireland's share of the Continental Shelf.  This should be done not just for ourselves but for the future. Future generations will not forgive us if we do not make sure that this nation will not be encroached upon because of our lack of urgency in this matter.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments, particularly paragraph (k) of amendment No. 7, which refers to the delineation, mapping and quantification of our marine and fisheries resources.  It is very important that this be included in the Bill.  It has been recognised throughout Europe that we have the richest fishing grounds in the western world, but we <Col N="38" /> do not know how rich they really are.  We rely to a large extent on information from other people.  I realise that the Department of the Marine are a relatively new Department which have a lot of ground to make up and that the resources in the Department are not sufficient to establish themselves properly.</P>
      <P>The Marine Institute are the ideal body to quantify our resources, particularly on the Continental Shelf.  With the Gulf crisis, it is now more important than ever that this is done.  For a long time we have foreseen a lot of disruption in the Middle East, and it is very important that our energy resources from the seabed be considered very carefully.  The institute would be the ideal vehicle to do that work and to come up with the answers for which this Government and future Governments will be looking.  From the fishing point of view, the institute could complement our Naval Service who work in the very difficult area of fishery protection, and so on.  At times they have to work with antiquated maps because up to now we have not had the resources to map our seabed and the fishery activities in the Atlantic and the Irish Sea.  It is very important that these amendments be included in a Bill of this nature.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not spelled out very clearly who will comprise the institute. We presume they will be experts in this field, and I hope they will have a special interest in this area.  It is vitally important that we quantify our marine resources from the seabed.  I support the amendments put down by Deputy Gilmore and Deputy Barnes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment, which is the most important that has been put before this House.  The Continental Shelf is an asset we have done nothing about.  Deputy Gilmore's point about farmers letting land go to somebody else is very relevant.  The Continental Shelf is like a big commonage; and it is only a matter of somebody putting up stakes, claiming it and having rights to it.  In the context of international law we should consider this matter fully. <Col N="39" /> We should recognise the importance and urgency of staking our claim.</P>
      <P>In the fishery negotiations, particularly in relation to Spain, because the Spaniards traditionally fished our waters they established legal fishing rights.  We were not in a position to argue against them and they were able to claim fishery rights in Irish waters because of traditional fishing patterns.  All you need is another member state &mdash; or some other country &mdash; to decide that they will become involved in exploration in certain parts of the Continental Shelf over which we have not laid claim, to undermine this country. There will be pressure; because of the international reduction in natural resources many people will be very anxious to stake their claim and we know that there is a strong possibility of finding gas, oil and other mineral resources.  It is very important for us in the national interest &mdash; and in the interest of future generations &mdash; to stake our claim early in regard to this matter.  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the Gulf, natural resources worldwide and the pressures which can arise at different times because of varying political circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This fundamentally important matter must be given priority by the Government because, up to now, sufficient importance has not been attached to it. There is a difficulty in relation to international law and the possibility of other countries laying claim to waters rich in resources because, as we have seen in the case of Spain, a similar pattern has developed over the years.  That would be a major loss to this country and this House has a responsibility to ensure that it will not happen.  Every child is fully aware of the suitability of the Continental Shelf for fishing and fish stocks, and it is important for the institute to do more research and to explore the possibilities which exist in that regard.  The importance of this matter cannot be overemphasised. I hope that the Minister and the Department recognise it and that the Minister will accept the combined amendments tabled by Deputy Gilmore and Deputy Barnes because the future in <Col N="40" /> relation to employment for young people in marine related and mineral resources which can be extracted from the Continental Shelf is in question.  It is up to Members of this House to take a positive decision in relation to that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of both amendments.  The amendment tabled by Deputy Gilmore lists the general duties of the institute.  These are all very important, particularly paragraph (k), which deals with mapping and so forth. However, in that regard I prefer the amendment tabled by Deputy Barnes and, if the Minister is giving serious consideration to taking these amendments on board, perhaps the amendment tabled by Deputy Barnes could be incorporated in Deputy Gilmore's more detailed amendments.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers dealt at length with the Continental Shelf.  This is an extremely important matter to which, obviously, the institute should give tremendous priority.  I commend these amendments to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach was the chief instigator and mover of the task force and, indeed, of the whole idea of the Marine Institute and, consequently, of this legislation.  From listening carefully to the debate, I am struck by the fact that there is a fundamental difference between these amendments and previous ones.  It is a question of interpretation; on one side they claim that the Bill is a vehicle for carrying all the range of activities mentioned in the amendments <Col N="41" /> and others outside it &mdash; that is my fundamental position &mdash; but there is also the claim that we must specify the projects which will be dealt with by the Marine Institute.  If I was convinced that the specifics would improve the Bill I would accept them without delay, even without any further discussion, but I am not convinced in that regard.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a danger to which I referred already, which would have the opposite effect from that which I know is the bona fide intentions of those who tabled the amendments to make the institute in their studies as comprehensive as possible, that if anything is left out in the specifics there is a kind of logical conclusion that if there is a whole list of specifics and something is not mentioned then it is excluded.  That is the danger. The Bill, which was framed with great care and put through a minute examination after Committee Stage, adequately covers the range of activities of the previous amendments and the amendments which are under consideration at present.</P>
      <P>If the institute, under the Bill without the suggested amendments, set themselves the task of studying the delineation of the Continental Shelf, to take an example from the amendment, is there anything in the Bill which indicates that they could not do that, that their powers were delimited by the Bill?  I do not think there is and I do not think anybody could, with any shred of credibility, argue that.</P>
      <P>The Continental Shelf was mentioned and its importance is accepted.  The geologists have an interest, and as the Deputies said, so have the Department of Energy.  There is a strong case for the Marine Institute to get involved in consultation with the Department of the Marine, the Department of Energy and the Geological Survey, which is the kind of activity covered in the Bill as it now stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan said that it is a young Department.  They are, and the purpose of setting up the Department was to focus on the marine as a source of economic and social development. However, we must remember that there <Col N="42" /> was formerly a section of the Department of Agriculture dealing with fisheries &mdash; it was known as the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries &mdash; which had been looking after that area.  Indeed, we are a little ahead of the posse in Europe in this respect in that very often agriculture and fisheries are tightly wed in that context, although it is not always to the advantage of the marine area.</P>
    <P>We should not forget that for a considerable period we have been linked to the ICES organisation, that we have been making a scientific contribution to that organisation and have been deriving benefits from the results of their research.  I have covered the main points made and have to oppose the amendments not on the basis of their merits but rather on the basis that they are unnecessary.</P>

      <P>We are probably a nation of landlubbers; we have never taken the potential of these sufficiently seriously. This to some extent may explain why we lost out over the 12 mile limit, were sold out in the negotiations on the fish quotas and are still neglecting to claim our share of the Continental Shelf.  What we are talking about here is one million square kilometres of seabed which could make this country a power in maritime affairs equivalent to Portugal, something which would contribute enormously to our role in the new unified Europe post-1992. However, because the Government have not yet claimed our share of the Continental Shelf it is being lost to us as other countries such as Denmark, Iceland and even the tiny Faroe Islands are claiming parts of the Continental Shelf which ought properly be ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why has this not been done?  The reason is that the Government have never given anyone this job and have always claimed that we did not have the necessary resources to delineate and map our share of the Continental Shelf.  The Minister asked, what is to stop the Marine Institute from going ahead and doing the job.  The answer is that a lack of resources will stop them.  Indeed, that is what prevented those Government Departments and <Col N="43" /> existing agencies engaged in maritime research from doing so, and it will not be done until such time as the Government decide to give some State agency this task.  That is what we are asking the Minister to do.  This Bill will establish a marine institute and we are pleading with him to give this institute the job of delineating and mapping our share of the Continental Shelf so that the Government can go and claim it.</P>
    <P>There are two amendments before the House, one of which is a rather lengthy amendment in my name, amendment No. 7, but the Minister is not going to accept either of them.  I take the point made by Deputy Garland that the amendment in the name of Deputy <Col N="44" /> Barnes focuses exclusively on the delineation of the Continental Shelf and I propose therefore to withdraw my amendment in favour of hers.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>We now come to amendment No. 9 in the name of Deputy Monica Barnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 15, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the inventor, under a share agreement to be determined by the Board of the Institute&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This has some bearing on what we discussed this morning.  I hope this will be an expert, hard-working institute whose researchers and staff will undertake much research leading to innovations over the next few years.  We recognise already that a huge amount of research and development into the overall marine area is at an embryonic stage compared with what can be researched, discovered and developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment in my name was one which appeared in the name of Deputy Taylor-Quinn on Committee Stage, when the point was made strongly by Members on this side of the House that, in order to retain the expert staff and scientific experts in this institute, they must be rewarded.  This will mean that there must also be provision for a degree of independence, autonomy and acknowledgment so that such staff will not merely work productively but will also &mdash; and this is very important with regard to scientific innovation or discovery &mdash;<Col N="47" /> undertake the inevitable risks involved in their work, particularly with regard to discovery.  It is essential that, when such a scientist or researcher provides information or makes an innovative discovery which will be of tremendous value not merely to the work of the institute but to that of the Department and the nation as a whole, there be adequate acknowledgment of and reward for that effort.  We must go beyond the mainstream work of the institute, because not to acknowledge or reward the personal, qualitative element of such scientists' endeavours and innovations would be a huge disincentive to them.  Indeed, such incentive is vital to the retention of such staff within the institute rather than moving to independently-funded, specialist research institutes where they might be highly rewarded because of their being more profitable and so on.  We must endeavour to retain the qualifications and commitment of such staff.  We must also acknowledge any breakthroughs which would be of immense value to society on the part of such people and ensure they are recompensed, as should be the case also with any group, who should be given a financial reward to maintain their motivation to produce work of the highest quality not only for the good of the nation but also at a personal level. We should remember that we all work at a level of personal regard, so that that incentive is vital to all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  I am glad that Deputy Barnes did refer to a group because that was a stipulation I had in an amendment on Committee Stage, that any group effort be recognised.  It is important that people making such discoveries be recognised in a practical way.  Indeed, such provision will create an incentive for people to work within the institute and remain with it in the knowledge that their efforts will be recognised at Government and national levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the thinking behind the amendment tabled by Deputy <Col N="48" /> Barnes, supported by Deputy O'Sullivan. Of course the general principle is that, just as the labourer is worthy of his hire, so the scientist is entitled to recognition of the results of his or her labours.  Always it has been a very delicate problem encountered within institutes and universities. The United States third level institutes, in particular, have been pioneers in this field, whereas Europeans generally have been more conservative or cagey, afraid of the self-interest of scientists overriding the interest of the institute or the public interest, as the case may be.  The Americans have brought it to a fine art.  A discovery such as the one adumbrated by Deputy Barnes in elaborating on her amendment has brought a very substantial factory to my constituency.  I know from my research that its origins came from a third level institute in the United States &mdash; to be precise the Massachusetts Institute of Technology &mdash; leading to the results of a discovery made there establishing a worldwide company which has brought benefits to many areas here but specifically to my constituency.  The famous and evergreen economist, John Kenneth Galbraith, wrote a novel which I read over Christmas in which he dealt specifically with the responsibility of an individual to the institution and whether he could make a lot of money for himself, a satiric novel dealing with much the same theme. Sections 22 (2), (3) and (4) deal with the point I am making.  For example, section 22 (4) reads:</P>
      <P>The Institute may, subject to the approval of and at the discretion of the Minister and the Minister for Finance develop a scheme for the payment of bonuses or royalties, out of moneys at the disposal of the Institute, to members of the staff of the Institute who have made important discoveries or inventions, or have materially assisted in making such discoveries or inventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My contention is that the interests of the individual, of somebody who has not merely added to human knowledge but who has invented something which, as <Col N="49" /> applied, would succeed in earning wealth, should be covered by the provisions of this section.  I appreciate that the Deputy's amendment, and those who spoke to it, are prompted by what motivated section 22.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A serious problem in the past decade has been that some of our most intelligent and talented people have been enticed out of the country by the offer of financial reward.  This amendment is very important in the light of recent history.  If intelligent and talented people are not encouraged to work in the public sector the country will not have the benefit of the best brains available. In order to keep those people we will have to look at the bread and butter issue, which is reward for work done.  Most researchers are highly motivated, with a sense of purpose.  They should be rewarded when they produce the goods. Under this Bill a person involved in research in the Marine Institute will only get a regular salary.  That is not sufficient if we wish to keep those people.  I hope the Minister will see the value of this amendment.  To get the full benefit from the Marine Institute we must offer marine researchers some incentive, a reward for coming up with a good invention or for doing good research work. While I appreciate the Minister's point of view, I do not share it.  In the national interest it is important to consider this matter, and I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment tabled by Deputy Barnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the principle of the amendment.  I support the principle of the labourer being worthy of his hire and the principle that if somebody makes a discovery or invents something that generates income he is entitled to a share of the benefit.  The difficulty is in identifying who has made the discovery or invented something.  It is not unknown in academic circles, for example, for a head of a department to publish as his or her own work, work which was done by research students.  In relation to a discovery or an invention it may well be that <Col N="50" /> the apparent discoverer or inventor was building on work that was done by subordinates or predecessors.  That is just a word of caution I would build into this. Those who contribute to the discovery or the invention, whether they are people who were previously involved in the research or who were involved in a subordinate or in an ancillary way, should be entitled to a reasonable share of the benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Deputy Gilmore's point.  However, if my amendment is included, that abuse will, I hope, not occur. The Minister realises that an incredible amount of innovation and invention has come from the US due to their reward system.  Many institutes who can profitably exploit inventions can offer attractive packages so that we could lose our staff.  The Minister will appreciate a statement made on conflict and copyright &mdash; to every cow its calf and to every book its copy.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;3.  One-third of the members of the Institute shall be elected by the staff of the Institute in accordance with <Col N="51" /> the provisions of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the time, and to expedite matters I wish to formally move this amendment which we discussed on Committee Stage.  I am sure the Minister is familiar with the principle of worker participation.  It is well enshrined now in many State organisations, that the employees have the right to elect a number of members to the board of directors of the body.  That is what I am seeking here.  The mechanism for doing so is provided for in the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> A total of £12,300 has been paid to date by my Department in respect of professional fees for works relating to the new museum at the Custom House Docks.  The construction costs of the museum-leisure complex to be undertaken by the Custom House Docks Development Company were estimated in 1987 at £11.2 million.  No precise cost has yet been estimated for the fitting out of the museum area.</P>
    <P>The development at the Custom House Docks site has now reached the stage where final decisions must be made about the museum.  These decisions are currently the subject of consultations between the Custom House Docks Development Authority and the developers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach give the exact location of the proposed cultural centre?  Will it be in the old building known as Stack A or will it be a purpose built building specifically for this purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter has not yet been finally decided.  The original idea was that it would be in Stack A.  Subsequently there were some suggestions that a new building should be provided. That decision has not been finally taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Stack A is a preserved building and other arrangements would have to be made if it were not decided to have the cultural centre there.  What sections of the National Museum will be going there?  Will it be the decorative arts, the military history or the folk collections? What is it intended to have there?  Is it also intended to have a theatre, a concert hall or an assembly hall?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The museum is a separate concept.  The idea originally was that it should be a folk museum.  It is the subject of continuing consultation between my Department and the director of the National Museum as to exactly what may ultimately go there.  Almost certainly it will be the folk collection.  The leisure complex is separate.</P>

    <Col N="54" />
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a suggestion some years ago that the Custom House building might be considered for the purposes of a cultural museum.  If the Taoiseach is now suggesting that a new building might be constructed in this area, would he give any consideration to using the Custom House itself as a cultural museum centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Such a use for the Custom House can always be considered. It would be a mistake to use the Custom House for this purpose because the developers are committed to providing £11 million or £12 million for the adaptation of Stack A or a new building.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not consider that it might be more suitable to have the decorative arts collection displayed in this centre city location rather than the folk life collection, a lot of which consists of large 19th century agricultural machinery which might be seen to be rather out of context in this city centre location?  Perhaps it might be better accommodated somewhere else in view of the fact that most successful folk life collections are on the edge of cities and not in the centre, for example, the museum at Cultra in Northern Ireland?</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that this is a policy question and that the size of the accommodation available will essentially determine what can be displayed?  Is the Taoiseach further aware that there are substantial folk life collections available in the National Museum consisting mostly of very bulky, ancient farm machinery which cannot be adequately displayed in a location as constrained as the Custom House Docks <Col N="55" /> must necessarily be?  Would he therefore consider that the decorative arts collection, which would not be as bulky, might be more suitable to that location?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possibly because of the Deputy's own rural background and his deep immersion in agricultural matters that he suggests that a folk collection should consist only of farm machinery.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the early days of this concept we were thinking more in terms of what the National Museum needed space for and it was regarded as appropriate that the entire folk collection should be replaced down there.  The matter is still under discussion and the suggestion made by Deputy Nealon can, of course, be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I aplogise for Deputy Bernard Allen, who asked me to convey his regret that he could not be here today. Will the Taoiseach confirm a statement made by the secretary of his Department that the final figure for the completion of this building will be in the region of £20 million?  Would the Taoiseach agree that this vast amount of money would be better spent in developing local museums so that many of the artefacts could be displayed in the localities from which they came?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already dealt with that point.  This does not arise since we are able to get the museum on the site because the developers will provide it for us.  The developers are providing this museum, whether it costs £11 million or £12 million or whatever, as part of their contractual obligation.  It cannot be provided anywhere else and must be provided there.  I gave the figures in my reply.  The estimated cost in 1987 was £11.2 million but that has probably risen since then.  There will probably be about <Col N="56" /> 90,000 feet involved in the museum project. It has to be in the Custom House Docks area.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Taoiseach that I am well aware of the security implications in relation to access to Government buildings but this is probably the only public building on which large sums of money have been expended in recent years that is not accessible to the public. A great deal of interest has focused on this building.  The population of Dublin can see it from all sorts of distances at night time.  Will the Taoiseach bring his consideration to an early conclusion?  The public should have access to that building at some stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have been thinking a lot about that.  I have been inundated with expressions of interest in seeing the building.  It is gratifying that there is such public interest in it.  That is something we must take note of and see if we can meet it.  As the Deputy knows, security precautions are paramount in anything to do with public buildings.

      <P>Of course, security is a consideration, but would the Taoiseach agree that the problem of security has been overcome in Dublin Castle, where there are great leaders of the world and members of the European Parliament visiting on a regular basis?  Would he <Col N="57" /> agree that the public are curious and interested to see how £17.5 million was spent within the walls of an existing building?  It would be important that the Taoiseach should satisfy that curiosity by allowing guided tours about the complex.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 19 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>On 28 January 1991 I convened meetings with the chairmen and senior management of all the regional airports and with Ryanair, and had discussions the following day with Aer Lingus, to express my serious concern at the imminent loss of services to/from the regional airports. We discussed a range of measures which might be taken to resolve the difficulties facing the airports.  These discussions are continuing.</P>
      <P>The regional airports have an important contribution to make to the economic and social development of this country and to the continued expansion of tourism in the regions served by those airports.  I am most anxious, therefore. that air services to/from the regional airports will continue to operate.  In the latter context, I was pleased when Aer Lingus recently found it possible to accede to my request that they should continue to serve the Dublin-Connaught and Dublin-Derry routes which they had originally proposed to drop under their &ldquo;Blueprint for Recovery&rdquo; Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that on the UK side at some of the airports Ryanair fly into, mainly Luton, there are no landing charges now because of the feeling in those airports that the traffic it generates is sufficient income from them? In view of that, will the Minister allow a waiving of charges to the air companies to allow the same arrangements to apply here?  Secondly, is the Minister prepared to put up any Government or EC resources on a temporary basis to ensure <Col N="62" /> that the routes are maintained into the regional airports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in Luton an arrangement has been made with a particular airline with regard to landing charges.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that the regional airports are not State-owned but are owned by the private sector, by chambers of commerce, by county councils, by the Church and by community organisations generally. An item that loomed large in my discusions with the regional airport boards recently was the question of landing charges. I have asked all of the airport boards to consider whether they could review their landing charges to help the airlines through this very difficult period.  I have said that I will not be found wanting in being part of any package that the airport boards could see their way to supporting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice from the Minister's reply that he is not offering anything in concrete terms.  Will the Minister state whether Exchequer support will be made available?  Will it be at least £1 million? When does he hope to bring these discusions to finality and announce a package of supports for the regional airports in order to maintain these routes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I hope the airport package will be concluded very shortly.  It does not depend entirely on Government but on the views the regional airports take and the view the airlines take.  The Deputy has to be aware that Aer Lingus withdrew from a number of airports but at my request went back to them.  He must also be aware that Ryanair have told the regional airports <Col N="63" /> that they would withdraw from them within a very short time, but because I embarked on trying to put a package together Ryanair decided to defer a decision to pull out of virtually all of the regional airports.  We are doing everything possible.  I am certainly very interested in the tone of the Deputy's approach and perhaps I could look forward to his support if I bring a package to Government.</P>

On all other routes either side may designate up to two of its own carriers.</P>
      <P>The designation of Irish carriers on any route is a matter to be decided by me, while the designation of UK carriers is a matter for the UK authorities.</P>
      <P>In September 1989 I announced a two Irish airline policy for a three year period. The aim of the policy is to strengthen the Irish presence on services to-from Ireland rather than having two Irish carriers actively pursuing traffic on identical routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this policy, in so far as it applies <Col N="64" /> to services between Ireland and the UK, Aer Lingus are the sole Irish carrier operating from Irish airports to Heathrow and Gatwick and from Dublin to Manchester, while Ryanair is the sole Irish carrier operating from Irish airports to Luton and Stansted and from Dublin to Liver-pool. Ryanair is also the sole Irish carrier providing direct services between Irish regional airports and airports in Britain, with Aer Lingus serving these routes via Dublin.</P>
    <P>While both Irish airlines are encountering difficulties at the present time, arising from the Gulf crisis and the current recession in the British and United States markets, they are taking the necessary corrective measures now to deal with the situation in order to be in a position to take advantage of any upswing in international travel when the current adverse trends have passed.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that current policy is working effectively and that it should be maintained for the planned period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the current policy is disastrous as British Airways have pulled out of the Dublin-London route and three carriers have pulled out of the United Kingdom-Ireland route in recent years?  Will the Minister confirm that it is now likely that Aer Lingus will lose £16 million on the Dublin-London route this year and that the combined losses of Ryanair have been in the order of £23 million and, in view of that chaotic situation, would he consider decontrolling fare prices where there is ample competition?  Will he consider some reorganisation of routes because the competition on routes in some cases is known to be predatory and in some cases is unsustainable in the long term in view of the losses I have spoken about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to consider decontrolling prices for airlines. I think that would be a very dangerous policy and I am surprised that the Deputy is pursuing that policy.  Tourism is essential to Ireland's economic growth and, in a situation where we had fewer airlines, not more, and less competition, not of <Col N="65" /> my choice but through market forces, it would be a very dangerous policy to allow the airlines to get together and effectively set their own prices.  I am surprised at the direction the Deputy is taking in this area, which is worth studying and I will certainly take a look at it.  British Airways pulled out of the routes for reasons best known to themselves.</P>

      <P>There were six airlines on the Dublin-London route two years ago and it is down to three now. This Government or this country did not invent the recession in the United Kingdom or in the United States or, indeed, the Gulf War.  Ninety-nine per cent of airlines in the world today are in severe difficulties and I have no mechanism &mdash; although I would be interested in the Deputy's proposals &mdash; to protect Irish airlines against international market forces nor could I attempt to do so.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's other point on reorganising the competition, let me say that I did that last year when I pulled the two airlines away from savage jungle-type, head-to-head competition and instead gave them complementary routes on which they could have some form of co-operation, which I hope will continue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the present level of losses being incurred by all the operators on the Irish Sea are simply unsustainable and that the inevitable conclusion of that attrition is that Ryanair could go out of business and Aer Lingus would be left with a monopoly at the end of the day?  Would the Minister not agree that his policy must be to preserve two Irish carriers and that the best way to do that would be to decontrol fares and to look at the existing areas where there is predatory combined flights flying out within a half-an-hour of each other from regional airports and that both <Col N="66" /> airlines must be brought together to see how there can be an orderly development of routes across the Irish Sea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree fundamentally with the Deputy.  Decontrolling air fares is not the way to get more competition in the current marketplace. The proof of that, if the Deputy requires proof, is that I have not refused either airline any increase in prices which they have sought.  We have given fare increases of up to 20 per cent in the past year and in one case I am told that a fare increase which I sanctioned was not used because they decided they would lose traffic if they had applied it.  I think that is the wrong direction in which to go.  The correct direction is not to raise fares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no compelling reason at this time to consider re-establishing the Dublin Transport Authority, who were dissolved at the end of 1987 as part of the Government's overall strategy to reduce public expenditure.  In general, I am satisfied that the Dublin Transportation Task Force, which was reconstituted following the dissolution of the Authority, is producing substantial benefits without incurring the administrative and other costs necessarily associated with a statutory authority.</P>
      <P>My detailed reply to Deputy Rabbitte's Question No. 45 on 12 June 1990, columns 1944-45, outlined the work of the Dublin Transportation Task Force in combating traffic congestion and in promoting the greater use of public transport.  That work is being intensified and the task force's allocation has been raised to £200,000 for 1991.  In particular, proposals are well advanced to give significantly more priority to buses.  I am hopeful that these proposals will receive full support from Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P>I should, perhaps, mention that considerable additional resources are being directed by the Garda and traffic wardens to combating illegal parking, which badly affects buses and other road users. In addition, both Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council are strengthening controls on road openings.</P>

Is the Minister not aware that every morning in Dublin, for example, 77,000 cars cross the inner cordon between 8.30 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. and that this avalanche of steel and the clouds of pollution that descend daily on the citizens of Dublin city must be controlled? Would the Minister not agree that the major reason traffic in Dublin city is chaotic is that there is no single body in charge and that at present responsibilities are divided between three Government Departments, the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications, who have responsibility for public transport, the Department of the Environment, who have responsibility for roads, and the Department of Justice who have responsibility for implementing the traffic laws&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The task force do a fair amount of work on bus lanes and in the whole area of traffic flows and <Col N="69" /> clearway signs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As all the questions deal in one way or another with Bord Fáilte's marketing allocation for 1991, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10, 15, 16, 29, 41 and 42 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint plan submitted by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation (ITIC) and Bord Fáilte, &ldquo;Promoting Irish Tourism, 1991-1993&rdquo;, and referred to in a resolution sent to me by Dublin Tourism, calls for an extra £17.4 million in Exchequer funding for Bord Fáilte over the next three years.  While I fully endorse the concept of a more strategic and coordinated approach to marketing Irish tourism, Government priorities, such as reductions in borrowing, in the current budget deficit, in taxation and inflation, rule out an increase in Exchequer funding of the magnitude sought, which would represent an annual increase of 27 per cent in State expenditure on marketing <Col N="71" /> over the period of the plan.  I have asked the confederation and Bord Fáilte to reexamine their proposals with a view to arriving at a more realistic and practical blueprint for action.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, in the light of the prospective difficulties arising for tourism from the Gulf crisis, and from the climate of recession in both of our main markets, the Government allocated an additional £1 million in the recent budget to Bord Fáilte.  This money is to be used for marketing and promotion in 1991, particularly in the UK and mainland Europe markets, with the specific objective of keeping the sector on course this year with the Government's five year tourism targets.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate Deputies' concerns for the tourism industry in these difficult times, there is still a great deal of business to be won.  The Irish tourism industry, which is stronger now than at any time in the past, must respond in an imaginative and aggressive manner to the challenges they are facing at present, particularly in the American market, and to the opportunities which continue to exist in Britain and mainland Europe, and also in the home and Northern Ireland markets.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that the increased marketing activity by Bord Fáilte will be complemented by a significant expansion in marketing and promotion by the private sector, which this year will have access to almost £4 million in ERDF assistance for co-operative marketing and establishment of new markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather disappointed that the Minister has not spelt out in detail a strategy or a crash promotion and marketing programme because of the position of Irish tourism. The purpose of my question was to obtain details in respect of both the American and mainland Europe markets.  We will be burying our heads in the sand if we do not recognise the primary difficulties associated with the American market.  It would be advisable to endeavour to tap the immense potential that is in Germany, Italy and France by an aggressive <Col N="72" /> marketing system, which should be putsued with adequate funds.  I should like to ask the Minister if the strategy Bord Fáilte are engaged in involves television or workshops?</P>

      <P>While it is not what I would like, it is on a par with the average of the past couple of years.  In the early eighties, for example, Bord Fáilte received additional money and this year their allocation is being topped up again by an additional £1 million.  The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and Bord Fáilte came to me recently and proposed substantially increased marketing funds. I simply cannot provide them at present; the most I can manage is an additional £1 million which they will have to spend professionally in a targeted way on the Continent particularly and in the UK. The American market this year will be very disappointing; it will be down very substantially.  I hope we can make up for that in the UK and on the Continent.</P>

      <P>I confirm that in <Col N="75" /> October 1988 CIE proposed to acquire 46 railcars at a cost of just under £40 million.  When I took over the Department I assessed that application and considered that a sum of about £18 million for a smaller number of railcars would meet the requirement.

      <P>I ask the Minister to give a directive to CIE to have the new railcars built at Inchicore with a follow-up programme. He should ensure that they are built by Irish people and not by English or European workers at the expense of Irish people.  This is a very serious matter.</P>

      <asker>Mr. McCartan</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the present position regarding plans for fleet replacement by Aer Lingus; the proportion of the funds which will be provided (a) by the Exchequer and (b) from the company's own resources; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Lingus are engaged in a programme of fleet replacement in respect of the airline's European fleet to cater for the expansion in traffic arising from the general liberalisation of European air transport, the increase in inbound tourists and the need to replace older aircraft in the fleet.  While the Gulf crisis and the current recession in the British and US markets are having a short-term effect on traffic levels, long-term traffic growth projections are of the order of 5 per cent to 7 per cent per annum.  Combined with the recovery measures which Aer Lingus have recently announced, the increasing mix of new aircraft in the fleet will facilitate Aer Lingus' development when the Gulf crisis is resolved and a more favourable economic situation exists.</P>
      <P>Since October 1987 a total of ten B737 jet aircraft and five Fokker 50 aircraft have been delivered to Aer Lingus. a further six B737s and one Fokker 50 are due for delivery between now and June 1992.  The total cost of these 22 aircraft amounts to approximately $602 million and will be financed by the airline through a combination of their own resources and borrowing without resource to the Government for equity or State guarantee of borrowing.</P>
      <P>By the end of 1992 Aer Lingus' European jet fleet will consist of 21 B737 jet aircraft, comprising 16 new generation B737s and five older generation B737s. Aer Lingus also have options on an additional four B737s in the period beyond 1992, but no firm proposals have been put to Government by Aer Lingus in respect of acquisition of these aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, Aer Lingus have recently entered into an agreement with the Swedish aircraft manufacturer, Saab, for the lease of four new Saab 340B commuter aircraft.  Saab will acquire four of Aer Lingus' existing Shorts 360s in return, as part of the transaction.  This is a financially attractive package which will <Col N="78" /> enable Aer Lingus to replace older generation commuter aircraft with new, technologically advanced aircraft, without the need for any major investment.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus are also planning for the necessary replacement of the North Atlantic fleet over the next few years and I expect to receive the airline's proposals in due course.</P>
    <P>Although the commencement of the Los Angeles service has been deferred, I understand that it is the airline's intention to proceed with the lease of two B767 aircraft for the North Atlantic fleet.  The first aircraft is due for delivery in April 1991 and will be deployed on the airline's existing North Atlantic network.  It will largely replace the capacity of the Lockheed Tristar which Aer Lingus leased for the summers of 1989 and 1990 to provide additional capacity.  The second aircraft is not due for delivery until December 1991.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> May I ask the Minister if he has examined proposals by Aer Lingus to offer to the public a portion of the equity of that company so that they will be able to replace their fleet?  Secondly, if he has examined such proposals, has he done so in a manner which would enable him to look with favour on this partial privatisation proposal? When will he be in a position to make a full statement on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans at present to consider a partial privatisation of Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that as there probably will be no Exchequer support, it is the intention of Aer Lingus to dispose of some of their ancillary company assets so that they can replace their fleet?  As the level of air transport losses is likely to be £50 million this year, according to the latest reports, does the Minister not agree that the figures he gave in regard to fleet replacement no longer hold good and that the financial basis of fleet replacement will have to be reassessed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="79" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy rightly said, this is a difficult issue.  The new recovery plan which Aer Lingus have brought to me and which I have approved is very severe.  I support the plan and I have asked the workforce and the management to give it their best so as to ensure that the losses which they fear do not materialise.  This is a good attempt to cut the losses down to the bare minimum. As I have said, I support the plan.</P>
      <P>In regard to fleet replacement, as I said in my reply, since October 1987 a total of $602 million has been paid for the acquisition of new aircraft.  That is a very substantial investment in fleet replacement. Aer Lingus have not sought State equity or guarantees for those aircraft throughout that period.  I do not rule out the possibility of the situation changing dramatically, which is inclined to happen in this business, but as of now I have had no request from Aer Lingus to change the method of financing their aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister in congratulating the workforce and management of Aer Lingus in their attempts to save £20 million to £30 million. However, the workforce are afraid that while they are expected to find £11 million in savings through reductions in their wages, at the same time the Minister will penalise Aer Lingus by forcing them to fly into airports which they want to get out of, that is, Knock and Derry airports. The same restrictions have not been applied to their competitors, Ryanair, who can clearly opt out of servicing whatever regional airport they like, or can bully the regional airport authorities into reducing landing fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try not to comment on many of the assumptions made by the Deputy.  I want again to thank the staff and management of Aer Lingus for getting us through a very difficult time. In their plan Aer Lingus said they wanted to pull out of Knock and Derry airports.  I asked them if they would continue to service these airports because of their importance to the regions.  They <Col N="80" /> looked again at their proposal and acceded to my request.</P>
      <P>Ryanair have only recently said that they want to opt out of servicing a large number of regional airports.  I have explained the position in regard to that proposal in reply to a previous question. I am trying to put together a package which will make it possible for both Aer Lingus and Ryanair between them to service the regional airports.</P>

      <P>Aer Lingus seem to purchase all their aircraft in America, mainly through the Boeing Corporation.  The European aerospace industry is very efficient and manufactures excellent aircraft. In view of the fact that our commitment to Europe is so great, would the Minister not require Aer Lingus to enter into negotiations with the European aerospace industry with a view to purchasing some of their aircraft from that industry?  I understand that the European aerospace industry are very interested in setting up technological exchanges and so on in Ireland which would give employment here.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Chairman of CIE that Iarnród Éireann are in the process of reorganising their Transtrack groupage business, but that following this reorganisation a comparable freight service will continue to be provided using a combination of rail-road operations on a more efficient and costeffective basis.  Freight services will be terminated at some smaller depots where freight volumes are particularly low at present.</P>
      <P>The question of reducing staff numbers associated with this reorganisation is a matter for Iarnród Éireann and is part of the company's ongoing attempts to achieve improved competitiveness and financial performance of the rail freight business.  I understand that discussions with the relevant trade unions concerning the new arrangements are under way at present.</P>

      <P>Yet again we hear figures of job losses, in this case in the region of 250 in Iarnród Éireann.  Would the Minister not agree that this is the wrong time to change the transport of freight from rail to roads?  For environmental <Col N="82" /> reasons, among others, it is better that railways remain the major servicing agent for the movement of freight in the country.</P>

Will he also agree that, for example, a proposal is currently being discussed to cut off the link from Limerick to Rosslare so that there will be no direct service between those two stations or any intermediate station, if this proposal is agreed?

      <P>Would the Minister reenter those discussions with a view to increasing the freight service that is provided by the railways and to taking more of the heavy traffic off our roads?  It is quite evident that no finances are being made available by the Government to repair those roads.  More jobs should be provided and more services made available in this area to take the heavy freight traffic off our roads.</P>

      <P>Under the Public Capital Programme, CIE's annual capital expenditure is normally financed from the board's own resources or by borrowing or by a combination of both. Exchequer capital grants are not made available to CIE.  Capital expenditure incurred by CIE on rolling stock in 1990 amounted to £2 million and this expenditure was financed by the board from their own resources.</P>
      <P>In November 1990 I gave approval to CIE to acquire 17 new railcars at a cost of £18 million.  Provision has been made in the 1991 Public Capital Programme for expenditure of £4.5 million on this rolling stock.

      <Quest>his views on whether any adverse change in the designated trans-atlantic airport status of Shannon Airport would seriously undermine the efforts to develop new sources of traffic for Shannon and would also damage the economic future of the west of Ireland, particularly in the light of the industrial and tourism recession caused by the Gulf War.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 20 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>Current Government policy is that Shannon Airport is Ireland's sole trans-Atlantic gateway for scheduled air services. All scheduled trans-Atlantic air services must operate via Shannon Airport in both directions.  Similarly, charter flights from North America to Dublin are required to stop at Shannon, but in one direction only, on either the inbound or the outbound journey at the operator's discretion.  The Shannon stop requirement no longer applies, however, to charter flights from North America to either Cork Airport or Connaught Regional Airport.</P>
      <P>I have received a number of submissions in recent months from many organisations and individuals arguing both for and against a change in the Shannon stop policy.  My Department are at present studying these submissions, having particular regard to their implications for Shannon Airport and the west of Ireland generally, and I have agreed to meet shortly representatives of both the &ldquo;Fly Dublin Direct Committee&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Shannon Status Committee&rdquo; to hear at first hand their views in the matter.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to commission an independent study to address the issues raised in these submissions but I will, of course, keep that option open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had extensive contacts with major international airlines in recent months with a view to encouraging them to inaugurate new services from North America to Ireland.  I am anxious to explore all possibilities to open up new gateways from North America into Ireland and to secure an expansion in existing services in order to generate additional business and tourism traffic <Col N="88" /> into Ireland.  In this context, Deputies might like to know that I have recently granted to Aeroflot fifth freedom rights for services between Shannon and Miami and Shannon and Gander.</P>
    <P>In relation to the status of Shannon generally, I can assure the House that the Government are fully committed to the further development of Shannon Airport and the Shannon region as a major centre for economic growth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that these two documents, one produced by the Davy, Kelleher McCarthy group and the one on Shannon mid-west from the Envision group, have been commissioned by business interests in the mid-west Shannon region and in the east with a view to attracting as much business as they can to their respective regions. Will the Minister agree that it would be appropriate at this stage to have a full, open and thorough debate on the pros and cons of this 40 year stop-over at Shannon in view of its delicate nature and the dire &mdash; and potentially disastrous &mdash; state of the national airline, and Ryanair by implication, because of the difficulties as a result of the Gulf war, and the falling number of North American tourists coming to Ireland?  As it was envisaged that Aer Lingus would establish a direct route to Los Angeles, will the Minister agree that it is of tremendous importance to take a decision, one way or the other, given the fact that in the mid-west there has been a decline in investment in hotels because of the Minister's indecision in regard to the stop-over?  Will he agree that it would be advantageous&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is an appallingly difficult year in aviation.  I have met most of the chief executives of the American airline companies and their boards and I get a very clear message that Ireland is not high on their agenda because of aviation fuel costs and the near panic in some of the major international airlines. There is a need to get more airlines in here and I stress that that is the bottom line.  We can all argue about Shannon and Dublin and where the planes will land but, at the end of the day, we will not have any landings if we cannot persuade the various international major airlines to fly in and out of Ireland.  I must confess that I am less worried about where the aeroplanes land than the fact that we might not have them at all.  I am more and more concerned about that aspect of this whole aviation business.  Airports are not a problem in this country, airlines are.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Minister for restating Government policy.  In a recent radio interview the Minister clearly stated that it was not a matter of principle but a pragmatic decision as to whether an additional tranche of business would be attracted to Ireland <Col N="90" /> if direct flights were allowed into Dublin. It is not a matter of principle, it is a matter of attracting extra business.  The Minister stated in his reply that he had discussions with airline companies in North America.  Will he inform the House whether any of the North American airline companies &mdash; either in the United States or Canada &mdash; have made a proposition to him to fly direct from any North American location to Dublin?  If such a proposition has been made, will he state which company made it?  Is he inclined to believe that this would provide extra tourists and business people to Ireland and would not simply divert business from one Irish airport to another?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any hard and fast definite offers from any airline to fly from North America to Ireland at present.  I have conveyed to all airlines the desire of the Government &mdash; and, I am sure, of the House &mdash; to have additional airlines flying in and out of Ireland. They know of the Government's interest in that happening and I do not have any formal proposal from them.  I have had a number of reactions, in a general sense, from them but they were very informal and I do not have a formal offer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am watching it very closely but I am not prepared to be drawn into a formal review with the aim of issuing a report by a definite date because that would lead to continuous demands from everybody as to when it will be finished.  I would be negligent if I did not watch this issue very carefully and if I did not talk to people in airlines and Deputies from all parts of the country.  Indeed, that is what I am doing; I am not conducting a formal review which will finish at a particular date.  There is no time-scale.</P>
      <P>In regard to American Express, I have given Shannon Airport all the support I can to make sure that that project works for them.  They will have further support from the Department and myself to make sure that their Atlantic Express concept works for them.  It is a very difficult concept and I know that they are having a lot of trouble getting it started but they have our support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>

Drastic ills need drastic remedies and I think the Minister will agree that if commercial companies use those people to boost their products we can also use them.  Will the Minister agree that last year, after our good performance in the World Cup, there was a big increase in the number of <Col N="92" /> tourists to this country, especially from the Continent?</P>

      <P>I would like to point out, and I am sure the Minister is aware of this, that there are 74,000 people on the live register for the Dublin region and that it is therefore a disadvantaged region.  Can the Minister tell the House if, in his contacts with Aer Lingus, particularly on the Los Angeles route which was due to open on 1 January this year, they told him that because it costs £8,000 to land at Shannon the Los Angeles route is not viable?  Given that this would be a new service, would the Minister accede to the request for direct flights between Dublin and Los Angeles so that tourists and customers from North America can be brought to Dublin?</P>

      <Col N="141" /> The Law Reform Commission, in Chapter 6, (2.c), of their report, recommend that we should enact legislation here to contain among other things &ldquo;a certificate purporting to be under the seal of the Minister for Foreign Affairs evidence of the fact that a State is party to the Convention and of any declarations or reservations made by a State party to the Convention&rdquo;, and the reasons for that are set out in the report.  Is the Minister satisfied that that provision is adequately covered by the provisions in section 4?  Is that intended to be the section to take on board, so to speak, the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission?</P>
    <P>They make other proposals with regard to necessary legislative steps we should take to properly accommodate the Hague Convention, in particular.  I am concerned that this recommendation is accommodated by the legislation.  I am curious because this is a rather technical area.  Is section 4 designed to deal with that recommendation?</P>

We are <Col N="142" /> satisfied that section 4 (2) covers adequately the points made by Deputy McCartan.  Section 4 (2) provides that:</P>
      <P>An order that is in force under subsection (1) of this section shall, as the case may be, be evidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a query which might be better left to pursue further when we come to an amendment in my name dealing with the issue of legal aid. I will put my query now to the Minister of State.  He may wish to leave it and take the matter up again.  The declaration here is simple, that The Hague Convention shall have the force of law.  The Minister in moving Second Stage said that legal aid will be available to applicants.  The explanatory memorandum provides, on page 3: &ldquo;11. Applicants under both Conventions will be entitled to legal aid.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision in the Bill in the accommodating section dealing with that aspect but it is recited in the text of the conventions that the contracting states should make provision, in short, for legal aid for those who require it under any application.  The Bill provides in Chapter <Col N="143" /> V, Article 25: &ldquo;Nationals of the Contracting States and persons who are habitually resident within those States shall be entitled in matters concerned with the application of this Convention to legal aid and advice in any other Contracting State on the same conditions as if they themselves were nationals of and habitually resident in that State.&rdquo;  Is that the way the Minister intends to leave this matter?  In other words, for the purposes of allowing people avail of our legal aid provisions here, is he satisfied that a mere recital of it in the convention is adequate, coupled with section 6 of the Bill which provides it shall have the force of law, or is it intended in the Department through other regulations or under other legislation to provide for the extension of legal aid to cover applications under the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy McCartan said, we will be dealing with this later on an amendment he has down.  Let me say that once we ratify the convention as a result of this Bill, when it becomes binding, it is automatic and incumbent on us that the Department of Justice, being the central authority in the case, and the State itself, must accept the rules of the convention, that is that in any case automatically the State which is a party to the convention must provide that necessary resources to ensure that legal aid is available to any person taking a case or any person affected by any application.  As a party to the convention, once we ratify the convention as a result of this Bill, it will be incumbent automatically on us in law to ensure we make legal aid available. We are satisfied that position will obtain and that we do not have to enshrine it in the Bill.  It is part of our international obligation under the convention and our national obligation once we ratify the convention.  I will come back to it.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in wishing the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, every success in his new role as Minister of State at the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>In regard to section 7, &ldquo;the court&rdquo; as defined in the Bill is the High Court.  Why is it necessary to use the High Court in this instance?  I am thinking particularly of the debate on the Judicial Separation Bill in which I say from memory &mdash; correct me if I am wrong &mdash; the Circuit Court is the court used in relation to family matters.  During that debate all Members were concerned that we would have judges sitting in family courts who would have a great deal of feeling for the type of cases they would be hearing on a regular basis, that certain types of judges would be selected to deal with those types of cases and preferably there would be some judicial training for dealing with the whole area of family law and particularly children.</P>
      <P>This legislation, which I welcome very much, also deals with children.  Our primary concern in this legislation is the protection of the rights of children as distinct from getting into disputes about who should have custody or who should not have custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that the Minister would satisfy himself that the High Court should be the only court to be used in these types of cases.  I would be anxious that we continue this whole concept, that in family law matters, including those affecting children, we would have people sitting on the bench &mdash; I say this with the greatest respect to this Judiciary because I acknowledge that a judge must deal with many different types of cases on a daily basis when the court is in session &mdash; who would have a feeling for the whole area of family law relationships between adults and between adults and children. For that reason I would be anxious to hear from the Minister why, in this instance, we must revert to the High Court.  There may be a very good reasons of which I am not aware but it would be worth giving the Minister an opportunity <Col N="145" /> to explain why it is the High Court that is referred to in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Seán Barrett for his kind words.  I look forward to working with the spokespersons of all the parties and having a good rapport with them in order to ensure that the laws we enact are for the betterment of the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to what Deputy Barrett has said I should explain that there are a number of reasons the High Court has been selected as the most suitable court. At present when children are abducted into the State it is the High Court that is normally used to seek the child's return whether by <i>habeas-corpus</i> application or otherwise.  It is considered that the High Court is the most appropriate court to hear cases under the Hague Convention, the expediency required under that convention and subject to certain safeguards in the convention which generally have regard to what is best for the child but also, as is specified in Article 20, make provision for the fundamental principles enshrined in our Constitution.  One of the reasons the High Court has been selected is that it is the one court that is available 24 hours a day every day.  These cases often occur at very sudden notice when one needs to be able to call on a higher court very quickly.  Often they also impinge on constitutional questions when the expertise of the High Court in that area is of great importance.  While I share Deputy Barrett's desire that we have people with specialised training in family law and child care deal with such matters it is appropriate for the courts to decide what training, if any, they should have. Because they have already been hearing cases like these we believe that expertise is already there.  Consequently, in the interests of expedient decisons and in order to be able to respond to immediate, sudden difficulties &mdash; taking into account the constitutional aspect and the availability of the High Court on a 24 hour basis &mdash; in order to fulfil our obligations under the Hague Convention in the broadest possible context it is important <Col N="146" /> that it be the High Court that deals with cases in these circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Seán Barrett in expressing some concern about reliance on the High Court as the exclusive court to deal with applications under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>In defence of the Circuit Court and indeed the district courts let me say that they are courts whose judges are also available on a 24 hour, seven day basis because very often the Circuit Court and district courts must deal with urgent matters. I am thinking of landlord and tenant issues, of barring procedures, place of safety orders for children at risk and many other separate, similar type applications.  It is only fair to say that our judges are available at all levels and in all courts when needed.  Equally they all deal with matters which impinge on constitutional rights.  I accept that the High Court is the court of primary jurisdiction and the court of first recourse and authority in dealing with the Constitution. Nonetheless all judges often take decisions affecting the position and rights of persons under the Constitution. Indeed the Constitution itself requires judges to take an oath that they will uphold its provisions and implement the law in accordance with its spirit.</P>
      <P>As has been pointed out, we have given substantial jurisdiction to the law courts to deal with matters relating to children's rights, custody and maintenance.  Then it does not seem logical to exclude either the District or Circuit Court entirely from the provisions and operations of the Bill. The obvious, really practical consideration is that of cost.  The complexities and formalities of the High Court are such that the onus that will be placed, for example, on legal aid centres in complying with the requirements of the more formal procedures of the High Court will be all the greater.  It is a matter which should be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider before Report Stage whether we might enable the Circuit Court to deal with applications under the provisions of the Bill.  Then the High Court would be there <Col N="147" /> as a court of appeal, from the Circuit Court, if issues needed to be taken further. As a matter of practicality there should be no difficulty experienced because it is not unfair to suggest that most if not all of the litigation arising under this Bill will come before the Circuit Court because the central authority with responsibility inevitably will be based in Dublin.  Therefore, most if not all of the litigation will take place in Dublin where the Circuit Court &mdash; and indeed the District Courts &mdash; have a fine array of family law courts established in seaparate buildings with all of the necessary resources and equipment available to them.</P>
    <P>It is a matter worthy of further consideration and it would be my hope that the Minister would reflect on it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting what the Minister said in relation to the availability of the High Court I would ask him to reconsider this matter for Report Stage.  It is important &mdash; I am speaking now not as a qualified lawyer by description &mdash; that we should, as a nation, endeavour to develop the whole concept of the family court in which we deal with family matters and those relating to children in a less formal atmosphere, one in which the wigs, gowns and formality of the court will disappear when it comes to dealing with what are basically family issues, be they breakdowns between spouses or cases in which children are involved.  I would contend that in 90 per cent of cases the issue with which we are dealing here is a family one.  Take the example of the &ldquo;tug of love&rdquo; as it is known, a breakdown between husband and wife affecting the whole family. Within the family court we should endeavour to develop a Judiciary that is understanding, dealing with these types of issues on a daily basis, so that it will become second nature to a judge to be understanding of such matters because he is in the atmosphere of the family court continuously.  I have often thought how difficult it must be for a judge to shift from one type of case to another. <Col N="148" /> After all we are all human and there will be occasions when we are in better form than at other times.  It would also lead to more consistency within the overall realm of family matters.</P>
      <P>For those good reasons, as I see them, it would be worthwhile reconsidering the involvement of the High Court in these cases unless it is absolutely essential, which it is not obviously, that a particular court must be the court to hear particular cases.  From what the Minister and my colleague, Deputy McCartan, have said, there is no compelling reason that the High Court should be the court to be used in all such cases under the provisions of this Bill.  We should also take into account the costs involved.  The family court in the Circuit Court is the place we can ensure that justice is seen to be done in family law cases in a less formal atmosphere and at lesser cost.</P>

      <P>I join my colleagues in sending my heartiest best wishes to the Minister on his appointment.  We all look forward to working with him.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's point that it is normal for these cases to be dealt with in a fire brigade fashion.  That is what makes this so confusing because there is a very long waiting list for free legal aid. Most of the people who would have to contest this type of case would require free legal aid.  A lot of them would be women without an income.  Can the Minister explain how the system of free legal aid would operate, at short notice, in a special sitting of the High Court or any other court?  Where will there be provision in the Bill, in the regulations or in the Department to operate free legal aid in this sort of case?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bell for his kind remarks.  I take cognisance of what my colleagues have said on this matter.  I do not have a hang up about any particular court, but it is important to designate the appropriate court.  There are a number of reasons the High Court was chosen.  I concur with Deputy McCartan about the availability of judges in all of the courts.  The difference <Col N="149" /> between the High Court and the others is that the High Court usually sits on most days, apart from weekends, whereas the other courts will not find it possible to hear cases for various reasons.</P>
      <P>We also need to build up a certain expertise in this area, as Deputy Barrett said.  There may be on average about ten cases like this per annum.  If we are to build up expertise we must have the cases heard in a particular court where that expertise could be built up.  The High Court would be suitable.  If we were to delegate responsibility to the lower courts, the Circuit Court or the District Court, there may be only one case in a Circuit Court in any one area in a year. If that were the pattern it would be hard to build up the necessary expertise.  Holding the cases in one court would make it possible to build up expertise.</P>
      <P>In relation to what Deputy Barrett said about the wigs and gowns, as per the Judicial Separation Act, 1989, section 39 (2), in cases like these, wigs and gowns will not be worn.  I am sure the House will be happy with that.</P>
      <P>Another reason the High Court should be used is that one of the first things the court may have to do would be to make a child a ward of court and the High Court has that jurisdiction.  However, I am prepared to consider what my colleagues have said.  I will look at this before Report Stage to see if there is an alternative to having them in the High Court and I will inform the House so that we can have consensus on the matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to free legal aid about which Deputy Bell talked, the central authority in the other country would make a request to the central authority here, the Department of Justice, in relation to any application to be heard here, and we would automatically make free legal aid available, inform the Legal Aid Board and have one of the solicitors from the board nominated to take care of the case.  The response would have to be immediate.  There would not be any delay or doubt.  Free legal aid will have to be made available under our laws and under international law.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 not moved.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had submitted an amendment which I have been advised is out of order.  I accept the ruling.  Nonetheless, I would like to talk to the Minister about the spirit of the amendment which related to the establishment of the central authority.  The section gives the Minister permission, if he wishes, to establish a central authority and I sought to make that mandatory by changing the world &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and indicating a time limit, that it should be established within six months.  The provisions of the Bill are very important and should be brought into play as quickly as possible.  What are the indications as to when a central authority will be established, and who will designate it as a central authority?  In the recent legislation dealing with child care a provision was incorporated to the effect that the Minister would bring a section or sections, or the Act in its entirety, into play by order when the occasion was right.  It is estimated that it will be years rather than months before that important legislation is brought into play.  On the other hand, the Video Recordings Bill passed in this House over 12 months ago is still awaiting ministerial order to bring it into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the surface we seem to be legislating in very important areas of law but because of the way in which sections are drafted and powers are given to individual Ministers to make orders to <Col N="151" /> bring the legislation into operation, often times the laws we are passing in this House are not operating.  This is a section where that possibility arises and it is possible that a central authority will not be established for a considerable period, and to that effect the Bill will not be up and running.  It is important to get a clear assurance that the central authority will be established sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the central authority will be the Department of Justice. We need to clarify how this will operate in the Department of Justice.  Will an official be designated with primary, if not sole, responsibility for the operation of that authority and its works, or will the Minister have direct ministerial responsibility for the authority?  The importance there is that a member of the public should know whom to go to and how to deal with approaches to the central authority.  Not everyone will be going through the agency of the central authority in the other contractual state.  Not everyone, of necessity, will be granted legal aid or will go through a lawyer who knows the ropes.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that these applications can arise in very heated and immediate circumstances involving high emotion and people under great stress in difficult circumstances, and it is important to have easy and clearly identifiable access available.  For example, the Department of Justice are not open seven days a week.  I presume like all other reasonable institutions they close at the weekend.  The difficulty here is that if the central authority is someone lost in the middle of a Department who close their doors at 5 o'clock on Friday, that absence could be exploited by people who would seek to do down the rights of children by bringing them into the State and disappearing within the State or by moving out of the State at an opportune time. Those factors are real.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to a remarkable affair where a mother and a lawyer were able to intercept at a Swiss airport a father and a child making their way rapidly to a Middle East county.  Timing was <Col N="152" /> crucial.  If they had arrived on a different day or at a different hour and if the Swiss authorities had not been so readily at hand and so well disposed, the heroic dash by the lawyer and the mother might have come to nothing.  It is important that the central authority, as well as the court, should be available on a 24-hour, seven-day basis.  Will the central authority have a public office where people can go or is it a matter that will be reposed within the Department and a person seeking aid or assistance will be dealt with by whoever is available on the day from a section within the Department?</P>
    <P>If issues arise in particular or general matters, will we be in a position in this House to put questions to the Minister relating to the functions and operations of the central authority, or will we be told that it is not a matter within the Minister's remit and has been passed to a person or group for whom the Minister has no direct responsibility?  These are issues which are not explained in the section.  It is a general and enabling section rather than a mandatory one.  Is it intended to establish an independent authority outside the Department or is it intended that the authority will forever repose within the Department's remit and functions?</P>
    <P>The Minister is being somewhat conservative in estimating the number of cases which will be covered by this legislation. I believe that the incidence of this unfortunate kind of case will increase rather than decrease due to the increasing number of inter-country marriages.  Perhaps we would be better served by an authority of experts, people working in the field, appointed by a small board chaired by some eminent person independent of the Department.  I say this in view of any conflicts that might arise between the interests of individuals and the policy of the Government or of the Department which might be seen to bear unnecessarily on the working and freedom of the authority.  These are important questions which I hope the Minister will be in a position to answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably one of <Col N="153" /> the most important aspects of this legislation and I should like to hear from the Minister exactly what he has in mind regarding the central authority.  The Minister suggested that we are dealing with only a small number of cases and he mentioned the figure of ten.  Of course that would be ten too many.  Factors such as ease of travel, the large number of emigrants marrying abroad while working in America or Europe, and the general fact that the world is becoming a smaller place lead one to believe that there could be more cases to be dealt with in this area.</P>
      <P>Ireland can play a major role and lead by example.  We often ask what we can do in the world of international politics. We are a member of the UN and this is one area where we can use our influence to encourage more and more nations to involve themselves in these conventions. Where conventions are not in place we can encourage more bilateral arrangements in relation to child abduction.  We as a small nation can have a major influence if we lead by example.  We are not talking about vast sums of money or setting up elaborate procedures but rather showing by example that things can be done to lessen the grief and hardship caused to so many people as a result of child abduction.</P>
      <P>I do not think any of us here has any personal experience of this horrific trauma which must leave a terrible mark on the child and the parent or guardian. The fear must remain that it may happen again.  It is like any kidnapping in that it is a most horrible crime and is even more horrific in that it involves small children who cannot defend themselves.  We should not underestimate the grief and hardship involved in this type of experience. Neither should we underestimate the possibility that the incidence of this type of problem could become greater, due to factors I have mentioned.  Conventions of this type are the ideal way of resolving such difficulties between civilised countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If somebody contacts any of us or another individual inside or outside the legal system in a matter of this type, the <Col N="154" /> central authority is the place to go.  There should be a clear understanding when this legislation has been passed as to the structures which will operate in relation to the central authority.  I am not in the business of saying that Ministers should have no say in such matters but a Minister for Justice is not the person to head the central authority.  He is a very busy person.</P>
    <P>If we provide that the central authority is the Minister for Justice, we do not expect that a person caught in this position will personally contact the Minister. It may be impossible to do so, for various reasons.  The Department of Justice, and the Minister, should be involved in a central authority.  I would envisage a children's commissioner or an office set up as the central authority, headed by a person who could do other things in addition to dealing with the odd case of child abduction that might be referred.  I am talking about politicians examining this matter in detail so that we encourage greater participation in conventions.  It goes beyond dealing with the occasional case that may come before the central authority.  We should be developing and encouraging a worldwide charter for the rights of children.  This is probably one of the greatest evils that can be perpetrated against a young child.  In dealing with this type of legislation we should at all times think about the child first, and everybody else second.  For that reason I would ask the Minister, before going further with this section, to outline to us what he has in mind in relation to the central authority.  As the legislation is worded at the moment, the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; by order appoint a central authority to discharge the functions of the central authority under the Hague Convention. Unless and until the Minister appoints a central authority under this section the said functions shall be discharged by the Minister, not by representatives of the Minister, and reference in this part to the central authority in the State shall be construed accordingly as references to the Minister.</P>
    <P>As the legislation stands at present, the Minister is taking on this job.  I think that <Col N="155" /> is unsatisfactory.  This House should be told what plans the Minister has in mind in relation to a central authority because I do not think that those who thought up these conventions in the first place ever expected that the Minister for Justice would be the person to contact if one had a problem.</P>
    <P>The wording of this section should be more definite.  Whilst Deputy McCartan's amendment was not accepted for legal reasons, the Minister has an ideal opportunity here to tell us and to put it on the record what plans he has and what structures will be in place.  He should tell us whether or not the Attorney General has any role in this central authority and whether the health boards or the probation and welfare officers will have any control.  We are into the area of the custody of children, of perhaps having to put children into care for a very limited period.  The central authority will play a major role in all of this.  As Deputy McCartan says, this is &ldquo;bang bang stuff&rdquo;. One does not hang around if the boat is leaving in two hours or if the plane is leaving in three hours.  We have to make certain that we have a system whereby somebody in Dublin Airport can be contacted immediately, or somebody at Dún Laoghaire Harbour or the North Wall, to make certain that a child does not leave the jurisdiction.  We cannot hang around wondering who is really in charge of this. It is like when the snow falls and traffic piles up all over the place, and a day later we have a big inquiry to find out who was really responsible.  Unless we know ourselves what we are talking about we will all be hanging around asking where the Minister is.  The Minister's Private Secretary might be representing the Minister, or perhaps it would be the Minister's officials, but we as public representatives want to be able to come in and ask the Minister to explain to us the circumstances of a particular case that went wrong.  No matter who is sitting on that side of the House in that office, people on this side of the House will want to know why somebody slipped up.</P>
    <P>What will we do in the whole area of <Col N="156" /> passports?  We can have a central authority here that can advise people, that can have a promotional role with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We should be raising this on a continuous basis in the UN.  We should be encouraging more and more countries into this because this whole legislation, as everybody knows, only works where different countries are parties to the convention. It does not apply otherwise.</P>
    <P>In a civilised society, we as a small nation should be making certain that this matter is raised on a continuous basis. All of this prompting, this leading by example, can be done here at very little cost, with no elaborate buildings, no special secretariat, just proper structures, knowing exactly what we have in mind, where we can improve things, how we can encourage judicial training; knowing where the Legal Aid Board comes into it, looking into the whole area of passports. All of these things can be a function of the central authority if there is a person nominated who would be in charge.  I only mentioned the idea of a children's commissioner as an example.  It does not have to be that.  It can be called anything, but there should be an office with somebody responsible.</P>
    <P>The legislation should not be left as it is at the moment.  We have no guarantee that subsection (1) will ever develop any further than what is stated in the legislation, which simply says the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; by order appoint a central authority. The Minister may never appoint a central authority.  The Minister may just continue to accept responsibility himself.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to ask this House to pass this section without knowing exactly what the Minister of the day has in mind in relation to the central authority as mentioned here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly like to join my two colleagues in emphasising to the Minister that this section certainly needs to be much more specific.  It is very vague, to say the least.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; implies that something might never happen but, effectively, this is the most important section of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> I would certainly agree that it should be controlled by the Department of Justice. However, it should not be part of the Department of Justice but separate.  If it becomes part of the Department it will just be thrown from Billy to Jack and there will be no beginning or end to it; it will never be able to develop the type of expertise that is necessary and will become more and more so as more countries are added to the 15 that are already part of the Hague Convention.</P>
    <P>Looking at the list of countries, the major problems we have had in relation to this has been with non-nationals from countries that are not actually on that list of 15.  Therefore, apart from the convention, we also require expertise in dealing with countries that are not part of the convention itself.  A lot of these things happen on religious basis with countries that are not listed there at all under section 7.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that because we do not have divorce here the whole operation of this type of activity is much more difficult because things are not regularised in clear and more definitive terms as they are in countries listed in that 15, the majority of which have had divorce legislation in operation for many years. That tends to complicate things.</P>
    <P>We would have to oppose this in its present form and ask the Minister to be much more specific in relation to that section.  There should be a separate unit under the control of the Department. One of its functions would be, for example, to initiate steps to trace a child who had been abducted into this State. There it seems, one is virtually getting involved in the activities of the Garda Síochána.  Does this mean that there will be a special investigator in the Department of Justice if this authority is under the umbrella of the Department who would simply go around knocking on doors and making inquiries to try to establish where the child had been abducted to or who was holding the child or children?  I would like to have that point explained to me.</P>
    <P>I would like also to have a further point clarified, who will initiate the steps to <Col N="158" /> trace the child?  Does this mean that a Member of the Oireachtas would be able to ring up the Department of Justice, ask for the section dealing with child abductions and discuss the steps being taken to trace an abducted child?  This needs to be spelled out clearly in the legislation.  Are we talking about employing agencies or appointing a member or members of the Garda Síochána to carry out investigations and searches?  This is not a crime that happens every day; there could be three or four cases in one week and there might not be another case for three months.  What will the central authority do in the meantime?  I am inclined to the opinion that a central authority should be separately appointed but initially at least should consist of people who have other professional interests, who would be divorced from but subject to the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 is a relatively straightforward section.  Section 8 (1) enables the Minister to appoint a central authority and that will enable the Minister, if he so decides at some time in the future, to nominate a central authority, somebody other than himself.  For the present, however, and for the foreseeable future, the Minister for Justice by virtue of subsection (2) will, through the Department of Justice, act as the central authority.  This is the position in most other contracting states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials in the Department of Justice have considerable experience in relation to the conventions not only because of their involvement in the preparation of this legislation but also on account of their attendance at many meetings concerning the conventions of the Hague Conference on Private International Law and the Council of Europe.  Department of Justice staff will be especially assigned to the central authority and their names, where they can be contacted <i>et cetra,</i> will be publicised in the State and in other contracting states.  On that point, I am delighted to be able to tell the House that we propose to publish a special information leaflet which will carry the name, and telephone number of the responsible <Col N="159" /> officer in the central authority within the Department of Justice and the name, address and telephone number and other relevant information of the responsible officer in each of the other central authorities.</P>
    <P>We also propose to have a liaison with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The other central authorities we know of are open five days a week and have one officer with responsibility for it.  The Department of Justice &mdash; I think Deputy Barrett alluded to this &mdash; will be open five days a week but we hope to liaise with the Department of Foreign Affairs and, as they have a service operating right through the seven days, we intend to ensure that the relevant information is available constantly to that Department who will have a co-ordinating role in cases which have an international dimension to them.  The Department of Foreign Affairs will, in turn, be able to contact this officer directly over the weekend.  Of course, the Garda Síochána will have the information also and this will help to ensure that we will have a responsible officer available at all times.</P>
    <P>The extent of the administrative work involved in the operation of a central authority can be gauged from the fact that in England the central authority is serviced by just one full-time officer.  Our central authority will be concerned with fewer cases and it would be overstating the position if we were to have a whole bevy of officials involved in the special authority.  We will definitely appoint a specific officer who will have full responsibility and who will report to the Secretary of and the Minister for Justice on this matter.  There will be a team of officials with the relevant expertise working to that designated officer and they will operate the legislation once it is enacted and the convention as required.</P>
    <P>There will also be special liaison between the central authority and the Garda Síochána.  There have already been consultations on this matter between the different bodies and guidelines will be in place when the legislation <Col N="160" /> comes into operation.  The Garda Síochána will appoint a special liaison officer who will have overall responsibility for the operation of the law in this situation and for the operation of the convention at the request of the central authority in the Department of Justice.  After that, it will be a matter for the operational procedures of the Garda Síochána for the Garda to carry out their duties in search of a child or children or to carry out the role they have under the operational control of the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan asked about a special office for the central authority. We would regard the Department of Justice as being a high street office, readily accessible and in a very prestigious location.  Most people know where it is. The fact that we will make the information available ensures that the central authority will be operating in a key area with the relevant expertise to ensure that we will be able to maximise the services available to the people as required.  As in most other contracting states, apart from the US, no regional offices of central authority are considered necessary here. The nature of the authority is such that it is a central authority and as England have a single authority we also propose to have a central authority operating through the Department of Justice and the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Section 8 as proposed gives the right to the Minister for Justice in the future, if the need is there, to appoint a specific central authority away from the Department of Justice.  We are vesting that power in the Minister for Justice.  This is a good law.  It is a good opportunity to bring forward legislation to create a structure but we give the flexibility to the Minister for Justice, or a future Government, to create a specific authority to fulfil the needs of the law nationally and internationally based on pressures and demands that might arise.  Of course, it will operate as an independent unit within the Department of Justice but that does not mean that these officers will not have other responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan or Deputy Bell asked whether the Minister for Justice <Col N="161" /> could be questioned on the execution of his duties in this matter.  Deputies are well aware of parliamentary procedures and will know that once the Minister for Justice has responsibility for any specific function he is, of course, entitled to be questioned in this House by way of parliamentary question or otherwise on any issue or on any case.  As the central authority are vested and entrusted to his Department he will have responsibility for answering any questions addressed to him at any time in the House.  I hope that information will be of assistance to Deputies who can be absolutely assured that we intend to discharge our duties both nationally and internationally under the law and the convention to the maximum service of people who find themselves in a very traumatic situation. As Deputy Barrett has said, the fewer cases the better, but human nature being what it is we must legislate for the problem and ensure there is a service to assist people in these very sad and difficult cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his detailed response.  To some degree I wish to repeat the proposition that I can see good reason why the Department of Justice would be the best resourced and capable institution for dealing with these applications.  For that reason, I am not unduly concerned about the functions and responsibilities reposing with the Minister for the time being or, as the Minister said, &ldquo;for the foreseeable future&rdquo;.  What circumstances might lead to a change in that arrangement or which might prompt him to appoint a central authority, independent of or exterior to the Department?  The fact is that the central authority will remain with the Minister in the Department. The issue of accessibility is a very live and real one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister of State is in the Department of Justice only a very short time but I hope that at some stage he will have an opportunity to look at an area of work in the Department that is not totally unconnected, that is the aliens section.  The aliens section is a unit <Col N="162" /> within the Department with responsibility for dealing with the arrival here of non-nationals.  If he looks at the record of this House he will see that many Deputies on this side of the House and, indeed, of his own party when they were on this side of the House, have raised questions about the accessibility and the fair way &mdash; or more particularly the unfair way &mdash; in which that section of the Department carry out their functions.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems relates to the absence of guidelines or regulations, accountability and answerability of that unit of the Department.  It is not a pleasant experience for non-nationals to go to the Department, even though the Minister talks about it being a high street location and a prestigous address.  Non-nationals who have to go there do not find it pleasant and will not concur in that view.  In my capacity as a Deputy I have gone there with non-nationals seeking some help and I went there previously as a lawyer in the company of clients.  While courtesy is always extended it is nonetheless an intimidating experience to say the least.  I am worried that that type of attitude may in some way work its way into the workings of the central authority, as envisaged under the provisions of the Bill.  I urge the Minister to ensure against that happening.  It is important to ensure that there are firm regulations in place that lay down the rights of people who come and which clearly state their position and to whom they can have recourse if dissatisfied with the response they receive.</P>
    <P>To put the matter into context, one will inevitably be dealing with people who are highly emotional, very distressed, in pursuit of a child, searching for a loved one who has been secreted into the country illegally, abducted, or taken out of the country.  This will need very careful, considered and tender handling.  I do not want to visit undue criticism but in all my visits to the aliens section of the Department of Justice I have never found that those qualities were there in any great abundance.</P>
    <P>The prospect I see emerging here is <Col N="163" /> that the person who will be given responsibilities will be somebody working in the aliens section because those areas are not completely unrelated.  I have reservations and worries that what should be a very caring and responsive unit may not have those qualities.  I do not want to push the matter any further as I have made the point I wanted to make.</P>
    <P>How will a person coming in at a port or airport be able to find his or her way to St. Stephen's Green and knock on the door there and say: &ldquo;I need the assistance of the central authority and its agencies&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I need legal aid&rdquo;?  If your want to put an entry into the telephone directory &mdash; which is obviously a useful point of first reference &mdash; what will it be called?  How will people find their way to this agency, authority or unit?  How will it be described?</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State can tell the House how the one officer in the UK exists, how the service there is promoted, or advertised, in order that people know how to find it easily?  When people arrive in St. Stephen's Green they will not see a neon sign up saying &ldquo;Central Authority&rdquo; with an arrow pointing to the front door. These are the practical problems that will inevitably arise.  That is why I asked whether we would have a high street office or a location that would be easily and clearly identifiable and contactable whenever a problem like this arises. While these issues may appear minute or nit-picking they are nonetheless, essential to the working of this legislation in a practical way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all happy with the Minister's response because as I said, this is the kernel of the legislation. I was even more disturbed when I heard him say that central authorities are being appointed in other countries.  If the Department of Justice in Britain or Germany are doing it why should we always have to do it?  As I said earlier, there are very few things that a small country like ours can actually do in a big way in the United Nations.  This legislation is useless unless we get more and more countries <Col N="164" /> putting their names on the piece of paper binding themselves to these conventions. This is an opportunity for us to think for ourselves.  There are practical difficulties involved.  Can you imagine a woman who wakes up or who comes home after shopping and suddenly discovers that her child is missing?  It is all very well that legislation says that there may be a central authority and in the meantime there is the Minister for Justice.  Panic sets in. Where do I go?  Whom do I contact? As Deputy McCartan said, you open a telephone directory and ask who do I contact?  We should be leading and we should be saying this is the model for everybody else.  It will not cost us a fortune, it will not impose massive sums of taxation on our taxpayers if it is organised properly.  If it is organised as a model other countries would follow.  In our Constitution we have a special place for our children and rightly so; we should actually mean that and we should lead by example.  We are the people who should be hammering and saying this is what we want other countries do to instead of saying: &ldquo;If they do it over there it must be all right for us, so we will do the same&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the explanatory memorandum, circulated with this Bill, states:</P>
      <P>The primary task of the Central Authorities is the transmission of incoming and outgoing applications for the return of children who have been abducted to any Contracting State. The Central Authority here will take or cause the following action to be taken:</P>
      <P>(a)  where a child has been abducted into the State</P>
      <P>&mdash;initiate steps to trace the child;</P>
      <P>&mdash;seek the child's return or secure access to the child;</P>
      <P>&mdash;arrange, if necessary, for court proceedings to secure the return of, or access to, the child.</P>
      <P>(b)  where a child has been abducted from the State</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" />&mdash;assist the wronged party in seeking the return of the child;</P>
    <P>&mdash;collate and send other Central Authorities information (including welfare reports) about the abducted child.</P>
    <P>The Minister is telling us that designated officials would be named in the Department of Justice and that their names will be known. I do not know what will be the rank of the officials in the Department of Justice.  Presumably every official in every Department is ambitious and seeks promotion.  They may be transferred to another Department, and if we want proper public service we will encourage greater mobility and more opportunities for public servants.  Therefore, I want to refer to what will happen if Mr. X, Miss Y, Mr. Z and Miss B are the only people in the Department of Justice who can deal with child abduction cases.  It may happen that Mr. X gets sick, Miss Y is transferred, Mr. Z gets promotion and Miss B is on holidays.  In such cases the person who phones the Department of Justice asking to talk to one of these four people will be told that none of them is available.</P>
    <P>We should deal with this issue as ordinary Irish men and women and for once forget about what they do in other countries. We should decide on the best way of giving a service to people who find themselves in a traumatic situation.  We should consider the type of service we should like to receive if we were in their position.  With the greatest respect, all of us can sit here smugly in the hope that we will never be faced with this problem. If we want to have proper legislation in this area we should consider the trauma and difficulties experienced by people in this horrible situation.</P>
    <P>I know that like me the Minister is new in the job.  He did not take this Bill on Second Stage.  It was presented to him as it was published initially and he has not put his stamp on it as he was not in his present position when it was being drafted.  I appreciate all of that but I ask him as a colleague, disregarding whether <Col N="166" /> or not we have legal backgrounds, to look at this issue from the point of view of the ordinary lay person, the people we represent.  We should forget about the idea that &ldquo;it will be all right on the day&rdquo;. Rather we should consider the ideal structure whereby such cases can be dealt with quickly, efficiently, compassionately and, above all, humanely.</P>
    <P>As I have said, people come and go in Departments, they move from one section to another, they die, get sick or are promoted.  We should know exactly how this legislation will work.  If somebody with a problem goes to the Department of Justice where will they go, who will meet them, will they be able to talk to a group of people or will the person to whom this job is designated have other things on his plate and have to drop everything else, etc.?  I have not heard why Deputy McCartan's amendment was not accepted.  I presume it was not accepted because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not accepted because it would involve a potential charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This highlights why this House should be reformed.  We are now getting down to the kernel of the problem. Deputies cannot put down an amendment which proposes to exclude the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and include the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; because it would impose a charge on the taxpayer.  It is essential that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is included in this section. If we do not get a satisfactory response from the Minister the only way in which my party can voice their objection to his proposal is by voting against the section. However, because there are more Deputies on the Government side of the House we will be defeated.  Nevertheless, we live in a democracy and we will lodge our objection, unless the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, who I know has a human heart says: &ldquo;Forget about what went before, I am going to make this change because the section as it stands is totally unsatisfactory and will not deal with the problems envisaged by the <Col N="167" /> people who thought up these conventions in the first place&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would love to see a Dublin or Ireland convention on children.  I should like to see Ireland initiating a convention and asking other countries to come along with us.  In addition, I should like to see us using our great talent in the areas where we have influence and saying to other people &ldquo;we know that when you drew up this convention you had positive things in mind, which we support, but there is a better way of doing it, which is what we have done, so that it will work much better&rdquo;.  We should not becoming in here and saying that because they do it this way in England it must be all right.  It is not all right.  We should make up our minds on what is all right.</P>
      <P>It is not just a question of building or renting offices to set up another quango; this is about proper organisation and thinking the legislation through.  I was very discouraged to read the sentence in the Explanatory Memorandum which states:</P>
      <P>In practice, incoming applications will be referred by the Central Authority to the Legal Aid Board for relevant proceedings to be taken in the High Court.</P>
      <P>That is a flippant provision.  I know the Minister does not mean that but it seems to suggest that we are only talking about the law and all we need is a post office so that when a request comes in it can be sent to the Legal Aid Board so that High Court proceedings can be taken.  That does not sound right.  Section 9 of the Explanatory Memorandum states:</P>
      <P>The Hague Convention provides that if the requested court does not decide an application for the return of the child within six weeks from the date of commencement of the proceedings the applicant, or the Central Authority on its own initiative, may request a statement of the reasons for the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person making the inquiries as to what has caused the delay &mdash; we should remember we are talking about children <Col N="168" /> here &mdash; would have more success if an authority were set up to deal with such cases.  When I think of an authority I think of a body of people, a place to which I can go if I have a problem.  I do not regard the Department of Justice as an authority.  When I think of an authority I think of a body with responsibility like the Ombudsman's office.  I know the Ombudsman does not deal with every case himself but all citizens know that if they have a problem they can go to the Ombudsman's office.  That is the sort of authority I am talking about.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to be more definite and to give a commitment that before Report Stage he will work out some alternative arrangement other than the one he has proposed here today.  I do not think the Minister's proposal will enable these sad cases to be dealt with as compassionately and quickly as I should like them to be dealt with so that people will know there is someone there to help them.  If I was the person in difficulty I do not think I should like to wander into the Department of Justice looking for a person whose name was on a list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to section 8 in a delicate way so that I am not misinterpreted.  I represent a constituency where perhaps the largest number of Muslim members of our community reside.  I have very good relations with these people and I do not want to offend any one in any way.  However, it should be remembered that the Muslim community in the Republic is now probably as big as the Jewish community, if not somewhat bigger; and there has been an increase in the number of inter-marriages between Muslims from other countries and Irish citizens.  In my experience this has given rise to certain difficulties particularly where children are concerned but I want to make it clear that it is only in a minority of cases that these difficulties arise.  The same thing could happen in the Christian, Jewish or any other community &mdash; I am not having a go at the Muslim community.  Often when an Irish girl marries a Muslim man here they return to his country later with <Col N="169" /> their children when the culture shock can cause a number of problems.  I am not one to be offensive, but I repeat, this is a problem which arises, in a minority of cases and, in those circumstances, the mother, wishing to return to Ireland, has difficulty leaving the country in which she is residing with her children.  I have come across cases where the mother has had to leave surreptitiously to return to this State and sometimes she has been stopped.  That is something the Muslim community here would not like to see happening nor would the rest of the community.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding what is in the earlier sections of this Bill relating to member states, the signatories of the Hague and Luxembourg Conventions are in the main European &mdash; but there are other countries involved, such as Belize, Canada and the United States &mdash; and it is possible for some of those countries to which I referred to become signatories to this convention without being members of or in any way associated with The Hague or Luxembourg Conventions.  Where the Bill refers to a child being abducted into the State I would be very concerned that the State, through this central authority, would initiate steps to trace the child, seek the child's return or secure access to the child and if necessary arrange for court proceedings to secure the return of or access to the child to countries of the kind I mentioned.  While we know who is signing the convention at this stage, we do not know what other countries with a totally different culture &mdash; in some ways maybe a better culture &mdash; from ours may be involved in the future, and it may not be desirable for us to have a provision so open-ended which would require us by law to ensure that a child who has been, according to the terms of this section, abducted into the State should be returned to another jurisdiction or that we should trace a child for return to such a jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will not be possible for the State to use this provision when the position is reversed and a child has been abducted from this State and taken to a jurisdiction with a totally different culture &mdash; perhaps <Col N="170" /> via Britain because of Commonwealth connections, or some other European country with old colonial ties, the father could bring the child into France or Britain because it would be easier to take the child from that jurisdiction to his state of origin unknown to the mother.  Experience of mothers in particular whose children have been &ldquo;abducted&rdquo; either out of or into the State has shown that a problem can arise when the parent is party to a mixed marriage of the varied culture arrangement to which I referred.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that I am talking about a minority of cases.  I know the Muslim community in Ireland would be every bit as concerned about this as the Christian, Jewish or any other community, but the reality is that it is mainly, with Muslims that these difficulties have arisen.  We should be aware of that fact, take account of it and, if necessary, on Report Stage provide protection to ensure that in all cases, the best interests of the child are served.  In almost all cases &mdash; there can be exceptions to this &mdash; it is better for the child to remain with the mother.  I make that point because those are difficulties I have come across.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it from reading the section &mdash; maybe the Minister would clarify this in view of the points made by the last speaker &mdash; the central authority will be responsible for this operation in accordance with The Hague Convention and therefore will be dealing with the countries as listed at present.  Perhaps at a later stage other countries, whose population is mainly Muslim or some other religion, might become signatories to this convention but at present basically we are dealing with the matter as it concerns those 15 countries listed.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to the reply to previous points made by me and my colleagues, I am more convinced now that we need a very positive amendment and a move away from the intentions of the Department. I would be totally opposed to the authority being centred in the Department of Justice.  Many more reasons could be given than those already put <Col N="171" /> forward as to why it should not be located in the Department.  As I have said, it should be under the control of the Department and the Minister, but it should be a separate unit.  If the authority was based in the Department of Justice the law might not operate as we would like.  The idea is a very good one and is certainly long overdue, but if this section goes through on the explanation given by the Minister, we would be better off without the Bill at all.  I would like to ask if this central authority, having been set up under The Hague Convention, would use its expertise in relation to countries other than those listed in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to what my collegues have said and I want to confirm that it is intended for the foreseeable future that the Minister for Justice, through the Department of Justice, will act as the central authority. This is in line with a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in their report, LRC 12/85, and with the position in the vast majority of contracting states to The Hague Convention as well as the Luxembourg Convention.</P>
      <P>I joined the Department of Justice only two days ago and I found the atmosphere and the welcome very convivial and warm.  I am surprised to hear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been there yet, but I was surprised to hear what Deputy McCartan had to say.  From my eight and a half years in public Departments in the main I find them exceedingly courteous, very fair and co-operative, but as this fact has been brought to my attention I will be observing the situation and will make recommendations if I think <Col N="172" /> they should be made.  If Deputies want to highlight cases or make suggestions we will be delighted to take them on board and give them full consideration.</P>
      <P>It is universally accepted that the Department of Justice &mdash; and all Departments of Justice in the relevant countries &mdash; are in the best position to carry out, or cause to be carried out, the functions of a central authority.  Article 7 of The Hague Convention sets out the general duties of central authorities to co-operate with each other and, in addition, to promote co-operation among the authorities in their respective states to achieve the objects of the convention.  Secondly, the article lists in broad outline the different stages of intervention by central authorities and the typical case of child removal.  The first obligation of a central authority, under the list of obligations in Article 7, is to discover the whereabouts of the child.  The Department of Justice, as the central authority, will liaise with the Garda Síochána, as I said earlier, in this matter.</P>
      <P>There have already been consultations with the Garda pertaining to the whole operation of this Bill when it is enacted. The central authority must prevent further harm to the child or prejudice to interested parties by taking &mdash; or causing to be taken &mdash; provisional measures. Deputy Seán Barrett alluded to this in one of his earlier contributions.  Since all applications will be transmitted to the Legal Aid Board for proceedings to be taken in the High Court for the return of a child, it will be a matter for the board's solicitor to take interim measures as provided for in section 12, where appropriate, to secure the welfare of the child.</P>
      <P>The central authority must aim to secure the voluntary return of the child or to bring about an amicable solution to the issues involved.  In this context the central authority &mdash; in our case in the Department of Justice &mdash; will avail of the professional expertise available within that Department in regard to all these matters.  These, among others, are the functions of the central authorities which are appropriate for the Department of Justice to perform, directly or indirectly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> I listened with interest to what Deputy Barrett proposed and I can see his commitment to achieving a singular, identifiable structure and for Ireland to have a clear model as a central authority, with which I agree.  However, this must be put into the context of the number of cases with which we have to deal.  I should love to see a major international convention held here pertaining to children.  I have a human, political and public interest in this matter and I have been involved in the Child Care Bill and I know that most people in this House have a very real interest in this regard.  It would be wonderful if we could have a major international convention here but there have been so many at this stage that we would have to have clearly identifiable goals before we could go down that road.  If at all possible, perhaps it is something which should be considered, maybe somebody will come up with the right idea and the initiative to put it in place.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Bell and I wish to clarify that we could only operate this Bill, when passed, within the parameters of the convention and be involved with the various countries which are signatories to the convention.  We propose to have a clear organisational structure, a clearly defined structure within the Department of Justice, with a qualified competent person heading it.  We want to have a team of people working under that officer who will deal with the administrative details pertaining to the dissemination of information.  That will all have to be worked out later by the Department of Justice in co-operation with the other Departments, the Garda Síochána, Aer Rianta and the airports, so that information is available immediately to people who need it.  There is no reason, when the Bill is passed, and the Department of Justice activate the structure, we should not put in place a model of which we can all be proud.  I have the utmost confidence that that will be done.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Gay Mitchell and I appreciate the problems which he pointed out.  Deputy Seán Barrett clearly illustrated the mobility of people in the modern world.  People in <Col N="174" /> this country emigrate and migrate right across the globe to continental Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia or America, because it is in their nature to do so. Being a small island country, people want to move for economic reasons, adventure, tourism or job opportunities. Thankfully, we have an excellent record abroad and Irish people make a great contribution to whichever country they go and we hope that position will continue.</P>
    <P>The convention can only operate in co-ordination with the countries that are a party to it.  As the Muslim countries are not a party to the convention it will not be operational in their countries.  The only other option available to Irish people in the situation to which Deputy Gay Mitchell referred, would be communication, negotiation and dialogue through our diplomatic channels in the worldwide network of Irish embassies available.  These have been reasonably successful in many well know cases and, indeed, in cases which are not well known.  It is the only system we can provide in such cases.</P>
    <P>The House must accept that we have the expertise in the Department and that the Bill gives flexibility to the Minister for Justice.  Deputy McCartan asked when I envisaged creating a distinctly separate authority.  It is very hard to foretell what may happen but the one reason I see for establishing a separate central authority is where there would be such a demand for services like this.  I hope, as Deputy Barrett said earlier, that this will never happen but, if it does, of course we will have to take cognisance of it.  Perhaps one of the Members present will be in the hot seat and will see the need to make changes and create a specific central authority. I am sure that Deputies, as public representatives, in dealing with public service Departments, particularly in dealing with the Department of Justice, see the need for the creation of this authority within the Department of Justice, where professional expertise is readily available.  The Department have close co-operation with the Department of Foreign Affairs on the international side and <Col N="175" /> with the Garda Síochána on the operational, security and investigative sides. This is the ideal place for it at the moment and I hope the House will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot accept it and the only way we have of lodging our objections &mdash; because amendments cannot be accepted &mdash; is to vote against the section, which we will be doing.</P>
      <P>In case there is any misunderstanding, it is not suggested that the expertise is not available in the Department of Justice to deal with any issue in relation to child abduction.  We are complaining about the fact that this House is not being given a clear direction as to what will happen in future in relation to the exact structures which will be put in place.  As far as we have been told, the Minister for Justice will be the central authority.  It is quite clear, having glanced through the Official Report in relation to Second Stage of this Bill, that the Minister intends being the central authority.  He said on Second Stage that &ldquo;the Minister for Justice, through his Department, will act as the central authority for the purposes of each convention&rdquo;.  It is quite clear that there will be no change in section 8 (2).  For that reason, we will be opposing the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>At a stage when the central authority are established &mdash; or indeed in advance of the central authority being assigned or designated by the Minister &mdash; is it intended to have statutory regulations in place governing the operation of his functions as Minister or functions which the central authority want established?  Earlier, the Minister spoke about guidelines in the context of referring to co-operation and liaising with the Garda Síochána.  Will there be a statutory instrument setting down the functions and responsibilities in relation to a member of the public or, indeed, a non-national?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for regulations or a statutory instrument because the clear function and guidelines are laid down in the convention and we <Col N="176" /> must operate within them.  We are satisfied that we can do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>One area not contained in the convention is where a person is aggrieved with the performance or the response of the central authority, the right of redress, for example, of appeal against, say, a refusal by the central authority to act.  How does one overcome that in the absence of any domestic regulations emanating from the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no change in the law as it stands.  If somebody feels aggrieved they can appeal.  That will be the position under this Bill also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though I have not read all of it I did not notice any provision dealing with an appeal system in the convention.  I would presume that any decision taken by our courts could be appealed to a higher court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to draw the aliens section in too much or draw it down to too low a level but one of the big problems that practitioners dealing with that unit within the Department face is that there is no right of appeal to a higher authority either within the Department or elsewhere in an effort to resolve the problem unless, of course, one can find in the broad thrust of the law a right of appeal to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a big problem.  I would like to know, in the absence of any appeal system under the convention, what the position would be if a citizen or a non-national goes to the central authority to say that a child had been abducted and taken out of the country or a child was being hidden somewhere in the country and the central authority, for their own reasons, good or otherwise say they are not in a position to help them or do not believe that the case was worthy of support or worth pursuing in the courts. What could that person do at that stage if the central authority are not prepared <Col N="177" /> to act?  Where is the right of appeal?  I am very concerned about the Minister of State's response that there is no intention to expand or build on what is contained in the convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the internal law of the country would apply. If someone wishes to make an appeal or lodge a writ of <i>mandamus,</i> they will be able to avail of the system.  I have no doubt that Deputy McCartan is better versed on that than I am.  If, on the other <Col N="178" /> hand, someone wishes to by-pass the convention and go directly to the High Court they will be able to do that as the convention is only there to assist in a co-ordinating way internationally through the national structures to ensure that there is co-operation in the interests of providing a proper service for those who find themselves in this very traumatic position.  As I said, people will be able to appeal right up the line and the internal law will apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Nothing in this Part shall prevent the Court from returning a child to another State merely because that return was not required by the Convention. Further, in deciding such applications, the Court shall have regard to the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was prompted by the report of the Law Reform Commission, No. 12, of 1985 to which I referred earlier. In their summary recommendations they suggested that amendments along the lines I propose here should be included in the Bill.  I include it because I do not believe the matter is adequately covered by the provisions of the Bill, as circulated.  I might quote recommendation No. 3 of the Law Reform Commission at pages 6-7 as follows:</P>
      <P>The legislation should state that nothing in it shall prevent a child from being returned to another State merely because that return is not required by the Convention.  It should also provide that in deciding on applications for the return of children to another jurisdiction in cases where that return is not required by the Convention, the court shall have regard to the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration:</P>
      <P>The report itself in the body of the document, does not advance a great deal of its support of the propositions.  They say, at page 30, of the same report and I quote:</P>
      <P>In framing legislation to give effect to the Convention it would be opportune to consider whether provision should be made for a court to order the return of a child in cases where</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> it is not compelled to do so by the Convention.  The Convention itself is explicit in that it does &ldquo;not limit the power of a judicial or administrative authority to order the return of the child at any time&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then the Law Reform Commission go on to recite a section that is the embodiment of the recommendations contained in their summary which there is no need to repeat.  Basically what the Law Reform Commission are saying is that, in the event of the convention being applied or addressed and not requiring or recommending the return of the child in a certain circumstance, that should not act as a deterrent on a court of competent authority making such a return or indeed the authorities themselves, independent of the court, contriving an arrangement whereby the child would be returned. Therefore, appearing to be comprehensive and to obviate any unnecessary ambiguity, the recommendation of the commission is that there should be in the Bill a declaration such as is contained in my amendment.</P>
    <P>The second part of the amendment is that the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration should be a declaration in the Bill.  It is important that we recite this.  The reasons are selfevident. It is correct that, in all matters dealing with issues like this &mdash; the custody, welfare, care or return of a child &mdash; the interests of that child should be the paramount consideration.  It might be seen to be stating the obvious but, in looking at the law with regard to adoptions &mdash; which will be debated in Private Members' time this evening as it was last evening &mdash; it is interesting to note, up to 1974, that the law with regard to adoption did not carry this declaration that the interests of the child should be paramount. A notable sociologist, a member of the clergy, commenting as late as 1974 noted that on issues of adoption &mdash; which have a close parallel here because they deal with the issue of who should have custody, under what circumstances a person should have custody of a child &mdash; the law had worked on the premise that <Col N="182" /> a child was to be dealt with almost as the property of the parent, that he or she could do anything with the child short of killing or maltreating it.  In the 1974 Act, amending the adoption law, a specific section was inserted stating that, in matters of adoption, the interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration. The Legislature was obliged and felt it necessary to do so in the interests of adoption even though, since 1964 &mdash; in the matter of child custody &mdash; that was the ground or base introduced in the legislation of that year, a whole decade before.  In 1974, in regard to adoption law the Legislature found it necessary to insert this declaration.</P>
    <P>It is proper that when we are dealing with issues of child abduction we encapsulate this declaration; in other words, that we address any potential ambiguity, so that there would be no doubt in the minds of any court addressing an issue as to whether a child should be returned, the interest of the parent, as opposed to the interests of the child, should not have any overriding priority or consideration. It is desirable that we recite this proposition in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see his way to accepting my amendment for the reasons I have advanced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 already makes clear that a person may apply to the High Court, whether under The Hague Convention or otherwise, to secure the return of a child who has been removed to the State.  Where an application is made outside of the convention the High Court would exercise the jurisdiction it has already in the matter.  Furthermore, Article 18 of The Hague Convention &mdash; which will become part of our law by virtue of section 6 of this Bill &mdash; makes it clear that the provisions of the convention do not prevent the return of a child at any time even though that return was not required by the convention. Moreover, in any such proceedings, the court must, under the law as it stands, in section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, regard the <Col N="183" /> welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
      <P>I might now quote section 3, Part I of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 which states:</P>
      <P>Where in any proceedings before any court the custody, guardianship or upbringing of an infant, or the administration of any property belonging to or held on trust for an infant, or the application of the income thereof, is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
      <P>It is very clear that no matter what proceedings are before any court section 3, Part I, of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 &mdash; which covers young people up to the age of 21 &mdash; must be taken into account.  Therefore, the paramountcy clause is always taken into account by the courts and, under our laws, they must do so.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the proposed amendment is unnecessary and I do not propose to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's response.  I might advance the matter somewhat further if I may.</P>
      <P>Section 11, as I read it, provides that a person has the right to go to the court irrespective and independent of the convention. As I understand it, that is basically what it says.  The Law Reform Commission talk about a step beyond that.  They say that the operation of the convention &mdash; if it so works as not to require the return of a child &mdash; should not be used as a basis for arguing in the court or elsewhere against the return of the child in an application to the court independent of the convention.  In other words, the Law Reform Commission are saying that the court should be free to operate on an application directly to it, on its own terms and in its own way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is that what is contained in section 11 does not deal with the recommendation advanced by the Law Reform Commission.  If there is doubt I <Col N="184" /> would suggest to the Minister that one should adopt the more generous approach and have due regard to what the Law Reform Commission argue and recommend.  I would therefore ask you to look again at this issue.  I am motivated in proposing this amendment by the Law Reform Commission's assertion that this should be there.  We should have due regard to the work they did on this issue and to their recommendation.  Section 11 does not cover the issue.</P>
    <P>This proposition about the consideration of the child being paramount is something I am utterly convinced should be contained in the legislation.  I thank the Minister for referring to section 3 of the 1964 Act.  One would have thought that that Act would be adequate to deal with the matter, because the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, is a fundamental document dealing with custody issues.  I do not have the full answers. For some reason, when the Adoption Act, 1974, was being introduced the opportunity was taken to include a provision to the effect that the interests of the child would be paramount, irrespective of the fact that the Guardianship of Infants Act had been there for ten years before.  For some reason the Guardianship of Infants Act did not seem to have addressed the position with regard to the custody of children in the context of adoption.  Section 2 of the 1974 Act says:</P>
    <P>In any matter, application or proceedings before the Board or any court relating to the arrangements for or the making of an adoption order, the Board or the court, when deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>In 1974 in the area of adoption, irrespective of the provisions of the 1964 Act the Legislature felt obliged to include that provision.  It is clear that in the context of adoptions the child's interests should be paramount.</P>
    <P>In 1985 when the Law Reform Commission reported, they were aware of the <Col N="185" /> Guardianship of Infants Act and of section 3 which the Minister has quoted and they nonetheless said that a declaration should be written into that legislation that the interest of the child are paramount. Because the Law Reform Commission seemed to believe that the declaration in the Guardianship of Infants Act is not clear enough or perhaps is not tied directly into what we are doing here and perhaps because there is an international dimension to the issue, it is important and prudent to underscore the legislation with a declaration that the interests of the child are paramount.  If it is superfluous, and I see that there are cogent reasons available to the Minister to support that contention what is wrong with being doubly sure by repeating this?  If the Minister is unhappy about taking the two propositions together in the one amendment, I do not have an objection to withdrawing the composite amendment and on Report Stage breaking it into two separate propositions.  While I am not as strongly committed to the first portion of the amendment relating to the position with regard to the High Court <i>vis-à-vis</i> the convention, I am utterly convinced that it would be remiss of this House not to include in the Bill a recital that the rights of the child should be paramount.  Including this proposition in the Bill will certainly do no harm to the legislation and it is important, considering that the Law Reform Commission says that it should be there.  If the Minister would indicate that he has some inclination towards the second part of the amendment I am prepared to withdraw it and break it into two amendments for Report Stage.  It is important that ultimately the Bill should have this recital with regard to the rights of the child.</P>

      <P>I support the point made by Deputy McCartan.  If we are to ask the Law Reform Commission to carry out this type of study and they say that the restatement in the legislation, of the principle already contained in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, should be effective in removing doubts created by recent case law in this matter, we should <Col N="186" /> heed their warning.  The insertion of these extra words might have a positive effect on the legislation but it certainly will not diminish anything the Minister is trying to achieve with the legislation.  If the Minister is unhappy with the wording of Deputy McCartan perhaps he will consider this for Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I studied this for the first time over the last two days.  I looked at Deputy McCartan's amendment in great detail and considered it carefully. What Deputy McCartan seeks to achieve is already covered in <i>Article 18</i> of the Convention which is covered in page 23 of the Bill where it says:</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Chapter do not limit the power of a judicial or administrative authority to order the return of the child at any time.</P>
      <P>We are asking the High Court in this Bill to use its existing jurisdiction, and the Guardianship of Infants Act is clearly implied in that and clearly involved in any decisions the court takes pertaining to a child.  Deputy McCartan talked about the 1974 Adoption Act and said that this was included.  Adoption is something very permanent, where we are changing the status of a child and conferring permanence on the new status.  In this case we are talking about custody, which is the return of a child to its natural parent or parents or the return of a child to a legitimate custodian.  From all the information available to me, it seems that if we were to include this amendment we would be calling into question the right of the High Court in its consideration of a case to be able to take into account the laws of the land as they exist here.  In view of that, we must accept that the court when taking its decision will take into account the paramount interests of the child having regard to the Guardianship of Infants Act.  To ensure that the High Court has total jurisdiction pertaining to the Convention it would be better not to have this included there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entirely baffled by the Minister's response and his reasons <Col N="187" /> for not accepting the amendment, particularly that with regard to the issue of the welfare of the child being the first and paramount consideration.  That is not the only consideration.  The suggestion is not and never was that it would be the only consideration, but that it would be the paramount consideration.  One can quite easily see the reasons that should be so. Inevitably, there are conflicts of interest between the parent or person who believes that he or she is justified in seizing the child and taking it, against the better interests of the child, to advance a cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are incorporating in domestic legislation an agreement negotiated between countries at The Hague, Luxembourg or elsewhere, we should make it clear that it is accepted in the spirit of the laws of our land and is compatible with those laws.  It is important that in this legislation we include the statement that the rights of the child are the paramount consideration.  That is recited in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, but for some good reason the Law Reform Commission recommend, irrespective of the 1964 Act, that the legislation enabling this convention to be incorporated into our law should include the proposition that the rights of the child are paramount.  It is essential that this be done.  I want to stand over this amendment but I do not want to use too much of the time of this House.  When a body such as the Law Reform Commission make recommendations and the reason for these recommendations is not readily apparent to the Department, is any approach made to the commission as to the necessity for such recommendations? The report is silent on the reason.  I have given my own reasons for including the provision.  I would refer the Minister to the report, which acknowledges that what it seeks is a restatement in the legislation of the principle already contained in the Guardianship of Infants Act to remove doubts created by recent case law on this matter.  There seems to be some very cogent reason.  Doubts are arising due to judicial interpretations <Col N="188" /> about 1985.  It appears that the 1964 provision has been worked on by the lawyers and courts and interpreted in such a manner that the Law Reform Commission believe there are doubts existing because of the opposing interests and rights.  If the Law Reform Commission consider there are doubts, that is the best reason for including such a declaration in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister had indicated that this is a matter of very recent involvement for him.  If he were to give an assurance that he would look at this before Report Stage, I would be happy to withdraw the amendment.  Perhaps the Minister, in consultation with his officials and the Law Reform Commission, could see how substantial these doubts are.  Perhaps we should recite the second part of the amendment in the legislation.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan has made a fair case, ably supported by Deputy Barrett.  Deputy Barrett and I are at one on this in that we are legal laymen and interpret the English language as best we can.  I had my personal doubts on the matter.  Taking into account what Deputy McCartan has said, I am prepared to have another look at this point and to have further consultation on it.  Deputy McCartan might, of his own volition, retable the second part of his amendment on Report Stage.  If I feel it should be done on my side, I may do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 16, before section 37, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;37.&mdash;(1)  It shall be an offence to take, send or keep a child, under the age of sixteen years, who is habitually resident in the State, out of the jurisdiction in defiance of a court order, or without the consent of each person who <Col N="191" /> is a parent or guardian or to whom custody has been granted.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a person has been charged with an offence under subsection (1), it shall be a defence to show that the defendant&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  honestly believed the child was over sixteen years of age,</P>
    <P>(ii)  obtained the consent of the requisite person or of the court,</P>
    <P>(iii)  has been unable to communicate with the requisite persons, having taken all reasonable steps, and there was reasonable grounds to believe that their consent would have been forthcoming, or</P>
    <P>(iv)  being a parent, guardian or person having custody of the child had no intention to deprive others having rights of guardianship or custody in relation to that child of those rights.</P>
    <P>(3)  No prosecution of an offence under this section shall be brought without the consent of the person in breach of whose rights that child was abducted out of the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>(4)  A person found guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a terms not exceeding 12 months or to both, or</P>
    <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to deal with one of the stronger recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, namely, making it an offence to abduct a child within the State.  The Law Reform Commission in recommendation No. 5 stated <Col N="192" /> that the legislation should contain a provision to create an offence for the abduction out of the jurisdiction of a child under 16.  The Minister dealt with this matter on Second Stage and said that the existing laws were adequate, that the offence of kidnapping or the unlawful detention of a person against their will was an offence known to the law generally and that there was the whole issue of contempt of court where an abduction was carried out in defiance of an existing court order.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that those sanctions are there.  Nevertheless, I equally acknowledge that the Law Reform Commission made the recommendation.  We would do no harm whatsoever by adding to the array of devices available to the authorities for dealing with what was earlier described as a most heinous phenomenon, taking children out of the jurisdiction against their will or against the will of their parents or the person <i>in loco parentis,</i> almost invariably for selfish and ill-motivated reasons.  We would certainly do no harm whatsoever creating such an offence.  It would be an option where other sanctions fail or are not appropriate.</P>
    <P>In introducing this important Convention into our law it is important that we set down a clear and unambiguous marker that this House considers the illegal abduction of children to be a particularly heinous and unacceptable crime and one that should be dealt with specifically as an offence in our law and treated as such.  That precedent is well established.  We provide specific offences for particular aspects of crime.  There is burglary, and there is aggravated burglary where a weapon is used.  We have done so in the area of rape where there are different crimes of rape contrary to common law, such as serious sexual assault, sexual assault and so on.  This notion of marking specifically heinous crimes with specific offences is well established. We should borrow the practice here in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the amendment follow closely the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission by providing <Col N="193" /> that it shall be an offence to take, send or keep a child under the age of 16 years who is happily resident in the State out of the jurisdiction in defiance of a court order or without the consent of the persons responsible for him or <i>in loco parentis.</i></P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides a number of defences available to a person who might end up charged with this offence.  There are four in all cited in the amendment. There is no need for me to go through them.</P>
    <P>The third provision is based on a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission that a prosecution for this offence should not be initiated without the consent of the person who is the parent or acting <i>in loco parentis</i> and whose rights are transgressed by the offence.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) suggests the penalties that might be levied.  Deputy Barrett has gone a little further than I in regard to penalties.  I would have no difficulty accepting one set of penalties or the other as being appropriate.  I would have no difficulty accepting what Deputy Barrett is proposing and I have no doubt he would have little difficulty accepting what I am proposing.  What we are both trying to do is convince the Minister that our legislation should incorporate an offence provision as recommended by the Law Reform Commission and as this particular type of activity deserves.  Accordingly, I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is basically the same as Deputy McCartan's in that I have provided for various aspects of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  I have no hang-ups about the penalties.  It only strikes me that there is no comparison between suggested fines and suggested terms of imprisonment.  Sometimes it is a fine of £1,000 or 12 months' imprisonment but the cost of 12 months' imprisonment to the taxpayer is considerably more than £1,000.  That is my only comment to my colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> Fine Gale's amendment seeks to indicate that the party regard child abduction as a grave criminal offence which should carry serious sanctions against the offender.  As a civilised society, we regard this as totally distasteful and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>We should also take into account the experience of other countries.  I said earlier that we should not automatically follow what they do in Great Britain or elsewhere but the passing of the Child Abduction Act, 1984 in Britain does not seem to have caused problems.  In addition the Law Reform Commission made this recommendation.</P>
    <P>I have read what the Minister said on Second Stage with regard to this being a family dispute and that it was better to deal with it under the civil law and not under the criminal law.  That is possible because, as the House will see from our amendment, we are including a number of defences.  For example, the abductor might be able to show that he had no intention of depriving others of the rights of guardianship or custody of the child. If there is a genuine case to be made the discretion is there in the amendment. However, it is important to send out the message loud and clear from this Assembly that we, as the elected representatives of the people, see child abduction as a grave offence, something unacceptable in society, and, if there is no good reason for doing it, there should be a criminal charge to answer.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to this that should be stressed.  It will give powers to the Garda Síochána to arrest without a warrant those perpetrating abduction.  It also brings into play the laws of extradition where in serious cases somebody could be returned to this country to answer a charge in relation to abduction of a child.  It has many benefits.  Above all, it is saying loud and clear to everybody that the interests of children are paramount, that the interests of children must be put before anything else, that as a society we do not accept that people can deprive others of the right of access to their children and that abduction is unacceptable.  I ask the Minister to think <Col N="195" /> very carefully before making a judgment on these amendments.</P>
    <P>I am open to discussion in this Chamber. I share the view of Deputy McCartan and the Law Reform Commission that we should make child abduction a criminal offence, with certain defences.  I am prepared, of course, to listen to the arguments being made by the Minister but at the end of the day I would hate to think that we would lose the opportunity we now have to say to society that child abduction is simply unacceptable.  Rather than putting the amendments at this stage I am prepared to wait until Report Stage, if the Minister needs more time as I am not in any great rush to flax muscles.  Let us look at this area from the point of view of what is in the interests of children; whether this offence is acceptable in a civilised society and whether there should be a criminal charge to answer.</P>
    <P>Those are the points I would like to put to the Minister.  I will be very interested to hear his replies to the points made by me and by Deputy McCartan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impressed with the contributions made by both Deputies on this matter and by their amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice dealt with this matter on Second Stage.  The essence of the argument for not creating an offence of abduction of a child by a parent is that this is a matter best dealt with by the court as a civil matter and in a very serious case the law of kidnapping could apply. Perhaps the most significant provision in the law would be the provision in section 37 of the Bill which gives the Garda Síochána power to detain a child whom they reasonably suspect is or is about to be removed from the State in breach of any custody order or a custody application that is pending or is about to be made.  In the delicate matter of family disputes, the law must maintain a particular sense of proportion as between the wrong committed and the righting of that wrong.  No one wants the criminal law to intrude into any part of family disputes more than it has to.  In my view it should not apply in cases of a child <Col N="196" /> abducted by a parent unless it is a very serious case where, for example, force is used.</P>
    <P>The courts in so far as their civil jurisdiction is concerned have powers of committal for breaches of orders made. Those powers should not be under-estimated. The threat of committal can be as good a deterrent as the threat of criminal prosecution.  Where it is feared that a child may be removed from the jurisdiction in violation of a custody or access order the position is that application may be made to the High Court or to the Circuit Court for an injunction prohibiting the taking of the child out of the jurisdiction.  Any person in breach of this injunction may be committed to prison for contempt of court.  Also any person who with knowledge of the injunction assists in its breach is guilty of contempt.</P>
    <P>Another procedure is for the parent to apply to have the child made a ward of court.  The child becomes a ward of court as from the making of the wardship application and to take him out of the country thereafter without the permission of the court is a contempt of court.  A difficulty referred to by the Law Reform Commission in their report LRC No. 12 of 1985 on The Hague Convention is that though the Garda Síochána have power to arrest a person who has been committed for contempt of court, the abductor is likely to have fled the jurisdiction with the child before the committal order is obtained.  The solution which has been recommended by the Law Reform Commission in this context is being implemented in section 37 of the Bill.  Indeed, that section goes further than the commission's recommendation which confines the power of the Garda Síochána to detain the child to the case where a custody order is in existence.</P>
    <P>Section 37 gives the power to detain the child in cases also where an application for a custody order is pending or is about to be made.  It seems to me that section 37 will get at the nub of the matter in all cases whereas the creation of an offence of child abduction will only be of very limited application and could, as has <Col N="197" /> been said previously, be counter-productive and a double-edged sword in that it might inhibit the voluntary return of the child by the abductor or a reconciliation between the parents, or in the absence of reconciliation, an agreed solution to their problem.</P>
    <P>It is the child's welfare and his quick return to the custodial parent that is the primary consideration in the emotional context in which these cases occur.  The pursuit of the parent as a criminal except, as I have already said, in an extreme case, should not be a feature of such cases. No particular need for that approach has been indentified in this country.  Indeed a view among many of the contracting states to these conventions is that in child abduction cases, since one is primarily dealing with a civil family law matter, nothing should be contemplated that might make the prospects of reconciliation or an agreed solution impossible. Incidentally in this regard I understand that in one Hague Convention case, the central authority of a contracting state let it be known that if it knew in advance that the abducting parent was to the arrested and charged with child abduction on returning to the state of origin with the child, it might decide not to return the child.  I mention the case merely to illustrate the fact that the intrusion of the criminal law in what is essentially a civil law matter can create difficulties that might not be immediately apparent.</P>
    <P>There are other examples also.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that an offence of abduction of a child out of the State be created.  In their view the offence would remove the uncertainty surrounding the law pending a decision of the Irish courts as to how they will follow the formulation of the crime of kindapping in the House of Lords as reported in RD, 1984, two all English law reports 449.  I do not accept that there is such uncertainty in the law on kidnapping by a parent that the matter has to be resolved at present by legislation.  RD established that a parent can be guilty of the common law offence of kidnapping his own child.  The House of Lords <Col N="198" /> reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal that a parent could not be guilty of kidnapping his own child.  The English Child Abduction Act, 1984, which established an offence of child abduction in the United Kingdom, was promoted as a Private Members' Bill following a report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee and catered for the problem which was thought then to exist, but the subsequent decision of the House of Lords rendered much of that Act unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The scope of the 1984 Act is limited. It does not, for example, cover the abduction of a child within England nor does it cover abduction abroad, for example, where a parent is on holidays abroad with the child and then decides to keep the child.  The stated reason by the English Criminal Law Revision Committee for the limited application of the legislation as conceived by the committee prior to the House of Lords decision in the case RD was that in such situations the matter is best dealt with by courts having civil jurisdiction.  Incidentally, the House of Lords in its decision in the case of RD referred to an Irish case, the People <i>v</i> H, heard in the Supreme Court in 1943, <i>Irish Law Reports 115</i>.  While there appears to be differences between Ireland and England in relation to whose consent is required in the case of child kidnapping &mdash; the child's consent or the parent's consent &mdash; it is clear that under the rationale in either RD of the People <i>v</i> H, where the child is young, which would be the usual case, a charge of kidnapping would lie.  That offence of kidnapping is an arrestable and extraditable offence.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that there is no need at present to create the offence of child abduction.  The fact that we are ratifying The Hague and Luxembourg Conventions on Child Abduction really has nothing to do with the matter.  The provisions in the conventions are confined exclusively to civil aspects of international child abduction and the question of an offence of child abduction is one that does not have to be considered in the context of the conventions.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons which has been advanced in favour of an offence of child <Col N="199" /> abduction is the possible availability of extradition on foot of that offence.  The position is that extradition, where it is on the basis of an offence of child abduction as suggested, or on the basis of the offence of kidnapping as it stands, may secure the return of the parent but it will not necessarily secure the return of the child.  The experience in some countries where extradition proceedings have been brought rather than simply proceedings for the return of the child is that the use of the extradition process has greatly hampered and confused the situation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, therefore, I am satisfied for the various reasons I have given that the creation of an offence of child abduction is neither desirable nor necessary at present.  However, the matter is one which I certainly will keep under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said that the amendment is neither desirable nor necessary at this time.  I note that he suggests that he will keep the matter under review but now is the time for us to act and to do something in this area.  I am convinced that it is both desirable and necessary to include an offence provision in the legislation.  It is desirable because it is important that we as a Legislature reflect our abhorrence for this type of activity.  As has been pointed out, it is an increasing phenomenon and will become, unfortunately, more frequent with increased travel, the increasing incidence of people working abroad, marrying abroad and all the attendant difficulties that have now emerged in that area.  The amendment is desirable and necessary and I do not believe any argument against that proposition can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission correctly point out that the highest court in Britain, in looking at the area of kidnapping by parents, have introduced an element of uncertainty which has not been resolved by any judicial authority there or in Ireland: that is whether the offence would exist in the absence of a court order being made given the custody <Col N="200" /> by court order to one or other of the parents.  That issue is left open.  The Law Reform Commission say that rather than wait to see what would be the position of a court of law in interpreting the offence of kidnapping the offence should be introduced.  I think that is the correct procedure.</P>
    <P>The next reason I consider it necessary is in the area of extradition.  One of the undoubted features of child abduction, particularly related to family disputes is that a desperate parent will repeat abduction attempts.  Even though you will succeed in the primary objective of the safe return of the child to the rightful parent a defaulting or recalcitrant parent not sanctioned, not admonished or not penalised will have every encouragement to have another go.  If, say, the mother was successful in getting to the airport in Switzerland on the first occasion she might not be as successful the second time round.  It is important, therefore, appropriate, that where, sanction of the law be available to the authorities to teach a lesson and to ensure a deterrent against a repeat of the offence.  Here, an important consideration comes to mind.</P>
    <P>Contempt of court, as I understand it, is not an extraditable matter.  The writ of the court runs within its jurisdiction and no further.  Therefore, if a person, in defiance of a court order, grabs a child in this jurisdiction and heads off to another jurisdiction, while he or she is technically in breach of the court, the case is outside the reach of the court.  Therefore, the court, while it may issue a warrant to have the person brought before the court to be dealt with on contempt, until such time as that person comes back within the jurisdiction of the court, that warrant cannot be executed.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the importance of having an offence that is extraditable where the warrant can be backed and forwarded to the country where the person has found refuge, is an important addition to the armoury of the authorities in combating and dealing with this unfortunate phenomenon.  That is important. The primary objective is to secure the return of the child.  There is a double <Col N="201" /> further objective, that is, to ensure that the offending person does not try again. One of the sanitary ways of dealing with that is to have the person brought before the court and made answerable or at least to have the threat that if he or she appears back in the jurisdiction there is the prospect of being put into jail and having to answer to a criminal charge for earlier activities.  I can find no other cogent reason to deter a further attempt by a parent than that prospect.</P>
    <P>The Minister has advanced section 37 of the Bill as one that might offer relief in this area.  Section 37 has nothing to do with the issues we are trying to advance. Section 37 gives power to the Garda Síochána to detain a child and to hold that child until such time as the court can make a further order.  That has nothing to do with dealing with an offender or a person who perpetrates the wrongful taking of the child in the first instance. The Garda do not have powers to detain him or her until such further order of the court is made.  The Garda must go to the court and wait until the court issues a warrant on a motion of contempt before the court.  On that basis a Garda would be empowered.  Section 37 is a very useful device in dealing with the safe return of the child but has nothing to do with dealing with the offender.</P>
    <P>The Minister then introduced the issue of an offence possibly being a disincentive to a voluntary return of the child.  The Law Reform Commission recognised that problem and made a succinct and workable proposition that is included in our amendment, paragraph (3) of which states that no prosecution should be taken without the consent of the parent aggrieved or whose rights have been offended.  It makes the real practical proposition that in an instance where a parent or other person realises they have done a grievous wrong to a child and in terms of the rights of a parent, and then return the child contritely and say: &ldquo;I made a mistake, I acted hastily, I am sorry&rdquo;, there is no practical likelihood that a parent who has secured the safe return of their child will then turn around <Col N="202" /> vindictively and say, &ldquo;I want this man clapped in irons and prosecuted&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons I am disappointed the Minister has not taken on board this proposition.  What we are arguing for here is that it be added to the existing armoury and have it available for the appropriate case.  I regret to say that there will undoubtedly emerge the bad case where the persistent bad-minded offender will continue to be involved in the matter of family disputes in this unacceptable way.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we should leave these matters entirely to the civil courts. I would be inclined to accept that suggestion if that was the way in which we dealt with all matters of child custody within the State, but it is not.  Barring orders are used as a device to protect children and parents against the unwanted attentions of the defaulting parent.  There is also the criminal sanction which provides that it is an offence to breach a barring order. We use the criminal sanction to put defaulting parents into prison for up to 12 months or longer if they do not comply with our civil law or are in breach of the civil orders of the courts in the area of child care and custody.  We should be consistent in our approach.  If we use criminal law as an effective bolster to the civil rights and protections we give to parents in domestic cases, why not use that as a parallel precedent in the international arena when we have to deal with people who move from one jurisdiction to another and who perhaps damage the family and the integrity of the child more than anything which might be done domestically by a parent?</P>
    <P>The Minister needs to reflect again on his proposals.  I will have no difficulty in withdrawing my amendment if we can come back to this issue on Report Stage. A very strong case is made by the Law Reform Commission for the inclusion of such an offence in the Bill.  We are doing no more than providing a good option. We should provide the best armoury possible to protect our children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy McCartan, if I got a satisfactory reply from <Col N="203" /> the Minister I would have no difficulty withdrawing amendment No. 8, which is exactly the same as Deputy McCartan's amendment.</P>
      <P>I want to clarify a few points.  The Minister is operating on certain assumptions. He is assuming that most of these cases arise as a result of marriage difficulties. However, the reality is that we are living in changing times and there are more single parents today than previously. At one time it was thought that it would be better if the law did not interfere with marriages in any respect. However, we had to introduce barring orders, to protect the rights of women, and the judicial separation Act to protect the rights of either spouse and, indirectly, the rights of children.</P>
      <P>This legislation is also about protecting the rights of children.  We should not look at the legislation only from the point of view of endeavouring to get a child back to satisfy an aggrieved parent or guardian. The rights of children have to be protected also.  This depends on the way one looks at the legislation.  Of course, it is of paramount importance to ensure that a child is returned to the parent who has custody but, unfortunately, we are living in a world where things are not as reasonable as they used to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read the Second Stage speech of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke.  I accept that he genuinely believed what he said, but with respect, I believe he was looking at the issue from one perspective only.  I look at the legislation from the practical point of view of returning a child who has been snatched to the parent who has legal custody and from the point of view of the rights of children who cannot speak for themselves and who do not have a lobby group who can march outside Leinster House or anywhere else. We must recognise the reality of today's world, which is different to the world in which the Minister of State and I lived when we were 13 or 14 years old.  Times have changed and will continue to change.  The Minister knows how difficult it is to get legislation into this Chamber. If we miss this opportunity to deal with <Col N="204" /> certain issues it will be a number of years before they can be discussed again.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy McCartan and I drafted our amendments along the lines suggested in the Law Reform Commission report.  We also took into account the genuine circumstances where it would be unwise to introduce a criminal law offence.  Both subsection (3) of my amendment and subsection (3) of Deputy McCartan's amendment allow for genuine cases, genuine misunderstandings, and those parents who do not want to pursue the criminal road. An article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Wednesday, 6 December 1989, said it was time we brought this heartache to an end and quoted a parent as saying &ldquo;I never let my children out of sight&rdquo;.  These are not cases of marriage breakdown; these are the deliberate snatching of children and the heartbreak that causes parents who have legal custody of their children.  We are not dealing with marriage breakdown where a parent wants to see her children who are living abroad. It is understandable that such parents would like to have their children with them for a few weeks.</P>
    <P>But we are talking about the deliberate kidnapping of children.  It can be called abduction but it is basically the kidnapping of children by parents whom the law has decided should not have custody. That is the type of case we are talking about.  Children under 16 years of age have a right to be protected.  Perhaps when they are older they can make up their own minds but somebody has to speak for them.</P>
    <P>I am not implying the Minister is not speaking for them and that all the &ldquo;goodies&rdquo; are on this side of the House.  I am merely putting forward the argument why we should give very serious consideration in this legislation to introducing the criminal charge and a criminal offence &mdash; we will not get this opportunity again &mdash; so that people will know we detest this type of behaviour, that we believe it is unacceptable in a civilised society and that we regard the rights of children as paramount.  Rather than divide on this issue, the Minister should <Col N="205" /> reconsider it between now and Report Stage.  Perhaps we should all have a rethink on it.  We will withdraw our amendments if the Minister gives us an undertaking that he will look seriously at this issue between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House that I regard child abduction, child kidnapping or the removal of a child from a home or place out of our jurisdiction as a most serious heinous crime.  I can also assure the House that I want to be part of a legislative consensus which will lead to the enactment of the best law possible, taking into account our laws and the international conventions to which we are a party.</P>
      <P>I accept the sincerity and commitment of all Deputies in the House who have contributed to this debate but we have to take into account the unexpected, something which may not be legislated for.  I also believe in the human dimension &mdash; the reconciliation process, the value of the human resource, communication and dialogue and eventual agreement arriving at a consensus where there can be some agreement in the interests of the child. This is vital.</P>
      <P>I would like to give an example of a case which received widespread publicity on the Continent last year and which illustrates the confusion and difficulties that can arise when the criminal law becomes involved in cases such as these. In the case in question a child was abducted by its mother and the country of origin sought the extradition of the mother on the basis that she had committed a criminal offence.  The order for extradition was made but when it transpired subsequently that the mother abducted the child because of sexual abuse by the father there was a public outcry against the return of the child with the mother.  If the matter could have been dealt with purely as a civil matter under the Hague Convention the subsequent problems might not have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to reiterate the point that the offence of child abduction was enacted into law in England in 1984 at a <Col N="206" /> time when it was thought that the common law offence of kidnapping did not apply to a parent.  It is now clear, following a decision of the House of Lords, that kidnapping by a parent is an offence in England.  That decision follows the reasoning in the Irish decision on The People v. Edge.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to these amendments in principle.  I am not at present convinced that they will have a beneficial effect in child abduction cases.  The existing law together with the additional provisions enabling the Garda to detain a child who they suspect is about to be abducted from the country is the right approach.  I am prepared however to keep the situation under constant review, but I am not satisfied at present that the creation of a new offence of child abduction is the necessary or correct response to the problem. I had doubts about this matter and had a second look at it.  In view of the excellent and eloquent case made by Deputies McCartan and Barrett I am prepared to have a further look at the matter so that when we come to Report Stage I shall be able to report again, or alternatively the Deputies will have the right to retable their amendments.</P>

      <P>Yesterday evening I was in the throes of accusing the Members of the Opposition with regard to the need for this legislation but I will go beyond that tonight.  Over the last number of weeks I have read great criticism of the professions involved in adoption.  I am speaking mainly of social workers and many of the adoption societies who are reluctant to participate in home study assessments.  What I have gathered from those people is not that they are against foreign adoptions <i>per se</i> but they are anxious that the high standards which we have reached in relation to adoption would be maintained and that particular safeguards in relation to inter-country adoption would be built into any legislation that would come before the House.</P>
      <P>The work of adoption agencies in this country has been commendable.  I hope, as I am sure does everyone in the House, that in any legislation in relation to adoption those high standards will be upheld. I hope we can reach some harmonisation of our laws with the laws of any country in which we wish to adopt children.  I have learned from many of my legal colleagues that this harmonisation will be very difficult to achieve.  It certainly will not be an easy task for the committee who will be dealing with this matter, but I am sure they will have all the necessary back-up to ensure that the best possible legislation is put forward, that the interests of all involved are protected and that in some way harmonisation will be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The move by the Romanian Government recently to establish a centralised committee for adoptions is most welcome. It will allay the fears of many people who feel that immoral or wrong practices take place in adopting children, for example, as Deputy Shatter outlined, buying children.  That is a totally immoral act which I am sure none of us would condone.  I hope we will be able to build into the legislation some safeguard to prevent that.  Liaison with Romania will be very important and I hope we will be able to reach some compromise with the <Col N="208" /> Romanian authorities when this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative in asking health boards to co-operate and provide services for home study assessments. I have met many people who are distressed because there is no lifeline for them to seek advice on home assessment studies, on how to go about adopting, what the laws are in Romania and how to go to Romania and find a child that would be suitable for adoption.  Those fears are paramount among couples who have tried to adopt children in Romania. I know many of these people have been very successful but from stories I have heard from people returning from Romania that is due to the fact that they had a strong heart and a great will to continue.  I hope that greater liaison with and advice from health boards will help people who wish to adopt foreign children.</P>
    <P>Legislation to facilitate foreign adoptions must be framed having regard to a number of aspects.  First, the rights of the child must be protected because they cannot speak for themselves.  We must look beyond five or ten years and consider what will happen when the children reach 18 years of age and want to find out about their natural parents, why they have been brought from Romania and to know about their culture.  This information should be provided to them, and I hope we will consider that aspect.  We also have to consider the prospective adopters and make sure they are the best people to adopt children.</P>
    <P>A very difficult process has to be gone through when adopting children in this country.  There is an initial assessment to see whether or not adoptive parents are suitable, then the placement of the child and, if the child is not fully adopted for a certain period of time, there is a followup study and supervision.  People will also have to go through that process when adopting children in foreign countries.  I can see a slight difficulty in the assessment of the natural parents and also perhaps the adoptive parents, but I am sure it is not insurmountable.  We also have to look at the country of origin and consider <Col N="209" /> that perhaps in a few years time life in Romania will become more realistic and progressive.  Will those people feel then that those adoptions are an insult to their country?  All those matters must be considered. We also have to look at our own country and make sure that we will be able to facilitate the additional children who come here.  They should have inheritance rights and access to education and all the services to which children born in this country have access.  Several anomalies have arisen here because people have brought Romanian babies to Ireland.  We have not facilitated adoption by single parents here and we will have to examine that matter, not only in the context of foreign adoptions but, indeed, within the context of our adoption laws.</P>
    <P>From what I can ascertain, there are couples who have brought in Romanian children who are over the normal age for adopting here.  That problem will also have to be dealt with.  Furthermore, something else which might prove difficult &mdash; but I am sure the legal brains in the House will be able to get over the problem &mdash; is the limited laws under the Adoption Act, 1988, where children born within marriage are not allowed to be adopted.  Most children who have come here from Romania have mothers and fathers.  I hope all these anomalies will be teased out on Committee Stage so that, in ten years' time, there will not be a plethora of court cases because the legislation was not tightened.  I hope the legislation will be watertight and that the rights of everybody involved will be fully protected.  I would be especially concerned that Romanian parents are fully aware of what adoption means here and that they will be giving up their rights to their natural child.  They must be fully aware of the situation in that regard and I hope there will not be problems in future which would involve a child being removed from a normal family.  I do not want to see adoptive parents being absolutely destroyed because natural parents think they should have access to &mdash; what they see &mdash; as their own child.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the good work of the proposed committee will allay the fears <Col N="210" /> of Members and ensure that the best possible legislation is brought forward.  I very much welcome the introduction of the Bill by Deputy Shatter.  I remember, when we were going through the Child Care Bill, I asked him why he did not bring in a Private Members' Bill.  Before I left the Chamber I was given a copy of it; he is a most progressive Deputy and always has the best interests at heart of the people whom he represents.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that all parties are very supportive of this legislation.  It shows that it is not just a political football but that people are aware of the situation and would like to provide the best possible protection.  Fundamentally, we must ensure that we do not create second class citizens by applying different standards for foreign adoptions as opposed to adoptions in this country.  I hope we will make progress as quickly as possible to facilitate those whose children are in a kind of limbo and that it will be easier in future for those who found it difficult to adopt children.</P>

      <P>I warmly welcome this Bill which has been brought before the House by Deputy Shatter.  While there are detailed, technical legal matters which may necessitate amendments to the Bill, I am pleased that the Government have agreed not to oppose it on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I have had a number of meetings with Cork people who adopted Romanian babies and there is no doubt they feel they are caught in a very difficult situation. They adopted their babies in Romania and find that they do not have the constitutional protection which other children have.  The parents have pointed out that the children do not have succession rights, and cannot be put on an Irish passport; their status within the family until is unclear.  This Bill aims to give official recognition to foreign adoption orders and requires health boards to assist Irish persons seeking to adopt children in foreign countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adoption consists of the establishment of a legal relationship between a parent and child where this relationship does not <Col N="211" /> necessarily depend on natural ties.  Over the centuries a complex range of adoption laws have existed in different countries. The policy of adoption has sometimes been directed towards benefiting the adoptive parents as in Greece and Rome where family ties were strengthened and the name and property of ancient and noble houses were preserved from extinction. Adoption was to help the parents continue the family name and maintain their property.  This policy seems to exist at present in some African and Asian countries but in Ireland, in other European countries and in North America, the policy of adoption is to promote the welfare of the child.</P>
    <P>There are, however, significant differences in a number of countries in the legal effects of adoption.  In many countries, including Ireland, it puts an end to the legal relationship between the natural parent and the child who is adopted.  In others it does not; in some countries adoption is by private agreement and in others it must be formally approved by a public agency.</P>
    <P>Adoption only became a part of our laws with the passing of the Adoption Act, 1952.  An adoption order may be made where the child resides in the State and where the proposed adoptive parents ordinarily reside in the State.  There is no legislation in Ireland setting out circumstances in which a foreign adoption order is recognised here.  The absence of such legislation has become a major and critical issue for many people here.  It is crucial that we in Dáil Éireann fulfil our role as legislators by introducing suitable legislation to tackle this very important and sensitive social issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter has responded very quickly to a problem which had become a social issue here following the dramatic changes in eastern Europe over one year ago.  The plight of the children left in deplorable conditions in orphanages in Romania was brought home very clearly to us by television pictures beamed into our homes.  Many Irish families responded very quickly and, to date, there are about 150 Romanian children <Col N="212" /> in Ireland who were adopted in Romania in 1990.  Their numbers are being added to by between two and four children each week.</P>
    <P>Adoption is an extremely complex area of law and is closely tied to the constitutional protection of the family.  There was particular difficulty regarding adoption which had to be dealt with by amending the Constitution.  The Adoption Act, 1988 was referred by the President to the Supreme Court to test if it was in keeping with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Under Irish law only certain categories of persons can adopt, namely married couples living together and where the person seeking to adopt is a sole applicant. There must be a natural parent, a relative or widow or, in certain circumstances, a widower.  Our law is based on the principle that the welfare of the child is the main consideration.  It is considered that a child should be adopted into a family unit with a father and a mother.  For that reason, there are limitations on adoption by single applicants. Adoption by unmarried couples is prohibited by Article 6.1 of the European Convention on the Adoption of Children, which Ireland has ratified.</P>
    <P>Some of the children available for adoption in Romania were born within marriage; in Ireland such children can only be adopted where the High Court is satisfied that they have failed in their constitutional duty to care for their children.  In this connection the Supreme Court have emphasised that factors such as poverty would not amount to a failure within the meaning of the Act.  Again, our standards differ from those applied in Romania.</P>
    <P>The question of whether we should recognise foreign adoption decrees was considered by the Law Reform Commission in their report issued in May 1989.  However in that report they did not deal with or provide solutions for the problems which were being experienced by those who had adopted children from Romania.  The Government and the Attorney General have been giving serious consideration to the need to introduce comprehensive legislation which <Col N="213" /> will deal adequately with the problems being faced by those who have adopted children from Romania.  While Deputy Shatter's Bill is very welcome we need to consider in the legislation the eligibility of the child for adoption, the consent of the natural parents and the eligibility and suitability of the adoptive parents.  These are matters which will be considered by the special all-party committee of the Dáil which is to be set up to deal with this Bill.  I look forward to a successful conclusion to their deliberations and to the enactment of this Bill into law.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the many families who have taken it upon themselves to adopt children from Romania.  I have visited the homes of some of these families and there is no doubt that these adoptions have led to a transformation in their homes.  There is much happiness with the fact that they have given a child a decent home having regard to the environment from which they have been taken.  There is a responsibility on us to ensure, despite the constitutional and legal constraints, that every effort is made to regularise their position given the many other difficulties they will face in rearing those children.  They are to be complimented and I have no doubt every support will be forthcoming from this side of the House in ensuring that the amending legislation will provide for their needs.</P>

      <P>I wish to congratulate my colleague, Deputy Shatter, for introducing this Bill which will recognise foreign adoptions.  To him alone belongs our praise and respect for facing the problems relating to foreign adoptions and, more importantly, for taking a positive step to ensure that foreign adoptions are recognised by the State.  I welcome the news that the Government in the past 24 hours have decided to put their pride in their <Col N="214" /> pockets and support the Bill.  I could never understand how any person could have contemplated blocking such an important and compassionate Bill.  I am glad that Fine Gael have compelled the Government to act responsibly and with maturity on this very human issue.</P>
      <P>The debate on which partner in Government convinced the other to make this responsible and welcome decision we on this side of the House gladly leave to you.  However the fact remains that nobody, either within Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats, did anything to solve the problem. Deputy Shatter with the support of the Fine Gael Party was the only person to take the initiative and seek a solution. But for his initiative I believe that the children concerned would have been allowed remain in a legal limbo and that the heartbreak and trauma for adoptive parents would have been allowed continue as there was no urgency on the part of the Government to do anything about foreign adoptions.</P>
      <P>Foreign adoptions have become the reality in our society today and have succeeded in attracting much media attention due mainly to the recent tendency to adopt Romanian babies.  The number of people making the journey to Romania to adopt babies is due primarily to the decreasing number of babies available for adoption here at home.  Many Irish couples with no possibility of adopting here, and touched by the plight and deprivation of Romanian babies, have grasped this last opportunity to have a family of their own.  We must remember that the procedure for such adoptions is not an easy or a simple one.  Indeed, apart from the financial demands involved in traveling to Romania and being prepared to stay there for a number of weeks many procedures have to be carried out before their departure from Ireland.  Sadly, there is a belief that no standards exist in relation to Romanian adoptions but this is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every couple have to get a character reference from the Garda Síochána, financial statements from the bank, medical reports, employment information, a <Col N="215" /> letter from the Department of Justice to allow the adopted child enter the country and a family study report.  Having spoken to some adoptive parents I regret to say that they met with many difficulties.  I can only conclude that it was their enormous personal commitment and determination to succeed that eventually allowed them to take the flight to Romania.  The sacrifices made by many of the couples only added to the depth of their determination to have a family of their own.  I expect, however, that with the number of children coming up for adoption in the State continuing to decrease, an increasing number of Irish parents will seek to adopt children abroad.  We must and should help them in their endeavours and should not hinder or place obstacles in their way.</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular section 12 of the Bill which will impose an obligation on health boards to co-operate in the carrying out of a family assessment for the purposes of a foreign adoption.  This was a real problem area for many of the couples when they failed, sadly, to get the co-operation and support of social workers in carrying out a home study report.  It is surely in our own interests that a genuine family study is carried out because our concern for a secure, healthy home is not confined just to children adopted in this country but to all children wherever they come from and wherever they are adopted.  We must demand the same standards for all adopted children and ensure that every child will find themselves with suitable adoptive parents and in a secure and stable environment.</P>
    <P>When the sad, heart-rending television pictures of the Romanian babies in overcrowded orphanages flashed across our screens, thankfully many people were touched and moved by such appalling human conditions and travelled to Romania to rescue babies from that hell. In south Tipperary alone 16 Romanian babies have found homes among us.  I salute and admire the parents who opened their hearts and their homes to those children.  This legislation then will ensure that they will be recognised as the <Col N="216" /> legal children of their adoptive parents. Until Deputy Shatter took the initiative and introduced this Bill these adopted children who had been given a second chance to find happiness by caring Irish families would have been confined to a cruel legal limbo where their adoptive parents would not legally have been their parents in this country.  Could we honestly watch these loving and caring couples face such a severe human heartbreak? Without the status of a legal adoption questions such as inheritance rights, passports, foreign travel and immigration could present legal nightmares for the children later on.</P>
    <P>I have fully supported the campaign of the parents, and gladly support this Bill, to have the law recognise these adoptions. After all, compelled by a sense of Christian duty and love Irish families decided to rescue these children from a system which had been brutal to them, which had marginalised them and denied them love and proper care.  Surely these adoptive parents cannot be blamed for acting according to their hearts and consciences while the innocent children certainly cannot be blamed for the legal no man's land in which they find themselves today.  It is time that our legislation conferred on these babies the same legal rights that are conferred on every other Irish citizen so that we can truly say we cherish all the children of the nation equally.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister when he says that there should not be uncertainty surrounding the status, under domestic law, of adoption decrees granted in other countries.  However, I cannot concur with some of the reservations expressed about the legality and acceptability of some of the measures included in the Bill.  The Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, claims that the section dealing with the recognition of foreign adoptions is based solely on the nationality and residence of the child with the result that it may be unconstitutional. This is complete and utter nonsense.  It would not, as the Minister claims, result in a complete open-ended system of recognition as the adoption <Col N="217" /> would be based on the child being a citizen, a national, of the country in which the adoption order is being made and the adoption would have to fulfil the conditions laid down in that country.</P>
    <P>The Minister also questioned the omission from the Bill of the eligibility of the child and the consent of the natural parents.  However, the consent of the natural parents and the eligibility of the child for adoption would surely be the responsibility of the foreign country making the adoption order.  Yes, I accept that we must ensure that we are satisfied with all the regulations in the foreign country in this regard, but this is how private international law rules work in all other areas of the law.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution which guarantee to protect the family and to respect the rights and duties of parents, the law here does not permit married parents to voluntarily surrender their children for adoption.  However, the Law Reform Commission say these Articles do not prevent the recognition of foreign adoptions and are, indeed, of limited relevance. The Minister further pointed out that a flaw in the Bill is that it does not require the eligibility or suitability of the adoptive parents to be taken into consideration. This, I must say, is an extraordinary claim in the context of Deputy Shatter's Bill.  On the contrary, the Bill tries to ensure that where a couple wish to go abroad for the purposes of adopting a baby, the health board will be involved in determining the suitability of the parents.  At the moment they do not co-operate and, sad to say, in some cases they deliberately obstruct the carrying out of assessments.  As I have pointed out, section 12 of the Bill deals with this matter.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House welcome constructive comments and opinions on this Bill and any amendments that will further improve the safeguarding of the rights and status of children adopted abroad.  I hope sincerely that on Committee Stage some of the Minister's reservations will be withdrawn and that this <Col N="218" /> Bill will be what it is intended to be, a recognition of foreign adoptions.</P>
    <P>I believe the Bill fully and properly addresses the issues to which it relates. Nevertheless, as Deputy Shatter stated, appropriate amendments can be incorporated in the Bill on Committee Stage. However, we must all remember that this Bill is an important legal response to a major social need to protect the welfare of children and ensure that all children adopted by Irish couples are equally treated under the law.</P>
    <P>Once again I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Shatter, on the introduction of this Bill.  I welcome too the positive and sympathetic approach of the Government on this issue in supporting Second Stage, but a united effort must now be made to ensure a speedy passage of the Bill, thus ensuring an end to the anxiety and stress of the parents and then ensuring legal status for those foreign adoptions.</P>
    <P>I hope, Sir, you were looking at the 6 o'clock news this evening.  It gave me great pleasure to witness the joy and happiness of parents and children in a village very near to both of us, Kilsheelan, in my constituency; their joy and happiness were due entirely to the initiative taken by Deputy Shatter and the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by paying a compliment to my colleague, Deputy Shatter for bringing this very important legislation before the House.  In doing so, he has displayed considerable ingenuity and made it possible for the House to provide a solution to problems which were in urgent need of resolution.  When moving Second Stage last night Deputy Shatter provided indepth background information, particularly with regard to the Romanian situation.  A couple who are close friends of mine adopted in Romania, and I can clarify that Deputy Shatter's account of the circumstances in the orphanages is entirely accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to add a little anecdote of my own.  My friends had with them a few packets of &ldquo;Smarties&rdquo;.  They adopted two children, one almost three years of age. <Col N="219" /> They discovered that the little three-year-old could not chew a &ldquo;Smartie&rdquo;.  He had never chewed anything in the three years of his less than satisfactory existence.  His diet was a kind of watery porridge &mdash; that is how it was described to me; I suppose you would call it gruel or something of that nature.  He had spent most of his time lying, sitting or standing in a steel-framed cot.  Not alone was he starved of good food and proper nourishment, but he was emotionally starved.  Until recently he never knew what it was to be hugged or cuddled.  I had the pleasure of walking the streets of Castleblayney with that little fellow about three weeks ago. He is now a very happy, secure little fellow, thriving on a good diet and on the love and affection of a very dedicated adoptive mother and father.  Had he not been adopted one shudders to think how his life would have evolved.  Now he is living in a happy, secure home, it is our duty to offer him full protection under the Constitution.  On his behalf &mdash; he is not here to say &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; himself &mdash; I want to say to Deputy Shatter and to the Minister, &ldquo;thank you for initiating legislation to bring this about.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child was signed on behalf of the people of this country by the Taoiseach in September 1990.  However, the convention has not been ratified.  Its ratification requires legislation to give effect to the protection of the rights of children.  The Child Care Bill which was initiated in 1988 and is now in the Seanad is an example of the type of legislation which needs to be enacted.  The Bill we are now dealing with will enact legislation envisaged by Article 21 of the UN Convention.</P>
    <P>I spent some time today examining the Minister's various objections to different parts of the Bill and I found considerable misunderstanding in relation to what the Bill proposes.  There is a grave danger that confusion will arise &mdash; it has arisen already &mdash; between our own legislation for home based adoptions and this Bill which provides for the recognition of foreign adoptions.  For example, we cannot <Col N="220" /> supervise adoptions which are carried out in foreign countries.  It would be impossible and undesirable that we should do so.  What we must do in every case is ensure that adoption procedures in foreign countries are followed to the letter of the law.  For example, we have to ensure that the procedures which exist in Romania are followed exactly and precisely and this Bill takes all that into account.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Minister's speech to reveal to the House some of the difficulties that have emerged because of the confusion that has arisen between our own legislation for home adoptions and what is proposed in this Bill.  The Minister said: &ldquo;However, in fairness to people who have adopted in Romania recently, it has to be emphasised that recognition based on domicile or habitual residence would be of no benefit to them or to other people who travelled to a foreign country for the sole purpose of adopting a child.&rdquo; That is completely and totally unfounded.  This Bill deals comprehensively with that, and I quote from section 4 which deals with recognition of adoption orders based on nationality and residence of the adopted child:</P>
    <P>(1)  An adoption order made by the lawfully designated authority of the country of which the person adopted was at the time of the making of the adoption order&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a national, and</P>
    <P>(b)  ordinarily resident,</P>
    <P>shall be recognised in the State.</P>
    <P>All we are doing is recognising foreign adoptions provided they are carried out under the law of the country of adoption. Section 4 deals completely adequately with that.  The confusion runs right through the Minister's speech.  I will give a few more examples and quote the Minister again:</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's proposal for dealing with this kind of foreign adoption is to provide for their recognition based solely on the nationality and residence of the child.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> This time he referred to Irish couples resident here who were carrying out an adoption in Romania or in some other foreign country.  Again we are confusing home law with what is provided for in this Bill: to be adopted a child must be a national and a resident of the particular country and the adoptions carried out must conform to the law of that country. There is no difficulty about that.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>Under the Deputy's proposals the adoption of a child born within marriage would be entitled to recognition. It is not clear whether this is constitutionally permissible.</P>
    <P>There is a very clear case there of absolute confusion between our existing law and the law that will be enacted under the Bill before us.  What is envisaged in what the Minister says there is that there may be a clash between the regulations which we have &mdash; which would prevent adoption of a child born within marriage &mdash; and a case like that which would happen, for example, in Romania.  Of course, if that particular circumstance is allowed in Romanian law all we have to do is ensure that the adoption, when it was taking place, was in fact carried out to the letter of that law.  There is no difficulty whatsoever with that.  Then the Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>...the law here does not permit married parents to voluntarily surrender their children for adoption.</P>
    <P>I have to repeat, that does not matter; it is the law of the foreign country that matters.  The Minister then had this to say:</P>
    <P>The Bill contains no reference whatsoever to the consent of the natural parents.</P>
    <P>I must repeat there is no need whatsoever for the Bill to refer to that; it is something which does not arise.  It is a matter for the law of the particular country where the adoption is taking place.  The Minister goes on to use that sentence to justify the creation by him of a whole lot of problems <Col N="222" /> he sees with the Bill.  For example, he has this to say:</P>
    <P>A further flaw in the Bill is that it does not require the elegibility of suitability of the adoptive parents to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Again we have confusion.  We do not have to be concerned with that; it is the foreign country that determines the suitability of the parents.  Indeed section 12 requires that health boards, when asked to do so, must co-operate in carrying out assessments of parents.  If the Minister is extremely worried about that part of the Bill would it not be possible for him to table an amendment to the effect that parents who wish to adopt abroad must have their assessments carried out through the relevant health board when we would have some control over the suitability of parents?  Again there are no grounds whatsoever for that objection. The Minister then said:</P>
    <P>The Bill would also entitle a single person who adopts abroad to have the adoption recognised here...</P>
    <P>That is the same old conundrum, the confusion between the two sets of circumstances. Anyhow at present we do allow that: in certain circumstances, single people can adopt here in the case of relatives and so on.  We must bear in mind throughout our consideration of this Bill that we are recognising foreign adoptions and are not so much concerned about our law in this respect as we are about the law of the country in which the adoption is taking place.  For example, if we have an objection to single persons adopting we must ask ourselves: what would we achieve by not recognising such an adoption?  I might also quote these remarks of the Minister:</P>
    <P>I would also point out that the provisions of the Bill are not restricted to Irish citizens or even to people who are resident here.  Thus, an adoption order granted in, say, Brazil to an English couple who are domiciled in England would be entitled to recognition here <Col N="223" /> even though Brazilian adoptions are not recognised in England.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to express deep concern that this country could be used as a sort of back door for foreign parents who might want to circumvent the adoption procedures in their home countries. In that type of case &mdash; should it arise &mdash; all we are concerned about is that Brazilian law would have to be fully and completely satisfied.  If Brazilian law was fully and completely satisfied, then we would recognise that adoption if the family unit came to reside here.  Of course, if Brazilian law was not followed properly, then obviously we would not recognise it.  For example, if the parents were found to have purchased the child, then surely we would not recognise an adoption in such circumstances?</P>
    <P>At this point I might point out that we recognise foreign divorces if granted by a country where either the husband or wife is domiciled.  Therefore there is a precedent there.  Then the Minister had this to say:</P>
    <P>However, there is one essential condition absent, that is whether the adoption was made with the consent of the natural parents or whether their consent was dispensed with by a competent foreign authority on appropriate grounds.</P>
    <P>The Minister again expressed grave concern about that aspect.  If one looks at it carefully, again one finds that it is not our concern whatsoever; we do not have to be worried about whether a parent gives consent or not.  I repeat <i>ad nauseam</i>&mdash; because this is central to the whole business &mdash; that all we are concerned with is that the law applicable in the particular foreign country is followed and obeyed to the very last letter; then that worry vanishes into thin air.  The Minister then had this to say:</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the withholding of recognition where recognition would be contrary to public policy. This means that the recognition of any adoption under any of the procedures <Col N="224" /> contained in the Bill could be set aside at any time by the courts.</P>
    <P>One would have to say that this concern of the Minister would apply to every adoption, whether it be an adoption by an Irish couple in Ireland or by a couple in any country.  At some stage a mother might decide to make certain allegations and, in that event, the courts would have to decide on the basis of the evidence they can obtain relating to the method of adoption in the country where it was carried out.</P>
    <P>In this country at this time if an issue with regard to adoption arises, courts, if they are asked to do so, deal with it.  In the same way if an issue arises with regard to foreign adoption the courts would have the power to deal with that and they would be able to make a decision based on the evidence they would collect and on the way the adoption was carried out in the country where the adoption happened. I have demonstrated to the House that there is a grave danger that we will have an enormous amount of confusion between adoptions carried out in Ireland under Irish law and adoptions carried out in foreign countries under the law pertaining in those countries, which is dealt with comprehensively under the terms of this Bill.  All I want to do at this stage is commend the legislation to the House.</P>
    <P>There is not a great need for a huge number of amendments.  However, seeing that we have agreement with the Minister I am sure that any imperfections will be dealt with in the course of the discussions that will take place.  We on this side of the House would point out to the Minister that he must look at this legislation apart completely from Irish law governing adoptions here and as brand new legislation standing admirably on its own.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this issue so far has clearly demonstrated that we are in a very complex area.  Many complex issues need to be teased out and that is why I particularly welcome the <Col N="225" /> fact that this legislation will be dealt with through the committee system of this House.  The contributions I have heard so far have been well researched and well thought out and have not been given to extreme statements of any kind.  The contributions have been genuine and are obviously influenced by the necessity to produce legislation which, when it becomes law, will do the job it is intended to do by all sides of the House.  It should ensure, with reference to foreign adoptions that the rights of the child and the adopting parent or parents will be fully safeguarded.  That is one of the crucial elements essential to this legislation if it is to fulfil its role.</P>
      <P>Like many others in this House, I have had an opportunity to meet adopting parents, particularly parents who are either going to or coming from Romania. They were able to recount the difficulties and trials of such a journey.  They were going into a society which they did not understand having regard to social background, political ideology and so on. Many of the parents who spoke to me told me of the great difficulties they experienced on entering Romania and beginning the adoption process there.  It is a very trying time for prospective adopters apart from the situation at home. When one considers parents involved in the foreign adoption process one can understand the difficulties and complexities and the sometimes harrowing times of such parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to ensure that legislation of this kind is to benefit such parents, we must pursue the debate in a calm and rational manner and on Committee Stage we should tease out the details and bring the best available minds to bear on the legislation to ensure ultimately that we put on the Statute Book legislation which will protect the rights of adopting parents and adopted children.  It is for that reason that I welcome the Government's decision not to oppose a Second Reading of Deputy Shatter's Bill.  The decision reflects the Government's sensitivity to the difficulties being encountered by Irish people who have adopted children abroad and their commitment to finding <Col N="226" /> a workable and lasting solution to those problems.</P>
    <P>There is agreement on all sides of the House as to the desirability of setting out in legislation the circumstances in which foreign adoptions should be entitled to recognition in the State.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have referred to the fact that in recent years there has been a steady decline in the number of children available for adoption within the State.  There are a number of reasons for this.  There is now a generally more sympathetic attitude to single mothers which has encouraged more of them to keep their children.  The availability of improved social welfare benefits and other support services has also helped many single parents to rear their children rather than place them for adoption. These developments are to be welcomed. No one will deny that the best place for a child to grow up is within the love and security of its natural family, wherever possible.</P>
    <P>The fact that more single mothers are now keeping their children has had a big impact on our adoption services.  It has resulted in an increasing number of childless couples wishing to have a family through adoption looking abroad in their quest for a child.  Over the years a small but steady number of Irish couples have adopted children from Third World countries.  Since early last year the situation has altered dramatically on account of the appalling situation that came to light in Romania following the revolution there.  This issue has been touched on by a number of contributors to this debate. We were all deeply saddened and shocked by the information that emerged from Romania in the light of recent political developments there.</P>
    <P>The upsurge in interest in the adoption of foreign children is by no means unique to Ireland.  This has also been the trend in the other developed countries.  Indeed, in some countries the stage has been reached where inter-country adoptions now outnumber national adoptions annually. This is the background against which this Bill must be viewed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> While the Government are in agreement with the overall objective of this Bill, they have, as my colleague the Minister for Health outlined last night, serious reservations about the advisability of some of the provisions contained in it.</P>
    <P>The first point I would like to make in relation to the Bill is that it is not confined to Romanian adoptions.  Rather it seeks to provide a legal framework for the recognition of foreign adoptions effected anywhere in the world.  It is important that this be made clear.  Some of the reports in the media may have given the impression that the Bill deals exclusively with Romanian adoptions.  This is not the case and in examining the Bill it has to be borne in mind that its provisions will apply to adoptions in countries throughout the world, some of which have very reputable systems of adoption whereas in other countries, unfortunately, the buying and selling of children is not unknown.  We have to ensure that our legislation does not facilitate trafficking and exploitation of vulnerable children.</P>
    <P>The second point I would make is that if the recognition of a foreign adoption means granting it the same status as an Irish adoption, it seems to me a prerequisite that the nature and effect of the foreign adoption must be the same as that of an adoption under Irish law.  In other words, the legal consequences of the foreign adoption must involve the complete termination of all the natural parents' rights and duties with respect to the child and the transfer of those rights and duties on a permanent basis to the adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>The Bill fails to address this fundamental issue.  It seeks to provide a number of mechanisms by which an adoption order made in a foreign country would be entitled to recognition in the State.  However, the term &ldquo;adoption order&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill.  This is a grave omission.  It totally ignores the fact that some countries operate systems of adoption which amount to no more than long term foster care where the child <Col N="228" /> retains its original name and its succession rights to its natural family.  Under Deputy Shatter's scheme, those arrangements would be accorded a status here beyond that which they enjoy in the foreign country where they took place.  The question of what constitutes an adoption order for the purposes of the Bill is one of the matters that will need to be examined at the Special Committee.</P>
    <P>A further matter which must be considered is the competence of the foreign authority to make an adoption order.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that recognition should be confined to adoptions effected under legislative provisions only.  Again, the Bill gives no guidance on this important matter and it is one that will have to be addressed by the Special Committee.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health, has already drawn attention to the absence of any reference in the Bill to the consent of the natural parents.  I must say that I was very surprised by Deputy Ferris's apparent rejection of the importance of parental consent in the adoption process.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cotter teased out this matter somewhat.  I cannot understand how one can in the adopting process dismiss the essential element of consent by the natural parents.  Since consent is essential to the validity of any adoption order, the absence of consent must have a bearing on whether a foreign adoption order is entitled to recognition.  If we were to do otherwise, we could find ourselves facilitating the trafficking of children for adoption, for example, children who had been abducted from their parents or who had been arbitrarily taken from them and placed for adoption by a dictatorial regime.</P>
    <P>As regards section 9 of the Bill, which would entitle the adoptive parents or the adopted person to apply to the High Court for a declaration that their foreign adoption is valid here, I think it is regrettable that there is no provision for the court to make a custody order where it refuses to recognise a foreign adoption order.  The court has this power when dealing with other applications relating <Col N="229" /> to children and I consider that it would be desirable to extend it to proceedings under this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the defects in the Bill be rectified when it goes before the Special Committee of the House.  I cannot over emphasise the heavy responsibility that rests on all of us as legislators to ensure that we produce a piece of legislation that will stand up in law.  In an area as delicate as adoption, which involves the termination of legal relationships and the creation of new ones, it is vitally important that there should be no uncertainty about the validity of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I share the Minister for Health's confidence that the Special Committee will effect the necessary improvements in the Bill.  Many of the points covered in the debate will have to be teased out further.  That is the purpose of the Special Committee.  All contributions have been made in the interest of doing what is right and proper and what is needed, particularly by the adopting parents.</P>
    <P>I should like to share the remainder of my time with my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for allowing me to share his time.  It is regrettable that the political rumour machine has become entwined in the passage of this extremely important legislation. The latest suggestion is that only for the Progressive Democrats the Bill would never have been referred to a Special Committee.  This is akin to the argument made during the passage of the Judicial Separation Bill when it was also argued that the Bill would never have seen the light of day if Fianna Fáil had not been in a minority position.  I would ask the critics to take note that Fianna Fáil were in Government on the only two occasions in the past 30 years when a Private Members' Bill was accepted. Some of the credit goes without question <Col N="230" /> to Deputy Shatter, who drafted both Bills.</P>

      <P>In any event, the basic principles set forth in Deputy Shatter's Bill will always be acceptable to Fianna Fáil.  The reason the Bill must be deeply considered is that this is a very complicated and difficult area.  This is best illustrated by giving examples and I mean in no way to demean Deputy Shatter's drafting when I mention some of the serious difficulties with which the Special Committee will be faced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Deputy Shatter's Bill a child adopted in a foreign country would have his or her adoption recognised solely on the basis of the nationality and residence of the child.  It would have no regard to the consent of the natural parents, for example, and would allow a regime in a foreign country to give away its citizens &mdash; children &mdash; irrespective of whether the parents of the child consented.  Neither our Supreme Court nor our civilisation could countenance that.  Under Deputy Shatter's Bill no regard could be had to the suitability of the adoptive parents. Literally anybody would be entitled to take a child from a foreign country into their care.  Nobody could seriously suggest that this would be acceptable.  It is acceptable in this country at present but within very narrow constraints.  Accordingly a child born within marriage could be given up for adoption if the parents were impoverished and, from my reading of the Bill, this could be done in certain circumstances without their consent.  I do <Col N="231" /> not believe that scenario can be countenanced.</P>
    <P>I could give other examples if time allowed but there is one common thread running through each of the examples given: it is that a different set of standards would apply in the case of foreign adoptions from those pertaining in our own adoption law.  This has serious constitutional implications and illustrates the difficulty and perplexity of the task facing us.  I believe that the Supreme Court would unquestionably return a child to its natural parents, regardless of his or her origins, if it was established that they had not consented in the first place to the adoption.  Accordingly the foundation stone upon which we must build this Bill is the recognition and acceptance of the fundamental principle that except in the most exceptional circumstances the natural parents must consent to the adoption. To do otherwise would be to fly in the face not just of our Constitution but of civilisation itself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter does attempt to build in safeguards but since for the most part each section is mutually exclusive of the others, even the safeguards do not apply in all situations.  Where the safeguards do apply, he suggests that the Minister designate the country whose adoptions would be recognised and that recognition should not be forthcoming where it would be contrary to public policy.</P>
    <P>He also sets out the criteria to which the Minister must have regard in deciding whether to recognise a foreign adoption. However, in all cases not covered by the safeguards he ignores the requirement that the natural parents must consent. Presumably, therefore &mdash; and I do not think it would be Deputy Shatter's intention, not am I saying that &mdash; under the terms of the Bill as at present constituted, it would not be contrary to public policy in certain situations to recognise foreign adoptions where the natural parents did not consent.</P>
    <P>To turn specifically now to the Romanian babies, there are specific issues to which the Special Committee will have to have due regard.  The first is <Col N="232" /> whether the Legislature will decide to confer recognition on adoptions effected in Romania by Irish people who are ineligible to adopt here.  For example, a number of single women have adopted children in Romania.  Adoption by unmarried couples is prohibited by Article 6.1 of the European Convention on the Adoption of Children which Ireland has ratified.  So we will have a difficulty not just in recognising the adoption of a child by a single person but we will also have a difficulty in getting around the ratification of the convention itself.  I believe that we should do that if at all possible but it will be extremely difficult and we had better realise that now.</P>
    <P>The second scenario to which I would like to refer in relation to the Romanian situation is whether the Legislature will decide that it is proper to confer recognition on adoption decrees made in a country which does not require the adopting parents to have lived there for any length of time.  The law here requires adopting parents to be ordinarily resident in the State for at least 12 months. Accordingly, the law would have to be amended in this regard also.</P>
    <P>The next question I would like to raise is whether there are constitutional objections to the recognition of foreign adoption orders relating to children who are ineligible for adoption under Irish law.  It is really open to question in the final analysis whether our courts will accept that the low standards of living and general backwardness prevailing in Romania or elsewhere are of themselves sufficient grounds to justify the adoption of foreign children here under the 1988 Act.  This grave human problem must be addressed and where defects appear in the Bill, as I am sure Deputy Shatter will accept they do, these will, of necessity, have to be closed off.</P>
    <P>It will be crucial to ensure that the standards applying to foreign adoptions will be the same as those which apply in Ireland.  We must insist when giving detailed expression to the principles enunciated in the Bill that all human beings within the terms of the Bill are <Col N="233" /> treated equally irrespective of nationality, creed, colour or class.  Those wonderful people who went to Romania and brought home children deserve no less than that this Bill be a testament to their courage, their valour, their love and their humanity.</P>
    <P>I believe that what Deputy Shatter has presented is commendable, as was the Judicial Separation Bill and, accordingly, I commend the Bill.  I do foresee a situation where will run into extremely complex legal difficulties and these difficulties will be compounded by the ratification of the European Convention to which I have referred and the UN Convention which was recently signed by the Taoiseach. Added to these problems will be the difficulty of reconciling the legislation as presented and as agreed in the final analysis with the conventions concerned and with the Constitution itself.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, it appears from a cursory reading of this Bill &mdash; and I will of course accept that I, no more than anybody else, am not omnipotent &mdash; that we are facing grave difficulties in passing the legislation into law.  I would go so far as to say that it is my view at present that the passage of legislation for the recognition of foreign adoptions, because the laws in other countries are very often not broadly similar to our own, will ultimately mean that the Constitution itself will have to be amended.  If the Constitution itself has to be amended to recognise foreign adoptions, and I believe this is certainly on the cards, then and in that event I certainly would not stand in the way of amending the Constitution. There are numerous imponderables in drafting the necessary legislation and, at the very least, it is quite obvious that any legislation in this area which is so deeply complex will, in all probability and indeed justice, have to be referred by the President to the Supreme Court for consideration.</P>
    <P>I would again like to commend Deputy Shatter for presenting the Bill, but I think it is now apparent to everybody that the reason the Government seemed to some to be procrastinating was the enormous difficulties which were envisaged at all <Col N="234" /> times by the Attorney General and the Government themselves in drafting legislation in this extremely difficult and complicated area.  It would have been very easy for the Government to have drafted the heads of a Bill having already seen that Deputy Shatter was to present a Bill, but the Government did not do that for the simple reason that they wanted to present to the House a comprehensive Bill detailing, examining and questioning the enormous complexities involved. This issue must, under no circumstances, become a political football.  No political party should seek to claim that it was the reason the Bill was introduced to the House in the first instance; and no political party, by innuendo, rumour or otherwise should suggest that just because it had a minority role in the Government, the Bill would be referred to a Special Committee.</P>
    <P>In my humble opinion the Bill as presented to the House by Deputy Shatter requires radical amendment before it can be tested in the Supreme Court.  It will have to be tested here, and following that there is every chance that we will require a constitutional amendment in order to recognise foreign adoptions.  In all justice and fairness to the wonderful people I mentioned who went to Romania, we should do everything in our power to bring this legislation onto the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>I believe as well that it is absolutely essential that we have a law relating to foreign adoptions.  It is equally clear that nobody has or nobody could have a monopoly of knowledge in this extremely difficult area.  It has to be recognised as well that what we are faced with is to a large extent a legal minefield which has to be walked around extremely carefully.  I sincerely hope that we will end up with the type of Bill which Deputy Shatter envisages and that it will be to the benefit of those who have brought home children from Romania and the generous Irish couples who choose in the future to adopt children from abroad.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to welcome this Bill and to commend <Col N="235" /> my constituency colleague, Deputy Shatter, for the work he has done on it.  Before I commence my contribution I would like to refer to the remarks of the previous speaker.  I have a great deal of time for this Deputy, having served on committees with him; I realise he has a great deal of expertise and knowledge of the law and that he has used this to very good effect.  I regret to say, however, it seems to me that he has not read the Law Reform Commission report and I do not think the complexities he sees are reflected in the report.</P>
      <P>May I suggest that the Fianna Fáil speakers study that report in detail?  It will not be easy.  It is very difficult for lay people to read these legal reports but it is a fundamental document and very important and useful for the work we have to do for the debate on this legislation. I do not for a minute suggest that anybody in the House believes that this legislation will be put through lightly or without great consideration.  The Bill, no more than other social legislation, particularly legislation dealing with children or anything that verges on a constitutional matter, needs to be scrutinised carefully and given an indepth analysis and examination in this House so that we can be quite certain that the legislation is as perfect, as good and as long lasting as it possibly can be before it leaves this House and the other House.  I feel reassured that this is what will happen to this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to comment on what, in my opinion, is a political breakthrough. Once more we are discussing a Bill which has been introduced by Deputy Shatter in Private Members' Time, and which has been accepted by the Government.  It must be a cause of relief and satisfaction to all in this House, particularly those of us who from time to time have felt frustrated at the antediluvian nature of this political structure and how it has tended to make many Members politically impotent because we have so little power.  There are so many things that we want to do but cannot because of the archaic structures.  This should not be the case.  Everybody elected to this House <Col N="236" /> has talents, skills and the motivation to improve the society he represents and the diffuse interests from their constituencies. It is wrong that so many Members are powerless to bring forward legislation.  Ministers and Ministers of State only can initiate legislation, that is, 30 out of 166 Members, a very small minority.  This is unworthy of any democratic institution.</P>
    <P>Some value may have accrued over the years from the way in which Private Members' Bills were treated.  The Bill was published and passed First Stage but it was then blocked or voted down and disappeared.  I have always felt that this was most regrettable and a terrible waste in terms of research, drafting and speaking time.  I felt that, whether I was in the Government or on the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>This Bill, now being agreed by the Government, is a sign of growing maturity.  Of course, it must have been painful to those on the Government benches to have to come to grips with this initiative and to have seen the Fine Gael Party run away with an issue as important as this and on which there is such great public concern.  I hope and trust this will lead to fundamental change and, perhaps, we will get used to this so that the voters will know that anyone alone, or with the support of his party, can initiate and bring a Bill through this House.  I do not care whether this was the result of PD influence; it matters not a jot who decided in their wisdom to accept this Bill.  In my opinion it was the right thing to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that we should formalise what we are doing to very good effect, and I am sure the public would appreciate it.  I suggest that we adopt if not the system then a version of it, that exists in Westminster in which they have regular lotteries of Private Members' Bills, perhaps three or four times a year. Various time constraints govern the lottery but Members can put in their Bills and some are taken.  Something similar <Col N="237" /> would be a very progressive step and one for which we are ready.  Very good and worthwhile legislation on issues which are important to people on this side of the House could be brought forward and developed.  This would be very useful, and perhaps this suggestion could be considered.</P>
      <P>Before I discuss the proposals in the Bill I must say that I am one of those people who have very mixed feelings about adoption in general.  I support the consistent trend under which single mothers can retain and rear their own children.  I have to say that this is my instinctive gut feeling, and it probably relates far more to the welfare of the mothers than to the welfare of the children.  I am quite sure that anybody could show me that children who are adopted into good, loving, caring homes will in many instances have a better life and a better future than many of the babies who are kept by school girl mothers, young or poor mothers or mothers who are not ready for motherhood. I believe, however, that mothers who have given up their children in the past have paid a very high price; and many of these mothers have emotional scars in later life.</P>
      <P>I recognise that this is a gut feeling and is probably not a good reason to argue against adoption because I feel that, in most instances, adoption is better for the welfare of the child.  I have to admit to that feeling.  I am fortunate that I have three children and never needed to try to adopt a child, but perhaps I would feel differently if I was one of a couple desperate to have a child.  It was this desperation that sent so many Irish couples to Romania to adopt a child against enormous odds and they are not the first group of Irish people who have gone abroad to adopt because they could not adopt at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first contact with people who sought to adopt abroad was with an Irish couple who were outside all the normal parameters even if there were children available for adoption here.  They were of a mixed marriage and both were over 40 years of age, but they were a very <Col N="238" /> loving pair and they very much wanted a child.  They went to Brazil on two occasions.  The first time they stayed there two months &mdash; they were living in Spain and having the child accepted legally was not an issue &mdash; but when they returned to collect the child the adoption became unstuck.  The sad thing about this was that the so-called lawyer who arranged the adoption in Brazil was a crook and had been involved in very shady business placing children.  The most recent contact I have had was of a friend who adopted in Peru.  He gave me a rundown of what he had to go through to get there, to have the right papers and to get people even to listen to him.  He said he did not know where to start.  He had done some work in Peru and was familiar with the system there.  He decided to go to Peru because he knew there were many abandoned children of single mothers for adoption but nobody here would help him.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Ní leor é sin.  On the last occasion I spoke I referred to the fact that the budget, and other events, had proved that the Government were a PR Government.  On <Col N="239" /> that occasion I referred to two different Ministers who had highlighted all they were doing and, in particular, that it was the biggest budget ever.  I pointed out that that would be the case if we take inflation and normal wage increases into account.</P>
      <P>In the few minutes I have left I want to mention the position of agriculture.  A little increase has been given to farmers to encourage them to spend more money on pollution prevention.  I wish to inform the House that farmers will be spending very little on pollution prevention because they are in serious financial difficulties. Part of the PR policy of the Government was that the Minister, and his advisers, would continue to tell the people that there was no difficulty in farming, that the cutback in income was in single figures even though everybody in the country &mdash; and most of all the farmers &mdash; knew that their income was cut by over 20 per cent.  No other group in Ireland would accept a cut in income much less a cut of the magnitude suffered by farmers this year.  The dreaded GATT talks are hanging over us like the sword of Damocles.  We have Commissioner MacSharry's plan and there are so many things going wrong in farming that my sympathy goes out to farmers who are trying to survive.</P>
      <P>There is the mistaken idea that because a farmer has land, or a big house or even a big car that he has large sums of money. Many small farmers are living in poverty. It is too easy to be glib and say: &ldquo;Look at them, they have this or that&rdquo;.  Their income has dropped and if any of us took a 20 per cent reduction in income we would crib.  In the past farmers may have been accused of having a tale of woe when they were doing well.  The chickens have come home to roost.  Things are not well on the farming scene and the budget has done very little for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget has done very little to help employment or to keep our emigrants here.  Another PR exercise is taking place.  Throughout the entire year we will hear Ministers say that unemployment is under control.  If the way to control <Col N="240" /> unemployment is to let our young people go abroad as emigrants that is a simple cure.  We now have the difficulty where the unemployment figures given before the budget had to be changed immediately. Many of the people who came back from England are not now returning and this will result in a further rise in unemployment. The allowances provided for in the budget will not be sufficient to look after those who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>We are in a difficult situation where the finances of this country are concerned.  I do not think any amount of PR work will sell the idea that this is the best Government ever.  This is a PR Government from another point of view in that they have postponed reality.</P>

It is unfortunate from the point of view <Col N="242" /> of those people who wish the Irish language to move on apace that this committee have been relegated to a fourth division position.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to my hopes for Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge so that we can continue the great work we have done under very restrictive conditions.  I want a full-time secretary or clerk to be appointed to the committee and some small injection of funds which will enable us to carry out some of the plans we have in mind for the Irish language.  As I have said, the Irish language room in this building remains effectively unused because the committee do not have a full-time clerk.  I should like all political parties to adopt an Irish-speaking programme in the House.  Unfortunately this cannot be done until such time as a full-time clerk is appointed to the committee. I appeal to those in power to ensure that these problems are resolved.</P>
    <P>In the second part of my contribution I want to refer to my constituency of Dún Laoghaire, which I have represented for a considerable period, and to a number of proposals for the area which are under consideration at present.  The new Garda station in Dún Laoghaire should be situated at the back of the town hall so that the people of the area will have immediate access to the law enforcement agency.  The plan to locate the Garda station outside the heart of the town would be a mistake.  There is a housing crisis in Dún Laoghaire at present and there is an urgent need for new housing. I look forward with great anticipation to the announcement tomorrow in regard to housing by the Minister for the Environment. I hope the first class College of Art which has been in existence in Dún Laoghaire for a number of years will be retained and upgraded.</P>
    <P>The question of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour complex has been on the long finger for too long.  The two items of concern to the people of Dún Laoghaire are the retention of the Sealink Stena Line and its upgrading in the context of new developments within the harbour complex itself and the provision of a marina or marinas for Dún Laoghaire, <Col N="243" /> which has been the subject of controversy for a considerable period.  I have been consistent in my approach to these issues over the years.  The people of Dún Laoghaire await with great anticipation and hope the report of the interim harbour board set up by the Government. We have the goodwill of the Minister for the Marine behind us in regard to these issues, as he indicated in his reply to my question during grievance time last night.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister for Education not only on her contribution on the budget but also for the part she played in the decision to allocate Carysfort College, Blackrock, to the authorities of University College, Dublin.  I know the Minister will not be dissuaded by those who are critical of the decision to put Carysfort College, the former college of education, in the hands of University College, Dublin.  This is a good decision and I know the Minister will stick by it.  The members of the Fianna Fáil Party in Dún Laoghaire welcome this decision, as I think do the members of the Fine Gael Party there.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the location of industry in the constituency.  To this day I cannot understand why small factory complexes are not located in local authority areas so as to ensure that young people remain in their communities. There are many marvellous local authority areas in Dún Laoghaire where environmentally friendly factories could be located.  If small factories employing 20 to 30 young people were located in Sallynoggin, Ballybrack, Loughlinstown and Shankill it would be a wonderful addition to these marvellous communities.</P>
    <P>This is a balanced and equitable budget &mdash; I have no doubt that in the next two years or so we will see that it is a balanced budget in a fiscal sense &mdash; which takes account of those in employment, those looking for employment and those dependent on State resources.  I am not an economist and I do not pretend to have any great competency in this area but I can recognise a good budget when I see one.  Given the financial constraints <Col N="244" /> under which he had to operate on this occasion the Minister for Finance is to be congratulated on this budget.  Suffice to say that the Irish economy is in its best state for many years and is still progressing. The Minister described the budget as a bridge between the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  This is a fair description of the budget.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 Fianna Fáil have delivered on their promises in relation to tax reform.  The Opposition parties may try to claim that tax reform is their sole preserve but it can be seen, despite all the talk, that it was the budgets introduced by the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Ray MacSharry and the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, which brought about real change in our tax system.  Tax reform may mean different things to different people but at the end of the day it means more money in taxpayers' pockets.  The changes introduced by Fianna Fáil since 1987 have meant that the take-home pay of taxpayers has increased considerably in real terms.  The other people who will recognise the advantages and benefits of the budget are that large group in our community who are in receipt of social welfare benefits.  The low paid workers will also recognise the advantages of the Minister's efforts during these difficult times.</P>
    <P>While other parties may talk about tax reform and the need to look after the have nots in our society it is fair to say that since 1987 the Government have delivered on their promises in the areas I have mentioned.  They inherited an economy which had been devastated by the economic dithering of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition during the previous five years.  That Government did not have the courage or vision to meet the challenges presented to them.</P>
    <P>Major steps have been taken by the Government to reduce the tax burden, particularly for the lower paid workers, to increase in real terms the living standards of those dependent on the State and to restore economic and fiscal stability. This budget consolidates the <Col N="245" /> achievements of the Government since 1987 and is another building block in the progress made over the past few years. We have come too far to throw it all away with a lax budget.  This budget takes account of the progress made to date, our targets for the future and the current world economic climate.  I have no hesitation in commending and supporting this budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention in dealing with the 1991 budget to demonstrate how the Government made no attempt in the budget to alleviate the problems in a number of areas.  Like other speakers, I do not get any satisfaction from speaking on issues which cause grave inconvenience and hardship to the community.  As public representatives we have both a moral and political responsibility to speak on such issues.  I do not get any pleasure from doing this.</P>
      <P>The greatest problems confronting the Irish economy and the Irish people today are unemployment and emigration.  The 1991 budget made no provision to meet that challenge.  It was regrettable to hear the Minister for Finance saying that the Government had no direct responsibility for job creation.  He said the Government's responsibility rested with creating an industrial climate that would provide an attractive basis for private investment on which job creation totally depended.</P>
      <P>This is not the first time such utterances came from a Minister for Finance.  We have heard it from Ministers in different Governments.  The reality is that year after year we have an abnormally high level of unemployment and added to that an abnormally high level of emigration of our best and brightest people.  Leaving politics aside and acknowledging the reality of that situation and its impact on our community and our economy, is it not time for a new, broader and bolder outlook on this cancer in our society that is robbing it and has robbed it down the years since we established native government 70 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are unique today in the EC as regards the percentage of our population who are in employment, but above all <Col N="246" /> as regards the numbers emigrating year after year.  It is time we asked ourselves if the policies we have been pursuing during all those years have worked in fulfilling our aspirations for full employment in an Irish economy, even with a small population.  There are 230,000 people on the live register plus 30,000 to 40,000 emigrating.  That is frightening for a community who have had control of their own destiny for 70 years.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Government should at this stage critically and closely examine the strategies we have been pursuing.  I am not saying this with any condemnation of the IDA or any other body.  I know how dedicated and committed the IDA are and I know they work extremely hard, but all of us as public representatives will have to make an assessment on our present position.  Millions of pounds in grants have been paid to industrialists as incentives to create employment, but regrettably we have to accept that it has not worked.  It is on that basis that I am appealing to the Government tonight to give recognition to the magnitude of the unemployment and emigration problems. This is the greatest challenge that ever faced an Irish Government.  I would strongly urge them to see what steps can be taken as a matter of urgency, whether it be an overhauling of the existing strategies in the IDA, CTT or whatever.  I do not think the Irish people are concerned about what the strategies are once they succeed in creating employment.</P>
    <P>Many people who are conversant with rural Ireland today can see the total decimation of many rural parishes.  This year is national census year and when the results of that census are revealed and the current level of population is compared with that which existed some years ago it will create a shock throughout rural Ireland.  There is need here for a total rethink.  County councils and public bodies could give deserving and productive work to thousands of people in the morning if a means could be found. They have jobs on hand and there is every opportunity to employ more people.  This is the angle at which the Government <Col N="247" /> must look in tackling this greatest problem that ever faced Irish people.  If we put people into employment they will be paying tax and relieving the Department of Social Welfare of a massive amount of money which is paid out every week, without even providing the recipients with a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with the chaotic situation in the health services.  Every person in public life is aware of the very serious shortcomings in the current level of health services.  On tonight's news I heard that two nursing organisations as well as a medical organisation, people who are not involved in politics but in giving a service to patients, are calling on the Government to take some steps to improve the treatment of patients.  There are long delays in admissions to hospitals and early discharges.  In the general operation of the service &mdash; I come from an area that has been particularly badly hit &mdash; terminally ill patients frequently have to travel over 100 miles to hospitals.  They are denied transport and in many cases they have not the wherewithal to pay for a taxi.  Some of those people have denied themselves treatment no matter how necessary it was because they have not the resources to get it.  Fiscal rectitude and balancing the books is all right, but it is on the backs of the people in the poorest circumstances, the people in the most remote areas, that the burden has fallen.</P>
    <P>People who have the resources and have access to private hospitals experience very few problems.  They are treated overnight.  General practitioners tell people who are treated under the national health service, people who should be provided with a reasonable service to go privately if possible because otherwise they cannot be guaranteed a bed, and that is a sad situation.</P>
    <P>I put down a question to the Minister for Education last week on school dental services.  I come from an urban area with 1,200 primary school children.  Since 1977 there has been no school dental examination in that area.  Unfortunate parents have to borrow money from credit unions <Col N="248" /> and lending agencies in order to treat their children's teeth.  Nobody should be put in this position.  The assessment for medical cards is rigidly adhered to.  In my county there are 3,500 more people with medical cards now than there were two years ago.  Regrettably, many of those people had the facility of a medical card over a protracted period and their whole economy was built round that type of medical service.  They have now been taken from them.</P>
    <P>Housing is a particularly difficult problem and, as Deputy Andrews said, we are all anxiously awaiting what the Minister for the Environment will reveal tomorrow. I represent a rural constituency and agriculture is in confusion which arises from a variety of statements and leaks in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy.  Commissioner MacSharry, in exposing his negotiating hand six months before the bargaining commenced, certainly weakened his own position.  Were it not for the strength of the Germans and the French in radically adhering to their position, perhaps the full extent of the cutbacks would not be known.  The position of the small farmer is particularly difficult and, unless positive action is taken now for farmers under the 30,000 milk quota, rural Ireland will become a forest and there will not be any dairying. It will not be possible, if there is a further reduction in milk quotas, for farmers to make any semblance of a viable living. That would be a tragedy for rural Ireland because it would distort the whole social fabric that has been built round the small farming community in regard to schools, churches, voluntary and sporting organisations and so on.  This diminution in income and security in relation to small farmers will create a major social change. Now is the time to say that from the social aspect &mdash; as well as from that of the population &mdash; that community must be retained.  There must be a basis for the viability of such an energetic community.</P>
    <P>There are talks of changes in the production of goats, greyhounds, rabbits, deer and racehorses.  The cow is the wealth of the small farmer in the west <Col N="249" /> and there is no substitute.  It is gimmickry to think that substitute can be introduced, as mentioned by the Minister for Agriculture.  These are not viable and will not attract the attention of the small farmer because he cannot be converted to that kind of life.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me time to speak.  I hope that in the serious matters of employment, health, housing and agriculture, the Government are conscious of the real problems.  That is my purpose in expressing my views here and I do not get any pleasure from doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Moynihan for his observations on the budget.  As usual he expressed himself well and there is very little with which one could disagree in his speech.  However, I should like to make an observation or two.  When the health problems were at their most severe there was a Labour Minister in office, Deputy Desmond.  The problems have not really changed since he held office.  There are the same pressures on the public purse and demands for more &mdash; and better &mdash; health services or, perhaps more correctly, demands for services to alleviate sickness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan also made the point that we have been in control of our own destinies for 70 years.  I do not think that will stand up now.  John Donne said that no man is an island, he is part of the mainland.  We have been part of mainland Europe, for better or for worse, since 1973 or thereabouts and, in this context, I should like to look at the background which shaped and controlled our budget and which will shape and control budgets for the rest of the century.  The most recent was the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which is a strategy worked out between the Government and social partners, unions, farmers, employers, and so on, covering most fields of industrial and social endeavour.  It tries to reach common ground and to hammer out common aims between all the partners in Irish life.  It <Col N="250" /> does not seek to exclude anybody and to be, in as far as possible, all embracing.</P>
    <P>Why am I speaking on the budget when the parameters have already been laid down for as far into the future as we can see?  Now that the major partners have agreed a programme, Deputies will have to be more wary and questioning in relation to these parameters.  They must ensure that those without a voice, who are not members of the great social groupings, are not ignored, left out or hurt in this movement towards underpinning social progress with economic stability.  It is in this Chamber that these items should be teased out.</P>
    <P>All the parties who were privy to the programme represented sectional interests and they brought their own from of tunnel vision to the negotiations.  In framing the budget the Minister for Finance also had to bear in mind what effect events in the Gulf will have on economic and social life in Ireland over the next few years because it now looks as if this war will last at least until the end of the year, with horrendous economic effects on us.  It will push up the price of oil with downstream effects on our economic competitiveness, not to mention the social dislocation of innocent people who are not participants in the war.  They do not own oil wells and are not arms manufacturers, they are men and women trying to raise and educate their families along the Arabian peninsula because it is now evident that the war has spread from Iraq and Kuwait and that the surrounding countries, to a greater or lesser extent, are involved.  They have to pick up the tab for the social dislocation; over one million refugees have had to flee Kuwait and Iraq.</P>
    <P>Tonight we discussed a Bill regarding foreign adoptions and I am sure its author was thinking in the context of Romanian adoptions as a result of the upheavals there in the last 12 months.  In framing the Bill we must be careful to ensure that it applies broadly across the board because there will be major social dislocation and many more orphans in the Middle East.  We, as a nation and a member of the European Community, <Col N="251" /> will be involved financially, if no other way, in helping to clear up the mess after the war.</P>
    <P>Another factor which must have played on the mind of the Minister for Finance was the developments in Eastern Europe over the last 18 months.  I refer specifically to East Germany whose reunification with West Germany and absorption into the European Community has caused major financial problems for the Bundesbank and, by extension, for us.  Our inflation rate of 2.7 per cent is one of the lowest in the European Community &mdash; it stood at 4.7 per cent in November 1990 &mdash; whereas the UK inflation rate is 9.7 per cent. However, our interest rate stands, on average, at 11.25 per cent mainly because of the large demand for money in Germany for the reconstruction of East Germany. We are all paying for this if not at first hand, by extension at second hand.</P>
    <P>In the context of what Deputy Moynihan had to say on farm incomes, we should bear in mind the release into the Common Agricultural Policy system of the huge German agricultural land bank, as East Germany was the bread basket for Germany as a whole prior to its division into eastern and western zones.  We are talking here about farms of 2,000 to 3,000 hectares, with downstream manufacturing industries, not all of which are efficient &mdash; very few of them are &mdash; but during the next few years they will gear up and be a source of concern for our small 40, 50 and 60 acre family farms which support either one or two families. It is in this context that we have to consider the MacSharry proposals for a restructuring the Common Agricultural Policy which are designed to support family farms as we know them in Ireland. Rather than attacking the commissioner in Europe and the Minister at home, farming organisations such as Macra na Feirme, the ICMSA and the United Farmers Association should get together to see how these proposals can be implemented without doing too much damage to the infrastructure of our family farms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> I should also say in regard to the entry of East Germany to the farming community of the EC, that we must look at the Sugar Bill, the Second Stage of which is being debated in the House.  I do not know what name has been thought up for the new phoenix which will rise from the ashes of Comhlacht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta, but when it is up and running it will find that it is a minnow in a very large pool.  As I understand it, the food retailing sector in Europe is controlled by about five major players most of whom do not have the marketing strength of the major American players.  It is in this context that we will have to consider the way in which we structure the Sugar Company and help it to develop.</P>
    <P>Aontáim leis an Teachta Andrews in a ghlaoch go ndéanfaí leathnú agus forbairt ar an chóras coiste atá againn i dTeach Laighean.  I had the honour to serve as a chairman of the Special Committee on the Child Care Bill and learned just how effective this House can be.  Under the committee system, people who held different political views sat down together, and with goodwill and without relinquishing any of their principles, hammered out a Bill for the benefit of the children of Ireland who are under threat.</P>
    <P>I would like to join other Members of the House in calling for the building of further low cost housing, particularly in my own constituency. However we should avoid the temptation to build huge estates similar to the ones built in the fifties and sixties with all their attendant social and economic problems and which have cost the people living and working in them dear while providing good and adequate housing.  When planning these estates we did not look far enough down the road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to address the budget which was presented in the House on 30 January. It is true to say that few, if any events of less significance have occurred in this House for a considerable period of time.  As we are all aware, the agreement which had been signed the previous week with the social partners indicated what <Col N="253" /> would be contained in the budget.  There was a time when the unemployed, the income tax payer, the VAT payer and so many others expressed concern and apprehension about whether the rates of income tax would be reduced, but that did not happen on this occasion because the decisions were taken outside of the House.</P>
      <P>Despite this, it is important and appropriate that we look at our constituencies and the country as a whole to see in what direction we are travelling. Above all else, one should speak about one's own constituency.  I speak for Cork Noth West which I have represented for almost ten years.  I have never witnessed there such a lack of confidence in all that time and I say that with regret.  It is a rural constituency containing a substantial number of farmers who in many cases are without hope at this time.  The GATT talks were bad enough, when Commissioner MacSharry proposed reductions of 30 per cent, but in addition to that he spoke about substantial cutbacks in milk, beef and cereal prices and in milk quotas, which for many people was the final straw.  Then last week the Minister for Agriculture and Food who had indicated that he would reluctantly have to oppose these proposals, informed the United Farmers' Association that he found them to be quite satisfactory.  Is it any wonder that the farmers are confused and bewildered and have no confidence when the Minister for Agriculture and Food does not know where he is going and has no sense of direction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One statement the Minister made about ten days ago caught the eye of many people.  He suggested to farmers, with perhaps 10,000, 15,000 or 20,000 gallons quotas, a wife and two or three children as well as substantial debts that they should provide bed and breakfast and breed greyhounds and rabbits, but that was fairly hollow and one could laugh at it were it not so frightfully serious. More and more of these people are coming to my office and my clinics and I am sure every Deputy in this House has the same experience.  These people are looking for a sense of direction, for some <Col N="254" /> confidence, for any ray of hope.  They are certainly not getting it now from the Government.</P>
    <P>In my area in the past 12 months unemployment rose by 11 per cent.  I know practically every house in my constituency and I am aware of the haemorrhage of emigration, its causes and consequences.  If the emigration figures were added to the unemployment figures the increase would be about 20 per cent over the past 12 months.  Is it not tragic? Parents come to our clinics asking whether there is any hope of getting a job for their son or daughter, John or Mary or whoever.  In Charleville there is a vacancy for a librarian to do part-time work and my information is that in the region of 120 applicants are hoping to get the job. Imagine the disappointment of 119, their last ray of hope gone, the last straw. In my town of Kanturk a factory which employs 66 people let 60 workers go a fortnight ago.  The management and staff worked hard over a number of years to keep that factory in production.  There was no Minister there for the closure although there were plenty of them there for the opening.  It is all very well to say the IDA will treat the area as a black spot.  The IDA will say they will give it priority but we hear that every second day from the IDA and it is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan touched on something very close to my heart tonight when he spoke about the strategy and policy of the IDA.  Perhaps it is time local authorities, and the IDA, became more closely involved.  I have lost faith in the IDA.  Speakers from the Government side tonight spoke about the IDA and jobs but they were not speaking about rural Ireland.  They spoke about centres of population.  In Cork city, and its environs, the IDA now are employing contractors to build advance factories and my information is they are paying the contractors rent for the factories until they are utilised.  Some months ago a term used regularly in this House by the Minister for Justice and Communications was, &ldquo;a level playing field&rdquo;.  While such factories are being built within the <Col N="255" /> environs of our cities and not in rural areas or country towns such as Kanturk, Charleville or Newmarket we do not have a level playing field.</P>
    <P>Unless Cork city and county get representation in the Cabinet, until we have power at the Cabinet table, we cannot expect very much.  A Fianna Fáil corporation member asked some time ago what the people of Cork city and county expected when they did not vote for Fianna Fáil.  I suggest we are getting absolute contempt from the Government.  I do not say that lightly but it proves to me that either the Taoiseach has not faith in the Fianna Fáil Deputies in Cotk city and county or he has no respect for the people there.  Perhaps the day will come when his eyes will be opened and he will have to face the music on that issue.</P>
    <P>In the last week we have had statements and policy document from An Post.  I do not want to raise this issue again but it affects rural areas to a degree few people realise and people who do not know rural areas will have no idea of its consequences.  Imagine the position of elderly people who see the postman two or three times a day, he is really the only comfort and company they have.  Imagine the person living out on the mountain far away from post offices travelling nine or ten miles to collect his pension.  That is a frightening thought for an elderly man who has no mode of transport and no friends.  It has been brought to my attention that any youngster can put his hand into the post boxes which have been used so extensively in the last couple of years and take out what is inside.  That is an indication of what An Post think of rural people.</P>
    <P>In the past two years we have seen the abuse of lottery funds.  In north Cork we were expecting in the region of £300,000 from the lottery and we got the grand total of £45,000 for groups who have worked hard and spent a tremendous amount of time and money developing community centres, parks and so on. They have been treated with total contempt by the Minister in charge of the lottery funds.  I regret that; it is wrong. <Col N="256" /> Until we make sure that money is distributed fairly and evenly any faith the public have in the lottery funds and the Minister of the day will diminish.</P>
    <P>After all that a 6 per cent increase in crime in rural areas was announced today.  It is time the Government shouted &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.  It is time they said that this cannot continue.  If they think it can then they are in for a rude awakening.  The Minister for Communications, Deputy Brennan, announced today that he was asking An Post to defer their proposals to close post offices and the cutbacks in general.  I suggest the only reason he has done that is to put back the evil day until after the local elections.  If that is his view, and the view of the Government, then Fianna Fáil may well pay a terrible price in the local elections.  The views I have expressed are sincerely held and they concern all the people I represent, the people in rural areas without hope. They are entitled to better than they are getting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his budget.  It represents a continuation of the progress set in train in 1987. Not only does it continue to prepare us for 1993, it sets out to deal with many anomalies.  The Minister has given special attention to the old and disadvantaged and to tax adjustments.  With careful management the Government have brought the country's finances under control and have managed to hold our inflation rate at the record low level of 2.7 per cent.  It is important that the confidence built up over the last number of years be maintained.  Job creation has been and must continue to be a top priority of Government especially with the slowing down of the British and United States economies leading to many of our emigrants returning home, in turn, placing a very severe strain not alone on finance for social welfare and health schemes but also for the provision of housing.  A few years ago there was adequate housing accommodation in many areas and, in some areas very few on local authority housing waiting lists.  That scene is changing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> The agricultural sector has been looked to to provide jobs.  As the outcome of the present GATT talks will determine agricultural policy in future years, it is an opportune time for us to examine our performance at EC level.  The two areas of production most in surplus are our two main sources &mdash; beef and milk.  I would like to give a small illustration with regard to each.  At present we are placing 90 per cent of our kill of prime quality steer beef in intervention.  An exporter, when interviewed at the green week in Germany in January, stated there was a good demand in Germany for that type of beef but he was unable to compete with intervention prices.  In the seventies we exported 40,000 tonnes of beef annually to Germany which figure has now fallen to 12,500 tonnes.  While many outlets have been closed as a result of the conflict in the Gulf, we must engage in a more aggressive sales campaign to ensure there is less use made of intervention.</P>
    <P>In the milk sector major co-operatives are competing with one another in the production of dairy spreads for the home and export markets while intervention stocks of butter stand at between 250,000 and 300,000 tonnes.  Our EC partners, especially France and Germany, have discouraged the manufacture of dairy spreads in an attempt to save the butter market.  It must have been ironic for them to observe a major Irish co-operative promote dairy spreads during the green week in Germany.  It is my belief that the co-operatives who are displacing butter fat in the market-place with imported vegetable oil dairy spreads should not have unrestricted access to intervention for the butter they are displacing.  I would appeal to the Minister to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>In contrast, we have the poultry industry in respect of which we are appealing in this House some eight or ten years ago seeking protection against unfair competition from imports.  At that stage we claimed that it was tantamount to dumping the produce.  Ten years later we have producers within that industry with massive investments not receiving a penny of assistance from either the national <Col N="258" /> Government or the EC for their development by way of housing or equipment. We must remember that they have built up the industry to a £300 million turnover annually, employing directly 3,500 people and indirectly another 6,000 with an export market of £40 million covering a wide range of poultry-based products. That industry has grown rapidly, has changed from having been a net importer to being a net exporter.  Seventy five per cent of the national poultry and egg production is located in my constituency. There are employed in the processing plants alone &mdash; apart from the production end &mdash; approximately 100,000.  The previous speaker claimed there were no alternatives.  I contend there are alternatives if we look hard enough for them. We had that alternative in the poultry industry and a similar one in the mushroom industry, employing upwards of 1,000 people.  In many such circumstances it is a case of necessity being the mother of invention.</P>
    <P>In his Budget Statement the Minister announced more flexibility in the conditions under which the young farmers' installation aid scheme will apply.  This is something Macra na Feirme and many rural Deputies have been advocating for a long time, which will ensure that more young farmers will qualify under its broadened scope.  The Minister has provided a sum of £600,000 this year which will amount to £1 million in a full year. This flexibility should influence many parents to pass on their holdings to young members of their families.  In the case of such younger members it is essential that they have obtained their leaving certificate so that they will be well qualified and competent to run their farms in a business-like basis.</P>
    <P>With the severe restriction on beef and milk production there will have to be a serious look taken at any alternative enterprise that might help maintain our rural population.  In that respect I welcome also the additional aid recently announced for the mushroom and potato industries by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Kirk.  A survey undertaken since <Col N="259" /> shows that there is a market for potatoes in Sweden, North Africa and the Canary Islands, for varieties with a high cropping rate, suitable for Irish soils, varieties which have been grown extensively here over the past 25 years.  In line with that we import £5 million worth of grass seed annually.  Grass seed is very suitable as a follow-on crop to potatoes.  Here I might congratulate Bord Glas on their performance and the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, who have been so successful in reducing fruit, vegetable and potato imports.  I have no doubt but that they will continue their efforts and provide many jobs.  Indeed, our importing potatoes and vegetables over the years was nothing short of tragic.  Yet, when Bord Glas was established under the aegis of an active, energetic Minister we observed how he could turn the tables within a very short period.</P>
    <P>Now that there are a number of spheres of joint funding between the EC and national Governments I would appeal to the Minister for Finance to adopt a well structured approach in co-ordinating the various programmes so that we can derive the maximum benefit therefrom. For example, there was the recent rural development programme announced by Commissioner MacSharry, the INTERREG Fund for Border counties and the International Fund for Ireland also applicable to that region.  While it is accepted that the Department of Finance must have overall responsibility for the schemes selected and financed, I would appeal for more flexibility so that such schemes would reflect the needs of the various regions allowing local democracy a real opportunity.  It is all very fine contending that groups could draw up their proposals or write their agendas with regard to such schemes but invariably things do not work out that way.  When such schemes come into operation we discover that the flexibility about which we are told in advance does not materialise, very annoying to their participants.</P>
    <P>While the International Fund for Ireland is comprised of an independent board who initially talked of supporting <Col N="260" /> job creation and private enterprise projects to date that has not been how they have operated.  An examination of their annual report for 1990 demonstrates that, in respect of the southern Border counties, a substantial amount of the take-up went to urban councils for urban renewal, support for hotels in the provision of swimming pols and amenities and some other minor allocations with little recognition being given to individual projects in respect of which applications were submitted.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the removal of the tax anomaly with regard to cross-Border workers because, to date, people employed in Northern Ireland &mdash; born and residing in the South, working in the North &mdash; were not eligible for the PAYE allowance while a person born in Northern Ireland, working in Northern Ireland and living in the South, qualified.  That serious anomaly was rectified by the Minister.</P>
    <P>On many occasions I advocated import substitution.  Recently on examining an empty domestic gas cylinder to find out where it was manufactured, I found only a number stamped on it but on making further inquiries I discovered it had been imported.  I checked with the Central Statistics Office and found that in 1990 2,314 tonnes of cylinders valued at over £3 million were imported.  This would represent more than 200,000 gas cylinders. Jobs could be provided here making those cylinders because it would not involve high technology skills, but mostly welding and turning.  I discussed this with a number of engineers in my constituency. There is a manufacturer of pressure container vessels in Clones who is manufacturing some of the world's best upmarket stainless steel Claddagh tanks which cost £25,000 to £35,000 each.  They employ about 130 workers and turn out ten to 12 of those tanks per week.  Despite that industry we have the unnecessary importation of gas cylinders.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce in reply to a question said he understood that imports of gas cylinders during 1990 were exceptional due to the setting up of a new distribution company and that it seemed <Col N="261" /> doubtful whether normal domestic demand alone would be adequate to justify the large capital investment.  I am informed that there would not be large capital investment as the equipment required for this work is available in many areas.  This is one area in which we should have import substitution and the.  IDA should monitor this type of thing and should alert engineering firms to the possibilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his budget referred to social housing and said that there would be an increased demand here.  The Minister referred to a rental subsidy scheme for voluntary housing and shared ownership for low income house purchase. This would be of great help to many young people who wish to own their own homes.  The Minister also gave an allowance for people leaving local authority housing to erect their own houses.  I ask him to reintroduce the house improvement grant scheme now that the inspections for the 1985 scheme are almost completed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the continued reduction in the tax bands and the Minister's commitment to reaching a 25 per cent standard rate by 1993.  This could not have been contemplated five, six or seven years ago.  I have no doubt the Minister will reach his goal.</P>
    <P>In relation to job creation, the Minister should look at afforestation.  Private afforestation has been very successful. There is a lot of mature timber coming on stream.  At present the IDA will not grant aid any small timber based projects for debarking and treating wood.  They should re-examine that attitude especially in a region like mine where there is a reasonably substantial amount of mature timber which is going to Northern Ireland to be processed.</P>

      <P>At this stage in the budget debate since most of the points have been made, Deputies use this debate to refer to constituency matters which they cannot discuss in the Dáil during the year.  My speech will probably be on those lines and I would ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to bear with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> I noted the Minister's comments at the start of his budget speech.  He said that this year television was bringing his budget address quite literally home to the people for the first time.  Certainly, the Minister achieved this end.  His performance on the television screen was similar to a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production directed by John Huston or an Abbey Theatre performance directed by one of the excellent Abbey directors who ensure that performances are well rehearsed.  However, his performance finished there.</P>
    <P>Once again I had to sit on this side of the House and watch an act of financial terrorism being perpetrated against the Irish people.  I had about a week to study its effects on my constituents and they are nothing short of horrendous.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave two examples of the combined effect of the exemption limit and the FIS changes.  A married employee with two children gains £9 per week and a married employee with three children gains £12 a week.  These increases will be offset by the 2½ per cent rise in VAT on heating, clothes and shoes which comes into effect on 1 March.  This is a farce; it is an insult to the intelligence of my constituents, especially those who are long term unemployed and who instead of gaining, will lose because their paltry increase does not take effect until late July, just in time for them to pay back the money lender, and then they will have to renew their loans in order to pay for school uniforms and books in our so called free education system.</P>
    <P>I will give an idea of the public perception that may be abroad when people look at the £10,000 given in the budget to the Connemara Pony Society in the Minister's constituency.  The people who run the society are excellent; they probably meet 12 times a year and arrange to have their annual show which I know is a success and arrange to have a Minister on hand to present the prizes which this £10,000 will buy.  The Minister from the area will probably present the prizes, and if it is a Fianna Fáil Minister, the Progressive Democrats might object and perhaps Minister Molloy would like to <Col N="263" /> present the prizes.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will agree, in our constituency we have people who have ponies &mdash; in Ballymun and Finglas &mdash; who would like something from the budget to run their pony clubs, as would pony clubs in Howth and Baldoyle.  The perception in the constituencies on the north side of Dublin is that the Government do not care about them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has generously allocated £1 million to Bord Fáilte for marketing and promotion in 1991.  I offer my condolences to Board Fáilte.  They are being asked to market a product which year by year becomes even more hopeless.  Let me give an example.  Dublin Bay has a serious problem with pollution and it is imperative that we cease dumping raw sewage in the bay in order to bring an end to an intolerable problem which is worthy of the Middle Ages.  The European Community plan to ban dumping of raw sewage at sea and published a report recently which stated that towns with a population of 10,000 or more should have a secondary or biological treatment plant for sewage before it is discharged into receiving waters.  More stringent treatment will be required in cases where water quality is a problem.  We have that problem in Dublin Bay.  At present most of the Dublin sewage is processed at the corporation's treatment plant at Ringsend. This is only a primary treatment facility which merely separates the solids from the liquids.  It has been estimated that the cost of upgrading this facility to a full treatment works would be in the region of £45 million.</P>
    <P>On the far side of the bay at the Nose of Howth the North Dublin Drainage scheme empties totally untreated raw sewage directly into the Irish Sea beside Howth Harbour.  This scheme, which starts at Finglas and serves all the large housing estates, factories and hospitals on the north side of Dublin, discharges all this raw sewage into the receiving waters at Howth.  The tidal pattern in the outer bay is very dynamic and the dumped material is spread over a wide area.  This has caused serious damage to <Col N="264" /> fish life and over the past few years raw sewage has ended up on such beaches as Portmarnock, Dollymount, Portrane, Donabate, Sutton and all the beaches on the east coast.  This must surely be a danger to our citizens' health and will certainly deter tourists from using our beaches.  Fishermen at Howth tell us that the best herring spawning grounds in the world are just off Howth and they are being completely destroyed.  The day of the famous Howth herring has long since passed.</P>
    <P>Because of certain easterly tides raw sewage also finds its way to the famous Blue Lagoon.  This is the strip of water between Clontarf and Sutton which forms a very nice view with the Howth peninsula in the background.  It is silting up very fast because there is a causeway which is preventing the scouring of the inner estuary.  On several occasions when I was a member of Dublin Corporation I put down motions calling for the causeway to be breached to allow a scouring process to take place.  My constituency has since been changed to the county council area and I am now a member of the county council.  I have asked for action within the council chamber but this has been ignored.  I will be taking up the matter with the Minister for the Environment.  One could take a walk from the middle of Dublin city along the seashore to Howth but the wonderful walks there and in the Howth Peninsula are ruined.  There is an obnoxious smell from time to time due to the silting of the estuary.  It certainly deters tourists.</P>
    <P>The European Community have a system of blue flag awards for clean beaches.  In 1989, 49 Irish beaches sought this award but only 35 were selected. Only five of the nine beaches entered by Dublin County Council won a blue flag. Dublin Corporation did not enter the competition.  The beaches were judged on water quality, beach quality, management, environmental, education and information aspects.  The problem with Dublin beaches certainly accounted for the poor showing, mainly because of sewage outflows and litter.  It should be our ambition by the early nineties that all <Col N="265" /> our beaches should attain the EC blue flag standard.  We should clean up and make our beaches environmentally sound.</P>
    <P>The pollution of our rivers seems to have grabbed the headlines in recent years.  Our rivers are used by anglers from abroad who are an excellent source of revenue.  However, there is a danger that we may lose this wonderful facility because of pollution.  Most of that pollution is effluent from the agricultural sector.  I understand that the effluent from agriculture is ten times the amount produced by the urban sector.  The discharge of effluent into our rivers is caused by a minority of irresponsible farmers.  I understand that slurry is 100 times and silage 200 times more pollutant than ordinary domestic sewage.</P>
    <P>Let me now outline to the Minister an accurate cause history which typifies a growing trend in Irish society.  I had occasion to meet at my advice centre a married couple with one child who were earning £16,000 a year.  They stand to gain the princely sum of £11.80 per month according to the Minister's budget speech.  Perhaps I should advise them to save and invest in a new car or possibly a child minder in order to allow the wife to return to work to supplement their income.  Car tax is up by 10 per cent.  That takes care of the first payment of £11.80. I have been informed that insurance companies are loading people in the 25 to 29 age group by an extra 40 per cent.  They would have to rethink about the new car and consider the viability of the old.  If they were considering buying for the first time they would have to do without.  The cost of their clothing and shoes is about to spiral.  The necessities of life are becoming a luxury.  Their heating bills will also increase.  At this stage we are beyond looking at investment and wondering how this family can budget to maintain their standard of living while raising and educating a child.  Their spending power and the incentive to work are dwindling very fast.  There are no gains for them and this case history would be representative of a large proportion in society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> Another great problem in my constituency is housing.  There are approximately 5,000 people on Dublin Corporation's housing list and probably another 4,000 or 5,000 on the transfer list.  We should at this stage declare a housing crisis in Dublin.  Dublin County Council, of which I am a member, has a housing list which is extending daily. Neither body has built a houses to mention during the past three or four years.  I note the Minister has stated that he will be introducing measures tomorrow to overcome this problem.  Among those measures I think the may introduce a grant whereby a council or corporation tenant may surrender the house and buy another house.</P>
    <P>That scheme was introduced by Fine Gael and Labour while in Government some years ago.  It worked in some cases but I caution the Minister to be very careful.  This grant led to the break up of some excellent estates.  The grants were mainly taken up by people who were the leaders in their community and they bought houses elsewhere.  These communities were left without leadership because the best people had gone.  Some of the estates on the north side of the city were decimated.  Some good communities lost their best people.  I would ask the Minister to consider this. However, he will have to address the problem of housing in Dublin.  People are coming to us at advice centres who are living with parents in over-crowded and unhealthy conditions.  Something will have to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Over a period of years the budget has lost a lot of its significance and impact on budget day.  The primary reason is that much of the information is known well in advance of that day.  Due to the commendable exercise by the Government in introducing the Estimates, usually in October, people can easily work out the changes, which should be made in the budget.  Before every budget practically all of it is published in the newspapers.  For a number of years <Col N="267" /> the budget has not contained any surprises. I suppose the Minister can congratulate himself on striking the right balance.  Some commentators said the budget was too cautious; others said it was too dangerous.  If he went independent he probably took the right course, since there were so many differing opinions.</P>
      <P>I have what is probably an old-fashioned view about what a budget should be.  We will have to get back to a stage of having what I call a barrier in regard to current budget deficits.  Prior to 1972 it was believed that one had to balance one's current expenditure against one's current income.  During the recession in the seventies caused by the oil crisis it was felt that one could not possibly operate within balanced budgets. The underlying theory was that in times of recession one pumped more money into the economy by taking less taxation or borrowing more.  That was always meant to be a short term measure, but like most short term measures in politics it assumed a life of its own and we have not had a balanced current budget now for nearly 20 years.</P>
      <P>Since 1987 this Government have been very successful in getting the total Exchequer borrowing requirement down, and more important, in coming near having a balanced budget again.  If the progress of the past few years was to be maintained I thought 1991 would likely to be the year we would have no current budget deficit.  That is important for all kinds of reasons but mainly for psychological reasons.  When a Government once reaches a stage of having a balanced current budget, it will be politically impossible for future Ministers for Finance to ever again go down the road of having unbalanced current budgets. Perhaps in 1992, but certainly in 1993, I hope this Minister for Finance will achieve that aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past few years under various Governments we had programmes for wiping out the current budget deficit in five years or three years or whatever, but the situation got worse.  I am hoping the <Col N="268" /> Minister will be able to maintain the progress of 1987, 1988 and 1989 so that this psychological barrier will be put up and it will be impossible to breach it again. What has happened over the past 15 years or so is that the discipline of balancing the budget has not been imposed and that is one of the main reasons we have had such financial disaster over a long period. I would hate to think we were heading down that road again.</P>
    <P>As public sector pay makes up a large part of Government spending, commentators are right to make the point that, with some special increases and with the proposed agreement, public sector pay will cost the State considerably more than last year.  It is also fair for commentators to point out that for the first time in three years current spending has increased in real terms.  The Minister will have to do a miraculous job if the outturn for this year is to be an Exchequer borrowing requirement roughly in line with last year's because there are many hang-over effects from previous agreements that the Minister had to take on board. However, if it turns out that we are not going to hit the target set in the budget, I would see nothing wrong with the Minister coming back to the House later in the year and introducing a mini-budget. We should learn from our mistakes.  I may not have learned much from my mistakes, but I think in some respects I have, and any Government must take cognisance of mistakes that were made in the past.  There was nothing wrong initially with trying this policy of over-spending, of trying to buy our way out of recession.  However, it did not work and we should not go down that road again.</P>
    <P>The reason we cannot give all people very high social welfare increases, have an educational system <i>par excellence</i> and solve the health problems so that there would be no protests in any of the health boards, is that we have to keep some semblance of order in the public finances. I believe in the simple equation in regard to the budget.  If the Government want to spend a certain amount of money on current services they should be prepared to match that with increases in taxation. <Col N="269" /> It is only a short term expedient measure to do anything else.  It would be wrong to tie the hands of any Government and force them to do this on all occasions, but we must learn something from the mistakes we made over the last 15 years. The principal mistake has been that as political parties of various hues we were not prepared to impose that discipline on ourselves because it is unpopular with voters.  We are all subject to the whims of the electorate and successive Governments have not been prepared to bite the bullet.</P>
    <P>Most people favour lower tax rates and so do I, do not believe in having lower tax rates if the result is to put the finances of the country totally askew.  I have heard no debate in this House and very little outside it about either 25 per cent or 45 per cent tax rates.  The idea of tax is to collect sufficient money for the State to enable it to provide a certain level of services and to redistribute income.</P>
    <P>Since 1989, in particular, we seem hell bent on achieving a particular target as far as tax rates are concerned, regardless of the cost.  That is a foolish policy, whether it is proposed by Progressive Democrats or Fianna Fáil.  It may be electorally sound in order to get votes but it is nonsensical to decide to bring down the tax rates every year in order to arrive at a particular target.  Yet all parties in the House have swallowed this particular fish.  We are all in favour of it because to be against it would be like being against sanctifying grace, and no one is prepared to be against that.  I have to congratulate the Minister because, under very severe pressure, he held out against both political parties, probably his own colleagues in Cabinet from all sides, and implemented a very minor reduction in tax.  I would have seen nothing wrong in the Minister saying that this year there would be no income tax reductions because we just cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>I did not count how many times the <i>Programme for Economic and Social</i><Col N="270" /><i>Progress</i> was referred to &mdash; I would say it was referred to about 100 times.  I am one of those who have reservations about this programme.  I am not against a Government entering into national wage agreements.  The last programme worked very well and it is hard to knock something when it is successful.  However, if everything is to be decided among the social partners, the employers, the trade unions and the Government, when the logical conclusion is that people should not bother to go and vote in an election but should join their local trade union or their local employers' organisations because that is where they will get the job done.</P>
    <P>It is unpopular to say that particularly when the programme has worked well, but I think it is important to put on the record that while I welcome the great strengths of the last programme and what it achieved &mdash; it was partly the reason this country has done so well in the past years &mdash; I would not welcome having everything decided by the social partners. There is an ethical concept about that which does not ring true to me.  Given that that is what we have &mdash; and I wish this programme as much success as the last one &mdash; I must enter some caveats about the new programme as it affects budgetary matters.  In this programme we have entered into commitments on health, education and a wide range of public affairs over a period of years.  All of these will cost the State a considerable amount of money in the future.  I am also aware that when the Taoiseach was announcing the programme he said that it was totally dependent on our achieving the levels of growth in the programme and if we did not, what was projected would not go ahead.  I am long enough in politics to know that that may not necessarily be the case.  I also remember a very famous document known as the 1977 Fianna Fáil Manifesto.  While I have been portrayed as having been critical of that particular programme, and I was, there was nothing inherently wrong with <Col N="271" /> it if one thing was matched against the other.  The goodies that were given away in that manifesto were to be matched by certain levels of growth and employment. What that proves is that we will be committed to implementing the goodies of the programme, as we were in 1977, but the nearer it comes to an election &mdash; no matter what party is in power &mdash; no one will be too anxious to say at that time that we have not achieved the levels of growth and therefore we will not go ahead with the goodies.  I know that will not happen, so I hope that if we do not achieve the levels of growth as forecast &mdash; and there are considerable doubts about the world economy &mdash; the Government will be strong enough to say that the commitments in the programme were dependent on these factors and we now cannot go ahead with them.  Politically, I hope I will live to see that day, because that is all right in my book but I have grave doubts about it.</P>
    <P>On budget night I was critical of the financial resolution on the business expansion scheme put before the House. I did much of my talking on that particular point on that evening before it had become the hullabaloo it has since become.  I honestly believe that the Minister should take some corrective measures in the Finance Bill, because he has cut off this scheme in mid division. The way the resolution was framed means that lots of good schemes that were going to go ahead will not now proceed.  I am not just talking about schemes in the hotel and tourism area.  I will give an example which has been drawn to my attention quite recently.  The owners of a factory in my constituency who have increased the numbers employed in the past three years, whereas the previous owners were going to close it down, have been in negotiation with the Revenue Commissioners since last October for an approved business expansion scheme.  It is totally a manufacturing industry and qualifies on all the <Col N="272" /> grounds, but now they will be caught under the capping proposals that the total amount of money raised must be £500,000.  This factory, which qualifies on all other grounds and is not asset backed and it complies with all the conditions, will be caught under the proposals put forward in the Financial Resolution on budget day.  I know there have been abuses of the business expansion scheme but, as I said so on budget night, we have taken out the slegehammer to crack a nut.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister sincerely on holding the line as best he could.  I wish him continued success in trying to sustain the line and I wish him the best of success the nearer it comes to an election in continuing to hold the barrier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of public perception, budget day is the most significant and important say in the political and economic life of the country.  Budget day, 1991, had the added significance of being the first budget speech to have been broadcast live to the nation.  Those who accept the traditional posturing of the Minister with his briefcase as a Santa Claus bag must have felt cheated and bored for 90 minutes at what turned out to be a non-budget.  It was an elaborate confidence trick played on a unsuspecting audience which failed to recognise the underlying problems in the Irish economy, namely, high unemployment and high personal taxation, both of which I believe are inextricably linked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance and his Government colleagues fail to recognise the underlying problems of the economy, then their budget cannot even begin to tackle those problems.  Budget day merely attempted to present in the most acceptable way possible policy decisions which had been entered into elsewhere. In the context of this budget, most of those policy decisions had been entered into in negotiations with the social partners in the new <i>Programme for Economic</i><Col N="273" /><i>and Social Progress</i> and in the publication of the Book of Estimates some months ago.</P>
    <P>My contribution tonight will attempt to extract from these areas some semblance of Government policy and highlight what I believe are its inadequacies and its failings.  We in Ireland have the highest levels of personal taxation on those who work and consequently we have the highest levels of unemployment as the incentive for hard work is rewarded by higher taxes.  In this scenario, the Government continue to tinker with the tax bands and tax brackets, which leaves nobody better off at the end of the week and condemns to the dole queues many of the brightest and best educated in our population and indeed condemns many of them to emigrate.  Surely the net benefit to the PAYE sector of reform of the tax system must mean more money in their pockets and this budget has failed to do that.  Others in the workforce realising that this Government placed little value on their labour saw there was admiration and greater remuneration for their talent in other countries and headed off.  It is this voluntary emigration which is the greatest indictment of this Government and makes them unworthy to continue to hold office.</P>
    <P>Lower taxation on job creation and on work will mean lower unemployment. Lower unemployment will remove the necessity for higher taxation, as much of the revenue which is collected is used to ensnare people in a continuous poverty trap which in many circumstances means that they are better off unemployed rather than taking up employment which will possibly reduce their entitlements to social benefits such as the medical card, rent reductions, etc.  That is the vicious cycle which this Government have failed to tackle in the budget.  While having the highest rates of personal taxation in Europe, our tax base is quite narrow, and there is a perception, which I share, that many of those who hold and generate great wealth do not pay their fair share <Col N="274" /> towards the cost of running the State. Their ingenuity is continually taxed in devising and exploiting tax avoidance schemes.  Some progress was made in the budget in this regard but much more needs to be done.  We need to cultivate an ethos here where the wealthy have a moral obligation to pay their fair share and lift from the shoulders of the working man the shackles of high taxation on his wages.</P>
    <P>The programme to instil that ethos needs to be enshrined in people from the first days of school and has to be continued throughout their lives. Obviously, as a nation we cannot afford to reduce the amount of money the Government have at their disposal to provide the many social services we need and expect.  Neither can we afford to neglect the necessity to reform the manner in which that money is collected which unfairly burdens the PAYE sector.  The Government in the budget failed to tackle the question of tax reform.  Surely that is the primary weapon at their disposal to revive an ailing economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to pose one question which exposes the inadequacy and unfairness of our taxation system.  Is it right and proper that citizens of rural areas pay double taxation for local services while the population of this metropolis pay nothing for those services?</P>
    <P>In the second part of my budget speech I wish to highlight the implications of Government policies, through the budget, for my constituency.  Cork North-West is a microcosm of life in rural areas, a constituency of mediumsized market towns such as Charleville, Newmarket, Kanturk, Millstreet and Macroom which are dependent to a large extent on a vibrant agricultural community in their hinterland.  It is a constituency which has all too few industrial employers and one that is constantly raped by migration and emigration; a constituency of vibrant village communities and, above all, one with a human resource that is highly skilled, <Col N="275" /> motivated, yearning for recognition and longing to contribute to the economic wellbeing of the Irish countryside.</P>
    <P>Rural Ireland is facing a crisis. Decisions being taken today, and in the next couple of years, will determine by and large the future for rural areas and whether those policy-makers have in their hearts the will and the capacity to protect the way of life which is unique in Europe and is worth preserving.</P>
    <P>Rural Ireland is like a prisoner on death row searching for a pardon but unlikely to find a sympathetic ear on Government benches.  Policies of centralisation adopted here have resulted in a concentration of economic opportunity on the east coast.  For example, the super-Euro routes are concentrated from Wexford to Belfast, from Dublin to Portlaoise and Kinnegad, yet the whole of the west and, indeed my constituency is by-passed regarding the resources available to the Government for the purposes of infrastructural improvement.</P>
    <P>The agricultural community is in chaos.  Incomes were reduced in 1990 by 15 per cent and the prospects for 1991 are daunting.  Clouds on the horizon of capitulation at the GATT negotiations and feeble defence of our agricultural interests at Council of Ministers level leaves no room for optimism.  The question of the disadvantaged areas which, for many years, was a perk which some farmers enjoyed is now a necessity to bolster falling incomes yet the manner in which our Agricultural Ministers have handled the whole question of extensions of the disadvantaged areas is nothing short of contemptuous towards those who derive their livelihoods from agriculture.</P>
    <P>In the eye of the storm Commissioner MacSharry told Irish farmers that they would be net beneficiaries from his reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The Common Agricultural Policy needs reforming but not in the manner Commissioner MacSharry envisages: 10 per cent quota reductions and price <Col N="276" /> reductions to Irish farmers, large and small.  What a cute and mean political ploy he has engaged in to set neighbour against neighbour in the agricultural community under the pretext that one can rob the big to pay the small, that the small can be made better off by penalising the larger commercial farmers.</P>
    <P>Quota reductions of 10 per cent and price reductions of 10 per cent will benefit no Irish farmers and will seriously damage the Irish economy.  It will mean job losses in the food processing sector and at the farm gate.  For Commissioner MacSharry to insist that we will be net beneficiaries from these proposals is nonsensical. It is asking to urinating on the agricultural community and trying to persuade them that they are sweating.</P>
    <P>The management of An Post are another of the angels of death stalking rural Ireland.  Job losses of 1,500 and the closure of 500 sub-post offices will affect rural areas exclusively.  One must in this debate consider that An Post have a social obligation in the context of the legislation which initiated that body.  In that context a policy of attrition, degradation and mismanagement by senior management of An Post left much to be desired and a question must be raised about the competence of management at senior level in that organisation.  Lack of employment opportunities, inability to compete with the favoured locations of the east coast, a declining population, a flight from the land and poor infrastructure are the hallmarks of rural areas in 1991.  Something needs to be done to save rural areas and the budget we are discussing failed dismally in this regard.</P>
    <P>I want positive discrimination in favour of rural Ireland.  We have seen and heard much about the designated areas programme in the context of urban renewal and much has been achieved under this concept.  I suggest to the Minister that he apply his time and ability to devising a similar to reward investment in rural areas which in this day and age could only be categorised as high risk investment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> The business expansion scheme is one vehicle that could be used for this purpose. I ask the Minister to consider its continued application in certain designated disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring my remarks to a conclusion with a few words about the health services.  The health services here are in a dismal state.  We could continue to pour financial resources, year after year, into the health services and fail to tackle the problems because there is a fundamental malaise on the administration side of our health services.  We need to reform health board structures and yet maintain an input for local democracy in our health services.  There are eight health boards and the Eastern Health Board administer health services for in excess of 60 per cent of the population. That prompts the question whether there is a justifiable case for the continued existence of eight health boards, perhaps it should be four or two. Certainly, a revision of the structures, and the wasteful way money is spent in the administration of our services, should take place.  Many thousands of public hospital patients are condemned to waiting lists for basic medical procedures in 1991 such as, for example, hip operations, ear, nose and throat surgery and cataract operations.  Those problems have to be tackled to ensure that a streamlined efficient service regarding public access to medical treatment is introduced in the health services.</P>
    <P>We have also in the budget a proposal to streamline access to medical treatment and introduce only two categories of patient, namely, medical card patients and all others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise <Col N="278" /> this matter on the Adjournment this evening.</P>
      <P>Many people both inside and outside this House were shocked and astonished to discover that the Government had seen fit to extend to Monsieur Le Pen and his grouping in the European Parliament the facilities at Dublin Castle for the purpose of a meeting to be held yesterday, today and tomorrow.  When I first learned of this matter I hoped it had happened by accident and that when the matter was drawn to the attention of the Government the arrangements for Monsieur Le Pen to use the Castle would be cancelled but that did not happen.</P>
      <P>It is outrageous that these facilites were made available to this group.  We cannot prevent any political grouping from visiting Ireland if they wish but the Government and State have no obligation to provide the facilities of Dublin Castle to a political grouping whose politics are abhorrent to the overwhelming majority of Irish people.  According to Monsieur Le Pen gas chambers used during the Second World War were just a detail or minor point in the history of that war. Jean-Marie Le Pen has been convicted of inciting racial hatred in France and members of his party have been convicted of charges of murder, assault and arson.  He leads in the European Parliament a Right wing group of neo-Fascists whose politics are designed to breed fear, racism and anti-Semitism and who seek to gain political advantage by exploiting the prejudices of the weak within France and other member states of the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that Irish taxpayers thought that the millions of pounds spent refurbishing Dublin Castle would result in that building, which was identified during our European Presidency as having a central role to play in the Government of this country, being made available to such a group.  I ask the Minister to explain how this group were afforded this facility.  I ask him to assure the House that such a facility will not <Col N="279" /> again be afforded to this grouping.  I ask him to reject the statement reported to have been made by the Government presss office last week when in an effort to explain this arrangement, they are supposed to have said that as the Socialist group in the European Parliament had been given this facility there was no particular reason Monsieur Le Pen and his group should not also be given it.  It is absolutely outrageous to compare the Socialist group in the European Parliament, whether or not the majority of the Members of this House agree with their politics, who are committed to democratic policies throughout the European Community with this group of neofascists who are at the opposite end of the political spectrum and who are trying to return Europe to the politics of the thirties, politics which brought chaos and discredit on many European countries.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give me a reasonable response.  I appreciate that, unfortunately, this meeting is now taking place and it may be too late to cancel the facilities now; there is only one day left during which the facilities will be available to Monsieur Le Pen, but I ask the Minister to give us an absolute assurance that the Government procedures to determine what groups can use Dublin Castle will be reviewed.  I also ask for an assurance that this group will never again be given access to this facility.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, on behalf of the Government, to apologise to the Irish people for the error which was made. Many people are deeply offended that this group were allowed to use Dublin Castle.  It has been reported in the newspapers that many members of the Jewish community have expressed concern at this action but I can tell the Minister that it is not only members of the Jewish community who are concerned.  The phone in my home has been hopping since this issue became public knowledge. Many people find it inexplicable that Dublin Castle was made available to this <Col N="280" /> group.  I hope the Minister will confirm in his reply that such an event will not be repeated and that no such facility in any Government building will be made available in future to a grouping of this nature.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works manage the conference facilities at Dublin Castle on behalf of the State.  Bookings of the conference facilities are arranged through that office.</P>
      <P>On 3 December 1990, the conference and protocol office of the European Parliament contacted the Dublin Castle conference office seeking to book facilities for 12, 13 and 14 February 1991 for the technical group of the European right.  A tentative booking was taken and, following clearance by the Department of the Taoiseach, the booking was confirmed.</P>
      <P>As Members will appreciate, the conference facilities at Dublin Castle are available on a commercial basis, for non-governmental use.  The technical group of the European right are a recognised group of parliamentarians who are paying the commercial rate for the facilities.</P>
      <P>Other European Parliament representatives with various political affiliations have previously used the facilities.  As Deputy Shatter said, these included the European left and the socialists.  Acceptance of bookings does not imply that the Government subscribe to the views of any particular group.  It makes no difference whether they are left or right wing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  At the outset I should like to congratulate Deputy Vincent <Col N="281" /> Brady on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>This matter deals with the serious conflict which has arisen between the Flesk Valley Rowing Club and the Office of Public Works.  I want to quote from a letter sent by the Chief State Solicitor to the chairman of the Flesk Valley Rowing Club, a voluntary body.  It states:</P>
      <P>I act for the Commissioners for Public Works in Ireland who inform me that the Rowing Club, of which you are Chairman, are in occupation of two boat houses, their property, which are situated within the confines of Bourn Vincent Memorial Park at Castlelough Bay.  The Commissioners require imediate vacant possession of both premises.</P>
      <P>The two boathouses in question are about 150 years old.  The Flesk Valley Rowing Club have occupied these boathouses on a continuous basis for 71 years.  They have looked after the boat houses and repaired them when necessary.  The members of the rowing club have never had any interference in their affairs until this year when the Commissioners for Public Works informed them that they owned the boathouses and asked them to take out a licence.  The members of the rowing club contend &mdash; this is backed up by substantial local evidence &mdash; that when the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park was transferred to the State on 31 December 1932 these boat houses were owned by another person and that this continued for some time after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The letter sent by the Chief State Solicitor to the chairman of the rowing club asked them to nominate a solicitor who would act on their behalf.  These people have no intention of doing this.  They have never been in court and they have no intention of getting involved in legal proceedings now.  I plead with the Minister to ensure that this document is withdrawn so that dialogue can take place <Col N="282" /> between the State body concerned and this voluntary organisation who have been showing people the techniques of rowing for over 71 years.  The people of Killarney view in a very dim light the way in which a State body has, through the legal system, put a gun to the head of this law abiding voluntary body who over the years have let the local community use their facilities.  No dialogue has taken place between the two bodies concerned even though a letter has issued from the Chief State Solicitor's Office to the rowing club.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the threatening legal document be withdrawn so that peace and harmony can be restored.  In a recent document which was released by the Minister's predecessor in Killarney outlining a major plan for the estate, one of the first objectives was to create harmonious relations with all local communities. I would appeal to the Minister to withdraw the threat to these people and resume dialogue so that a simple difference can be brought to a speedy and satisfactory solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank Deputy Moynihan for his good wishes.  I hope I will be able to clarify this little difficulty for him.</P>
      <P>The boathouses in question are situated in the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park, which forms part of Killarney National Park.  The Bourn Vincent Memorial Park, which includes Muckross House and gardens and comprises approximately 4,300 hectares, was given to the nation as a gift by Senator Arthur Vincent in 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan will be aware, in his position as a trustee of Muckross House for many years, that the gift was given effect by the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park Act, 1932.  The Act obliges the Commissioners of Public Works to manage the property &ldquo;as a national park for the general purpose of the recreation and enjoyment of the public&rdquo;.  All the <Col N="283" /> lands and property contained in the gift were to be managed for this purpose and this implicity required that no part of the bequest could be surrendered or permanently disposed of.  The Act did provide, however, that the Office of Public Works could permit the use of areas or buildings within the park to individuals or organisations for particular purposes.</P>
    <P>Last year Flesk Valley Rowing Club were in the process of reroofing a largely derelict and disused boathouse close to the boathouse occupied by them.  The reroofing of the building was being done with sheeting rather than traditional tiling and was being undertaken without prior notice or permission of the commissioners. This standard of finish would not be acceptable.  Furthermore the Office of Public Works could have been held liable for any accidents, which occurred during the course of such works. Indeed, part of the roof apparently below off during the course of the work.</P>
    <P>For these reasons the club were informed locally to cease working on the boathouse and they were subsequently advised of this in writing.  No response was received from the club but the works continued.  Some time later in a telephone conversation, the club claimed ownership of the boathouses.  This was not accepted by the Office of Public Works as the boathouses were located within the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park which had been left to the State as a gift.  The club were asked to support their claim with evidence of ownership but they have not done so.  To this day the club have not responded to any of the Office of Public Works letters.  In order to protect their interests the Office of Public Works were left with no alternative than to intitiate legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>In the management plan for Killarney National Park which was published last year, the Office of Public Works have undertaken to restore and improve all the existing stone boathouses in the national <Col N="284" /> park on an ongoing basis.  They have concentrated initially on boathouses in the Ross Bay areas which is subject to high levels of use for boating purposes by both visitors to the park and by the local community. Already the boathouses at Reen Pier in Ross Bay have been carefully restored to the highest standards.  The other boathouses in the Ross Area, as well as the those elsewhere in the park &mdash; including those occupied by the Flesk Valley Rowing Club &mdash; are intended to be restored and improved as necessary in due course.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works are of the view, which I share, that this matter can be resolved amicably if the club are willing to accept a licence for the continuing use of the boathouses in question.  This was suggested in a reply to a recent parliamentary question on this issue from my colleague, Deputy John O'Leary.</P>
    <P>I think the Deputy will agree that this proposal provides the basis for an easy solution to this problem.  Certainly the Office of Public Works have no wish to be obliged to pursue this matter by way of legal action.  Officials from the Office of Public Works would be happy to meet representatives of the Flesk Valley Rowing Club to seek a mutually acceptable solution to this matter if they so wish.  I would suggest to Deputy Moynihan that it may be possible for him to contribute in some way to resolving this problem, which we are all anxious should be resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Pat McCartan gave me notice of his intention to raise the implications of the judgment of the Supreme Court given on 12 February in the Gallagher case, and the urgent need for the Government to act as a result of that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you for the opportunity of raising this <Col N="285" /> very important, urgent and serious issue in the House tonight.  I also thank the Minister of State at the Department of Justice for taking the time to listen to what I have to say.  This House will be well aware that on 18 September 1988 John Gallagher took the life of his former girlfriend and her mother in the grounds of Sligo General Hospital.  At his subsequent trial he pleaded not guilty to the charges by reason of insanity, and that plea was sustained at an eventual hearing before a jury.</P>
      <P>Shortly after his committal to the Central Mental Hospital, where I understand he is being detained, Mr. Gallagher's lawyers began a process of applying to the courts to have his release secured. That process of application led ultimately to the recent decision of the Supreme Court, delivered only a few days ago, that the matter of his eventual release will be decided by the Minister in consultation at Government.</P>
      <P>The process is no longer <i>sub judice</i> and therefore affords this House an opportunity to have the views of the court heard on the matter.  In addition, it affords the Minister an opportunity to act in the way he promised in answer to questions from The Workers' Party in this House in regard to the issue as it unfolded in the Central Criminal Court and elsewhere. It is now a matter of urgency that the Minister and the Government bring in legislation to update the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is curious about this issue is that the whole matter has been already addressed by a Government appointed committee under the chairmanship of former Supreme Court Judge Henchy who reported as long ago as November 1978 &mdash; the report was lodged in the library in 1980.  Judge Henchy looked at this and many other matters dealing with the mentally ill which come before the courts.  He even went as far as to draft a Bill, and any Government since then could have presented it to this House where, I have no doubt, it would have <Col N="286" /> received overwhelming and immediate support.</P>
    <P>It is a remarkable condemnation of this House that that report has sat on the shelves for so long and that the legal quagmire that the Government now find themselves in has been allowed to generate when the solutions were there.  The Henchy report recommended that where a person was found not guilty by reason of mental disorder &mdash; it recommended a change of the ridiculous formula used in our courts of guilty but insane &mdash; the person would be assessed and admitted to hospital if that was the appropriate action to take.  It also recommended that it would be a matter for the courts subsequently to decide whether and when the person should be released, bearing in mind not just the sanity of the person, as is currently the position, but also whether it is safe in all the circumstances to allow him to be released.  That is a very important consideration.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record of the House that there would be very major repercussions not only for John Gallagher but for the family of the victims should he be released at an early stage. None of us should be hesitant about making that point.  It is only due to the sensible ruling of the Supreme Court that that gentleman will be kept longer in custody and, I hope, until such time as the Government have an opportunity to look at the report.  They should then act without delay.  There can be no reason for dallying on this urgent and important matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by reminding the House of a statement which the Minister for Justice issued yesterday afternoon shortly after the decision of the Supreme Court in DPP <i>v</i> Gallagher became known.  The statement was as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implications of this judgment <Col N="287" /> will be examined by my Department as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Legislation is at an advanced stage of preparation to amend the law relating to criminal insanity and will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We are studying the Supreme Court judgment in detail and taking advice as to its full implications.  While I will be glad to note any observation which Deputy McCartan or any other Member of the House may wish to offer on the case, it would obviously be inappropriate for me, or the Minister for Justice who will have the responsibility of dealing with the outcome of the case, to make any comment pending completion of the detailed examination which is under way.</P>
    <P>I am particularly conscious of the fact that while the judgment may be seen as one which carries general implications as regards the manner in which the detention of persons held under section 2 (2) of the Trial of Lunatics Act, 1883, is to be managed, it must also be borne in mind that the judgment refers to what the Supreme Court has found to be the lawful detention of a named individual. It would be very wrong for me to engage in any discussion on the individual case or to say anything which might be seen as carrying implications for the future management of a named individual's detention.</P>
    <P>While it is not easy to avoid an overlap between the general and the particular in this instance, I trust that the House will appreciate the importance for me, as Minister of State, the Minister and indeed for the House generally, of maintaining this distinction.</P>
    <P>With regard to suggestions that have been made to the effect that the general law in this area should be amended, I can say that even prior to the decision of the Supreme Court it had been decided to introduce legislation with a view to amending the law in relation to criminal insanity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> Work on the preparation of the legislation is already at an advanced stage in the Department of Justice.  The House will appreciate that at this stage I am not in a position to reveal specific details of the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>However, I can say that certain issues are being examined in the context of the legislation.  These include provisions about fitness to plead at a criminal trial, a possible change in the verdict of &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo;, the introduction of a right of appeal against such verdicts, the definition of criminal insanity, the possibility of introducing the concept of &ldquo;guilty but with diminished responsibility&rdquo; and the procedures for determining the release of &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; persons.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of reports both here and in the United Kingdom on the question of criminal insanity.  The third interim report of the inter-departmental committee on mentally ill and maladjusted persons, often referred to as the Henchy Committee, is one of the most recent and contains many detailed recommendations.  The issues in question also have been the subject of some considerable debate in the United States as a result of the Hinckley case.  We have, therefore, the benefit of a considerable body of research and recommendations to enable us to come to proper and informed conclusions, although there seems to be no universally agreed solution in other jurisdictions to the problems in question.</P>
    <P>As soon as the legislation has been finalised it will be introduced in the normal way.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for Agriculture and Food for giving his time to listen to my complaint.  There is a delay in inspecting works approved under the control of farmyard pollution and other grants inspected by higher agricultural officers in various farm development offices throughout the country.  This has come to my attention through contact with my constituents and from colleagues whom I heard making similar complaints.</P>
      <P>It is appalling that the agricultural community, who have been encouraged by Teageasc officials in the Department of Agriculture and Food and those concerned about the environment to make such large investments at a time of scarce resources throughout the agricultural community, are treated in this contemptible manner by the Department. Will the Minister make sufficient resources available to the higher agricultural officers concerned on an annual basis rather than, as I understand at the moment, on a three monthly basis, as many of them exceed their allowance before that period has expired?</P>

The Minister will have received these complaints and every weekend my colleagues and I are inundated with complaints about the non-payment of headage grants.  I cannot blame my local headage office in Sligo because some unpaid headage has been batched in the middle of December but it still has not been paid.  There is a 90 day's wait as far <Col N="290" /> as pollution controls are concerned and, to make it worse for farmers in difficult circumstances, the Department of Agriculture and Food will not answer telephone calls about this matter.

      <P>I wish to raise the matter of the delay in payments of special beef premiums and EC suckler grants to many farmers in my constituency, Carlow-Kilkenny. It appears that there is a particular problem in Kilkenny because some farmers have been paid since early December while others have yet to receive payment in spite of the fact that the finance is available from the EC and has been lodged with the Department of Agriculture and Food.  At a time when there are serious financial difficulties in the farming community, I cannot understand why the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government are deliberately delaying payment of these grants to farmers to enable the Minister to balance his departmental budget.  It is certainly not acceptable in Kilkenny.</P>

      <P>I will speak about conjecture and rumour, but I know that the Minister will respond in a decent and honourable fashion.  There are rumours of cuts in milk quotas to particular types of suppliers in different parts of the country and I am worried about the effect of such cuts, particularly on handicapped areas.  A cut of 10 per cent has been mentioned and we have also been told that they will be applied only to farmers who supply more than 42,800 gallons.  In handicapped areas, that would apply to very big farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned that, even though the cuts would be applied to people in that category, it would affect everybody in handicapped areas because the cost of collection and processing would increase dramatically which, obviously, would affect smaller producers.  Bearing in mind that the co-operatives in those areas are <Col N="291" /> already, to some degree, handicapped, I should like the Minister to respond.</P>

      <P>As far as County Laois is concerned, there is a peculiar and unique problem which must be addressed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food. The leaked proposal on the disadvantaged area extension shows an increase from 18 per cent to 31 per cent of the lands in County Laois, which is one of the lowest increases in the country; that figure is a source of grave dissatisfaction, disappointment and discontent to everybody in the county.</P>
      <P>Detailed examination of a soil map of the county clearly shows that 58 per cent of the lands in County Laois is comprised of wet organic soil, unsuitable for tillage and of little agricultural value.  Most of the land in the county was not even surveyed by departmental officials last year, which is clearly unsatisfactory compared to other counties and having regard to the level of farm incomes in the county in recent years.</P>
      <P>Submissions have now been made from areas not surveyed, including Mountmellick, O'Moore's Forest, Cullohill, The Marsh, Clonkeen, Trumera, Lisduff, Oldtown, Wolfehill and Ballyroan. Examination of these submissions show that all the necessary criteria are complied with.</P>

That document states that 90 per cent of the Government's national submission was acceptable while the remaining 10 per cent was still being negotiated.  I have <Col N="292" /> been told by knowledgeable Fianna Fáil sources in my constituency that some of the townlands listed in the submission have been deleted while others have been slipped in.  I doubt very much if this is true and the rumour is probably without foundation and I seek clarification from the Minister on this.  While many of these townlands feel aggrieved they anticipate that they will have the right to appeal. I hope there will be no sleight-of-hand activity in this matter.</P>

      <P>The matter I wish to raise relates to the importation of second hand cars and, in particular, the effect this has on employment and the availability of apprenticeships.  Up to September 1990 approximately 16,000 second hand cars had been imported and this represented an increase of a multiple of four or five on the previous year.  This had the effect of destabilising the market which was obvious from the number of second hand cars which remained unsold in garages. As a consequence, the value of &ldquo;tradeing&rdquo; has slumped which, in turn, will affect the sale of new cars.  What I am concerned about is the level of employment and the availability of apprenticeships in garages and places where cars are sold.  Would the Minister agree that there is a difficulty and, second, has he any proposals to stabilise the market?</P>

      <P>On the question of the import of second hand cars which was raised by Deputy Cotter, I would first make the point that cars are no longer assembled or manufactured in Ireland.  All cars sold on the Irish market have to be imported whether as new cars or as second hand cars.  Our <Col N="293" /> membership of the European Community prevents us from imposing import restrictions on cars from within the Community while our participation as a member of GATT precludes us from imposing new import restrictions on cars from countries such as Japan whether the cars are new or second hand.</P>
      <P>It is not clear to me why the import of second hand cars should have any impact on the overall level of employment within the motor trade whether in general or as regards apprenticeships.  As the House is aware, I have no responsibility for the level of apprenticeships available in any sector.  This is a matter for the Minister for Labour.  However, I have responsibility not only for our international trade but also for the consumer.  It seems clear that the import of second hand cars gives the consumer an added choice and increased competition within the motor trade must be in his best interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say in response to Deputy Creed that he will appreciate it is essential to exercise economies in travelling expenses as well as other administrative costs. However, I can assure him that with efficient management of resources all necessary inspections will be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the matter raised by Deputy Nealon, I should like to say that this time last year, at the end of February 1990, payments totalling some £87 million had been made to 173,500 beneficiaries under all the 1989 cattle and sheep headage and premium schemes. As of today's date, payments totalling £168 million have been made to some 248,700 beneficiaries under all the 1990 cattle and sheep headage and premium schemes.  I hope there will be a significant improvement in these figures by the end of the month.  With 75,000 more payments made and £81 million more paid now than at the corresponding date last year it seems that there has been a substantial improvement in the speed of <Col N="294" /> making payments as between these two years.  I can assure the Deputy that I will do everything in my power to have all remaining payments made as soon as possible to sustain this dramatic level of improvement.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Nealon is aware, a special scheme providing grants of up to 55 per cent for the control of farm yard pollution was introduced for the disadvantaged areas in 1988 and was extended to the whole country in August 1989.  The demand for grants under this scheme has been exceptionally high and to date some 28,000 applications have been received. Considerable progress has been made in the processing of these applications.  So far 21,000 approvals have been issued representing an investment of £173 million.  The remaining applications are being dealt with as quickly as possible. On average, grants are paid within four to six weeks of the completion of the works.  To date they have been paid in 9,500 cases totalling almost £38 million. All in all I am satisfied that this scheme for the control of farm yard pollution is being effectively operated by the Department and that there are no undue delays in the payment of grants.  There is, therefore, no substance in the allegation made by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan raised the question of delays in special beef premium and suckler cow scheme payments.  The position is that at the end of February 1990 57,200 applicants under the 1989 schemes had been paid £21 million in grants whereas, as of today's date, some 91,100 applicants under the 1990 scheme have been paid £38.7 million.  Again, it seems that with 34,000 extra applicants paid and almost £18 million extra over and above the numbers and amount paid at the corresponding date last year there has been a considerable speeding up of payments under these schemes during the past two years.  I want to assure the Deputy that I will seek to ensure all remaining payments under these schemes are made as early as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> On the question of the Common Agricultural Policy regime raised by Deputy Cotter, while there has been some media speculation and rumours about possible cuts in milk quotas no proposals have emerged from the European Commission in this area.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to make any comments on this matter at this stage.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Laois disadvantaged areas survey which was raised by Deputy Flanagan, I am aware that some farmers in County Laois are unhappy because certain areas were not visited during the course of last year's nationwide survey of the disadvantaged areas or because, after being surveyed, their areas were not included in the submission made to the European Community in 1990.  I can, of course, understand and sympathise greatly with their unhappiness but, under the usual rules of confidentiality, I cannot disclose which areas of County Laois were or were not submitted to the European Community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I assure Deputy Flanagan that any appeals received from County Laois will be carefully and sympathetically considered by the appeals body to be set up and will be adjudicated on their merits.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finucane also raised a question on the submission on disadvantaged areas.  The European Commission is concluding its examination of our proposals and the consultations we have had with it have been very satisfactory.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>I was very disappointed at the decision of British Airways to withdraw from the Irish market with effect from 24 March 1991, having served Ireland for 44 years. When the decision was announced, I contacted Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus and Ryanair to assess the impact of the withdrawal and particularly its implications for Irish tourism.  Both Aer Lingus and Ryanair have indicated to me that they have adequate capacity to fill the gap created by the British Airways withdrawal and will provide extra flights as necessary.  In addition, British Midland have indicated that they have the capacity to attract additional traffic on the Dublin/Heathrow route.</P>
      <P>In relation to the impact of the British Airways withdrawal on tourists travelling to Ireland from the US, Bord Fáilte is, at my request, having discussions with the airline to ensure that British Airways continue to market Ireland in the US.  In addition, I have personally contacted a number of North American airlines about their extending existing services or inaugurating new services to Ireland.</P>
      <P>For visitors travelling to Ireland from Australia and the Far East, British Airways have in recent years been commonrating fares to Dublin with those to other points in Europe.  In response to a request from me, Aer Lingus have been having discussions with a number of other carriers serving the Far East and Australia about their adopting similar commonrating arrangements and, so far, Signapore Airlines have agreed to do this.</P>
      <P>As a result of the measures taken to date and the general plans for the development of Irish tourism, I am confident that the withdrawal of British Airways from the Irish market will not impede the development of Irish tourism.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in the operational programme for tourism for grant aid for accommodation developments.  The objective of the programme is to accelerate and facilitate tourism growth through the provision of high quality, marketable amenities and facilities, better marketing and improved competitiveness, a better distribution network and increased and expanded training.</P>
      <P>Investment is being channelled into improving the range, quality and marketing of our tourism product.  This will enable us to compete successfully in specific target markets and to increase and spread visitor numbers over a larger tourism season, thereby expanding the sector's revenue base.  The programme is due to run until 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from Bord Fáilte that <Col N="98" /> there is no evidence to suggest that people in the Border counties have not availed of grants for tourism projects. Over £23 million will have been drawn down from the ERDF on completion of the second phase of the special border areas programme for a range of tourism developments involving both public and private sectors in the region.  In addition, another £10 million had been allocated, £3 million of which has already been paid out by the International Fund for Ireland &mdash; IFI &mdash; to private tourism developers in the six border counties.  These IFI funds are being used to assist the development of a broad category of tourism facilites including the upgrading of guest facilities in lower grade hotels and guest-houses in the region.</P>

This project has also been included in the operational programme for peripherality.

      <Quest>the investigations which were held into the circumstances surrounding the collapse of the main air traffic control system at Dublin Airport on 21 July 1990 and the simultaneous failue of the emergency back-up system, resulting in the total closure of the airport for almost two hours; if, in view of the safety implications of this failure, he will outline the steps which have been taken to ensure it does not reoccur; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Dublin Airport was closed to all traffic from 12.30 hours to 14.10 hours on 21 July 1990 following a power failure at the new State Services Building, which also involved an apparent failure in the back up emergency generator.  I must emphasise that safety was not endangered by the power failure and that the air traffic control personnel on duty had communications with aircraft at all times.  The temporary closure of the airport was to ensure that safety standards would not be breached while the power failure problem was being resolved.</P>
      <P>Initially, power was restored at 13.40 hours and, at 14.10 hours, operations resumed on a limited basis, which gradually increased until full operations were restored around 21.00 hours that evening following a complete check on the various systems and sub-systems in use.</P>
      <P>On the day of the incident, I initiated a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident.  I am satisfied that the failure was an isolated event and that procedures have been put in place to prevent a recurrence.</P>

      <P>The <Col N="104" /> general flight rules concerning minimum heights are specified in Rule 3 of the Air Navigation (Rules of the Air) Order, 1973 (S.I. No. 22 of 1973) as amended by the Air Navigation (Rules of the Air) (Amendment) Order, 1974 (S.I. No. 18 of 1974).</P>
      <P>In summary, the rule provides that an aircraft, except while landing or taking off, shall not be flown at a height less than 1,500 ft. over densely populated areas, or elsewhere at less than 500 ft.  These minimum heights are not applicable to a helicopter if the flight is being conducted without hazard to persons or property, and at a height which would permit it, in the event of an emergency occurring, to land without undue hazard to persons or property.</P>
      <P>The aeronautical operations service in the air navigation services office of my Department are responsible for investigating violations of the rules of the air and non-adherence to air traffic control clearances.  Any complaints relating to infringement of these rules should be addressed to that office giving the time and date of such infringement, together with, where possible, the aircraft type and registration number.  Any such complaints will be fully investigated by my Department.</P>

      <P>Apart from petroleum products, the <Col N="105" /> annual tonnages of the dangerous substances acrylonitrile, methyl acrylate and liquid ammonia transported within the rail network total about 220,000 tonnes. Acrylonitrile and methyl acrylate trains are normally routed from North Wall, Dublin, to Ballina, County Mayo, via Portarlington, Athlone and Claremorris. These chemicals are transported from Ballina to the Asahi plant at Killala by road.  Liquid ammonia trains are normally routed from the Irish Fertiliser Industries plant at Marino, Cork, to Arklow via Limerick Junction, Portarlington and Dublin.  Routes and timetables of such trains are advised to the various emergency services.</P>
      <P>Trains carrying dangerous substances are operated to special stringent rules and regulations and all persons associated with these operations are given special training.  The maximum speed of trains transporting dangerous substances is 50 mph &mdash; 40 mph in certain places &mdash; for ammonia trains and 40 mph &mdash; 35 mph in certain places &mdash; for acrylonitrile and methyl acrylate trains.</P>
      <P>All vehicles containing dangerous substances must carry appropriate information notices and hazard labels.  In addition, there are barrier wagons on both ammonia and acrylonitrile trains which provide additional safety protection.</P>
      <P>The tank containers and tankers used in the transport of dangerous substances comply with the International Union of Railways &mdash; UIC &mdash; specifications and the trains are operated in accordance with the Regulations on the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail &mdash; RID.</P>
      <P>A scheme for alert and co-ordination of emergency services and other organisations in the event of an incident or accident involving dangerous substances in transit by rail has been drawn up by a committee operating under the auspices of my Department.  The committee includes representatives of Government Departments and agencies concerned and of certain manufacturers using dangerous substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme provides a framework for the co-ordination of the actions of the <Col N="106" /> various emergency services, such as fire authorities, gardaí, pollution control agencies and ambulance services in the event of an incident or accident.  It also provides for the identification of substances, raising the alarm and rendering the site of an incident safe.</P>
    <P>Under the direction of my Department, exercises are held from time to time to test the operational capability of the scheme.  Plans are reviewed in the light of the experience gained from these exercises.  I am satisfied that the scheme is sufficient to ensure that, in the event of an incident or accident involving a train carrying dangerous substances, procedures are such as to ensure maximum possible protection for the general public.</P>
    <P>Finally, as previously advised to the House, a Bill to regulate the transportation of dangerous substances by rail is currently in preparation.  This Bill, when enacted, will give legislative effect to the RID Regulations to which I referred earlier in this reply.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the terms and conditions under which British registered vehicles either (a) hired, (b) leased or (c) under commercial contract, are allowed to operate in the State; and whether there is a time limit on their operation.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to the terms and conditions under which British registered commercial vehicles may operate in the State while engaged in the carriage of goods by road for hire or reward.  The same conditions apply to all vehicles as detailed in (a), (b) and (c) in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three arrangements under which British or Northern Ireland registered vehicles, exceeding 2.5 metric tons unladen weight and hauling for hire or reward may deliver goods into and bring goods out of the State.  These are as follows: first the United Kingdom/Ireland Bilateral Road Transport Agreement, which permits road haulage to, from or in transit through the territories of both States.  This agreement also provides for reciprocal exemptions from vehicle excise duties and road taxes; requires mutual compliance with transport and traffic regulations in our respective territories and provides for certain enforcement procedures; second, the EC multilateral quota scheme, under which each member state receives an annual allocation of transport authorisations for distribution to its hauliers.  These authorisations allow hauliers to undertake multilateral carriage of goods for hire or reward throughout the Twelve member states of the Community; third, the <Col N="108" /> ECMT multilateral authorisation scheme, which is similar to the EC scheme but authorisations in this instance are valid for seven other European countries in addition to the Twelve EC member states.</P>
    <P>As part of the ongoing process of liberalisation of the road transport sector, it was agreed with the UK authorities that was effect from 1 January 1990 there would be no need for the presentation by British or Northern Ireland hauliers of any permit or authorisation under any of the foregoing schemes while operating in the State.  On a reciprocal basis, the same applies to Irish hauliers operating in Britain and Northern Ireland.  There is no time limit imposed on these operations. All hauliers must, however, be properly licensed to operate in accordance with their own national legislation.</P>
    <P>None of the schemes to which I have referred provides for cabotage operations, that is, point-to-point carriage of goods within a country by a non-resident haulier.  With effect from 1 July 1990, however, the European Community introduced by way of regulation a limited system of cabotage, whereby special authorisations, each valid for either one or two months, are issued to member states on a quota basis.  Ireland received 595 authorisations, each valid for two months, for distribution to Irish hauliers for the period July 1990/June 1991, enabling them to undertake cabotage operations in any or all of the other 11 member states.  The UK likewise received an allocation of 1,124 authorisations for distribution to their hauliers. If a British or Northern Ireland registered vehicle is, therefore, engaged in point-to-point haulage for hire or reward within the State, it must be accompanied by a valid cabotage authorisation.</P>
    <P>The EC Regulation introducing cabotage also requires such non-resident operators to comply with the specific regulations in the host state relating to transport, traffic and revenue requirements.</P>
    <P>I should stress that the schemes outlined above relate exclusively to the hire <Col N="109" /> or reward sector of the transport industry. Own-account transport, that is carriage of one's own goods in one's own vehicles, is not subject to these procedures.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the embassy at Washington that it has, at present, no passport application from an Irish citizen living in Washington, who is holder of a Norwegian passport.  The average length of time which should be allowed for the processing of a passport application by the embassy in Washington is two to three weeks, if the documentation is in order.</P>
      <P>The embassy did recently receive an inquiry by telephone from such a person living in New York.  In accordance with normal practice, the inquirer was advised to apply to the Irish Consulate General in New York.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Consulate General that they did not in the event receive any passport application.  It is the case, however, that delays have arisen in that office in recent times because of a significant increase in all forms of passport related work.  In order to deal with these delays, priority was given to the issue of passports to Irish born people <Col N="113" /> who do not have an alternative passport for travel purposes.  This resulted in a backlog of applications from Irish citizens who are already in possession of a passport of another state but who wish to have an Irish passport.  However, an extra head of staff has been employed recently and the backlog has already been substantially reduced.  In fact the present delay in the processing of applications of this type is less than two months.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that tax has been demanded in respect of the years 1987-88, 1989-90 and 1990-91.  The assessment for 1987-88 is based on information that the taxpayer was in receipt of income from the letting of land.  The liabilities for 1989-90 and 1990-91 arise <Col N="114" /> because the taxpayer failed to complete farm profile forms for these years.  If the taxpayer completes the outstanding farm profile forms and clarifies the position in relation to the letting and ownership of land the position will be reviewed.</P>

As a result of an examination of the Report of the Formal Inquiry into the <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i> casualty that was carried out by the Irish National Ferry Safety Committee, regulations have been introduced to implement, where appropriate, the recommendations of that inquiry.  For the future, I shall be guided in the introduction of further measures by my expert advisers in the Marine Survey Office, by the IMO, and by the National Ferry Safety Committee, who were established by my predecessor to keep ferry safety under continuous review.</P>

      <P>The number of farmers in County Galway who qualified for cattle headage grants in more severely handicapped areas and for beef cow grants in less severely handicapped areas in 1989 was 5,900 and 4,900 respectively.  It is expected that for 1990 these numbers will increase by 600 and 650 respectively, due mainly to the abolition of the off-farm income restriction and, in the case of the beef cow scheme, to more farmers qualifying for beef cow grants in herds with both dairy and beef cows.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the total amounts payable to County Galway farmers under the cattle headage and beef cow schemes for 1990 are £3.57 million and £2.69 million respectively.</P>

      <P>I understand that imports of gas cyclinders during 1990 were exceptional due to the setting up of a new distribution company.  It seems doubtful whether normal domestic demand alone would be adequate to justify the large capital investment needed to enable an Irish company produce standard gas cylinders for the Irish market in competition with existing European scale producers. The IDA would be prepared, however, to assist the establishment of an undertaking for the manufacture of gas cylinders here provided that they were satisfied, having regard to the proposed markets, that such an undertaking would be economically viable.</P>

      <P>Since 1987, Aer Lingus have been operating air services on over 35 routes and on most routes there are at least six fare types, both inbound and outbound.  Each fare type has changed at least once annually and considerably more often on the busier and more competitive routes. Accordingly, it would not be practicable, having regard to the time available and the inordinate commitment of staff time and resources that would be involved, to compile in full the information requested.</P>
      <P>However, information regarding the more general fare changes over the period is as follows:</P>

      <P>The latest air passenger traffic figures published by Aer Rianta are for January 1991.  These show an overall drop of 9 per cent in traffic at the three State airports combined as compared with January 1990.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to be specific on the impact of the Gulf War on passenger traffic to date.  While the Gulf situation has had a major negative impact on air traffic, there are other important factors to be taken into account such as a recession in the United States and United Kingdom markets and the decline in value of the US dollar.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy has not applied to my Department for a road freight carrier's licence.

      <P>He can, however, qualify for a certificate of competence if, having taken the relevant course, he is successful in the written examination for such a certificate. Examinations are held twice yearly, under the auspices of the Chartered Institute of Transport in Ireland, at various centres throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Apart from certain categories, most aircraft flying through Irish airspace are charged for the provision of en route air navigation services.  The costs involved are recouped on Ireland's behalf by Euro-control under the multilateral agreement relating to route charges.  Under this agreement Ireland, like most other countries in the system, does not charge for flights by Irish or foreign military aircraft.</P>

      <P>Council Directive 89/552/EC has compulsory effect and will be implemented.</P>
      <P>A number of provisions were included in the Broadcasting Act 1990 for the purpose, <i>inter alia,</i> of facilitating transparent compliance with the directive &mdash; in, for example, the area of advertising time limits and standards and in relation to the &ldquo;Right of Reply&rdquo; provisions.  The questions of the need to adopt further measures in the form of a statutory instrument under relevant EC legislation is currently under consideration in conjunction with the Attorney General's Office.</P>
      <P>It was not envisaged that the type of advertising adverted to in the question under reference would be prohibited under the clause referred to.  In general I can say that RTE do not envisage any difficulties in meeting the advertising standards prescribed in the directive, the vast majority of which are already explicitly or implicitly covered in the code of practice which they have followed in this area for many years.  Likewise they would not anticipate any loss of revenue arising from the implementation of those standards.</P>
