      <P>It is the first time since the Dáil was founded in 1919 that a Minister for Finance, having been asked to <Col N="1260" /> resign, refused and was sacked.  It is also the first time the House will have had an opportunity to discuss the recently agreed joint programme between the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party.  In view of these considerations, my party believe that this debate should not be artificially restricted. My party consists of 55 Deputies and under the proposed arrangements only four of them will be allowed to speak. The other 51 Deputies, if they wish &mdash; most of them will not so wish &mdash; should have the opportunity to speak.  For these reasons I am objecting to that part of the Order of Business which requires that these proceedings be brought to a close at 10 p.m. I am not objecting to the time limits on speeches which are reasonable. However, I object to the artificial limitation on the overall time for the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to let this occasion pass without paying tribute to the contribution made to Government by the former Ministers for Finance and the Environment, Deputies Albert Reynolds and Pádraig Flynn.</P>
      <P>Since 1989, Deputy Reynolds has brought in three budgets, which have contributed through downward pressure on the national debt and a reduction in the tax burden to maintaining a favourable climate for continued economic progress. He has played a key role in the negotiations on economic and monetary union, insisting that it will be framed in such a way as to allow Ireland to participate from the outset on broadly acceptable terms.  He was also one of the negotiators of both the original and the revised Joint Programme for Government, and he played an important part in the negotiation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn has been Minister for the Environment from 1987.  During that period much important environmental legislation has been passed, and a ten year environmental action programme has been adopted.  He has also introduced an innovative social housing programme. <Col N="1270" /> Notable improvements have been made to the country's road network and to oher essential aspects of our physical infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank both Deputies for their outstanding work in Government. Both of them made a major contribution to the success of Ireland's EC Presidency.</P>
    <P>I would also like to pay tribute to Ministers of State Geoghegan-Quinn, Smith and Treacy for their effective and assiduous work in the Departments in which they served.</P>
    <P>Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn too played a part in the success of our Presidency and her work on women's affairs in my Department has been impressive. The Government appreciate also the work Deputy Michael Smith has done as Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce with special responsibility for Science and Technology. Deputy Noel Treacy has worked at the Departments of Health and Justice and made a valuable contribution to the work of both Departments.  I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge in the House the dedication of all three Deputies to the discharge of the responsibilities assigned to them.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, circumstances have arisen, which have made it necessary for me to request the resignation of the Ministers concerned, in order to uphold the principle of collective responsibility enshrined in our Constitution and in the interest of maintaining the overall unity and the cohesion of the administration.  I have done this with regret.</P>
    <P>It is now accepted on all sides of the House that it is our paramount duty to implement the new comprehensive Programme for Government and to concentrate our full attention on the many important problems and issues facing the nation.  In a few weeks' time far reaching decisions on the future shape of European Union will be taken at the European Council Meeting at Maastricht.  Work on the Book of Estimates has to be completed, and a budget framed for 1992 which will be appropriate to the economic situation and fulfil the requirements laid down in the revised Programme for <Col N="1271" /> Government.  It is also necessary to complete our discussions with the social partners on the implementation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in present economic conditions. We must continue our efforts to achieve peace and political progress in Northern Ireland.  There is a very full agenda for the months ahead, to which the Government, and I hope other Members in this House, will now devote their undivided attention.</P>

      <P>As a nation and as a people we have the capacity to do much better than we have been doing.  We here in Ireland are not performing to our potential.  We are not performing because we have no common purpose as a people.  We have no common purpose because we have no political leadership. There was no greater evidence of a lack of common purpose than in the speech we have just heard from the Taoiseach. The speech was devoted more to a hypocritical attempt to write the political obituary of his party opponents than to sketch out any idea of what the newly appointed Ministers are supposed to achieve.  In a very real sense this Government have no common purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us understand the importance of genuine leadership.  Let me take an illustration from another field of endeavour. The Irish soccer team was transformed from mediocrity to excellence by the catalyst provided by the leadership of Mr. Jack Charlton.  Jack Charlton did not score a single goal or block a single ball, but he created a vision that enabled others to do that.  Irish politics today, and this Government in particular, are failing to provide a vision or to lead this country in <Col N="1272" /> any real way.  As a result, as a nation, we are failing to perform.</P>
    <P>The number without work, the number who have emigrated, the number leaving school without basic reading and writing skills, the number living in substandard accommodation, the plight of people with a handicap, the neglect of those caring for elderly relatives, the discrimination experienced by travellers in our community, by any of those standards we as a nation are failing to perform to our full potential.  Instead of creating a strong enterprise econony where effort is rewarded, monopolies removed and employees share in profits, this Government have created a society in which enterprise has been given a bad name.</P>

      <P>I have just outlined where I believe this country is failing to perform because of the lack of proper political leadership.  This will not change as long as this reshuffled Government remain in office.  That is all they will do, remain in office, not in Government in any real sense, no just in office; the Progressive Democrats have seen to that. As long as this Government continue in office everything is provisional.  The <Col N="1273" /> maximum time frame is two years, the minimum, on past experience, is about two weeks.  That is no way to run a country. Indeed the make-shift character of everything is very well revealed in the particular choices made for promotion to the Cabinet.  Not a single Minister of State was deemed worthy of promotion. Their experience was of no importance. Not a single woman TD on the Fianna Fáil benches was considered worthy of promotion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>After all the trauma of the past few months nothing has changed. The Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil have both separately decided that the Taoiseach is to continue as Head of the Government; that is their decision. we have a Government remaining in place, not because of leadership but because of the very lack of it.  The Taoiseach has simply frustrated the ambition of those who serve him.  He remains Taoiseach because those around him have neither the courage nor cohesion to replace him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am utterly convinced that the continuance of the Government is not in the best interests of the State.  No good will come of the continuance of what we have seen during the past two years.  I ask those on the Government benches to drag themselves away from the world of disinformation campaigns, white Hiace vans and threats for a few minutes and contemplate what people outside this House are thinking.  The people cannot understand why this Government are still there after all that has happened.  They have heard his colleagues make extraordinary accusations against the Taoiseach. They have heard those who supported him last Saturday saying afterwards that he should not be there at the <Col N="1274" /> next election, yet this paralysed Government remain in office because of the collective lack of cohesion or cowardice of those around them.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the majority in this House, I am convinced that the people can and will do better.  The first requirement is that we have a Government who have a clear sense of purpose.  Politics in Ireland has become increasingly removed from the people.  Few people under the age of 35 listen to or watch political programmes. Politics has become, to use Professor Joe Lee's term, more about possession than performance.  Success is measured by how much one possesses, not how well one manages to perform. One cannot perform, of course, unless one has a sense of purpose.  The Government do not have a sense of purpose. That is their fundamental problem.</P>
    <P>Speaking in this House on 20 February 1985, Deputy Desmond O'Malley said, &ldquo;Young people can hardly be blamed if they look at this House and its Members with a certain cynicism because they see a certain hypocrisy.&rdquo;  Those words were used by Deputy O'Malley on the day he made a moving speech in which he outlined his sense of a true Republic and stated that unlike his colleagues he intended to stand by the Republic. Deputy O'Malley today is not standing by the Republic.  He is standing by Deputy Haughey.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>Where does the interest of this Republic lie?  What is best for this Republic?  These are questions which are not being answered by this Government, a Government without a policy or a purpose, yet they are questions which must be answered for the people in this debate. Other parties, Opposition and otherwise, should say with clarity where exactly they stand on the issue of a change of Government. Do they want one or not?  Do they believe a change of Government is possible?  Do they believe that this is the best possible of all Governments that can be formed in this House?  I do not think so and I intend to demonstrate how a better Government can and will be formed to replace the present one at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> For my part I have no fear for this country as far as the election of a new Dáil is concerned.  The people are wise enough and the case for a new Government is strong enough.  I wish to give notice in this debate that Fine Gael are seeking a mandate for a new Government from the people.  If the people decide that we must enter into discussions with other paries to form such a Government, then we will do so willingly but on the basis of clear and well understood parameters, to which I will refer in some detail.  Let me repeat that the people do not and will not have to tolerate this Government indefinitely without any choice being offered.  They will have a choice, whether it be his year, next year or the year after. They do not have to continue with this Government for ever.  The Progressive Democrats and the 55 Fianna Fáil Deputies have decided between them that in this, the 26th Dáil, we can provide nothing better than the present Government. I am utterly convinced, however, that the 27th Dáil, whenever elected, will elect a new Government which will be immeasurably better than the present one.</P>
    <P>How can we build a Government which will be better in every way than the Government who seek renewed authority in this House today?  As the leader of the largest united party in Dáil Éireann, I recognise that some responsibility falls on my shoulders.  The Taoiseach has no clear objectives on any political issue, nor have his Government. I will state what I intend will be the clear objectives of the Government that will be formed whenever a new Dáil is elected.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has had half-baked notions on Northern Ireland in the past. When he found himself at a critical point in the nation's history in 1980 and had something almost between his hands, he allowed it to drift away.  Then, having virulently opposed the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985, he operated it compliantly from 1987 on.  Now he is waiting for the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to make another initiative. He is waiting for the British.  Where <Col N="1276" /> is the purpose, where is the vision in regard to Northern Ireland of this Government who are seeking a renewed mandate?  What is their vision for the future of this country?  They have not got one as far as Northern Ireland is concerned or any other matter.  In the next Dáil we can and will elect a Government who will make real progress on Northern Ireland, based on an explicit recognition in Articles 2 and 3 of our Consitution of the right of the people of Northern Ireland to decide their own future.  There is an unlimited prospect for future prosperity and harmony on this island once that vital recognition is granted.  It can open a new era.  I am convinced that in the next Dáil a Government will be formed which will be committed to the creation of that new era, based on the mutual respect which has been lacking.</P>
    <P>The economic objectives of Deputy Haughey and his Government are equally unclear.  In 1980 and 1981 he compounded the financial crisis caused by his own party from 1977.  In Opposition from 1981, he was simply destructive.  In 1987 he accepted the budget that had been prepared by the previous Government. Some progress was achieved.  To borrow Professor Lee's phrase again, because the Government between 1987 and 1989 did not entirely possess, they had to perform. A minority Government had to perform because they could not simply sit back and enjoy power, as the Coalition have done for the past two years.  That is the difference between those two Governments.</P>
    <P>All the progress up to 1989 was thrown away frivolously in the general election called that year.  Few general elections in any country were so blatant about power rather about policy.  What economic purpose was served by that election? None.  The two parties who lost seats in 1989 proceeded to form a Government.  As a result of this contract the Taoiseach and the Progressive Democrats from 1989 had all the power they craved but whereas under a minority Government without full power the nation's finances were brought under <Col N="1277" /> control, once we had a majority Government with full power the nation's finances almost immediately started to slip out of control again.  In more recent times, the Taoiseach even went so far as to undermine his Minister for Finance.  I say this with some feeling because I never saw it happen in any Government in which I was involved.  The rift in Fianna Fáil that burst wide open last Saturday can be traced back to the by-passing of the Minister for Finance in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> negotiations. That was followed by the deliberate undermining of the Minister for Finance's radio interviews on the economy. It was all a game.  The work of earlier years was wasted.  There was no sense of economic purpose or economic leadership.</P>
    <P>The recently revised Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats joint programme bears all the marks of this collapse of collective and individual responsibility. The programme's promises on tax and PRSI cannot be met without raising approximately £640 million by some other means.  Yet no answer is given anywhere as to how or where this £640 million is to be raised.  Without such an answer as to where the money is to come from this vaunted programme is not a policy, it is just an aspiration.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, of course, has similar flaws.  It contains financial commitments, which I have detailed in a statement in my circulated speech, amounting to £888 million.  Again we are not told where a single penny of this is to be found.  Like the joint programme between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, it is not a policy, it is just an aspiration because they have not said how the money will be found.  It is not a policy because a policy is about choices.</P>
    <P>There is a well known phrase &mdash; I have heard this used by former secretaries of the Department of Finance on many occasions &mdash; that to govern is to choose. In neither the joint programme with the Progressive Democrats nor in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> have this Government had the <Col N="1278" /> courage to make any choices about where the money was to be found to pay for any of the aspirations they contained.  They did not choose; they simply aspired. Because they aspired without choosing they have no right to call either of those documents a policy for the future of this country.  The failure to answer these questions about how promises are to be paid for shows the claim of the Progressive Democrats to be a policy driven party, to be nothing more than just pious rhetoric.  In the sense of making real choices about how things are to be paid for, the Progressive Democrats are no more policy driven than Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>However, I am determined that the next Dáil will elect a Government who will have clear economic policies.  It is Fine Gael's intention that any Government formed in the next Dáil should agree prior to taking office on certain basic economic parameters.  There will have to be a negotiated agreement between the parties forming the Government to limit Exchequer borrowing for each year and an agreement that there will be a balanced current budget over a ten-year period so that we can get the debt-GNP ratio down to 60 per cent, something we must do in order to take part in the proposed single European currency.</P>
    <P>I am also determined that there will be an explicit agreement prior to the formation of the Government in the next Dáil that taxation will not be allowed to exceed its present proportion of GNP. Basic budgetary policy must be agreed in advance of the formation of any Government. That did not happen with this Government but it will happen with the Government who will be elected in the next Dáil.  Only thus will we have a sound financial framework within which our jobs crisis can be overcome.  This Government have shown their lack of any sense of collective purpose in its most extreme form in the way they have reacted to the recent rapid increase in unemployment.  They have not outlined any jobs strategy.  They do not even have a Minister with overall responsibility for <Col N="1279" /> employment matters.  They rejected, dismissively, the suggestion of an all-party forum on jobs, put forward by Fine Gael and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. However, having done what they have no policy of their own.</P>
    <P>I am determined that the new Government to be elected in the next Dáil will resolutely tackle Ireland's unemployment problem.  The people now in office are saying that nothing can be done, there is no hope, and the Government cannot solve the unemployment problem.  My party have already started work on a comprehensive jobs Bill designed, in one decisive overall legislative measure, to clear away all the blockages to job creation right across our social system in areas such as taxation, social insurance, labour law, rents policy, means tests and sectoral policies.  Our aim is to have one comprehensive legislative measure that can be put into effect in the first three months of the new Administration in the next Dáil.  We also want to ensure that all Members of the Dáil, Backbench and Front Bench Members, Opposition and Government, will be allowed play a constructive role in helping to solve Ireland's jobs crisis. We will establish in the next Dáil an all-party jobs forum, to work with the social partners, something which both Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have refused to countenance.</P>
    <P>There is another area in which the utter purposelessness of this Government is evident, that is, their reaction to developments in Europe.  The Government have no policy on how Europe should develop. The Taoiseach, going to Europe, is like someone going to a meeting with a notice and a copy of the agenda in his pocket but with no proposals to make.  Ireland is no more than a passive bystander in the debates now being conducted by other countries.  We are waiting, to use the Taoiseach's words, for something to &ldquo;emerge&rdquo;.  We are not pushing for anything in particular, apart, of course, from looking for more money, as usual.</P>
    <P>We have heard <i>ad nauseam</i> from the Taoiseach that he has a list, an agenda <Col N="1280" />&mdash; a very passive word &mdash; but what objectives does he have?  We know what is on the agenda.  We know the agenda would be the same no matter what Government were in office.  We also know about Maastricht which has been recited so often it has almost become a mantra used by the Government to lull people into a hypnotic trance &mdash; if one keeps saying &ldquo;Maastricht&rdquo; often enough people will go to sleep.  What do the Government intend to do at Maastricht?  What do they intend to do about unemployment?  The Progressive Democrats have repeated the words &ldquo;tax reform&rdquo; so often that they have also become a sort of mantra used to lull people into somnolence.  What do the Government intend to do about tax reform?  There is no clue given in either the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> or the Joint Programme for Government about the answer to that question.  They have not said where a single penny to pay for any of the aspirations in those documents will be found.</P>
    <P>In the real sense of the phrase, this Government have no common purpose. The key which made the Irish soccer team a success was that Jack Charlton gave them a sense of common purpose.  This Government have given the people no sense of common purpose.  It is all about staying in office and has nothing to do with achievement.  There is no sense of what ought to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not outline in his speech any mandate for the Ministers being appointed.  It is simply a way of rearranging people for some internal party purpose.  No purpose or sense of direction has been offered to the people. That, more than the scandals, is what is wrong with this Government at present.</P>
    <P>My aim is that the next Dáil, whenever it is elected, will elect a Government who will be committed to a clear and explicit European policy.  I hope they will be a Government committed to the creation of a federal Europe.  They will also be committed to the genuine radical reform of European institutions to protect small nations in a democratic way through the establishment of an elected European Senate with equal representation for all <Col N="1281" /> states similar to that in other federal democracies, such as the United States of America.  They will also be explicitly committed to a social Europe and not just to a free trade area.  The new Government which I hope will be elected in the next Dáil will give Europe a lead on matters such as aid for the Third World. However, they will also stand for a Europe in which there will be no hiding places for terrorists.  I want to see a Government in this State fully committed to effective extradition throughout Europe where political motives will never excuse violent crime of any kind.  I do not believe we have such a Government in office today.</P>
    <P>I am determined that in the next Dáil we will have a Government who will behave in a collectively responsible way in full accord with the Constitution.  We do not have such a Government at present.  The Constitution states:</P>
    <P>The Government shall meet and act as a collective authority and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by members of the Government.</P>
    <P>This Government have not honoured those provisions of our Constitution. Even in the past two days their members have spoken of &ldquo;standing aside&rdquo; from decisions such as the sacking of Ministers of State.  Standing aside is the notion of collective responsibility in this Government. The servants of one Minister, the Taoiseach, actually briefed the press against another Minister in his so-called collectively responsible Government. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was finalised without the direct involvement of the then Minister for Finance. This was a clear breach of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, which requires the involvement of the Department of Finance in any matter affecting public finance.  The present Taoiseach involves himself directly in the business of individual Departments, meeting State company chairmen, without the involvement of the responsible Ministers.  This is not collective Government.  There is an <Col N="1282" /> old saying: &ldquo;What is everybody's business is nobody's business&rdquo;.  In this Government the government of Ireland is nobody's business.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the next Dáil will elect a Government that will adhere strictly to the sound principle of collective responsibility.  I hope that the next Government will not continue the luxury &mdash; which the present Government have &mdash; of separate internal rival press offices, financed by the taxpayer on behalf of the two parties forming the Government.  My intention is that the next Government will conduct their business in Cabinet, with proper minutes and proper accountability and not in the private home of the Taoiseach or any other Minister.</P>
    <P>My intention is that the next Government will respect the independence and integrity of the office of the Minister for Finance.  No financial commitments will be entered into that do not have either his or her consent, or the authority of a prior Cabinet decision.  That is the only sort of Government in which the people of Ireland will be able to have entire confidence.  The next Dáil will end for good the historic aberration of personal Government of a kind we have seen in the early eighties and for the last four years but never before in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>The scandalous events that came to the surface in the last two months underline more than anything else the need to return to a genuinely responsible system of collective Cabinet Government.  It is simply not acceptable that we have a Government in office today that has refused to take any ministerial responsibility for what happened in Irish Sugar, notwithstanding the very frequent meetings between the Taoiseach and the chairman of the board.  Nobody accepts responsibility. They have lots of meetings but they will take no responsibility.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that we have a Government in which no Minister will take responsibility either for what has happened in Telecom.  Everyone else is being investigated except the responsible Ministers.  It is not acceptable that no Minister in this Government will take <Col N="1283" /> responsibility for the appointment of a chairman of Aer Rianta, notwithstanding the acknowledged leaking &mdash; known to the Government &mdash; of financial information by that man's company to the commercial rival of a national airline. Nobody takes responsibility for that decision in this Government.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable either that the Head of the Government has refused to take any personal responsibility for giving plainly misleading answers to this House on 22 October last.  In all of these matters and in all the other matters I referred to earlier in my speech, we have a Government that, quite literally, wishes to stand aside from responsibility for everything that is happening in this country.  Therefore, in the real sense of the term, because they wish to stand aside, we do not actually have a Government.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats may well be prepared to accept that for the rest of the 26th Dáil, for the next two and a half years or the next two and a half months or whatever.  That situation will not apply in the next Dáil.  The next Dáil will not operate on the basis of inner circles or evasive answers.  It is my intention that the Government in the next Dáil will establish a comprehensive committee system to which every member of the Government will be answerable.  Every Member of this House, through such a committee, will have a voice and a constructive voice.  If, for example, the privatisation of a State company is being contemplated, each step along the road will be explained by Ministers to a committee of this House.  Decisions by Ministers to appoint consultants will be taken on the basis of open tender and not of private discussion.</P>
    <P>Ministers will, I propose, be compellable to give evidence before the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  We will never again have, as we have had in the last few weeks, the spectacle of a Minister refusing to appear before that or any other committee of this House.  Why is that?  If Ministers themselves are properly supervised by this House they, in turn, will properly <Col N="1284" /> supervise the companies and agencies under their control.  That is the key to preventing future scandals, proper supervision. That is what Dáil Éireann is for. Dáil Éireann is there to ensure that the Government do their job.  Because this Dáil, through no fault of its own, has not been doing its job, Ministers in turn have not been doing theirs and we have allowed a situation of the kind that came to the surface in the last two months to arise.</P>
    <P>This country has the capacity to perform and to win.  I know that.  Those who are content simply to possess office for the next two and a half years should first move aside.  They must allow this nation to run its own affairs, to build an Ireland, as part of a Europe of which we can all be proud.  We need a Government that will govern with a purpose and that will thereby release the creative energies of our people in the way they have been released in so many other spheres of endeavour but have not been released in the area of politics or economics because, quite simply, the people who are supposed to provide the leadership in that area &mdash; the Government &mdash; are not doing so.  We can do better and we will do better.  In the next Dáil we will have a better Government than the present one, and I am determined that that will happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the best efforts of the Taoiseach &mdash; not particularly inspired efforts &mdash; this morning there is, unfortunately, a jaded ring about the composition of the Government.  It is hard to imagine that the Taoiseach could have put a team together that look as tired and as stale as the outgoing team, but he <Col N="1285" /> seems to have managed that.  I compliment and congratulate the two new Ministers on becoming part of the Cabinet. Obviously, it is a major responsibility for both Deputy Davern and Deputy McDaid.  I would, however, recommend that they do not sell their family cars because they may well need them in the very near future.</P>
      <P>I question whether Deputy Davern &mdash; or perhaps Minister Davern if all the backbenchers return to vote this evening at 10 o'clock &mdash; has the vision and the capacity in relation to education which is at a very vital stage, given that the outgoing Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, has announced, on a number of occasions &mdash; and some of the newspapers have informed us &mdash; that a very important Green Paper on education will be emerging.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDaid is moving into the Department of Defence, a Department which has had difficulties in the last number of years and it remains to be seen what Deputy McDaid does in that Department.  Obviously, both Deputies have been rewarded for their stoic defence of their leader in recent weeks. I also congratulate the junior Ministers, Deputies Kitt, Ahern and O'Donoghue and wish them well in their appointments to whatever Departments they are assigned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was evident to all of us who watched the events of last Saturday that there would not be any serious change in relation to this Government, that there was not going to be a spirit of openness or honesty and that there would be no willingness to rid the country of the air of scandals which has gripped us for months.  Obviously, and more importantly, there would not be a new departure in relation to unemployment or emigration, there would not be a fresh look at the homeless or new concern for the rights of handicapped or disabled people and there would not be any compassion for children in this nation who go to bed hungry every night.  Unfortunately, the legacy of this Government will be essentially the same as the legacy as that which preceded it.  For that reason it is not a <Col N="1286" /> Government that deserve even a moment's honeymoon in this House &mdash; although how they could enjoy a honeymoon, with so many uneasy bedfellows around, would be a mystery.</P>
    <P>The Government announced today is essentially the same cynical collection of time servers, imbued with the same tired old philosophy of office at any price, and presided over by the same malevolent spirit, as the one that went into conclave with the rest of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party last Saturday.  They hung together then, just about, and final judgment on their performance must wait for another day, when the Irish people get an opportunity to express the judgment that they did not have the opportunity to express last Saturday.</P>
    <P>If Ireland had woken up last Saturday to hear that the Taoiseach had resigned, that at last the backbenchers of his own party had stood up to this man who for so long has treated them with absolute contempt, there would have been a huge national sigh of relief.  There would have been the beginnings of hope that at last we could get away from the smell of corruption and petty venality in high office; we could begin to dismantle the golden circle that has threatened the fabric of democratic Government; and we could begin to see some light let in to some of our darkest corners.</P>
    <P>Or, if the Taoiseach had decided, unilaterally, to use that Napoleonic phrase that he has frequently used, to &ldquo;pass on the baton&rdquo; to some other leader of his party, there would have been perhaps the beginnings of a new respect for the Taoiseach &mdash; the beginnings of a realisation that this man had a sense of dignity after all.  If he had decided that his long suffering party needed and deserved a change, there would have been some admiration for the personal sacrifice he had made on their behalf.  If he had decided that the country as a whole needed and deserved a fresh start, there would have been a sense that at last he had discovered the value of real democracy.</P>
    <P>Instead, we witnessed the spectacle of a democratically elected Taoiseach <Col N="1287" /> describing dissent with his party as nothing more than a &ldquo;power-grab&rdquo;&mdash; and this from a Taoiseach who has all the experience to know a real power-grab when he sees it.  We watched the secret trading and brow beating, we saw the pressure building up, we saw young Deputies being exposed to the cynical realities of manipulation by Deputies longer in tooth and claw than them and the realisation began to dawn that there was no way this Taoiseach was going to allow himself to receive the message that virtually every member of his party, in their heart of hearts, wants to send him.</P>
    <P>In the process, of course, we saw some of the things we have come to expect in these situations.  We saw the Minister for Agriculture and Food dithering, hoping to use the occasion to copperfasten his already very shaky seat at the Cabinet table.  We saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs debasing himself on national television on the boss's behalf.  We saw other contenders weighing up the main chance and deciding that it was more important in the end to do Deputy Reynolds in than to take any action that smacked of principle.</P>
    <P>In the immediate aftermath of last Saturday we saw some of the backbenchers, like the one who appeared on television on Monday night and accused a journalist of &ldquo;doing all right&rdquo; out of the tapping of her telephone, behaving like carrion birds circling over a carcase.  It is a sad state of affairs when remarks like that can be thrown at reputable journalists &mdash; that they are &ldquo;doing all right&rdquo; because they got a justificable award from the courts as a result of telephone tapping by members of the Government.  It is a sad day when Deputies make remarks like that on the national airwaves.</P>
    <P>Of course, we saw some Deputies prepared to make a sacrifice for the sake of change.  I know that the great majority of Deputies in this House believe that the motivation of most, if not all, of the 22 who were prepared to be counted, was honourable.  I do not believe they should be referred to as a gang.  In fact, I suggest that being one of the 22 is a mark of <Col N="1288" /> distinction, a sign that they had the interests of the people of Ireland at heart. There is a certain amount of sacrifice in giving up office in order to express dissent, even though describing it as the &ldquo;ultimate sacrifice&rdquo;, as some people have, is a very revealing phrase, because it suggests that nothing matters more than office.  In fact, being able to look at yourself in the mirror matters more than office, and I feel sure that every one of the 22 can look at themselves more comfortably this week than they could last week.</P>
    <P>There was, of course, still some measure of hope that by now the Progressive Democrats would have had enough, given the reason for their foundation. The reasoning was simple: if Deputies Reynolds and Flynn could take no more of the stultifying grip of the Taoiseach, how could the Progressive Democrats fail to see the writing on the wall?  But, of course, we reckoned without the keen sense of national duty of the Progressive Democrats.  The party described recently, and perhaps sarcastically, by one commentator as the &ldquo;standard bearers of integrity&rdquo; were not long in throwing in their lot with the 55. I cannot figure out for the life of me, and perhaps never will, where the national duty lies in that.</P>
    <P>It is no secret that Progressive Democrat Members, supporters, and voters are all equally dismayed by the spate of scandals which has engulfed the Government. That have made this well known to the press.  Senior Progressive Democrat members make little secret of their belief that there is something rotten at the very heart of this Government.  Yet they appear to see it as their &ldquo;national duty&rdquo; to prop up a Government which failed to keep the trust of a significant proportion of their own backbenchers, and a Taoiseach who has in the last 12 months sacked one-quarter of the Ministers he was entitled to appoint, Ministers who were themselves among the key people who made him Leader of Fianna Fáil in the first place.  At the centre of it all is the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, perhaps the nearest thing Ireland has to a <Col N="1289" /> medieval prince &mdash; with the cunning of a Machiavelli, the lifestyle of a Louis XIV, and the apparent personal wealth of a Medici.  The only thing that spoils the picture is that Medici always used poison to dispatch his enemies &mdash; but obviously there were no Hiace vans in those days.</P>
    <P>For the last three months Ireland and the Government have been convulsed by a string of scandals.  When they are all added up, one thing is clear, and is worth repeating &mdash; there is now in Ireland a small clutch of people pulling strings, stings and strokes, all for their own benefit. None of these strokes have added to the quality of life in Ireland or to the overall efficiency of our economy.  All they have done is to make a small group of people richer and ever more ambitious.</P>
    <P>I have already said that we value enterprise in Ireland.  We need it.  We admire the skills and talents of our entrepreneurs, and we do not grudge people the reward they have secured, but there is a line between hard driving, efficient, and pragmatic business on the one hand and business that has taken the law into its own hands in the other.  The Government must walk that line, creating and leading the ethos and the standards that ensure that business is conducted according to rules of ethics.  What we see all around us now only becomes possible when Government have stopped walking the line.  The ethics that are behind all the deals and strokes I have already mentioned are the ethics of a Government that believes in nods and winks rather than in standards.  The style of Government that the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, has created, and the ethos that runs through these events, has been all too predictable for a long time.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Taoiseach, that, despite the changes made in the Government, that ethos has to end.  That is what many people had hoped for last Saturday and that is what the 22 Members of Fianna Fáil who voted against the Taoiseach last Saturday set out to end.  It is unfortunate for Ireland that their attempts failed.</P>
    <P>The string of scandals which have come <Col N="1290" /> to light have stirred anger in the people. The anger is at the greed and amoralism that has been displayed.  It is vital that we begin to see the connection between the scandals and the ethos behind those scandals and a lot of other things that are wrong with this country.  There are many things wrong in this country at present. It is not pure accident that if one wants to travel out to the much-lauded new K-Club in Straffan one passes tumbledown and grossly inadequate sheltered workshops on the way.  If one went down to visit the Financial Services Centre, one would be no more than a stone's throw from one of the busiest labour exchanges in the country.</P>
    <P>It is not an accident that, side by side with the greatest cutbacks in essential services that we have ever seen, there has been an enormous increase in disposable income in a few hands.  Side by side with poverty on a scale unprecedented in recent Irish history, we have daily displays of ostentatious and unseemly wealth.  Of course, these things are only visible to those who want to see them &mdash; it is hard to see poverty when one is flying over it in a helicopter on the way to one's wind-powered island, or driving past it in a State Mercedes.</P>
    <P>What we have witnessed in this country in the last few years has been the beginning of a social breakdown.  The Taoiseach said last weekend that he was not ready to depart.  The legacy he would be leaving if he left at this stage would perhaps be one that he could not live with because the legacy of the present Coalition Government is an appalling legacy which the people on the streets and in the houses know all too well.  I would say that the average Fianna Fáil backbencher who left here in a great state of discomfort this morning, knows all too well or will find out all too soon.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is begrudgery to point out the social breakdown that is taking place.  The real begrudgery lies in the hearts of those who believe that only the strongest should be encouraged, those who believe that as long as income tax on £50,000 a year is kept low, it is all right for those with no income at all to <Col N="1291" /> queue for health care.  The real begrudgers are those who will not spend money on leaking roofs in our schools around the country and defend that by saying no money is available, but they will give £8 million to University College Dublin to buy a property it neither wants nor needs.  The real begrudgers are those who ignore the growing housing lists, but will spend millions of pounds on turning the Temple Bar area into a glorified film set which this country needs like a hole in the head.</P>
    <P>It is our role in this House to criticise, and there is much to criticise about the performance of this Government over the last number of months.  We also, however, have a duty to be constructive. I would like to think that the new Cabinet will start to put things right.  The challenge facing them, as in this debate today &mdash; in which obviously none of them is interested &mdash; is to see if they will start putting right the things that are wrong in Ireland at present.  I would particularly like to think they will tackle some of the wider and fundamental issues in a new and different spirit although I doubt if they can do so under the leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <P>Let me take one crucial example that we have been neglecting here in recent months.  It is the whole question of European integration.  Will they tackle that whole issue about which we have been at pains to discover, have the Government a position on this matter?  Will they tackle it now, even at this late stage, with courage and resourcefulness?  I would certainly hope that the performance of our Minister for Foreign Affairs in these discussions will show a little bit more finesse, character and genuineness than his performance on television last Thursday.  I thought he was going to come out of the television screen at us at one stage. Maybe he was trying to do that to get away.</P>

      <P>The people of this country must be taken into the confidence of the Government in relation to this debate. Otherwise it will be far too late to open up the debate on European integration. They will have to make it clear very quickly that on the economic front they will forge alliances with the other peripheral nations of Europe to challenge the centre to develop as one community with equality and justice as cornerstones of economic policy.</P>
      <P>They will have to demand that job creation be placed on the European agenda so that investment can be encouraged away from the centre, to which it naturally gravitates, and towards the edges.  They will have to ensure that Europe has a social agenda which will enable workers and citizens alike to enjoy the benefits of European economic growth.</P>
      <P>They will have to make it clear at every level that the survival of our agriculture is important to us not just for all the crucial economic reasons but also because agriculture is part of what we are as a people.  Above all they will have to make it clear on behalf of us all that we do not see the new Europe as a plaything for financiers and traders.  We do not want to bring a shopping list to Europe; we want Europe to rediscover its commitment as a community of people.</P>
      <P>On the European political front, I want this Government to open up the debate about peace, security, defence so that all the people can take part in it.  I want Ireland to be able to play its full part in the developing Europe, not by sneaking off to meetings and issuing press releases saying that neutrality is still as solid as it was in de Valera's day, but by shaping a commitment to peace and security throughout the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say also to the Government that they must play a full and vigorous role but not one strictly limited by our self-interest.  I want Ireland to be a force for good in Europe, leading the way in relation to the Third World, opposing oppression wherever it occurs, and able to take a moral stand on the great issues <Col N="1293" /> of the day.  That may well mean the redefining of our traditional neutrality into a more active and open concept.  If so, let us do it openly and by the will of the people of this country, not in the hole-in-the-corner way that has characterised the last few years.</P>
    <P>Above all, there will be no excuse and no forgiveness for this Government if they come to the people in six or eight months time and forces through a <i>fait accompli</i> on Europe in a referendum.  We have called again and again in this House for the opening of a real debate about European integration and what it means. The greatest crime would be to keep the people of this country in the dark until it is too late for change and debate.  Ireland will be one of the few member states of Europe where a referendum will be necessary.  That referendum must be conducted on the basis of full information and participation by every citizen.  Otherwise it will constitute another great sellout of our legitimate national interest.</P>
    <P>On the home front, the most immediate task facing this Government is next year's budget and the Book of Estimates due out in the next couple of weeks.  Let me make the position of the Labour Party clear.  If the commitment contained in the revised Programme for Government to reduce personal taxation can only be accomplished at the cost of further hacking and cutting of essential social services, then I say here and now that no reduction in personal taxation arrived at through those means would be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I say here and now that we will oppose, with all the resources at our command, any budget that sets out to make the health services or the homeless or those dependent on social welfare pay for a further reduction in the top rate of income tax.  We will oppose any effort to make PAYE workers subsidise their own tax cuts through cuts in mortgage relief. We will oppose any effort to make the unemployed pay for fiscal rectitude through further deflation of the economy.</P>
    <P>No Government who have chosen to preside over ostentatious displays of <Col N="1294" /> wealth, who have facilitated rip-offs through their own incompetence, and failed to address the ever-growing issue of tax evasion through offshore vehicles, who have bowed again and again to the lobbies of the rich and powerful, have the right or the authority to make the most defenceless and unrepresented sections of the community pay for the Government's own mismanagement.</P>
    <P>I would like to make some comments on what I suppose are the relevant parts of the reshuffle that has taken place this morning.  The former Minister for Agriculture and Food who has had, to say the least, a most uncomfortable journey over the last weeks and months, is now being transferred to Labour.  From Agriculture to Labour is, of itself, a little mind boggling. I worry about Minister O'Kennedy being in charge of industrial relations in this country.  I certainly hope that he has better success there than he had in Agriculture over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy O'Hanlon, I do not think that anybody waiting to get into a hospital in this country will shed tears about Deputy O'Hanlon's departure from the Department of Health.  I hope that he protects our environment better than he has protected our health services in the last number of years.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke is departing from Education at a time when we are about to embark on a very important debate on education, on the basis of education in our society and on the control and management of education in our society.  In some respects it is unfortunate that she is not left there to finish that task.  Perhaps now we understand why the Green Paper had to be leaked over a number of weeks by certain newspapers before it was published.  It is out there in some form now and perhaps she can bring some compassion to the area of health where it is badly needed and has been sadly lacking for the last number of years.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious task and serious obstacles facing the Government.  I looked at the Fianna Fáil backbenchers this morning when they heard the appointment of Deputies McDaid and Davern to Government.  Certainly there <Col N="1295" /> were some very sad and bemused people leaving this Chamber.  I suspect that even at this stage, the caucuses of last week may be taking place again this week.</P>

      <P>I think that the Taoiseach may have yet again, in trying to get out of the hole which he has been digging for himself over the last number of years, has dug himself deeper into it.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, we have been rather direct and blunt during the past few weeks trying to get the message across to the Taoiseach, and the message which echoed throughout the country last week when thousands of people were surveyed in the tele-polls was that the overwhelmingly majority felt the time had come for the Taoiseach, a man who has been in the political arena for over 30 years, to go.  They felt the Ireland we want, the new Ireland that our young people want to live in, had passed the Taoiseach by and they would welcome an opportunity to have new politics; all of his own younger backbenchers are saying they want new politics.  They want to come into the House to make a contribution to government.  I put it to the Taoiseach in plaintive language, in a way that he better than anyone else would understand, I suppose going is out of the question?</P>

      <P>The result of the past few dramatic weeks is that the Government are now inherently <Col N="1296" /> unstable, that Deputy Haughey is now a minority Taoiseach whose days are clearly numbered and that his own supporters chose to make the decision of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party an issue of confidence in him, not just as party leader but as Taoiseach.  Given that so many of his own party voted against him, it is now clear that more than 100 Members of the Dáil, two-thirds, have no confidence in Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach.  Those who voted no confidence in Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach only three days ago cannot now come into the Dáil and vote confidence in him and expect to retain any shred of credibility. Even if his opponents are prepared to eat humble pie by trooping through the lobbies with their sworn enemies at the end of this debate, the indisputable fact is the Dáil, the country and the world know that Deputy Haughey is a minority Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The motion for the appointment of two new Members to the Cabinet comes during one of the most extraordinary phases in Irish politics experienced in recent decades.  Since the story of Mr. Chris Comerford's claim to a beneficial interest in Talmino first broke in the press at the beginning of September, the country has been shocked by an unprecedented wave of scandals involving semi-State companies.  We have seen the Coalition Government go to the brink over the bitter differences between the two parties arising from the negotiations on the review of the Programme for Government and we have seen the Fianna Fáil Party almost tear themselves apart in the course of a leadership battle of unprecedented viciousness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dismissal of two senior Ministers by the Taoiseach has only one precedent in the history of the State, and the circumstances of May 1970 were very different from those of November 1991.  In many respects the reverberations of the 1970 dismissals are still being felt in Irish politics and it is likely that the events of the past two months will have a similar long term impact on our political system. The appointment of the two new Ministers may mark the end of a chapter but <Col N="1297" /> it is certainly not the end of the story. Neither have we heard the end of the scandals.  Many questions remain to be answered by the Government about their handling of the Greencore, Telecom and Carysfort affairs.  Yet more are likely to arise from the results of the various inquiries into these affairs when they are made public.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach can never expect to enjoy the confidence of all parties in the Dáil; no Taoiseach can expect that. However, the minimum requirement for political leadership and for the normal conduct of Government business is that the Taoiseach should at least enjoy the confidence and support of those on his own side of the House.  This is clearly not so.  No Taoiseach with so little support can have any credibility and no government led by a Deputy in this situation can win the confidence of the people. The credibility of Government and of the Oireachtas will suffer as long as Deputy Haughey stubbornly clings to power.  It will take more than the appointment of two new Ministers and a reshuffle of the pack to breathe any credibility back into this Administration.</P>
    <P>The cracks in Fianna Fáil which have been evident since Deputy Haughey first came to power, and which have been papered over for more than ten years, have been exposed to the light of day by the vicious leadership struggle of the past few weeks.  The monolith which has dominated Irish politics almost since Independence is now fragmenting. Fianna Fáil can never hope to govern on their own again.  Given their record that is no bad thing.</P>
    <P>It is very evident also that the leadership battle within Fianna Fáil is far from over.  The refusal of the three Ministers of State to resign their positions and their continued operation as a group with the two dismissed Ministers is clearly intended to show that the challenge to the authority of Deputy Haughey remains very much alive.  Despite the endorsement of a majority within his party, I do not believe the Taoiseach is a fit person to be head of our Government. <Col N="1298" /> If there was any doubt about his suitability for office, it has been removed by the events of the past few weeks and has been confirmed by his vindictive dismissal of Deputies Geoghegan-Quinn, Smith and Treacy.</P>
    <P>I do not have any particular sympathy for the two Ministers who have lost their jobs.  They, like the other members of the Cabinet, must take their share of the blame for the appalling mess in which this country now finds itself.  They made their bid for power, miscalculated badly and paid the price.  Their loss will be cushioned by generous ministerial pensions and, in the case of Deputy Reynolds, he has his substantial business interests to fall back on.</P>
    <P>I have a measure of sympathy for the three Ministers of State who are now to be given the &ldquo;Charlie chop.&rdquo;  The ranks of the Ministers of State are not exactly overburdened with talent and the three who are now to go are among the most talented and capable.  Unlike Deputy Reynolds and Deputy Flynn, they were not bound by the principle of collective Cabinet responsibility.  I believe they should have been free to make their positions known on the matter of their party leadership without losing their jobs. Their dismissal is, I am afraid, an example, as I said earlier, of the vindictiveness of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I am however, quite astonished at the appointment of the two new members of Cabinet.  Slavering unquestioning loyalty to Deputy Haughey seems to have been the criterion used rather than talent or ability.  Both Deputies Davern and McDaid have had fairly undistinguished careers, to put it mildly, as Government backbenchers rarely, if ever, contributing to Dáil debates.  On the few occasions on which Deputy Davern has spoken, he has invariably managed to lower the tone of the proceedings.  When it comes to smears he is the man who is sent in to say what the Taoiseach thinks but is afraid to say himself.  There is no rock too low for him to crawl under and no sewer too putrid for him to explore.  His vicious and untrue attack on a member of the Dáil staff of The Workers' Party during the <Col N="1299" /> recent confidence debate is simply the worst example of the sort of tactics which have become his trade mark.  I cannot think of a worse role model in this House for our school children.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's decision to appoint a card carrying member of the Fianna Fáil backwoodsmen as Minister for Education is one of the most cynical decisions he has ever made.  Those who over a long period have been working for change in education, both inside and outside this House, now, unfortunately, have an ignoramus as Minister for Education.  I am not given to abuse in this House but I cannot think of any other description which fits the appointment today as Minister for Education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>What are people in Northern Ireland to make of the appointment of Deputy McDaid to the sensitive position of Minister for Defence?  We will now have as our Defence Minister a man who only 18 months ago was seen chairing from the environs of the Four Courts a man who had successfully evaded extradition to Northern Ireland to face very serious charges there arising from the Provisional IRA campaign of violence.  What message does this convey to the victims of violence in Northern Ireland?  What message do the Progressive Democrats believe that this appointment will convey?  Can they really stand over it?  We cannot blithely allow appointments of this kind to be <Col N="1300" /> made without taking into account the effect they will have on the politics of this country, either internally or externally.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that a change of leadership in Fianna Fáil will bring about any significant change in Government policy but at least it would remove the cloud of uncertainty which has cast a shadow over this Administration.</P>
      <P>I hope it would also unlock the decision-making progress and allow those decisions which need to be made to be actually taken.  My understanding is that with all the internal turmoil, little or no progress has been made on the preparation of the Estimates for next year.  Everyone accepts that, given the major miscalculations by Deputy Reynolds in his budget last January, we face a particularly severe difficulty next year.  Government Ministers have, effectively, been paralysed by indecision over the last few weeks.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have still not received the notification of the level of their rates support grants for next year, yet they are legally obliged to have their estimates published by the end of this week.  A dispute which has caused enormous disruption to the courts system has been allowed to drag on and now threatens to spread into the wider public service, yet the Minister for Justice has done nothing to seek a settlement.</P>
      <P>We face a crucially important EC Summit at Maastricht next month, yet there was neither a Minister nor Minister of State present at the important meeting of EC Finance Ministers on Monday.  The principal reason for all this has been the internal turmoil in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that it was his performance during Question Time last week when he failed to provide a satisfactory explanation as to the nature of his meetings with Mr. Bernie Cahill, or <Col N="1301" /> to clarify the contradictions between versions of the May 1990 meeting given by him and Mr. Cahill, that provoked the Taoiseach's own backbenchers into tabling the motion of no confidence.</P>
    <P>I believe the Taoiseach emerged more discredited and dishonoured than ever by his attempts to smear Opposition Deputies who had posed perfectly legitimate questions to him.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has been complaining bitterly about being hounded about the Greencore affair, but the necessity for the Opposition to pursue him on this is totally due to his evasion, his refusal to answer questions and his downright dishonesty with the House.</P>
    <P>The little information we have been able to extract from the Taoiseach has thrown a little light on the extraordinary Haughey style of Government, a system of Government where the Taoiseach meets the chairman of a major semi-State company in his own home, without the presence of the relevant Government Ministers or civil servants; &ldquo;official&rdquo; meetings in respect of which no minutes were taken, or record of decisions taken. Is it any wonder that the Opposition and the public doubt the reliability and credibility of such a Government?</P>
    <P>Since the Dáil resumed last month the Taoiseach has attempted to smear Opposition Deputies who have posed questions which he finds uncomfortable. Deputy Rabbitte and myself were subjected to this tactic during the confidence debate and Deputy Spring was given the same treatment last week.  These tactics represent a new low in the history of this House.  Supporters of the Taoiseach, in their more flamboyant moments, like to compare him to Charles Stewart Parnell. Perhaps they should now accept that a more legitimate comparison would be with another figure of 100 years ago, the notorious character assassin, William Piggot, who played such a central role in the smearing of Parnell.</P>
    <P>To add to the public concern we now have the allegations made at the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting at the weekend of illicit surveillance and telephone tapping.  If, as the allegations <Col N="1302" /> seemed to imply, these allegations were directed against public servants then it is not just a matter for the Fianna Fáil Party, but for the Government and the Dáil.  I hope that Deputy Reynolds and the others who made these allegations in the privacy of the party meeting will now come into the Dáil and place whatever evidence they have before the House.</P>
    <P>In this context, I welcome the categorical assurance given by the Minister for Justice yesterday that no telephone of any Member of the Oireachtas is now the subject of a warrant authorising tapping. Ministers for Justice have up to this refused to give a specific assurance that Oireachtas Members' telephones were not tapped.  The Minister's assurance is a step forward and I hope he will give an assurance that no Oireachtas Member's telephone will be tapped in the future.</P>
    <P>While it is understandable that the main focus of media, political and public opinion has been the dramatic spate of scandals and the Government reaction to these, this has served to divert attention from the performance of the Government in the whole economic and social areas.  It is also meant that the review of the Programme for Government did not get anything like the attention it merited and indeed it is deplorable that neither Fianna Fáil nor the Progressive Democrats thought it appropriate to bring it before the Dáil for debate and critical assessment.</P>
    <P>It is now almost a year since the Taoiseach urged the Fianna Fáil faithful to go away and tell the public about what the Taoiseach called the &ldquo;economic miracle&rdquo; his Government had performed.  Twelve months on, it is clear that the economic miracle has proved to be the mirage we suggested it would be.  Unemployment has grown to its highest ever level; there is a desperate battle among the young to get visas for the United States to escape from this country; economic growth has disappeared; the budget figures are in disarray; the health services are entering another winter on the verge of collapse; schools are being kept open by parents digging into their own pockets and the local authority housing lists are growing <Col N="1303" /> longer by the day.  Indeed it is worth reiterating the point made by Deputy John Bruton that our services for people with mental handicap are deplorable. Parents are sitting at home in quiet desperation wondering whether they will get places for their adult mentally handicapped children who are not capable of looking after themselves.  These parents fear dying and leaving their children without a safe place in which to stay.</P>
    <P>If there is any one issue, one problem, one area which sums up the utter failure of this Government, it must be unemployment. Again we have the shameful honour of having the highest rate of unemployment of the 12 member states of the European Community, twice the Community average.  Have the Government any idea of the misery caused by unemployment?  Have they any idea of the families being destroyed by unemployment?</P>
    <P>Many members of the public, I am sure, felt a twinge of sympathy for the two Government Ministers who lost their jobs in the past week, but I am sure that the touching photographs of Deputy Reynolds children chipping in to buy dad a little gift to cheer him up after he lost his job &mdash; just a little £50,000 Jaguar to take his mind off the job loss &mdash; produced a hollow laugh among the 40,000 people who had been added to the dole queues during his last 12 months as Minister for Finance, largely as a result of the economic policies of which the same Deputy was the chief architect; not for them the consolation of a new car, but the realisation that they will probably have to sell a car, if they have one, to meet the mortgage or the rent.  Not for them the comfortable cushion of a family business to fall back on, but the miserable reality of life on the dole.</P>
    <P>Apart from the moral and social arguments for combating unemployment, it is also very clear that there is an unanswerable economic argument for urgent action to deal with the problem.  Unemployment is penalising not just the unemployed, but every citizen of the State.</P>
    <P>The burden on the economy, arising <Col N="1304" /> from unemployment, is now so great that there does not seem to be any way in which the economy can be restored to full health until the majority of those on the dole queues are put back into productive work.  It is now generally acknowledged that a major factor contributing to the Government's budget figures being so off target is the growth in unemployment.</P>
    <P>The full cost to the Exchequer of unemployment is notoriously hard to compute, but from official figures it is possible to establish that the direct cost in terms of additional social welfare payments and income tax foregone is at least £2,300 million.  According to the summary of public expenditure transfers from the Exchequer to the unemployed was, this year, to amount to £744 million. However, as unemployment is about 15 per cent higher than forecast this is likely to reach around £860 million.</P>
    <P>The average amount paid in income tax by PAYE workers last year was just £3,300.  On the basis of that figure, if the 260,000 on the dole were put back to work it would bring in an additional £858 million.  On the same basis, putting the unemployment back to work would bring in around £670 million in PRSI.  This gives a total of £2,388 million or around £680 for every man, woman and child in the State.  To this must be added indirect losses to the State, such as lower VAT and excise returns arising from the reduced purchasing power of the unemployed, lower rent returns to local authorities because of the structure of the differential rent system, extra health costs, supplementary welfare payments and so on.  We can only speculate as to the cost of these elements, but when they are taken into account, the total cost of unemployment is likely to be closer to £3,000 million.</P>
    <P>Shocking as these figures are, they are only part of the picture.  Of even more significance is the human and social cost, the families broken, the lives destroyed and talents wasted by the scourge of unemployment.  The abandonment by <Col N="1305" /> successive Governments of the unemployed is reaping a bitter harvest of poverty, crime, vandalism and social alienation.  This is so in rural and urban areas, where unemployment is demoralising and destroying entire communities. The utter failure on unemployment has been the greatest possible indictment of the record of all recent Governments.  It is an appalling reflection on our values as a society that unemployment has not been below 100,000 since 1980 and has never been below 200,000 since 1984.</P>
    <P>The picture is getting worse.  Reputable economists have forecast that unemployment will reach 300,000 by next year and perhaps 325,000 by the following year.  The recently published labour force survey clearly contradicts the claim by the Government that the rise in unemployment can be attributed to returning emigrants and school leavers coming on the labour market for the first time.  The labour force survey shows that in April of this year there were 5,000 fewer people in employment than at the same point in the previous year, and that there were 31,000 more unemployed than in April 1990.  The growth in unemployment is even greater than that suggested by the live register figures which showed an increase of 27,000 between April 1990 and April 1991.</P>
    <P>These figures relate to April of this year and all the indications are that the picture has worsened considerably since then, with 20,000 having been added to the live register total.  The Government have consistently argued that, despite the increase in the live register figures, there were more people at work and that the growth in unemployment was simply due to the returning emigrants and school leavers.  The Central Statistics Office figures blow a big hole in that theory.</P>
    <P>The Minister with Cabinet responsibility for industrial development which is the key to job creation, is the Minister for Industry and Commerce and leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley.  It is one of the great ironies of political life that the scandals and the turmoil within Fianna Fáil have allowed him to evade the attention and public <Col N="1306" /> odium that should be focused on him for his abysmal failure in this area.</P>
    <P>With unemployment at unprecedented levels and warnings of worse to come, one would have expected that job creation would have been the central issue in the negotiations on the review of the Programme for Government. Instead, it appears to have hardly figured at all.  The priority for the Progressive Democrats was clearly to get the upper rate of tax down to 44 per cent.  This means that people like Michael Smurfit and Dermot Desmond will be paying tax at the same rate as workers on the average industrial wage.  The super-rich in Irish society, who once paid tax at a rate of 80 per cent will now, when they pay tax at all, be able to escape at a rate of 44 per cent and will no doubt be eternally grateful to Deputy O'Malley and his colleagues for this.</P>
    <P>The unemployed have considerably less cause for joy.  The review offers not one new idea or initiative for job creation and the partners in Government have clearly decided that an unemployment level in excess of 260,000 is quite acceptable. The Workers' Party reject the notion that such levels of unemployment can become the norm in our society. Unemployment must be treated as the national economic and social disaster it is.  We must force whatever Government are in power to give it the priority it merits.  No Government who tolerate such levels of unemployment and turn a blind eye to the plight of the unemployed deserves either the confidence of the Dáil or the respect of the public.  What is needed is not just a change of faces around the Cabinet table, but a radical change in policies which will treat unemployment as the social and economic disaster it is.  Tonight my party will be voting against the appointments and treating this vote as one of no confidence in the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="The Tánaiste John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to associate myself with the remarks made by the Taoiseach this morning in gratitude to Deputy Albert Reynolds, former <Col N="1307" /> Minister for Finance, and Deputy Pádraig Flynn, former Minister for the Environment. I want to pay tribute to them for the work they did for this country over a long and difficult period in which they impacted very heavily in their own spheres to bring about an improved situation in this country.  I would like also to take this opportunity to welcome to Government Deputies McDaid and Davern and the new Airí Stáit, Deputies Michael Kitt, Dermot Ahern and O'Donoghue. I cannot let the occasion pass without paying tribute to the Airí Stáit, Deputies Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, Michael Smith and Noel Treacy, three bright young Ministers of State who will no doubt, with the two former Ministers whom I have mentioned, contribute substantively to the political and economic life of this country in the future.</P>
      <P>I have had the honour of serving in a number of Governments and with a number of different portfolios since 1977, and I am honoured to have an opportunity to continue to serve to the best of my ability.  The Taoiseach has put together in the new Government a judicious mixture of change and continuity, in my opinion a sound balance for a Government who have onerous tasks to face and difficult problems to solve.  We came to Government in 1987 and fielded a team &mdash; if I may use the metaphor used by the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy John Bruton &mdash; that any impartial judge of the economic and political scene would have to say worked well, with the inclusion of two Progressive Democrats Ministers in 1989.  A good, sound, experienced team was needed at that time, and a good, sound, experienced team is now being put before Dáil Éireann for its approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton mentioned Jack Charlton as a successful motivator and manager of a football team.  I do not know why the Deputy did not choose Seán Boylan from his own county, the successful and innovative manager of the Meath football team.  However, <i>chacun a son gout,</i> as they say in my constituency. It is worth having a look at the scene in <Col N="1308" /> 1987 in terms of the footballing metaphor. We took over when the team of the previous Government, as published, showed eight places being filled by four players.  This reality of what we found in 1987: the then Taoiseach placed his team and four of them were filling eight different places.  Mr. Jack Charlton has a reasonable budget with which to manage his team and, if I may remind Deputy Bruton, so had Mr. Seán Boylan.  What did we find?  We found that the outgoing managers had left us with a £26 billion debt and the kitty was bare.  This was not, you will admit, the most ideal circumstances in which to put a team in the field &mdash; Ministers with two portfolios, Government documents piled high on the Cabinet table because of this vacillation, this <i>aboulia,</i> this lack of ability to make decisions, admittedly caused through tension in Cabinet.  The then Minister for Health refused to move, in other words the Captain wanted to improve his team and the players told him to go to hell. Poor Minister Hussey crying into her diary at night as a result of the activities of the then Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>We have had a solid Government that made solid progress since 1987 and we have two and a half years to go and, as I said already, a good sound team in the field to bring about the changes and improvements which are necessary in our society.  Because I have a belief in the sound common sense of Members of Dáil Éireann, I know that Dáil Éireann will tonight approve of this team.  We have a Programme for Government, which has been published and agreed between the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat Members in Government and that programme is the <i>mise en scéne</i> for the next two and a half years.  The Government are committed to putting into effect the policies proposed in that programme. There are high objectives in that Programme for Government.  I am proud to say that we have already achieved a low inflation rate, if anyone takes the trouble to look at the currencies in the league of the EMS he will see that our currency is stable.  That we are competitive is proved <Col N="1309" /> by the fact that, despite adverse economic conditions in Europe and in the USA, our exports are still going very strongly indeed.  Facing the momentous decisions involved in the Maastricht meeting and the scenario in Europe, all parties in this House have an obligation to apply themselves seriously to policies and to give up, what I have been listening to on my way in, personality attacks in this House, which are unworthy of anybody, particularly a leader of a political party.</P>
    <P>We have to work on the Estimates, and we have been working on them.  Let me say this, and I said it elsewhere, over the past several weeks we have been working in Government on these Estimates and the Taoiseach and the former Minister for Finance have been collaborating in that regard.  In fact, I thought I might have been able to set up a little division between them to the advantage of the Estimate for my Department but I failed on that count because they have been committed to a very strong, strict and stringent budget, as the world knows now.  In fact, I was reflecting on the most suitable word for the new Minister for Finance and I remember that a Foreign Minister of a very powerful country made his name by saying &ldquo;Nyet&rdquo;. I think the whole policy of the Department of Finance, and the right one &mdash; despite the fact that I might be losing out for my own Department &mdash; could be summed up at this moment in the one word &ldquo;Nyet&rdquo; because that is the general consensus.</P>
    <P>I have spoken already in this House about the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress;</i> I said that when the economic history of this period is being written the greatest tribute should go to the present Taoiseach and his entourage for the successful co-operative working policy they developed with the social partners from the first programme in 1987 to the new programme.  I know that some countries, one of which I am a student, Spain, tried to get agreement with the social partners and failed.  I have great admiration for the President of that country, Mr. Felipe Gonzalez, but he failed <Col N="1310" /> because he could not get the social partners, employers, workers, etc. on his side.  That is an economic marker for the future which will not go away.</P>
    <P>It is well known that we have a problem now.  The Government and the social partners have to get together in view of the changed and changing circumstances and whatever comes out of it, the idea of economic consensus should prevail because there is no other way that this country can improve economically and socially than by the process of co-operation &mdash; Níl neart go cur le chéile.  It must be said that unemployment is the most important single factor in the future development of our economy.</P>
    <P>I know, and there are Members who know better than I, of economies which did achieve full employment based on psuedo-foundations and I regret to say that those countries have come to a state of economic chaos and I hope that is only a passing phase.  I come from an area where there is high emigration &mdash; as I have mentioned already I am one of seven, five of whom, myself included, had to emigrate at some stage but we did not whine about it.  I am glad to say we all come back and are all living in Ireland and have raised our families here.  Our objective must be the creation of employment and the lessening of emigration.  It is easy to mouth &ldquo;full employment&rdquo; but it is difficult to achieve and it must be based on solid economic progress.</P>
    <P>We have tough decisions to make in Government.  The Minister for Finance will have a very heavy burden to bear, but the July correction has steadied the finances of the country and we expect a 2 per cent overrun which, although not desirable, is a lot better than what the prophets of doom have been forecasting for our economy.  I am talking about two per cent without benefit of the moneys we got from Irish Life.  We know what happened during the year; we know why we have again to consult our partners about the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>; we know that the economy of the United Kingdom took a dive, as did that of the United States; we know that the Gulf War had an impact on the <Col N="1311" /> position.  We have an open economy, which is to our credit, and in order to survive we have to remain competitive. We cannot insulate ourselves.  Through European transfers we have received considerable aid in the recent past, we continue to receive considerable aid and we know that that will continue in the future.  We expect an upswing in the economy and we will have in place a team ready to take advantage of that.  We know that if we can reach the proper consensus with the social partners we will be in a competitive position to take advantage of that upswing.</P>
    <P>As I came into the House I heard Deputy De Rossa talking about Piggot. It is unworthy of Deputy De Rossa to mention our Taoiseach's name and that of Piggot at the same time.  If I were put to it to think of people who were collaborating with foreign Governments to do damage to their own country, as Piggot was, I certainly would not look towards the Taoiseach in this House.</P>
    <P>I thought I was dreaming, but I know that I was not, when I heard Deputy Bruton talking about a Coalition of Fine Gael, The Labour Party and The Workers' Party to provide a Government for this country.  To propose such a collection of scallwags &mdash; a rogues' gallery comprised of people with different philosophies, different beliefs and different motives &mdash; as something out of which one could make a team, alias a Government, to run this country passes all understanding. I cannot but think that, despite managing to conceal it fairly carefully in the House, Deputy Bruton has an advanced sense of humour that goes with his very distinctive laugh.  A Tower of Babel such as that could in no way speak to the people of Ireland, let alone lead them to economic prosperity.</P>
    <P>I hope that we have left the personalities and the individual attacks on honourable Members of this House, from whatever side of the House, aside and that we will develop unanimity with regard to the development of our economy.</P>

      <P>Two major issues, one national and one local, arise with regard to the ministerial appointments that we are asked to approve here today. The Taoiseach has appointed as his new Minister of Defence, Donegal Deputy Jim McDaid.  I do not know Deputy McDaid, so anything I say about his appointment is not said with any sense of personal animosity.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, has appointed Deputy McDaid to one of the senior security posts in this State.  As Minister for Defence, Deputy McDaid, with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, will sit on the Cabinet committee on State security.  He will be involved in decisions on most vital and sensitive matters of State security.  In that context, I now want to hear from Deputy McDaid &mdash; Minister McDaid if today's vote goes through &mdash; his views on Northern Ireland, on the Provisional IRA and on extradition.</P>

      <P>That is irrelevant.  I am interested in the rule of law.  I am interested in the security of this State and I am interested in those involved at ministerial level with the security of the State being completely committed to the rule of law.</P>
      <P>There are questions arising from Deputy McDaid's appointment, which I do not raise in any personal sense.  I should like to know about the case last year in which he gave evidence on behalf of a Provo, or an alleged Provo.  If I recollect correctly, that case was the McIntyre case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  What was Deputy McDaid doing at that time, providing alibi evidence in a court of law on behalf of a Provo?  I should also like to know what he was doing with anti-extradition demonstrators last year in this very city, if my recollection is correct, taking part in an anti-extradition demonstration. I could not be happy or satisfied with this appointment, in particular because of its relevance to State security, until those questions are cleared up.</P>
      <P>If my recollection of Deputy McDaid's involvement in those matters is correct then I can only ask the Taoiseach, who is now proposing Deputy McDaid for appointment as Minister for Defence, whether he has taken leave of his senses? What kind of signal is the Taoiseach sending out by appointing Deputy McDaid as Minister for Defence, the most important security post in the country?  We all know of the difficulties being experienced at the moment in getting the stalled talks on Northern Ireland under way again.  I thought that all of us were completely committed to giving what help we could to get the Brooke initiative talks under way immediately.  We are all horrified at the continuing violence and sectarian deaths.  I want to know from the Taoiseach, who has the responsibility of course, what kind of signal he is sending to the unionists in Northern Ireland by making such an appointment.  What kind of a signal is he sending to the Chief of Staff of our Army and to his officers and men, all of whom have sworn an oath of loyalty to the Constitution and whose job it is to uphold that Constitution and the rule of law when needed by way of support for the civil power?  What signal is being given to our people in the Army who have loyally upheld that oath down through the years?  The Taoiseach owes the House an explanation and, if for no other reason, until I hear a satisfactory explanation there is no possible way I could support this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned that there was one local matter arising from the appointments. <Col N="1314" /> On behalf of the people of Cork I must protest at the appointments.  The Haughey vendetta against Cork continues. Today the Taoiseach has missed another opportunity &mdash; once again he has given the back of his hand to the people of Cork.  At election time I compete for votes with my constituency colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh.  Let me honestly put on record my firm belief that, man for man, or woman, Deputy Walsh would be a more effective Cabinet Minister than most of those now included in the present administration.  Therefore, the Taoiseach does not have the excuse that he has no suitable applicant from Cork.  Deputy Walsh had the temerity at one time to belong to the original club of 22.  The Taoiseach may forget about many things, including meetings with chairman of boards and things like that but he does not forgive or forget those who in any way cross him in so far as his personal power, vanity and ambition are concerned. In his eyes, Deputy Walsh obviously has not purged his guilt by his support over the past weekend.  Therefore, the claims of Ireland's largest county and second city once again are ignored: the vital interests of Cork will continue to be ignored by this administration. Let me say very clearly to the Taoiseach and this administration, it will not be forgotten when the opportunity arises.</P>

      <P>Everybody must fight their own corner even in counties that would return four Deputies as opposed to counties that return 20 Deputies.</P>
      <P>In a general sense, this Government, whose energies are expended on survival, cannot even begin to address the horrendous problems that confront this country.  Week by week we have had revelation after revelation, scandal after scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last month we debated a motion of no confidence in the Government.  Fianna <Col N="1315" /> Fáil and the Progressive Democrats papered over the cracks then but that did not put an end to uncertainty and instability. No doubt the cracks will be papered over again today and a combination of Haughey loyalists, cowed assenters, ambitious successors, beaten dissidents and progressive democratic moralists will carry the day.  A more unlikely combination for effective Government is hard to imagine.  I say that because this Government will continue to operate in the sure knowledge of further revelations which inevitably will lead to a continuation of instability and uncertainty. One might well ask why I am so sure. The lines of a poem from my school days sum up my view: &ldquo;The truth is great and shall prevail; when all is done the lie shall rot&rdquo;.  We have been served with a recipe of half truths, evasions and deceptions over the last two months.  Satisfactory answers have not been given to direct questions; so far ministerial responsibility has been evaded; the quest for the truth goes on and on.  As long as the Taoiseach and the Government are less than forthcoming on these issues &mdash; by the way that includes Carysfort College &mdash; until such time as the full facts come to light the Government stand indicted before the people.  The 70 per cent resign vote for the Taoiseach in the RTE telepoll on last Saturday confirms this view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me be specific and provide one example of which I have first-hand knowledge.  Last Wednesday the Taoiseach answered questions dealing with his famour meeting with Chairman Bernie Cahill of Greencore.  I refer to the meeting of May of last year rather than the four other meetings to which he now admits.  Having denied that he had ever made representations or suggestions in relation to advisers, in particular NCB, the Taoiseach went on to say, as reported at columns 405/406 of the Official Report of that day:</P>
      <P>Chairman Cahill said, very specifically and clearly, that I did not make any representation or suggestions to him about the list of advisers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Yet the truth of the matter is that Chairman Cahill said no such thing.  I can vouch for that fact in that I closely questioned chairman Cahill on this very issue. Having given fulsome replies to my other questions he failed on three occasions to answer the specific question as to whether the Taoiseach had proposed, supported, approved or in any way, directly or indirectly, sought the nomination of NCB as brokers of the company.</P>
      <P>Therefore, two clear conclusions can be drawn.  The clear inference of the failure of chairman Cahill to reply to the direct question is that the Taoiseach did in fact advocate the appointment of NCB as brokers to the company.  If there is any question about this, it is all on video; I saw it on a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme. Furthermore, since chairman Cahill did not reply to these questions the Taoiseach then misled the House when he stated that the chairman specifically and clearly confirmed that he did not make any representions or suggestions to him about the list of advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a later stage in that Question Time on Wednesday last the Taoiseach came <Col N="1317" /> to a breath-taking conclusion, when he stated, as reported in columns 312/3 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>He and I are both prepared to confirm to any tribunal anywhere in this country that I made no recommendations or suggestions about that list.</P>
    <P>Having incorrectly informed the House as to what chairman Cahill said in the past at the Greencore extraordinary general meeting, he now has the presumption to tell us what chairman Cahill will swear to a tribunal in the future.  I believe that the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, will live to regret that presumption.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to dwell on the myriad of other scandals directly afflicting this Government and, indirectly, our country. Yet, other than in the speeches of Deputy John Bruton, Leader of the Opposition, no attention has been paid, no comment made and no action taken to deal with the biggest scandal of all.  I refer, of course, to the 265,000 of our people without a job.  What we witnessed recently, following the efforts to stave off the collapse of this Government were the political energies of Fianna Fáil devoted totally to saving the job of one man, that is the job of the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey.  The fact that he was able to hold on to that job is no consolation whatever to the hundreds of thousands of our people without a job. In fact, it is pretty much a guarantee that nothing will be done about their plight.</P>
    <P>The clear message that came through last weekend from Fianna Fáil is that their primary interest is the future of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Indeed, it was interesting and somewhat sad to see those who appeared to be making considerable career sacrifices do so in the interests, as they stated, of the Fianna Fáil Party rather than <i>pro bono publico</i>, in the interests of poor old mother Ireland, which is totally forgotten in all those scandals, in all these convulsions and totally forgotten by the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>I suppose I should mention the Progressive Democrats at this stage before <Col N="1318" /> they disappear from the political scene. I honestly found some grain of truth in their assertions in the past that they were part of the solution to our problems.  Now that the Progressive Democrats continue to prop up an incompetent and discredited Taoiseach they have become part of the problem.  They cannot now, or henceforth, wash their hands of the more unsavoury aspects of this Government. As they also cling on to power they will have to suffer the consequences. Pontius Pilate was regarded as a saint in the Coptic Church in Ethiopia.  I do not detect any strong movement for his canonisation in Ireland.  Perhaps that should be a warning to the Progressive Democrats as once again they attempt to wash their hands and distance themselves from the discredited aspects and incompetent failures of this administration.  It will not wash any more.  They cannot carry on as provisional Fianna Fáil while continuing to prop up the leader of that party, the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey.</P>
    <P>As we face in to a bleak winter we now have an administration which is both incompetent and discredited. The claims of a virtual economic miracle sound very hollow to the hundreds of thousands out of work.  They bring no comfort to our business people whose confidence at the moment is eroded to nil.  The expectations of our farmers who have been battered and buffeted with economic gales over the past two years are now sub-zero.</P>
    <P>In the social area this Government have succeeded in extending the delays for hip operations to almost three years in some parts of the country.  A GP with a substantial rural practice told me last weekend that he expected some of his patients on the waiting list to be dead before they were called for the operation. I myself had a constituent in to my clinic seeking such an operation who had been told that it will take at least six months before she is seen so that she can be even put on the waiting list.</P>
    <P>And to complete the sorry picture we have the liberal agenda catered for by the parties in Government who have engaged <Col N="1319" /> in agonised hair-splitting over condoms. In the Foreign Affairs area we have the promise of an insight into Government policy on the future of Europe by way of a White Paper after completion of the present negotiations and the sorry spectacle of broken promises to the starving poor of the Third World.</P>
    <P>The soiled and sorry record of this Government gives me no confidence that a sea-change can now take place.  Shuffling the deck to accommodate the vindictiveness of the Taoiseach towards those who dare to suggest that like other old age pensioners he should retire is no prescription for a solution to our problems. The spider remains at the centre of the web with a strengthened strand following the capitulation of the Progressive Democrats, who prefer to remain in office despite the evidence which mounts every day that this country would be better served by a new administration.</P>
    <P>This Government have been on autopilot for months past.  They will so continue like the rabbit mesmerised by the beam of the dazzler, unable to move, unable to perform and anxiously awaiting the next misfortune which is about to befall them.</P>
    <P>The record of this Government is soiled, sorry and shabby.  Last weekend we had an exercise in alleged democracy which was reminiscent of similar events in Europe of the thirties.  The decision which the Taoiseach extracted from his reluctant party does not change one iota the underlying economic disasters which still confront our country or the record of scandals which have unfolded with such remarkable regularity over the last few months.</P>
    <P>We are assured of various investigations and inquiries.  Where are the investigations and inquiries into ministerial responsibility?  There are many defects in the American system but if this kind of thing were brought to light there they would have committees to investigate fully and they would get at the truth.  We do not have that system here, and there is a continuation of the efforts <Col N="1320" /> to cover up, to pawn people off with half-truths and to continue to live the lie with deception and evasion.</P>
    <P>I have no confidence in the Taoiseach. My view is shared by the majority of the Members of this House and by a majority of the people.  I have no confidence in a Government led by him, all the Members of which, either on the basis of direct involvement or collective responsibility, share in the guilt.  The proposed changes will not change the position one iota. Unless there are satisfactory explanations in relation to the appointment of Deputy Jim McDaid to the Ministry of Defence, it will change things very much for the worse.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak and to support the proposals made by the Taoiseach this morning.  I want to reflect on my time in the Department of Education, to pay tribute to some Members of the House and to sketch where I feel we will be going in the future. I listened with interest to Deputy O'Keeffe when he spoke of the vicious contenders.</P>

      <P>I was wondering.  The Deputy has a fine turn of flowery language and a facility with words, although I do not agree with anything he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointments proposed by the Taoiseach, the changes in the portfolios of incumbents and the two new Cabinet appointments, reflect highly on his imagination and initiative.  He has shown care and skill in fitting particular people for certain portfolios on the basis of experience gained or future potential.  I have been in the Department of Education for nearly four years and nine months and before that I was spokesperson on education for over four years. For many years before that I was teaching. Anybody who is a parent realises that raising children is the greatest education of all.  The years spent in Marlborough Street have been some of the happiest of my life and while I relish the <Col N="1321" /> challenges which lie ahead, I cannot help but look back with nostalgia on the years spent there.  I intend to maintain the open door policy which operated in the Department of Education during my tenure.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay sincere tribute to my former constituency colleague, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  Longford and Westmeath are now divided into two separate constituencies but for many years we shared these counties together as the standard bearers for Fianna Fáil, along with the former Deputy Henry Abbott. We always managed to co-operate amiably within our separate and different counties.  I have no doubt whatsoever that at some stage we will be welcoming back Deputy Reynolds to a prominent position in Government.  The same goes for my former Cabinet colleague, Deputy Pádraig Flynn, who left an indelible mark on the conduct of local government affairs during his tenure of office as Minister for the Environment.  He introduced much legislation into the House and showed skill and imagination in various matters.  He initiated the process of reform of local government in the Act leading up to the local elections this year. The legacy he has left to his successor, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, is the further reform of local government.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome Deputy Noel Davern to the Department of Education and wish him much good luck.  I am sure he has the ideal personality and capability for this position.  One needs in that job an openness and a capacity for hard work and in particular a capacity not to get bogged down in the often quite severe grinding nature of daily work.  One needs both to keep at it and to stand back from it.  I have no doubt that Deputy Davern has those attributes and charateristics in abundant supply.  I know he will work very well with the officials in the Department of Education.  The Green Paper on Education has been published and naturally he will want to examine it and perhaps put his stamp on it.  I am satisfied that much has been achieved in the education area over the past number of years.  I know Deputy Davern will carry <Col N="1322" /> on this work and will put his stamp on the various initiatives he will undertake.</P>
    <P>I would like, in all modesty, to put some of my achievements as Minister for Education on the record.  As I have not had an opportunity to listen to the debate so far I do not know how other Ministers have dealt with such issues.  One of the highlights of my term of office was the introduction of the home-school liaison scheme.  Initially these teachers were appointed to primary schools and the scheme was extended this year to second level schools.  I believe this scheme will prove to be one of the most important developments in education.  These fully qualified teachers spend their time on what could be called pastoral duties &mdash; they visit homes to talk to parents and children, encourage parents to become involved in their children's education and encourage children to become involved in various activities both in school and outside school.  They always give a sense of community involvement in school activities.</P>
    <P>Up to September of this year 80 schools were participating in this scheme either on a single or shared basis.  I know this is one of the schemes Deputy Davern will wish to add to in the years ahead.  By coincidence, last night in the House I met a vocational school principal from Cork &mdash; Deputy O'Keeffe's favourite county. His school have just become involved in the scheme and he is very keen to get it underway and develop it.  Nowadays education is not merely a matter of what happens in classrooms, it also involves the wider community it seeks to serve. Parents can play a major role in this regard.</P>
    <P>In this context I should like to refer to the work done by both Gemma Hussey and Paddy Cooney, MEP, during their terms of office as Minister for Education. In 1985 Gemma Hussey set up the primary and post-primary tier of the National Parents' Council and gave it funding for its first year.  I was glad to be able to revive the funding element of that council.  In the meantime the parents forged ahead with their work and forged great links with other councils.  This has <Col N="1323" /> given parents great insight into how they can contribute as much as teachers and management to the education of their children.  Parents' councils have now been established in almost every parish in the country.  Their involvement in local schools is of enormous benefit to pupils.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  Again I must pay tribute to Gemma Hussey who set up this council.  I reconstituted them as an advisory council to me.  They have been very successful in pioneering the junior certificate course.  Students will sit this examination, which combines both the group certificate and intermediate certificate, for the first time in June 1992. At present a committee under the Chairmanship of Dr. Tom Murphy are considering the objectives of assessment.  He is also chairman of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Primary Education Review Body.  I should like to pay tribute to Dr. Murphy, ex-president of UCD, for the excellent work he has done in this area.  At a time when most people would have been glad to shrug off extra duties he joyfully took on the role as chairman of the Primary Education Review Body.  They produced a splended report last December and half of their 107 recommendations have been implemented.</P>
    <P>I should also like to pay tribute to Moya Quinlan, former chairperson of the NCCA and to the people who serve in a voluntary capacity on the many bodies and committees in the education area. They are not paid for their work and they are to be applauded for their great input to the development of education.  I should also like to pay tribute to all the groups with which I worked during my nine years as Minister for Education.  Of course, parents are the primary educators of their children.  I have formed bonds of friendship with people in many areas of education, parents, various union bodies, the INTO, the TUI, the ASTI and IFUT. Even though these bodies were very clear about their objectives and work, they responded at all times to the open door policy of education I instituted.  I am very <Col N="1324" /> happy to be able to say that I met all the groups who asked to meet me to discuss education matters, for example, managerial bodies &mdash; the JVEA, the JMB and the C&amp;C &mdash; the colleges of education, the vocational education committees, Avocational education committee, the regional colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>Legislation dealing with the regional colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology is now on the floor of the House and Deputy Davern will get his baptism as Minister for Education tomorrow when the Second Stage debate on those Bills is resumed.  I was glad, as Minister for Education to be able to introduce these two pieces of legislation in the House.  The setting up of two new universities, Dublin City University and the University of Limerick, was very significant from my point of view.  A Minister for Education seldom has the opportunity to set up one new university, let alone two new universities.  I regard this as a particular honour.  Both these universities are fulfilling their role of excellence in the provision of third level education.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to all the people who worked so hard on the Green Paper. In this regard I want to pay particular tribute to Dr. John Coolahan of Maynooth University who helped in the compilation of the paper.  I am sure Deputy Davern will wish to look at the Green Paper.  As he will also bring forward the White Paper and the legislation it is only natural that he would examine the Green Paper very carefully and perhaps put his stamp on it.</P>
    <P>I also want to pay tribute to all the officials in the Department of Education, the previous secretary, Declan Brennan, and the present secretary, Noel Lindsay. Their commitment to their work was outstanding. They have an extraordinary capacity for hard work and an eagerness to serve the public.  Deputy O'Keeffe spoke about <i>pro bono publico.</i> The Department of Education is the busiest of all the Government Departments because of the relentless nature of the work they undertake and the queries they <Col N="1325" /> deal with.  They are aware at all times that they are serving the public.</P>
    <P>When I went into the Department there were huge difficulties facing me.  I remember sitting at the table in my office that first evening and wondering how I was going to manage and what I was going to do.  I decided the best thing to do was not to change and not to acquire any notions of pomp &mdash; if I was inclined to do that, but I am not that type of person.  However, I remained very committed to talking to people and literally leaving my door open and not just for all the vested interests &mdash; who were always welcome.  I saw them frequently, often wih very little advance notice if an urgent matter had to be attended to.  I did not delay and say I was not free for a week or two.  I would see them the next morning if possible or even that day if necessary.  I maintained an open door policy.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy Davern will seek to implement that policy too.  The clearest way to do business is by showing readiness to listen to another person's point of view, a readiness to take up some of the points if you feel you can accommodate them and, above all, an openness to change and willingness to see the situation as it is.  That policy has stood me in great stead.  I applaud those who met and responded to me on that level. Often, those meetings were very difficult when there were points of conflict between us.  I never fell out with one deputation; I never ended a meeting on a note of anger or acrimony.  We would agree to differ, bearing in mind that usually it was not an ideological point of view which separated us but, perhaps, an economic one of financial stringencies, always conceding that the other person's idea in the main had great merit and could be looked at another time, somehow we were always able to do that.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to former Deputy Gemma Hussey for her programme on curriculum advancement.  Even though the primary student population decreased by over 20,000, we were able to make a dramatic increase over the previous four years in the provision of remedial teachers.  I know the Government are committed to <Col N="1326" /> providing remedial teachers.  Now 240 schools have, on a shared basis, an extra 80 remedial teachers.  There is a need for many more remedial teachers.</P>
    <P>In September, for the first time in decades, the pupil-techer ratio has been reduced with a further reduction planned for next September both at primary and post-primary levels.  A sum of £123 million has been spent on post-primary buildings in four years.  This is a huge expenditure, but much more work remains to be done.  One would need tens of millions of pounds to do it all. In excess of 240 primary school projects have been completed.</P>

      <P>I thank all who worked with me and with whom I worked in joyful unison throughout those years. I thank particularly the people of this country.  I travelled north, south, east and west.  I went to hamlets, villages, towns, cities, primary schools and all sorts of educational establishments, and in those four and a half to five years I received nothing but friendship and a warm welcome wherever I went.  There is a remarkable body of people working in education in Ireland.  The teachers are committed and devoted to their charges and have the finest of ideas and ideals.</P>
      <P>Education was a domestic issue but one in which I gained personal fulfilment and devleopment.  I pay tribute to the Taoiseach for the imagination and the initiative he has displayed in putting forward the Cabinet here today.  I look forward very much to my journeys in the Department of Health.  I intend to do three things there: first, to learn my brief; second, to work hard and third, to contine my policy of open door and of communication with all who wish to see me.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;knows more than anybody else the extremely high temperature that currently prevails in Health and the very tough decisions which are ongoing and which will be required for the future.</P>
      <P>I find these new appointments extremely hard to fathom.  If I find them hard to fathom, I am sure the vast majority of Junior Ministers in particular &mdash; each of whom was passed over &mdash; find them doubly hard to fathom.  The appointment of this Cabinet indicates that all is changed, but nothing is changed.  It was obvious in relation to who was assigned to what Department &mdash; particularly the two new appointments, that is, the new Minister for Education and the new Minister for Defence &mdash; that the decisions were based on blind loyalty rather than ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the appointment of Deputy McDaid as Minister for Defence, I believe that, as somebody who has well proven Republican sentiments, this challenges the high moral tone and ground of the Progressive Democrats.  The appointment to the most sensitive of portfolios, other than Justice &mdash; a key sensitive security position &mdash; of Deputy McDaid is one that will really test the moral rectitude of the Progressive Democrats. They cannot have it every way.  They cannot say one thing on radio, television <Col N="1328" /> and in the newspapers, they cannot ride the high moral hobby horse at all times, and then when it comes to the political realities in this House do something else; that moment will be at 10 p.m. today.</P>
    <P>I find it extremely difficult to understand how a number of the other Cabinet appointments have been made.  This Cabinet represents a total abandonment of the west, a total clean out of the west. One of the significant factors in every Cabinet until now, whether a Fine Gael led Government or a Fianna Fáil led Government, we always had western Ministers.  For example, in the past decade alone we had former Deputy Paddy O'Toole as Minister for Defence, Gaeltacht, Fisheries and Forestry, former Deputy Denis Gallagher, as Minister for the Gaeltacht; Deputy Pádraig Flynn had a phlethora of portfolios up to the time of his sacking as Minister for the Environment; former Deputy, Seán Doherty, as Minister for Justice; Commissioner Ray MacSharry, formerly Minister for Finance and Agriculture, yet now the west does not have a single Cabinet Minister sitting around the Cabinet table.  Last week the bishops of the west sat down with community representatives to try to salvage some kind of economic existence for the west, to try to put in place a package that would retain the existing population structure and give us some chance of retaining a semblance of social and community cohesion and stop the decay and the decline of the west.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of Deputy M. Kitt as Minister of State but, irrespective of how many junior Ministers we have, Ministers of State are literally junior Ministers and have no input at Cabinet level.  They have no decision-making voice and are very much in the role of doing their master's or their mistress's bidding.  It is an extremely black and bad day for the west and represents a new watershed &mdash; the abandonment of the west by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The appoinment of Deputy Davern as Minister for Education is not a good one. He is somebody I personally like; he has a great deal of personal charm but I doubt <Col N="1329" /> whether he has either the experience or the ability to pilot the necessary changes in education &mdash; the Green Paper, the White Paper, the Education Bill &mdash; and to face the challenges that are very much part and parcel of the education scene.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach explain how it is simply a party matter for an investigation to be conducted into an allegation that the Government Press Secretary has been directly responsible for spreading misinformation about a former Minister for Finance?  Would the <Col N="1331" /> Taoiseach not agree that if there are allegations about the conduct of the press secretary that is a matter that should be properly investigated by this House rather than by an internal caucus of his own party?</P>

Does he intend, in the next couple of weeks, to introduce legislation to extend the powers of the EC Committee or is it intended to set up a separate foreign affairs committee as was hinted at in relation to one of his former colleagues and a post being found for him?</P>

      <P>This position has been outlined by me on a number of occasions in this House.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities are having their remit and powers extended and that will require legislation.  Side by side with that it is the intention very shortly to set up a foreign affairs committee.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee have a very restricted remit which confines them to European Community affairs.  It is proposed to have, in addition, a much wider ranging committee who will deal with the whole ambit of foreign affairs.</P>

      <P>That remark is ráiméis. The position is absolutely clear.  The Programme for Government calls for the extension of the remit of the Oireachtas Joint Committee and I am indicating that that is under way, but it will require legislation because that committee was set up originally by legislation.  That is the only commitment in this area in the programme. However, it is separate from the programme.  In addition I have always indicated that it was my intention to set up a foreign affairs committee and that will now be proceeded with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 31, 68 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>In the course of 16 seizures from suppliers and farmers a total of 32 kg. and 770 litres of products containing clenbuterol, 17,493 doses of hormone implants and 25.35 litres of injectable hormone cocktails were seized since 1 January 1991.  As the products concerned have no legitimate values it is difficult to assign a value to the seizures but the farm gate value is believed to be between £250,000 and £500,000.</P>
      <P>Clenbuterol was detected in samples taken from 350 live cattle on farms and 15 samples taken at slaughterhouses this year.  Hormones were detected in 338 cattle during the same period.  In regard to traces of clenbuterol found in Irish meat exported to UK, the position is that the meat plants in question have been notified by my Department.  Five prosecutions have been initiated as a result of these activities and further prosecutions are in the pipeline.</P>
      <P>A Bill is being prepared, as a matter of urgency to amend the Animal Remedies Act, 1956.  The new provisions will provide greater powers for the Minister to control all aspects of the manufacture, availability and use of veterinary medicines. The major provision of the Bill is to provide for the introduction of indictable offences for which maximum penalties of a £50,000 fine and, or, ten years imprisonment will be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new legislation will further strengthen the ongoing campaign against the illegal use of veterinary medicines.  I am satisfied that the current campaign which is focused on the availability and use of these substances is bearing results and that the vast majority of those involved in the agricultural sector are fully committed to protecting the reputation and image of our food industry.  I have arranged for the level of testing on carcases at meat plants to be intensified. <Col N="1343" /> However, I want to ensure that the most effective deterrent possible should be available to support the campaign to eliminate the use of these substances.</P>
    <P>Regarding the article in the <i>Farmers Journal</i> I must state that the article is based on a very unrealistic and unacceptable line of argument.  I have had my views on the matter conveyed to the publication in question.</P>

May I put it to him that it has been represented to me on so many occasions &mdash; and I accept this to be a fact &mdash; that we have reached the stage where those who might be found guilty if caught using clenbuterol, have been notified in advance by officials of the Department and in some cases suspected cattle were sold?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 9, 37, 41 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>As set out in the Programme for Government published last month the present ERAD arrangement is due to expire in April 1992 and in this context a comprehensive appraisal of the scheme will now be carried out with the aim of formulating a realistic and workable scheme for the next three to four years.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have been made to meet all the relevant interests within the next few weeks and I would expect that wide ranging discussions will take account of all factors such as the experience of the scheme to date, cost benefit analysis, the availability of EC funding and trading requirements and that through this process a consensus would be reached on the future of the programme.</P>
      <P>As regards the recent discussions with the Irish Veterinary Union, I am pleased to inform the House that an interim contract has now been agreed and revised arrangements have been put in place to allow herdowners to avail of a herd test. It is proposed to have further discussions with the union in relation to other conditions which must be adhered to in order to secure EC funding for the programme. This year the scheme has concentrated on the testing of infected herds and herds contiguous to them.  To date 28,000 reactors have been removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Events have overtaken the purpose of Question No. 6 and we are all glad that the dispute has been settled. Does the Minister have any views on the statement by the chief executive of ERAD to the effect that he does not see it as a practical possibility that bovine TB will be eradicated?  Does the Minister <Col N="1348" /> agree with that statement or has he an acceptable level in mind within which bovine TB can be contained?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department and my successor will very shortly receive a report from the director of ERAD in relation to that and other elements with a view to prioritising the ERAD programme from February next year.  The question raised by the Deputy is obviously very relevant in that context.  I am sure that the Deputy will be aware &mdash; as a result of his experience in the Department &mdash; that the level of outbreak at present in terms of herd is about 3 per cent of our national herd.  If that figure was reduced to 1 per cent we would then be able to claim a total eradication in the European Community context.  It is foreseeable and achieveable but I do no want to anticipate the consequences of the discussions which will take place with a view to renewing the programme shortly.</P>

      <P>That is one of the elements which the director of ERAD &mdash; and ERAD &mdash; have been considering. The Deputy will remember, from his experience, that we did not have a blood test as we relied on what is there at the moment.  We now need to re-examine the matter and it is quite possible &mdash; although I do not want to anticipate what may arise from the review &mdash; that blood testing may be introduced.  The Deputy will appreciate the unusual circumstances of today and I am sure my successor, Deputy Woods, will be able to give more details.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the labour force survey April 1990 to April 1991 which shows a huge reduction in the number of persons in agriculture, from 167,000 to 155,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest labour force survey published on 30 October 1991 has shown that the number of people employed in the agricultural, forestry and fisheries sector has fallen from 167,000 in 1990 to 155,000 in 1991.</P>
      <P>The fall in employment in agriculture reported in the preliminary survey results for 1991 is greater than the results reported in recent years.  Between 1986 and 1990, employment in the sector was reported as falling from 168,000 to 167,000.  However, in the four intervening years, there was a reported increase in two of the years and a reported decrease in the other two. Against that background, the fall of 12,000 in a single year is at considerable variance with recent developments and it may well be that when the final revised figure for 1991 will be published next year a somewhat different result will emerge.</P>
      <P>It may be that figures for 1991 reflect in one year a fall which has been going on over a period, but which has not been reflected in the results of the labour force survey.</P>
      <P>As the survey is based on a system of self classification it is also possible that a number of people still engaged in the sector have simply reclassified themselves as having another activity as a principal occupation.  Thus the survey results do not necessarily mean that 12,000 farmers have ceased farming between 1990 and 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that between 1987 and 1989 about 3,000 or 4,000 people annually left farming? This drop of 12,000 people means that young people are voting with their feet and leaving agriculture because of the crisis and because they can see no future in agriculture until the Government &mdash; or a future Government &mdash; guarantee long term viability of family farms and produce an integrated programme to solve the problem of low <Col N="1350" /> incomes in farm families.  Will the Minister agree that this trend will continue and indeed accelerate unless such programmes are brought forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a number of possible explanations.  There may have been an over-estimation of numbers employed in the sector in recent years. The figures for 1991 may reflect in one year a fall which has been going on over a period but which may not necessarily have been reflected in the results.  Of course, as I stated in my reply, the survey is based on a system of self classification and it may well be that certain people feel their principal occupation is different from what is was a number of years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that one of the great problems is the fact that incomes, in real terms, have not increased over the last 15 years for family farms?  People in agriculture, particularly those in farming, see that the big increase in EC funds from the Commmon Agricultural Policy are not going to farmers but to people engaged in activities outside farming and to guarantee the storage of a huge amount of surplus foods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh will readily accept that there have been very good years income-wise for the farming sector over the last number of years. While there may be a temporary difficulty at present we cannot overlook the fact that there had been very good years prior to that.  We must remember that, having regard to the overall picture in the Community, the percentage of our population engaged in agriculture is one of the highest in the Community.  Given our farm structure there is a certain inevitability that we may have a gradual reduction in the total number of people employed fully and directly in the industry.</P>

    <P>Since the outset of the Common Agricultural Policy reform debate I have been outlining Ireland's position in the clearest and strongest possible terms both in the Council and in the many bilateral contacts which I have had with all my fellow Agriculture Ministers and with Commissioner MacSharry.  This is in line with the Government's commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>These consultations will continue as the negotiations unfold and the Government are committed to availing of all opportunities to ensure that Ireland's vital concerns in the reform debate are taken on board.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly indicated the areas in the proposals which most concern me in the many discussions on Common Agricultural Policy reform in this House, most recently last week.  I propose to circulate copies of my statement.  I do not propose to go into all of them in this reply but it is, nonetheless, important to highlight some of the most crucial for Ireland.  Any change must fully respect Treaty provisions; it must be moderate and gradual and responsive to the needs of an economy which is heavily dependent on agriculture; it must be backed by adequate and durable Community resources; it must ensure that market support arrangements continue to play a vital part in farm income formation; it must apply realistic stocking rates which reflect the economic basis of modern family farms and it must not discriminate against grass based livestock production. It must take particular account of economies such as Ireland's where agriculture represents a vital element in the overall national economy.</P>
    <P>The position up to now has been that in the absence of detailed examination of the Commission texts, Ministers in the Council largely concentrated on outlining their general attitudes to the proposals. In this, all member states agreed on the need for reform and could accept the Commission proposals as the starting point of the negotiations.  There were and <Col N="1354" /> are, however, widespread differences of view on the correct form of change needed.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the Council is now in a position to go on to debate the detail of the proposals.  In these discussions I will, in common with most Ministers, be indicating alternatives to some of what is on the table.  These will cover the maintenance of adequate Community preference controlling imports, gradual price adjustment, realistic production control, the levels of direct income support and the conditions under which it is paid and the putting in place of a secure Community financial framework for the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>An important element in the approach I will be proposing is the establishment of much more realistic stocking rate criteria especially but not exclusively in respect of the disadvantaged areas.  The needs of intensive family run farms in all parts of the country will of course have to be met.</P>
    <P>In developing a national strategy on the reform proposals the Department and I have, as provided for in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> maintained the closest possible contact with the farm and agricultural organisations.  That contact will be maintained. The organisations and the Department have quantified the efforts of the proposals compared to the agricultural situation which obtained in 1990. While the results vary to some extent, all of these exercises indicate a significant loss in the value of agricultural output and, even after compensation, in aggregate farm income.  It has to be accepted, however, that even if the policy remained unchanged, some losses would occur in any event because of the operation of the stabiliser system and likely changes in the market management arrangements. There is also the point that some benefits might accrue over time because of better market balance and there should also be some consumer gains.  Nevertheless, the overall position remains that an outcome based on unchanged Commission proposals would lead to immediate national losses.  This would affect employment levels which, on the basis of a recent <Col N="1355" /> ESRI study, would be expected to fall in the medium term, even if this trend might be reversed in the longer term due to improved competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Such assessments as have been made are, of course, based on the proposals as they now stand.  I would expect that the quantifiable effects would be significantly changed by progress in the negotiations. It is, therefore, impossible to be more definite about those effects until the shape of final conclusions is clearer. When the conclusions of the reform and GATT negotiations are known the Government will, as agreed under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, negotiate with the programme partners on a new national development plan for the agriculture and food sector. Preparatory work on this will begin shortly.</P>

      <P>I have the utmost regard for Deputy Woods who will succeed Deputy O'Kennedy as Minister for Agriculture and Food, but it is certainly a most unwise and untimely decision to change Ministers at this stage of these most complex and important discussions.</P>

      <P>I wonder whether the Taoiseach had the interests of agriculture and farmers at heart when he made that decision.  However, that is another day's work.  May I ask the Minister when he realistically expects a decision on the Common Agricultural Policy reforms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank the Deputy for the implications of what he said, but I would reassure him that Deputy Woods who has a professional qualification in this area and was an adviser to my party in Opposition some years ago, is particularly competent in this area.  As far as a date is concerned, the Deputy will know from negotiations, even price negotiations which the Deputy attended, that one could not say when <Col N="1356" /> they would conclude.  When the Deputy's party were in office negotiations concluded sometimes as late as June but sometimes they concluded in March. When considering such a major reform as this it would be foolish for me at this stage to put a time scale on the negotiations. However, the expectation is that they will be concluded at or about the beginning of the next marketing year.  I am sure the Deputy will accept that it would be wrong to consider that as a timetable much less a deadline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The conclusion of those talks generally coincides with the persistence or awkwardness of the Irish Minister and not the other 11 Ministers. In the context of the proposed reform, does the Minister agree by and large with the findings of the survey carried out by the ICOS, which, if they are factual, would mean that agriculture would be devastated in this country?  Has the Minister seen the findings of that survey?  It seems to be the most qualified and professional survey carried out and its ramifications are dreadful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of surveys have been undertaken and I awaiting further surveys from very highly qualified and independent sources.  The ICOS survey does not coincide exactly with the surveys undertaken so far by my Department. I acknowledge that there is not a great difference between them on the basis of the current proposals and for that reason that kind of analysis is a little unrealistic.  Regardless of who is Minister, as we have already signalled, the proposals that will emerge will be very different from those tabled at the beginning of the negotiations.  It has been signalled that there will be concessions &mdash; for example, the stocking rate will be changed and the compensation element will be advanced to our benefit.  A number of other matters have been agreed generally but, as the Deputy knows, they are not definite until they are put into regulations.  The outcome will be much better than that outlined in the survey to which the Deputy referred. <Col N="1357" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the store trade itself is concerned, prices for forward stores are holding at levels close to last year.  This is a reflection of the stability resulting from the revision to the arrangements for processors margins for inerventioin beef which I negotiated last August.  There is obviously a wide variation in prices depending on quality with the good quality stores doing better.</P>
      <P>I am concerned, however, that store heifers and weanlings are making somewhat lower prices than last year.  In this context I was pleased to support the recent Commission proposal to increase the suckler cow premium this year by up to 20 ECU or £17.58.  I am satisfied that this move will improve confidence and provide important income support for producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister lives in the real world.  Since 1989 the incomes of store producers have fallen by 55 per cent and heifer prices have been down by 19p per lb.  Indeed, one could quote many other figures to show that this category of farmer is entitled to special assistance.  I am sure that if their case was put to the EC, assistance would be forthcoming.  Is the Minister seeking special assistance for this particularly hard hit category of farmer?  The figures prove that of all enterprises in the agriculture industry this is the enterprise that has been hardest hit in recent years.  Therefore a special case should be made for these farmers.</P>

      <P>I accept that the level of price for store cattle producers is of particular concern and I accept that by the nature of the activities of those <Col N="1358" /> engaged in this type of farming they have been particularly affected because they are generally lower income farmers.

      <P>Our intention is to be helpful, there is no need for us to be at odds on this particular issue.  We are anxious to see trade to this country resumed and we were delighted to see that the Libyan Foreign Minister renunciated support for the IRA.  Indeed this makes our position, as I am sure it makes the Minister's position, much easier.  When can we expect that trade will be resumed?  It is now 13 November 1991 and if trade does not <Col N="1360" /> recommence by the end of the month, it will not be of much good this season.</P>

However what I can say is that I am totally satisfied that there is no basis for any apprehension about our animal disease status. I am also satisfied that when they visit us shortly this will be confirmed beyond yea or nay.  It is well that we recognise that we do not represent the Libyan Government as well as the Irish Government, and the Deputies opposite must recognise that we must await the Libyan response to this political decision.</P>

May I suggest also &mdash; I think he is aware of this &mdash; that we are coming from a period when store cattle prices were unreasonably high and the man involved with the fatteners had a problem.  I hope we will begin to see a levelling off.  I am fully aware of all the circumstances and I expect that we will see an improvement shortly.</P>

We managed to get the EC Foreign Ministers to agree that a visit to discuss the health status of our animals did not breach the sanctions they had put in place.  We are bound by the precedent and regulations of the EC Foreign Ministers. However, matters are improving because of the statement of the Libyan Foreign Minister and other developments.</P>

The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the Shannon Free Area Development Company in the mid-west <Col N="1364" /> and Bord Fáilte in the rest of the country as part of their normal remit.</P>
      <P>As the total allocation has now been committed, the processing of further applications has now to be suspended for the time being.  I am satisfied with the manner in which the scheme is being administered by the agencies involved.</P>
      <P>I propose to circulate a copy of the Minister's address at the agri-tourism awards.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister happy that there is not over-emphasis on duplication by the people who are trying to organise and run this scheme?  Second, as a result of an industrial dispute which has been ongoing since 15 October 1991, is he also aware that no actual training is being provided for people who have been approved for grants and are looking for help to ensure that the projects they are initiating get off the ground?  What follow-up action is taken when people are approved for grants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell Deputy Farrelly that the agri-tourism grant scheme has been a considerable success.  It is one of the grant schemes that comes in under the general heading of the operational programme for rural development.  The number of applications and approvals that I have just read out clearly underline the success of the scheme.  As I said, the two agencies dealing with the administration of the scheme are the Shannon Development Company and Bord Fáilte. Those two bodies have considerable experience in that regard.  I am sure that in the processing of various applications the examination of the capacity and the ability of individual applicants to plan, invest and ensure that the investment is carried through to finality and commercial fruition, will be a matter on which the agencies seek satisfaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State not agree that his statement that the scheme is a tremendous success is somewhat of an overstatement in view of the fact that the amount of money involved is a mere £5.3 million and in <Col N="1365" /> view of the fact that of the 368 applications received 196 were approved for the Shannon area and only 80 were approved for the rest of the country? Would he not agree that the scheme is way beyond the range of scope of the vast majority of those who should have benefited and that what should have been an ideal alternative enterprise for small farmers is in fact total nonsense and a total flop in that it is very bureaucratic, tied up in red tape, very grandiose and beyond the relevance of the vast majority of small farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Higgins' sentiments on the matter.  The statistics show that the total number of applications received to date is 368 and that 196 projects have been approved. The relevant figures for the Shannon Free Airport development area are 106 applications and 63 approvals.  I think those figures fairly graphically underline the attractiveness and importance of the scheme and the important role it will play in the whole question of alternative enterprises on farms throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister whether future allocations of funding could be related to regions rather than to carry on with the present system.  The more advanced tourist regions are picking up the greatest amount from all of those schemes, the result being that when people from other regions make applications for aid under many of those schemes, as has been experienced even recently in my own region, they are told that the money is gone.  In order to make the operational programme really effective in the future grants could be allocated on a regional basis rather than on a free-for-all basis, under which the strongest bodies get the most.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not give an answer to the problem of the people who have been approved and are awaiting training because of the dispute that has been going on since 15 October in which the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture are refusing to accept the terms agreed with the unions.  Of the applications that have been approved there are 39 groups and 88 other industries involved.  The people in the regions and the regions themselves should be given the process of dealing with the applications and a sufficient amount of funds.  Would the Minister ensure that sufficient funds will be made available in 1992 for the regions to deal with other applications?  I am not surprised that the Minister is side-stepping or has set that matter aside in the question, because that is the way that things have happened here all day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the limited degree of flexibility available to me under the Community regulations on the quota system I have already made a number of decisions designed to re-direct any quota available towards smallscale producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987-88 I introduced a restructuring scheme restricted to producers below <Col N="1369" /> 50,000 gallons quota and of these the first priority category is confined to producers below 30,000 gallons quota.  I have also assisted these producers by giving them priority under the schemes for the temporary leasing of quotas and the allocation of flexi milk.</P>
    <P>In addition, I introduced a clawback system in December 1987 whereby a portion of the quota transferring with a lease is retained in a national reserve if the lessee's quota exceeds 50,000 gallons. The main objective of this scheme is to give small scale producers priority access to quotas becoming available for leasing with land.</P>
    <P>I also arranged that out of the reserve pool of 11 million gallons which the Commission agreed to make available in response to my specific request at the 1989 price negotiations eight million gallons were allocated to small scale producers with quotas below 12,800 gallons.</P>
    <P>It is evident, therefore, that since taking office in 1987 my concern under the quota system has been where possible to allocate additional quotas to small scale producers who would use them.  I will continue to do my utmost &mdash; and I am sure my successor will too &mdash; in this regard but the main difficulty is that under a quota system additional quotas can only be made available to some producers by way of reductions in the quotas of other producers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I could have anticipated much of what the Minister said in his reply which is cold comfort to many farmers who now have no income because they exceeded their milk quota for a number of months.  I accept that there are structural problems but what progress has the Minister made, in particular with regard to the efforts of his Department to have the benefits of the family income supplement extended to the farming community?  Furthermore, would he say what efforts he is taking to ensure that the 3 per cent quota cut, as proposed under the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, will not affect small quota holders?  The Minister made a passing reference to the lease and sale of quotas. <Col N="1370" /> Would the Minister agree &mdash; because of the experience of solicitors and others practising in the legal field involved in the sale and transfer of quotas &mdash; that it is a legal minefield they anticipate will blow up in their faces at some stage in the future?  Would he and his Department put in place specific guidelines governing such transactions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In a sense I am gratified by the fact that Deputy Creed said he had anticipated my reply.  I hope he will have anticipated it from the commitment I have shown over the past four and a half years to protect small quota holders particularly.  One of the things that has kept me going in rather difficult times over the past four and a half years has been the number of letters and telephone calls I have received from those who felt they had not been protected as much previously.  In relation to the legal requirements of the lease and sale of quotas, and of leasehold transfers with a view to protecting the small quota holders I imposed a clawback over a certain amount so that I would have a national pool for small quota people and young people coming into agriculture.  Unfortunately lawyers &mdash; and I am a member of that profession myself, or at least used to be &mdash; found a way of advising those, whose needs were not nearly as acute as those I was endeavouring to help, of how to avoid the clawback.  I regret that.</P>

We have not yet reached that idealistic stage but we are working towards it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In the realisation that the Minister has such feeling for the small producers going out of business at present &mdash; this number of 5,000 &mdash; would he agree that a high percentage would be experiencing such difficulties because they have not sufficient income from their milk production?  In view of the fact that the Minister acknowledges that the larger producers or their representatives have found a way to combat the proposal for leasing to small quota holders, what action does he propose taking to rectify that position so that it will have more impact on small quota holders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to tell the Deputy that that is one of the matters I have referred to the milk quota review committee.  The Deputy will know that we have a milk quota review committee on which small farmers and Macra, the young farmers, are well represented.  I have requested their views as to how we can tighten up the existing arrangements in order to prevent what I might describe as that kind of distortion.  I would hope that among the farming families of Ireland there would be greater awareness <Col N="1372" /> of the equity behind my proposal.  I am quite satisfied that if they themselves do not volunteer to agree we will find a way of tightening up the arrangements to ensure that abuse will not occur.</P>

      <P>Following on the Minister's reply to Deputy Creed, I am sure it is quite apparent to the Minister, as it is to everybody else, that he has shied away from the guarantee he gave small farmers recently.  It is evident that any small farmer who exceeded the milk quota &mdash; even in the case of a farmer with a 1,000 gallon quota only &mdash; was penalised to the same extent as the larger farmer.  Would the Minister explain to the House why those farmers who exceeded the milk quota received an average of 83 pence per gallon for their milk but are fined at the rate of 1.20 pence per gallon for their milk?</P>

May I just inform the Deputy that I could never, never did and would never shy away from the problems particularly of small farmers.  All of my young days were spent on small farms with all my relations.  That is why they have been a priority with me, particularly over the past four and a half years.  That is also why they recognise that what was not done for them in 1983 by way of the quota allocation was corrected to some extent within the past 12 months.  I would never be able to do as much as I would wish but I have done a awful lot more than was done before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an ill-judged Cabinet.  It was an ill-judged decision to superimpose two newcomers over the heads of the junior Ministers, one of whom is relatively new in the Dáil and about whom there are major question marks in relation to his entitlement to assume the sensitive role of Minister for Defence.  There are also question marks about the competence, the vision, ability and experience of Deputy Noel Davern in assuming the trying, testing and increasingly challenging portfolio of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the extraordinary things that will characterise the reign of office of the Taoiseach is his unquenchable thirst for power and the manner in which, when it came to the crunch, every friend was used as a sacrificial lamb.  Going back to 1970, of the trio comprising Boland, Blaney and Haughey, only one really survives in high places and that is the Taoiseach. While Deputy Blaney has survived in this House as a raven croaking on the Republican battlements now and again, he is largely out of the mainstream of national politics.  A decade later in the early eighties the Garda Commissioner and the Deputy Garda Commissioner were dispensed with, as were the then Minister for Justice, Seán Doherty, and the current EC Commissioner, Ray MacSharry. In the mid-eighties after his &ldquo;I stand by the Republic&rdquo; speech, Deputy O'Malley, now Leader of the Progressive Democrats, was dispensed with, as were the <Col N="1437" /> current Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, the current Minister of State, Deputy Harney, and two others who are now Progressive Democrat Deputies. This time last year we had the indignity of the Tánaiste's head being carried in on a platter at the behest of the Progressive Democrats.  The one time best friend of the Taoiseach was easily disposed of.</P>
    <P>In the past six to eight weeks people in high places, friends of the Taoiseach, have been dispensed with.  I am referring to Mr. Comerford, Mr. Tully, the honourable Mr. Paircéar, Dr. Smurfit and, of course, Mr. Desmond.  This week we have the final irony.  Two of the people who were the most staunch supporters of the Taoiseach in previous coup attempts, Deputies Reynolds and Flynn, were dispensed with, as well as three junior Ministers. It is an indication of the quality within the junior ministerial ranks that the three who walked out today having lost their portfolios were extremely talented and would have been in the running for full ministerial positions.</P>
    <P>Nothing has changed.  That particularly applies to the junior partners in Government, the Progressive Democrats. Nothing has changed since the day Deputy O'Malley claimed in his very fine address to this House, &ldquo;I stand by the Republic&rdquo;, since he tried to hammer out a deal in relation to high standards in high places, since the day the Progressive Democrats said they would pull out of Government if the high standards they set for themselves in partnership with Fianna Fáil were not maintained.  Clearly they are not being maintained.  I put it to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, that the key and acid test in relation to where exactly the Progressive Democrats stand at this juncture is the voting out of office of two good Ministers who can at least face their conscience tomorrow morning and the voting in of two people of considerably lesser ability and lesser integrity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What we have seen today is, to say the least, a dull reshuffle. Two &ldquo;yes men&rdquo; from the backbenches have been plucked out of nowhere to be <Col N="1438" /> appointed to the Cabinet for the simple and sole reason that they will do whatever the Taoiseach asks them to do.  We have had that dangerous precedent before in Governments led by Deputy Haughey.  It is a sad day, given that the Taoiseach and his Government are presiding over the worst unemployment figures in our history. Each month new records are set. The figure for last month, including those who are off the register because they are over 55, was 277,000.  At the same time there is an escalating budget deficit and a housing crisis.  There has been a total collapse of the public sector house building programme and a very sharp downturn in the private sector.</P>
      <P>I remember well the clarion call of Deputy O'Malley, then in Opposition, about standards in high places and the justification he and his party gave for going into Government.  They made great claims in the first year of this Government about restraining Fianna Fáil from their worst excesses, about maintaining high standards in high places and ensuring that the right economic policies were pursued to ensure economic success.  The regrettable fact is that since the Progressive Democrats joined the Government the budget deficit has escalated, not reduced, and unemployment has escalated each month to new records.  This week the claim of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that actual employment has increased has been shown to be false. Actual employment has again fallen in the past year.</P>
      <P>What then are the justifications of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his party for staying in Government? What is it they are sustaining?  Surely they are in the corner of sustaining the very thing most of them left Fianna Fáil to get rid of?  Are they to stand by a phenomenally successful economic policy, Northern Ireland policy or European policy? Are they standing by a phenomenal success in maintaining high standards in high places?  They have manifestly failed on all fronts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad to observe that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is in the House.  On the Government benches <Col N="1439" /> there is not one Fianna Fáil Deputy. There are two Progressive Democrats on the back benches.  I am glad of that small audience to point out that an excuse given by the Progressive Democrats and by Fianna Fáil for staying in Government and voting confidence in the Taoiseach is that no ministerial wrong-doing has been proven.  The reality is that no ministerial wrong-doing is being or has been investigated. We have Greencore, Goodman and Telecom being investigated but not the performance of the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers.  I put it to the House, and especially to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that if there is a sworn investigation into the conversations held between the Taoiseach and the chairman of Greencore in relation to consultants on privatisation and if there is a sworn investigation into the discussions between the Taoiseach and the then chairman of Telecom Éireann, Dr. Smurfit, about the appointment of advisers, that both chairmen will tell the sworn investigations that it was the Taoiseach who asked for the appointment of NCB.</P>
    <P>I can tell the House authoritatively that the board of Telecom Éireann, even in the past week, were informed yet again that the appointment of NCB and IBI arose following a discussion between Dr. Smurfit and the Taoiseach.  When the story of the appointment of those two companies appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Brennan, issued two statements denying that there had been any Government contact on this subject.  However, a statement which was issued later did not deny the two statements but explained that there had been some contacts.  I want to say to the House and Deputy O'Malley that the board of Telecom Éireann have been told for the second time that the appointment of NCB took place after discussions between the Taoiseach and Dr. Smurfit. I challenge Mr. O'Malley to insist on a full inquiry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, <Col N="1440" /> you are giving me the impression that you are doing this designedly.  You are an experienced Member of the House and you know that we credit Deputies with their titles.  He is the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it was merely an oversight.  I challenge the Minister for Industry and Commerce to insist on the setting up of a sworn inquiry so that Mr. Cahill and Dr. Smurfit can give evidence under oath.</P>
      <P>Last week at Question Time the Taoiseach tried to claim that Mr. Cahill at the extraordinary general meeting of Greencore had exonerated him.  He did no such thing.  Mr. Cahill was offered the opportunity on three occasions to clarify beyond doubt that the Taoiseach did not try to influence or suggest the appointment of NCB as advisers on the privatisation. Mr. Cahill avoided exonerating the Taoiseach on each of those three occasions.  I suggest that if the former Chairman of Telecom Éireann was asked similar questions under oath he would not exonerate the Taoiseach either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the crucial points is that no Minister is under investigation.  There is no investigation into the laying of a pipeline under the Taoiseach's lands.  There is no investigation into the value of the Taoiseach's lands at Kinsealy before and after the laying of that pipeline.  There is no investigation into who took the initiative in that regard.  It has been accepted laterally that the Department of the Environment took that initiative.  I know it was the former Minister for the Environment who took that initiative.  If the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, was asked under oath whether the Taoiseach had asked him to take that initiative I suggest we would get an interesting answer.  Like Mr. Cahill and Dr. Smurfit, Mr. Flynn is not being called before a sworn inquiry.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce is truly concerned about the need for high standards in high places and setting an example which the rest of the country can <Col N="1441" /> follow I suggest he should insist on that additional inquiry over the above all the other inquiries which are taking place.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have no case for staying in Government.  This country needs a new start.  It needs a Government who understand what needs to be done and have the determination to do it.  It does not need a Government who are intent on staying in office at all costs, time servers.  As the leader of the main Opposition party so eloquently said this morning, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not standing by the Republic.  Rather he is standing by Mr. Haughey when Mr. Haughey has no leg to stand on except the leg of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Mitchell must be purposely trying to thwart the Chair in a very simple matter.  Surely the Chair is not being too demanding on the Deputy in asking him to recollect that the Taoiseach is the Taoiseach and Mr. Flynn is Deputy Flynn.  Is there some reason the Deputy persists in making little of the office those Members hold?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean to do any such thing and I apologise again.</P>
      <P>In the very short time available to me I wish to refer to the performance of the two former Ministers and their history in office.  I have already referred briefly to the pipeline laid under the Taoiseach's land and the lack of investigation into how that came about.  As I have said, it would be instructive if Deputy Flynn, the former Minister for the Environment, was called before a sworn inquiry.  It might also be instructive if there was a sworn inquiry into some of the affairs of the Customs House Docks Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is even more striking is that, in terms of housing, Deputy Flynn has left office after probably the worst four years, other than the war years, since the foundation of the State.  The statistics bulletin of the Department of the Environment will show that.  They will also show that there has been a sharp downturn in the building of private housing.  The myth <Col N="1442" /> which has been repeated by Fianna Fáil apologists that Fianna Fáil in Government are good for the construction industry is exploded by the facts.  The only areas where there have been significant development in the past four years are in the designated areas under the Urban Renewal Act, and it was the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government who introduced that Act and set out those designated areas.  The Fianna Fáil Party cannot even claim credit for the only area in the construction industry where there has been any performance.</P>
    <P>In addition, Deputy Flynn as Minister presided over two botched revisions of constituencies.  In the agreed Programme for Government there is a promise of a third review of constituencies in two years.  What sort of messing is going on? What future messing will the Progressive Democrats stand over before they eventually capitulate and do what is in the interest of the country, thus truly standing by this Republic?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to avail of the opportunity to express my regret at the departure from office of five people today.  Whatever the circumstances, it must always be a cause of regret to Members of this House when something like this happens.  I want to express my special regret on a personal and departmental basis at the proposed removal from office of the former Minister of State, Deputy Smith, who worked with me in the Department of Industry and Commerce for the past two and a quarter years and with whom I have had <Col N="1444" /> a very good relationship and whose work I have admired and valued greatly in that Department.  I should like to express my gratitude to him, and I hope that at sometime in the future, in whatever circumstances, he will hold a ministerial office again.</P>
      <P>This country has come through a two-month period of unprecedented political turmoil arising initially from the disclosures surrounding the Greencore affair at the beginning of September and concluding with today's Government changes.  It has been an unsatisfactory period so far as public confidence in certain institutions and State companies are concerned.  I suggest that the developments of the past two months have not all been one sided or negative: I will elaborate on this point later.  The most unfortunate aspect, however, is that the political turmoil of the past two months, arising from the revelation of the various business scandals and the subsequent controversy within the Fianna Fáil Party, undermined the Government's stability and authority at a time when it was already faced with profound social and economic problems, particularly the persistent unemployment crisis and the necessity to curb excessive public expenditure.</P>
      <P>In relation to the issue of Government stability, the consistent and unwavering attitude of my party &mdash; the Progressive Democrats &mdash; has been to seek to concentrate the energies and attention of ourselves and of the Government as a whole on tackling the country's social and economic problems and not to allow the internal affairs of any other party, or the politics of personality, to override that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Progressive Democrats were obsessed with the politics of personality then I suggest that the present Government would never have come into being. But since our foundation, almost six years ago, and in particular since our entry into Government in July 1989, we have made it crystal clear to everyone that the Progressive Democrats are committed to the primacy of policy over personality. That objective finds its fullest <Col N="1445" /> and most up-to-date expression in the recently agreed new Programme for Government between ourselves and Fianna Fáil which was finalised on 18 October last.  That programme provides the policy framework for effectively tackling the problems I mentioned through a wide range of radical and innovative economic fiscal and institutional policy changes.</P>
    <P>The programme sets down tight, clearly defined, fiscal targets which must be met over the next two budgets.  It also commits the Government to a two-year programme of radical, pro-jobs tax reform along with the restructuring of the PAYE system on an Exchequer neutral basis.  The overall target is to reduce distortions in the taxation system and in the labour market, to increase incentives to work, to invest productively and to ensure greater social equity by comprehensively tackling the problems of tax evasion and avoidance.  The latter objective will be greatly helped by the introduction of a universal identity card system based on the extension of the RSI number.  This will not only help to tackle tax evasion but it will also play a major role in combating business fraud.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Programme for Government also sets out a range of major institutional reforms which will make the State and the Oireachtas work more effectively and it also proposes to devolve Government functions and services to local communities through a radical overhaul of our local government system.</P>
    <P>It is on the basis of these policies in the revised Programme for Government that the Progressive Democrats are participating in Government, that these domestic, social and economic policy targets are not the only reason this country needs strong determined and united Government at present and in the months ahead.  It is quite obvious, for instance, that the task of public finance readjustment is going to make tremendous demands on next January's budget.  In that context, the task of agreeing tight <Col N="1446" /> and prudent Estimates for public spending, for next year, is of crucial importance.</P>
    <P>It is also essential that we review the system of pay determination in the public service and that we continue to review the role of the State in various commercial activities.  This will facilitate greater competition in our economy and ensure that consumers do not remain victims of monopoly and cartel arrangements.</P>
    <P>The ongoing discussions with the social partners on the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which take account of the decline in economic growth this year and the economic outlook for next year is another fundamental aspect of the onerous responsibilities facing Government at this time.  Moreover, as the Taoiseach indicated to the House yesterday, it will be necessary to complete the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> review before the Estimates can be finalised.  In the context of both exercises, I believe it to be essential for all elements in Irish society, to pull together in the spirit of genuine patriotic endeavour, to realise that sacrifices will be necessary and that expectations of what the public purse can afford have to take account of the persistent and fundamental fiscal and debt problems still facing this country.  We cannot give ourselves continental European standards of living without first earning it for ourselves.  We are a highly borrowed nation which has failed to live within its means and we must now make the necessary policy adjustments that will secure a stable and better future for this country and especially for our children. That requires tough decisions and it requires that all sectors of the community share the cost of economic adjustment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am the first to appreciate that public solidarity and the willingness to share sacrifices on the part of the average citizen have been seriously undermined by the theories of recent business scandals.  Unfortunately <Col N="1447" />&mdash; and in part correctly &mdash; these disclosures have conveyed the impression that in this State there is one economic law governing the affairs of most citizens and a more privileged economic law for a select and well-heeled few.  That view has been fuelled, understandably, by the revelations in the Greencore and Telecom affairs and also by some of the revelations surrounding the Goodman affair.  I deeply regret these happenings but they are now being vigorously investigated on behalf of the Government and in one case on behalf of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>We must remember, too, that it is the taxpayer who is largely funding these several inquiries now under way; that same taxpayer is entitled not only to eventual full public disclosure but also to be assured that any proven wrongdoing that is revealed will be properly addressed and punished.  It is in that context that I stated earlier that the developments of the last two months are not all negative. Provided the various inquiries are vigorously and conclusively pursued then the likelihood of serious business wrong-doing should be much less in the future.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell, this is not Question Time.  This is a debate which has been requested. The Chair will be very intolerant of interruptions having regard to the fact that speakers have a mere 20 minutes.  I assure the Minister that the time that has been lost to him while I addressed disorder, will be compensated for.</P>

      <P>I would find it very difficult to circulate a speech that I made in part in reply to interruptions.  I do not have any obligations to circulate a speech.  It is convention in this House, sometimes observed, that where Ministers make a speech on a departmental matter, their Department take the opportunity to circulate the script that the Minister may or may not use.  When a Minister <Col N="1450" /> is not making a speech on a departmental matter, and that is the case here, there is not any obligation or even a convention that he should circulate his script.</P>
      <P>In so far as political accountability is concerned, which Deputy Mitchell is so concerned about now in terms of inquiries and so on, I would remind the Deputy that political accountability is exercised in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is open to Members to inquire from any member of the Government about any topic for which he has official responsibility.  If Members find that they are unable to pursue that successfully they might reflect on the fact that sometimes it is perhaps due to their own failures in eliciting the information they are looking for.  The functions of this House could not be replaced by inquiries held under the Companies Act, for example.</P>
      <P>The matters of which I have spoken are some of the priorities now demanding the total and undivided attention of the Government.  There are others, and none is more vital than the Maastricht Summit on economic and monetary union and on political union on 9 and 10 December next.  The suggested revisions to the Rome Treaty will have a profound and lasting effect on Ireland and they will radically change our relationship with the European Community and with the Community's institutions.  I would dearly wish that the politics of recent weeks had been dominated by consideration of the Maastricht Summit and its agenda.  Of course, the preparatory work is being pursued by the relevant officials, but there is an urgent need for a comprehensive national debate on the consequences any Treaty of Rome changes for Ireland and for our future in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That too is the reason why in the context of recent negotiations on renewing the Programme for Government, the Progressive Democrats secured a commitment to the publication of a White Paper following the Intergovernmental Conferences at Maastricht, covering all <Col N="1451" /> aspects of proposed changes in the Rome Treaty prior to the holding of any referendum which is likely here.  In that wider European Community context, the talks on the Uruguay Round of the GATT are also crucial to the future of our agriculture based industries in particular, and also to the whole economic welfare of the country.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the ongoing process of reforming the Common Agricultural Policy is already bringing painful and costly adjustments to our farmers.  These changes will continue to demand innovative, courages responses from our farming community and single minded toughness by Government in defence of our vital national interests.</P>
    <P>When I emphasise that the Progressive Democrats' role in Government is to concentrate on policy and not to be side tracked or distracted by personality concerns, it is these policy concerns I have in mind.  We should reassert tight control of our public finances, we should finalise the Estimates preparing a radical and enlightened budget for 1992.  We should protect Ireland's vital national interest in the ongoing GATT and Common Agricultural Policy negotiations and at the Maastricht Summit.  We should vigorously pursue the inquiries into the various business scandals and implement in full as quickly as possible the new Programme for Government.  Earlier this week, and in the light of these considerations, the Progressive Democrats Parliamentary Party made clear that it was our national duty to continue to work in Government on this vital policy agenda.  I have no doubt that the vast majority of people support us in our decision and do not wish us to resort to a general election at this time.  Nor have I any doubt that an election at this time would simply replace the unfortunate political instability of recent weeks with downright political chaos.</P>
    <P>It is easy for Opposition parties to call for a general election, but it is incumbent on those making such calls to explain to the people how a general election now would improve the lot of this country and <Col N="1452" /> the people.  When Fine Gael and Labour call for an election they should accept the parrallel obligation to spell out clearly how they would tackle the problems in the public finances, deal with the unemployment crisis, deal better with the recent business scandals and how they would handle the affairs of Government in a better way.  They should also explain what will be the composition of the alternative Government that they would offer to the people.</P>

      <P>None of the Opposition parties has done this.  They settled for the clichéd and knee-jerk Opposition response of simply calling for an election which they know would leave the political situation totally inclusive and uncertain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a bit fed up with the sanctimonious public declarations by Opposition politicians in this House, that we must now have a general election when at the same time they have their party colleagues heartily thank the Progressive Democrats privately in the corridors for not bringing about an election.  This kind of hypocrisy becomes difficult to stomach when one listens to some of the Opposition contributions here today.  I am aware too that in today's debate, the Labour Leader, Deputy Spring, and others including Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, chose to tell this House what they believed were the views and feelings of supporters of my party.  They are correct when they say that the Progressive Democrats Members have been unhappy with the recent business scandals.  Doubtless that is the fairly universal feeling of followers of all parties.  However, that is only half the story as far as the Progressive Democrats are concerned.  I can assure Deputy Spring, and anybody else who wishes to know, that last weekend my party organised an exhaustive consultative process of our constituency organisations which the parliamentary party took fully into account before reaching their final decision on Monday last.  The overwhelming message from <Col N="1453" /> our members throughout the country is that it is in the national interest for the Progressive Democrats to continue to work in the Government, vigorously tackling the issues I have already outlined in the House.</P>
    <P>I recommend to Deputies Bruton and Spring, and others on the Opposition benches, that they too go and listen to what their rank and file members and the average person in this country is saying at this time.  Everyone has reservations and concerns about recent events.  I, and every member of the Progressive Democrats, share those reservations and concerns. During the course of the past two months I have felt distinctly uncomfortable on many occasions but at no stage have I, or the Progressive Democrats parliamentary party, felt compromised by the stance we have taken and that is the vital distinction.  Our participation in Government is based on the policy agenda of the new Programme for Government.  If that programme is not honoured or if any events arise which in my judgment or in the judgment of the Progressive Democrats parliamentary party compromises us and compromises the trust that the electorate has placed in us then we will not hesitate to respond accordingly.</P>

I would ask all the Deputies of the House to bear with me while I explain what I have in mind.</P>
      <P>James Pius Clarke of Letterkenny, County Donegal, was arrested by the British Army in Derry on March of 1978. He was subsequently tried in Belfast by an non jury court and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment for the attempted murder of a UDR man.  He escaped with 37 others from the Maze Prison.  He was sought for alleged crimes arising out of that escape and, in particular, crimes associated with the death of a prison warder who died in the course of the breakout.  He was free for quite some time but he was subsequently arrested by the Garda Síochána in 1981 and he was put into Portlaoise prison to await trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently this arrest and a request for his extradition by the UK Government became a matter of extradition proceedings and James Pius Clarke and his co-accused, Mr. Finucane, were both released by the courts on Tuesday 13 March 1990.  There were extensive newspaper reports about the release of James Pius Clarke by the court and in a photograph he is surrounded by wellwishers and supporters.  I have here a cutting from <i>The Irish Times</i> of Wednesday, 14 March 1990 with a large photograph of James Clarke surrounded by wellwishers as he left the court following his release. Clearly identifiable in that photograph is <Col N="1456" /> Deputy James McDaid, now the Taoiseach's nominee for the sensitive post of Minister for Defence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I presume RTE will run that film tonight because I know all the <Col N="1457" /> other television stations, BBC and UTV, will run it right across these islands.

Would Minister O'Malley now like to take a leaf out of Deputy Colley's book and veto the appointment of Deputy McDaid to such a sensitive Ministry when the publicity which I have referred to here depicts a nominee for this, one of the highest offices in the land, as a fellow traveller of Provisional Sinn Féin.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> When James Pius Clarke appeared to seek bail on 4 November 1989 before Judge Hamilton he entered the witness box to give evidence in his own defence.  I would like to quote from the report of the case in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 4 November.  I presume the case was on the previous day, 3 November:</P>

    <P>At the very minimum the nominee for this very high security office has a duty to come into this House and explain how he was involved in the proceedings that I have outlined.  What series of events can he draw to the attention of the House to explain this involvement I have outlined? The Taoiseach also has a duty to explain, in the face of all this publicity to which I have drawn the attention of the House and to which I am sure the law officers of the State drew the attention of the Taoiseach, the reason he would discount the publicity which has surrounded Deputy McDaid and proceed with his appointment.  This country is going to be shamed once again tonight when all the wrong signals will go out internationally.  I have no doubt that this will be the leading item on BBC, UTV and RTE and that the message will be that the Taoiseach of the Republic of Ireland is appointing a Provo fellow traveller to be his Minister for Defence.</P>

As the House will recall, Mao said that if you want to create a revolution it is best to start with a blank page.  When we researched the record of the House we found that in the period 1977-82 Deputy Davern scarcely spoke in the House.  On education matters he put two questions down in that five year period relating to two local schools and one other question dealing with visual aid material for schools.  He was not a Member of the House between 1982-87 but I failed to find any major contributions by him on education matters since his return to the House.  Certainly, he did not speak on any of the Estimates on Education.  We have no idea therefore what Deputy Davern stands for and what he would do in Education, but this is not to say that silent Deputies do not make good Ministers. We can therefore give him the benefit of the doubt.</P>

The facts can be stated very briefly.  The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, supported by Deputy Flynn and others, organised a putsch against the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach sacked two Ministers and the putsch failed.  The Taoiseach is now filling the vacancies.  Who leads Fianna Fáil is entirely a matter for Fianna Fáil, but who holds the office of Taoiseach and who serves in Government is a matter for everybody.  Consequently, the reasons which motivated his colleagues to move against the Taoiseach are relevant to this debate.  I have no doubt that those who were opposed to Deputy Haughey were motivated in some way by personal ambition, but I also believe they acted because they no longer had any confidence in the Taoiseach to lead the country.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Taoiseach has presided over a failed Government.  The last 12 months have been a calendar of failure, with unemployment at the highest level since the foundation of the State and heading towards the astronomical figure of 325,000.  The budget has gone off the rails and no remedial action has been taken. The <i>Programme for Economic and Scoial Progress</i> is an expensive irrelevancy to the needs of the community with one million people living below the poverty line while the confidence of the business community is evaporating.  The building industry is at a standstill with garages on the verge of liquidation because of unfair foreign competition while the farming community are totally depressed by the impact of the MacSharry proposals and the failure of the Government to formulate an alternative.  There has been a decline in foreign investment, a reduction in retail sales and a widespead feeling among ordinary people that not only are the Government irrelevant to their needs but that they do not care.  The economic gloom of the people had been accompanied by a collapse of the health service, a breakdown in local government and a massive cynicism among the youth of our country.</P>
      <P>In recent months this general economic and social decline has provided the dismal background to the greatest number of scandals in the State sector ever to rock the confidence of the people. While no one on this side of the House has claimed that any of the scandals involved a Minister personally, it is quite clear that a number of Ministers did not do their jobs.  In particular the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications were guilty of gross negligence at the time in respect of the Greencore an Telecom affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the Taoiseach however is not the same as that of his Ministers. This House remains unconvinced that the Taoiseach did not play a personal part <Col N="1461" /> in the events leading to some of these scandals, in particular the most favoured treatment awarded to Mr. Dermot Desmond of NCB in the appointment of that company to consultancy work in the State and semi-State sector.  Be that as it may, the challenge to the Taoiseach made by Deputy Reynolds and others failed and the consequences are before us today. We are therefore left with the same Taoiseach, and, very largely, the same Government with the addition of one dubious nominee and one nominee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We are therefore left with the same Taoiseach, very largely the same Government, and the same incompetent policies &mdash; in effect, the same tarnished scandal ridden Administration.  The deckchairs have been rearranged on the <i>Titanic</i> but the ship sails on with its doomed crew.  There is no fresh start for the country, no new dawn with new men and women guiding the destiny of the country; there is only the reaffirmation of the old, the tired and the tried and found wanting.  My party will not support the reaffirmation of this reshuffled failed Administration.</P>
      <P>The parties in Government have failed to give the country the fresh start it so badly needs.  We believe that only a general election can do so.  There is also another reason for my pessimism.  The support for the Taoiseach last Saturday was to a large degree tactical.  Ambitious men and women competing with each other for the office of Taoiseach stopped their internecine rivalry for a few days and combined to destroy the leading candidate, Deputy Reynolds.  Now that that has been achieved they will return to their personal agendas and pursue their own interests.  This is not the foundation for a Government or the basis for collective Cabinet responsibility and it provides no foundation for the necessary concerted action to rectify the ills of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These ills are many and varied and I have already listed them.  They are known to every person in the country and in the Government; but the Government have given no indication that they have the resolution, will or ability to tackle these problems.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is in tatters. This programme, which was negotiated late last year and effective from January 1991, was supposed to provide a detailed economic and social plan for three years and to be the basis for economic and social policy for the decade.  It has already been rejected by the Taoiseach, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, and the Leader of the <Col N="1463" /> Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    <P>A new Programme for Government has been negotiated by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil.  It purports to be the economic and social blueprint for the next two and a half years and makes commitments on taxes and PRSI changes which will cost about £650 million. It states fiscal targets which will involve at least £500 million in public expenditure cuts.  When we rake in all the promises made, the cost of the programme is about £1.2 billion; yet the Government have not identified a single penny of the money which will go to fund these expensive promises.</P>
    <P>The programme is merely aspirational and its claims that it provides an economic and social blueprint for the next two and a half years are totally spurious.  Its central plank, the reform of personal taxation, is based on a false premise.  The Progressive Democrats have constantly argued that a reduction in the marginal rates of income tax will lead to a reduction in unemployment, but this is based on a misguided interpretation of the theory of the tax wedge which I will not go into here.  I would like however the Progressive Democrats Ministers to explain how it came to pass that when the standard rate of income tax was reduced from 35 per cent to 29 per cent during the past two years unemployment went to its highest level since the foundation of the State.  I do not believe there is any connection between the two events.</P>
    <P>Neither do I believe that the reduction in the marginal rates as proposed in the new programme will have anything more than a marginal effect on unemployment figures and job creation.  Do the Progressive Democrats seriously believe that, while the reduction from 35 per cent to 29 per cent had no effect whatsoever and was accompanied by historic high unemployment, a further reduction from 29 per cent to 25 per cent will press a magic button and abolish unemployment? The programme is aspirational and a political document motivated by the desire of Fianna Fáil <Col N="1464" /> and the Progressive Democrats to continue in Government, but it provides no blueprint for the future.</P>
    <P>Now that the Progressive Democrats have signed on for another two and a half years in Government it is worth looking at some of the peculiar characteristics of that party.  They are a party founded out of a previous leadership challenge to Deputy Haughey.  They are first and foremost a party which emerged from a clash of personalities.  Now that Deputy O'Malley is the main taca or, to use the English word, support, for Deputy Haughey, the Progressive Democrats party are redundant and their members should apply for membership of Fianna Fáil, their parent party.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats claim they are policy driven but, of course, they are no such thing.  They called for control of public expenditure but, since they joined Government, public, expenditure has risen by 14 per cent, £1.1 billion against an inflation rate of 6 per cent.  They say they are opposed to the perks of office, yet they participated in a Government decision to reverse the decision of the previous Government to use less expensive and less powerful State cars.  They promised to abolish ministerial pensions but have now agreed to pensions schemes, the effect of which will be to increase the ministerial pensions of Minister Molloy and Minister O'Malley.  They promised to implement social legislation and to be strong in regard to the liberal agenda but it was Minister Molloy who thought up the scheme to make the health boards responsible for the selection of outlets licensed to sell condoms.  They promised to abolish the Seanad but insisted that the Taoiseach appoint three of their members to that Assembly.  They talk tough and they vote soft.  They distance themselves and step aside from all unpopular decisions of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;and seek to take sole credit for any limited successes which the Government may <Col N="1465" /> claim from time to time.  Finally &mdash; and most culpably &mdash; they talk of high ethical standards in politics while they continue to prop up a Taoiseach who, together with his close associates, is most responsible for the decline in ethical standards in the public and business life of this country.  Their hypocrisy is accompanied by appalling arrogance in that they fully believe their six Deputies are essential to the governing of this country, a kind of <i>aprés moi le deluge</i> attitude to public life.</P>
      <P>I should now like to comment on the changes announced by the Taoiseach.  I shadowed the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, for a long time when he was in office.  I always found him gentlemanly and courteous in debate; he pressed his political point hard but he was never personal.  I wish him well in his career.  I did not know Deputy Flynn well but he has been replaced by lesser men in Cabinet.  The Ministers of State who were pushed out of office were the pick of the bunch.  In particular, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn distinguished herself in Europe, especially during the Irish Presidency.  I say to her, as the Americans say in politics, what goes round comes round or, as they say in the Gaeltacht from where she comes, &ldquo;Níl íseal ná uasal ach thíos seal, thuas seal&rdquo;. I am sure we will all have another day.</P>

      <P>Good, vigorous critical debate on political, social and economic issues is the essence of parliamentary democracy. Political posturing, verbal abuse, skirmishing and sniping, as we heard every afternoon over the past months, are the exact opposite and serve only to erode public morale and to discredit the whole political process and indeed every politician in this House.

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Today should give us an opportunity to make a fresh start.  I am happy that many of today's speakers have tried to concentrate on the challenges which face us and which must be tackled without delay.  Much has been said about the Maastricht meeting and the efforts which must now be made to narrow the gap between the rich and poor regions within the Community at European level. I argue that, parallel with this, a much more determined effort will have to be made to narrow the gap between rich and poor in our own country.  Today I want to talk especially about poverty among children and teenagers, particularly among children in certain housing estates in every city.  I will not mention the estates by name in case I should draw further attention to the families with young children who are trying to break out of the poverty trap and to achieve some kind of equality.  However, without mentioning names everybody knows of the areas of which I speak.  If urgent and comprehensive action is not now taken we will witness the emergence of grey <Col N="1467" /> townships, versions of the black townships of South Africa with all their attendant problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>They are already there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>They are grim, grey townships described elsewhere as concrete jungles and are poor places in which to spend one's childhood at the best of times.  They have grown even more miserable as a result of the effect of long term unemployment settling like a layer of toxic dust over the life prospects of families living in the areas which I did not name but which I described.  If urgent intervention programmes are not put in place shortly the waste of human potential will be more than I, for one, am prepared to have on my conscience.</P>
      <P>I should like to outline a list of measures which would at least go some way towards alleviating the problem. Proper pre-schooling will have to be provided for every child living in those suburban areas.  Pre-schooling will also have to involve parents because, in many cases, young parents severely lack the skills of proper parenting and that is part of the root of the problem.</P>
      <P>The home school liaison scheme was introduced by the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke.  She will be moved out of the Department of Education later this evening and I should like to pay tribute to her great contribution in attacking the problems of disadvantage during her term in Education.  She, more than any previous Minister, made an honest effort to tackle the problems of disadvantage, which is to her credit, among the many other contributions she made in the educational field.  The scheme which she introduced, mainly on a pilot basis, must be extended and strengthened because it holds the key to the solution of many problems encountered by children and teachers in areas of high disadvantage during childhood years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proper sports, recreational and library facilities will have to be provided to ensure the proper social, emotional and <Col N="1468" /> healthy physical development of young people.  If we have to make policy decisions in that direction we must make them now.  Much has been written about the economic deprivation experienced by young people in areas of long term unemployment. Little has been said or written about the cultural malnutrition inflicted on young people whose minds and imagination are fed daily on a junk diet of videos, morning, afternoon and late night television.  You kill the wealth of a nation when you stifle the creativity of so many of its young children.  What about the teenagers who are growing up in this environment, the young people who on leaving school have no jobs and no propect of jobs?  All young people have a need to prove their mettle.  That is a fact of life.  They need to have the status and identity that comes from having a job to do and they need to have the satisfaction of seeing the fruits of their labour take shape before their own eyes and the eyes of the community.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand that we are prepared to pay £10 million per day on social welfare and we cannot find jobs in a country where so much work remains to be done.  Surely it is not beyond our ingenuity to design, plan, organise and implement schemes whereby young people could be involved, for example, in repairing and maintaining houses in their estates and bringing them up to a proper standard.  They could be involved in schemes that would environmentally up-grade, improve and beautify their housing estates and bring some kind of natural beauty and order back to so many local authority estates that have become run down, some almost to the point of dereliction.  Surely young people could be involved in schemes of tree planting and creating woodlands.  They could work in public parks that need to be developed and maintained or jobs could be found for them in public buildings, many of which badly need a face lift.</P>
    <P>The reality is that there are mountains of work to be done on the one hand and there are many able-bodied people available to do it on the other, if only <Col N="1469" /> we could make it happen.  We now have harmony with our social partners, and those who have jobs are reasonably well catered for.  That welcome harmony should now enable the relevant Government Departments, in conjunction with local authorities, to negotiate schemes such as those I have described and to get them off the ground.  Young people who commit acts of vandalism and expend their energies in destructive ways could be encouraged to direct those energies towards constructive work and we should put schemes in place to enable them to do so.  If only we had the imagination to transfer some of those millions of pounds from social welfare to, for example, the Department of Labour to enable the kind of activity I have described to take place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is a little too smart.  I am very glad the Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, is present because there is need for additional community police persons and proper health and welfare services in such communities.  It is time for all of us to acknowledge that it is going to be extremely difficult to instil concepts of justice into young people whose lives are surrounded with evidence of injustice.  I do not think that is something we should continue to ignore.  In other words, we should not seek to under-estimate the power of the hidden curriculum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems which I have experienced in at least three estates in my constituency will not be solved by Government intervention alone.  The community and voluntary agencies within the community have a role to play, as has the Church.  During the course of <Col N="1470" /> work in my constituency I have met too many young people in whose lives all hope for the future has died.  These are the young people who get caught up in a web of teenage drinking and drug taking and very often teenage pregnancies.  I meet these people when they are 17 or 18 years of age and they have the hardened faces of old men and old women because they have all of life's experiences behind them and none of life's possibilities ahead of them.  In many of those young people's lives all hope is dead, and in any life where hope is dead surely God is missing because God is hope.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I think of the great heroism with which Ireland in the past has sent missionaries abroad to far-flung corners of the earth to bring God to the lives of people deemed to be Godless.  The time has come for some kind of reverse missionary activities.  The Church will have to play a more direct role in coming to the assistance of so many of our young people who are lost, lonesome and adrift in the streets of our cities.  That must be done and we must face up to it.</P>
    <P>In the past we have, as a country, a very good reputation for our generosity to the Third World, maybe not at Government level but certainly in terms of voluntary subscriptions.  We have a very good reputation for the attention we pay to the needs of the Third World, but we have our own third world at home.  We have to look to the developing situation which will get worse unless intervention programmes are put in place.  It was said of the Wild Geese of old &mdash; the 300th anniversary of their leaving is now being celebrated in Limerick &mdash; that they fought everybody's battle except their own.  It is time that we considered fighting our battles, maybe small but nevertheless important battles.  If action is not taken now the consequences to society in the future will be much too serious to even contemplate.</P>
    <P>As we ponder on all the challenges that face us, I hope we will concentrate our time and energy on the Programme for Government.  This is an item about which I feel extremely strongly.  As I said in the course of my introduction, the continued <Col N="1471" /> presence of unemployment is something that I am no longer prepared to live with. It is about time that the conscience of the nation was stirred.  The young people and their parents looking at what is happening today and what has happened in the last month can take little hope from the sparring and the empty rhetoric that has filled the House.  If we are to act according to our consciences we will have to put that behind us and focus on the job that needs to be done.</P>

    <P>I should like to put on record the absolute amazement of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers who scurried so noisely out of this House in a panic stricken exodus that business was stalled for a few moments before Deputy Bruton, the Leader of the largest Opposition party, began his contribution.  Their expressions of amazement, which turned to bewilderment, and in some cases to downright anger, could be heard in the corridors and overheard in the Members bar as <Col N="1472" /> Fianna Fáil Deputies &mdash; both those of the loyal 55 and the doubting 22&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is a testimony to the Minister for Justice's tenacity in holding on to his position that he was not included in the reshuffle.  Perhaps it is a testimony to both Deputy Burke and Deputy Vincent Brady that the Taoiseach considers they are doing a good job, but nobody in his right mind could consider that Deputy O'Kennedy was doing a good job in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  He is being moved from one particularly sensitive position, as head of the Department of Agriculture and Food, to another, the Department of Labour, when after a relatively calm period of industrial relations over the past three years we are facing into extreme difficulty as is manifest by the ongoing industrial disputes which will spill over after the Government renege on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as they have clearly signalled. The Government are putting into that most sensitive of portfolios a person who, with all due respects, has not proven he has the ability to do the job or jobs he had.

Deputy Davern, however, has been a Member of the House for a long time and it is a reflection on him and on the way we conduct our business that a great many people would not necessarily know what Deputy Davern thinks.  Perhaps it is for that reason he is being put into the Department of Education to calm the nerves of the cautious conservatives who were getting worried about the radical sounds associated with the leaked text of the Green Paper on education proposed by the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke.  One has to look at the motivation for selecting Deputy Davern for that portfolio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why were these changes made at a time when the Estimates have not been finalised and when in many cases the key spending Departments have had their key Ministers removed?  We know that the Estimates have not yet been completed. Yesterday at Question Time, the Taoiseach, in his temporary capacity as Minister for Finance, said that negotiations with the social partners were continuing with a view to finding a formula that would enable the Estimates to be completed within the context of the pay commitments for 1992.  When asked to explain what he meant by that he declined to elaborate, but he did not deny the charges I made to the effect that the Government can not yet complete their Estimates because they have not got an understanding with the social partners in respect of modifying the commitments made in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> He did not indicate that the trade union movement, in particular, had been specifically asked to <Col N="1474" /> consider renegotiating, reducing or in some way postponing elements of the pay agreement to which they are entitled and for which they were given an assurance they would be paid notwithstanding anything that had been said by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds.</P>
    <P>Another very strong and clear message has been conveyed by the Taoiseach not just to his own group of 55 and the group of 22 Deputies but to the public.  His message was that promotion, reward and development are not necessarily related to hard work, effort, application or manifest dedication.  I am not referring to Deputy Roche but to the group of young Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party whose ability has been noted and commented upon by various journalists and Members who are not of the same party.  What message is the Taoiseach sending out to a generation of young people who believe that if they work hard and apply themselves they can expect reasonable prospects of promotion and recognition?  On the basis of the exodus from this House this morning, and the sheer anger that is ricocheting around the corridors of Leinster House, a very negative signal has been sent around the parliamentary rooms of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Perhaps it was the same type of signal that was sent around the business circles about tendering for business or trying to promote expertise in relation to work, that the ethos of the golden circle is as predominant and effective as ethos of hard work, application and proven achievement.</P>
    <P>It is hard to understand the promotion of certain Deputies over the heads and shoulders of other Members who, although they have different political views from me, clearly are people of considerable ability.  Indeed, the promotion of two backbenchers over the heads of the seven Ministers of State, allowing for the sacking of their three colleagues, does not make sense.  If County Donegal was to be compensated to balance the loss of a Cabinet Minister in County Mayo and a Minister of State in Galway, logic and, <Col N="1475" /> indeed, performance to date would suggest that Deputy Pat &ldquo;The Cope&rdquo; Gallagher would have reasonable expectations of such a promotion. Instead a Deputy who was elected in 1989 and does not have the experience of many of his colleagues, male or female, from that county has been favoured by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The logic of this reshuffle is not apparent to me nor, I suggest, is it apparent to Fianna Fáil Members, either the 55 or the 22.  If it is not apparent to those of us who are so close to the centre of political gravity in this Republic how will it appear to the public?  How will it be interpreted by the pundits and journalists who will have to explain it?  I believe it has already sent a very confusing and negative signal. The Government are not seizing the opportunity to relaunch themselves and deal imaginatively with many of the problems facing us in the run up to the Maastricht Summit, the completion of the Single Market, the vagaries confronting us in relation to the GATT negotiations and the changes that will occur in the agri-business as a result of the massive changes in Common Agricultural Policy. Instead of responding creatively and positively we have a confused, bemuddled and, I would go so far as to say a sinister and cynical reshuffle by the Taoiseach, who has once again, for the fourth time, warded off an attack on his leadership &mdash; or, as he described it himself, an attempted grab at power, in which he alleged Deputy Reynolds was involved.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has warded off such a grab at power and has brought into the House a team of new Ministers for Cabinet and has made an announcement of three replacements for the sacked three Ministers of State without telling us which portfolios they will get, or to which Departments they will be assigned. We have had little or no explanation about that.  The Taoiseach stood up, gave what was for him an uncharacteristically very brief speech and simply announced who was going to what.  The House was given no reason why Deputy Woods <Col N="1476" /> should take over the Department of Agriculture and Food, although we all know that Deputy Woods has scientific qualifications in that area and perhaps may at one level be eminently qualified.  That explanation was not offered.  Perhaps if the Taoiseach had provided an explanation of Deputy Woods' positive qualifications he would have been in great difficulty when trying to find similar positive qualifications for Deputy O'Kennedy. In respect of all of the placements and all the changes that have been made no explanations of a regional kind, of a political left or right kind, of a technocratic kind or of an administrative kind have been offered.  The portfolios have been just reshuffled, rearranged and presented to us within days of the Estimates being completed and within weeks of the budget coming before the House.</P>
    <P>On a personal note, I want to say that I wish every Deputy in the House well, and I particularly wish the new Cabinet Ministers well.  Having shared that experience myself, I can relate and respond to the sense of honour, pleasure and pride that they must be feeling tonight.  I wish them well without any reservation in that sense of achievement. Indeed, not only themselves, I also wish their families and their loved ones well, because one does not get into the House on one's own, there is a whole team behind every Deputy in the House.  The teams of the two Deputies to be elevated tonight are entitled to due recognition and celebration.</P>
    <P>However, celebrations are short-lived and parties come to an end, sometimes with very unenviable hangovers.  The hangovers that Deputy Ahern, Deputy Davern and Deputy McDaid will have will be substantial.  Therefore, in repetition of what my party leader and colleague, Deputy Dick Spring, said this morning, I think it would be unwise for any members of the new Cabinet or the team of junior Ministers to expect some protracted or extended honeymoon period in relation to the performance of the Government.</P>
    <P>They had a chance to make the real change, the only reshuffle that mattered <Col N="1477" />&mdash; and that was to remove the Taoiseach. They failed.  That move would have brought about a real reshuffle, it would have brought about real change and perhaps it would have brought about a return to meritocracy, openness and, indeed, democracy, not just within this House but within the largest party in it.  That chalice was grasped at a few times and then cast away.  Instead we have what is in front of us now and we are being asked to vote confidence in this Administration and to confirm in office as Ministers of the Government and, I presume, although we have no formal constitutional say in it, in effect to confirm in advance the appointment of the three junior Ministers.</P>
    <P>I want to say on behalf of the Labour Party that we are not prepared to do that and we will be voting against those appointments tonight because there is not contained in the names or in the portfolios to which any of those Deputies have been appointed any glimmer that new policies will emerge.  There is no sense of a new solution emerging from the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Education, the Minister for Social Welfare or from the Minister for the Environment.  In the form of an aside, it may perhaps be good news for Deputy Boylan and the potholers of Cavan-Monaghan in that maybe the cost of running a car in that abandoned constituency will be reduced because of the presence of Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, now Minister for the Environment, with responsibility for that area of environmental abandonment and the quality of its roads.</P>
    <P>But they are minor points on an otherwise bleak horizon, and that bleak horizon will get bleaker.  Yesterday Deputy Pat Rabbitte on behalf of The Workers' Party read into the record an analysis made by a very respected economist from a respected firm of stockbrokers projecting that unemployment would grow to the 300,000 mark by the middle of next year and peak at more than 325,000 at some time nearer 1993.  Nothing that we have heard from this Administration can give us any confidence that they will <Col N="1478" /> reduce that upward and apparently relentless increase.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough to be able to say that, but what is even more damning is the incredible arrogance of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party that not only do they proclaim to not have the answers themselves, they refuse to listen to any other political party in the House who might possibly have half an answer or the suggestion of an answer.  Proposals for an economic and social affairs committee to work in tandem with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> were contemptuously dismissed; suggestions for a jobs forum from the Fine Gael Party were rubbished; proposals for a European affairs committee to analyse in detail and, indeed to strengthen the negotiating hand of the Minister in relation to social cohesion &mdash; as happens in Spain and in Denmark and so as has happened in the Netherlands &mdash; were contemptuously dismissed by that &ldquo;Minister of the Airwaves&rdquo;, Deputy Collins, whose claim to fame relates more to the Abbey Theatre than it does to Leinster House.  This side of the House may not have all the answers but the people over there appear to have none, and their contemptuous, arrogant disregard of any suggestions that might come from this side of the House &mdash; backed up by a permanent Civil Service, which has been indicted in a manner that no such permanent bureaucracy could ever have been indicated by Professor Joseph Lee in his book, which is a testimony to the failure of the 70-odd years dominated by the Department of Finance &mdash; is the real crime tonight.  There has been no real reshuffle.  The deck chairs have been rearranged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall conclude on that point.  Because the House consistently refused to reform the way in which it does business and because the arrogant parties in Government refused to listen or even to hear some of the suggestions <Col N="1479" /> that have been repeatedly put forward by every Deputy from the Opposition side of the House &mdash; and, indeed, I suggest, by many Government backbench Deputies, including those who left the House in disgust &mdash; we have a tired Government, locked in a bunker of despair, with two new members who have joined it, whose contributions we cannot assess because we simply do not know.  We are being asked to vote confidence in that Administration. No, Sir, we will not so do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it should be the Labour Party.  I ask the House to cast its mind back just a short few years ago to 1986 when the Labour Party, then in the most discredited Government that this country ever saw &mdash; in which they participated in a fairly inactive way, I think that would be the charitable way to describe it &mdash; were very active in the reshuffle of 1986, so active that the Taoiseach of the day had his decisions vetoed by the otherwise inactive Minister for Health at the time.  The same Minister for Health, former Deputy Barry Desmond, on one classic occasion announced the closure of about seven hospitals in this country but had to withdraw the proposal before the evening was out.  That was typical of Labour Party participation in Government.  If one were a stranger in the Gallery who had not visited this country before, somebody who did not know the history of the Labour Party in Government, one could be excused for taking Deputy Quinn seriously.  But then one would need to have been in this country for the first time or absent for a couple of decades in order to object to a reshuffle and talk about it, as Deputy Quinn began, to the effect that it should be to complete a programme or stagger <Col N="1480" /> on to the end of a programme.  Deputy Quinn, in his own words, had the honour to be a member of that Government.  I understand the honour of being a Minister. I am honoured to be a Minister in this Administration, so would any Member of this House.  One enters this House to represent the people of one's constituency, with the hope, some day, of achieving a position at junior or senior level in Government and make one's contribution in that way for the betterment of our people.</P>
      <P>It is totally unacceptable for Deputy Quinn to come in here and talk about a reshuffle, about Fianna Fáil business, shedding crocodile tears of concern for Members of the Fianna Fáil Party, for the difficulty the Taoiseach experiences &mdash; something of which Deputy Quinn would be unaware in his organisation &mdash; in making difficult choices for promotion and recognition because there is, as Deputy Quinn acknowledged, such an abundance of talent within the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Taoiseach is limited in the number of people he would wish to promote because, although Deputy Quinn did not use the phrase &ldquo;abundance of talent&rdquo;, he did emphasise there were so many excellent backbenchers and Members worthy of promotion.  I agree with Deputy Quinn that there are so many Members worthy of promotion within our party.</P>
      <P>It is really a bit hypocritical of Deputy Quinn or anybody in the Labour Party to come into this House and talk about reshuffles, about changes in Government, when their party, not in the interest of the country or of the betterment of our people but for no purpose other than base political opportunism, refused to be shuffled.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Taoiseach's constitutional right and prerogative to decide who will be in his Government and in what position they will serve this country. I listened to Deputy Quinn talk about democracy, about the need for change, <Col N="1481" /> the need for committee systems and so on.  What about the Constitution?  The Constitution actually specifies the Taoiseach's right, his prerogative and so on. Until that end of January day in 1987, when they had been milked to the very end, when the national debt had doubled, when there was despair nationwide, when editorials of the time were referring to the fact that probably we would have to call in the World Bank in an effort to bale us out, when there was nothing but pure, black despair nationwide, Deputy Quinn and his masters in that Government, fair play to him, stuck it out to the last bitter moment of that Government when they had to be chased out by the people.  I accept that we are in the cut and thrust of parliamentary debate and that Deputy Quinn was speaking very much tongue in cheek.</P>
      <P>It is all right for Deputy Quinn to make comments about Fianna Fáil, our abundance of talent and so on.  What I do object to &mdash; and I want to put it on the record here &mdash; is this.  I have served in Government now at different levels since 1987 and have been honoured to do so, have enjoyed it and given it my all. Perhaps I have not always been as successful as some would like me to have been; there are things about which I am particularly pleased and others I might have hoped would have been even more successful in that period&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to Deputy Quinn coming into this House and making comments about the permanent Civil Service. In my view &mdash; Deputy Quinn has served in Government and knows this &mdash; within our democracy since the foundation of this State we have been blessed with loyal civil servants, men and women of integrity who have served this country to the best of their ability, who have served successive administrations without fear or favour, without showing any political bias.  I object strongly, as a Minister of this Administration, that the permanent Civil Service should be indicted in the <Col N="1482" /> manner in which Deputy Quinn chose to do.</P>
      <P>I want to say to Deputy Quinn also that it is a bit much to listen to him talk about the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> having crashed.  Other Members, including Deputy Noonan, spoke about it earlier.  No such thing has happened.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in all of its facets is being implemented by way of continuing review and so on.  Since 1987, when Fianna Fáil assumed office, a major plank of our strategy has been negotiations, discussions, and agreement between all of the social partners, that is, Government, unions, employers, farmers.  That was the case with the original <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>and now with the negotiations under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>It would be my hope perhaps a futile one that some day we would hear some Labour Party member come into this House and tell us just how often during their period in Government the unions ever got even inside the door of Government Buildings never mind sit down and achieve the type of negotiations engaged in under the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the commitments given thereunder, continuing into the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> including all of its review and discussion procedures.</P>
      <P>To revert to the point made by Deputy Quinn about Fianna Fáil Members of this House leaving in disgust this morning, I should say that what I saw here this morning was not a matter of Deputies leaving in disgust but rather a rush by my colleagues to go over and congratulate those who among this abundance of talent to which Deputy Quinn referred&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It will be a long time before Deputy Quinn or Fine Gael &mdash; and never, hopefully, for their friends to their left &mdash; will ever have the opportunity of having a Taoiseach stand here and give members of their parties an opportunity to take over in Government.</P>
      <P>It is with the greatest pleasure that I commend this motion to the House affirming the commitment of the Government to the development of this country and the wellbeing of its people through the programme designed by the partners in Government and the selection of Ministers by the Taoiseach today.  That programme, agreed some weeks ago, serves as a review of the agreement devised in July 1989 by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to serve as a basic framework under which both parties would seek to serve our people in Government.  I am pleased to note in this House that the vast majority of the original commitments contained in the programme have been or are being carried out.  That programme has served this country well following on the achievements of the Fianna Fáil Government of 1987 to 1989, providing great benefits to our people.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, we have a unique coming together of the social partners, an unprecedented willingness to work together for the good of all our people, resulting in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The Government continue to work closely with the social partners on the successful implementation of this far-reaching and integral programme.  In addition, we have the European Communities common support framework based on the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inter-party agreement of 1989 set out a wide range of major social, economic and institutional reform objectives, which are now backed up by the new <Col N="1484" /> agreement which has set out a number of specific, ambitious, exciting and determined goals which will enhance this nation in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>This nation faces many challenges. Greatest among these challenges is unemployment.  This Government have taken action which has insured that net employment has increased by 30,000 since 1989; that an economic climate is maintained which is conducive to growth and investment; and that specific measures were implemented to promote growth in important economic sectors in our community such as agriculture, tourism, the marine, financial services and forestry.  A Task Force on Employment has been established to assist the Government in taking speedy and effective measures to assist employment creation.</P>
    <P>In the field of taxation this Government have been widely recognised for taking the bull by the horns.  Steps have been taken in tax reform which ensure that taxation does not serve as a restriction on economic growth or job creation, provide for fairness and greater social equity, reduce economic distortions, facilitate compliance with tax laws, and lessen the attractions and opportunities for tax evasion.</P>
    <P>There has also been a very significant emphasis on the need for social progress in matters which affect the freedom of the individual and the entire quality of life.  For my own part as Minister for Justice with the safety and security of our citizens as my chief concern, I am determined that this country should be guided into a new age where all may feel secure and where the law serves as a protection and a support for our people rather than a burden which diminishes their lives.  To this end I have, since I became Minister for Justice in 1989, introduced an unprecedented legislative programme which will only be surpassed by the programme which I will introduce in the next two years of Government.</P>
    <P>Without going into all the detail of the legislation which has been passed, I will run through it for the record.  Acts included the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, the Larceny Act, 1990, <Col N="1485" /> the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, and the Criminal Justice Act, 1990, of which I am very proud.  It finally removed the death penalty from our Statute Book while ensuring that what were previously capital offences would incur a penalty of life imprisonment with a minimum mandatory term of 40 years to be served.  The Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, introduced new concepts into our law in relation to rape within marriage etc.  Other Acts were the the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991, the Contractual Obligations (Applicable Law) Act, 1991, the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1991, the Courts Act, 1991 and the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1991.  The Criminal Damage Bill, 1990, is before the House.</P>
    <P>By any reckoning that is an impressive and substantial catalogue of legislative achievement over the past two years. However, there are a number of very important legislative proposals in the new Programme for Government which I am committed to enact into law over the next two years.  One of those is the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, which I circulated at the end of last month.  I was glad that it was welcomed by Opposition spokespersons. I am sure that, like me, they will see room for improvement; but we will tease that out on Committee Stage.  I have to acknowledge the welcome which has been given to the general principles of consumer protection included in that legislation and I want to give credit to my colleagues on the other side of the House for that.</P>
    <P>I will be introducing within the next couple of weeks the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulations) Bill, to which I referred in this House yesterday.  It will regulate on a statutory basis interception of communications for the purposes of criminal investigation and State security.</P>
    <P>There will be a Bill to provide for the confiscation of the proceeds of crime, to provide for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other crimes and the prevention of <Col N="1486" />&ldquo;money laundering&rdquo;.  The Bill is currently being drafted and I hope to circulate it before the end of the session.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law Bill will modernise the underlying basis of our criminal law by abolishing the distinctions between offences known as felonies and misdemeanours and by abolishing penal servitude and hard labour.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Evidence Bill will also be published within the next few weeks. It will make business and administrative documents, including computerised records, admissible in evidence.  It will make it easier for children and persons with mental handicap to give evidence in cases of physical or sexual abuse.  It will also set out clearly the circumstances in which the spouse of an accused person is competent and compellable to give evidence for the prosecution, the accused person or a co-accused.</P>
    <P>There will be a Courts Bill to set up a court of civil appeal.</P>
    <P>In the family law area, the Family Home Bill is being prepared to give each spouse equal rights of ownership in the family home and contents.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill is under preparation to amend the law on criminal insanity.</P>
    <P>There are a number of further legislative proposals being prepared in my Department across the range of the Government's commitments.  The Juvenile Justice Bill is a very important example.</P>
    <P>In relation to family law, an interdepartmental review of developments in the area of marital breakdown is nearing completion.  The outcome of that review will be reflected in a White Paper which will be published very shortly by the Government.  The issues which arise in endeavouring to determine the most appropriate response to marital breakdown are clearly wide ranging and complex. Inevitably they are matters which can give rise to strongly held and often opposing views.  Nevertheless, I am confident that the proposed White Paper will make a very significant contribution in the effort to ensure that effective policies exist to assist in the preservation of stable <Col N="1487" /> marriages and that appropriate responses are available where marriages break down.</P>
    <P>It must be agreed that this is a substantial programme of legislative reform. It is all part of the Programme for Government.  It is an ambitious programme to be sure.  I am convinced that these ambitions will bear fruit and that the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, has assembled a team which can and will deliver on the programme's promises.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Bertie Ahern, while Minister for Labour, worked for many years to bring our social partners together in a unified and constructive approach.  His talents, his abilities to find accord where only discord seems apparent, will serve the Office of Minister for Finance well.</P>
    <P>As our new Minister for Agriculture, I am certain that Deputy Michael Woods will bring the same degree of dedicated concern and attention to detail which he demonstrated as Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>With the revisions required in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> I am confident that the skills demonstrated by my colleague, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, will be put to good use as Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Deputies Rory O'Hanlon, Mary O'Rourke and Brendan Daly will bring energy, imagination and great innovation to their new portfolios. My colleagues amply demonstrated this in their former responsibilities.  The Departments of Environment, Health and Social Welfare will benefit greatly from the dedication which I know my colleagues will bring to them.</P>
    <P>In Deputies Noel Davern and Jim McDaid I welcome two friends and colleagues to Government.  I look forward to their contributions in Government and I am sure that all good-thinking people will wish them well.</P>
    <P>In Deputy James McDaid this House has been graced by a Deputy who has been most forthright and eloquent in his views.  He has proven himself to be <Col N="1488" /> honourable in his dealings in this House and with the people he has encountered in his constituency.  I have no doubt whatsoever that he will prove to be a most excellent, competent and absolutely reliable and trustworthy Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noel Davern has served this nation both in this House and in the European Parliament for 22 years.  His has been a distinguished career and has been recognised as a parliamentarian of great experience and a man of great talent and ability both here and in Europe.  He is a man with a very deep knowledge of our community, possessed of an abundance of good commonsense, both attributes serving as marvellous recommendations for a good, indeed a superb Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity completely to reject the level of criticism which has poured forth from the Opposition benches.  Much of it has been pointless and mean spirited.  In the case of Deputy Noel Davern it has been downright scurrilous and abusive and equally so in the case of my colleague, Deputy McDaid.  Indeed, I would put it before this House that the words directed against my colleagues bear more reflection on those who would throw invective and epithets than those to whom these attacks are directed.</P>
    <P>I also take this opportunity to congratulate Deputies Michael Kitt, John O'Donoghue and Dermot Ahern on their appointments as Ministers of State in this Government.</P>
    <P>The team led by the Taoiseach includes my colleagues, the Tanáiste Deputy John Wilson, Deputies Gerry Collins in Foreign Affairs, Seamus Brennan in Tourism, Transport and Communications, our Progressive Democrats colleagues, Deputies Des O'Malley in Industry and Commerce and Bobby Molloy in Energy as well as myself as Minister for Justice. It is a strong team with imagination and talent.  It is a team that can and will deliver on the commitments they have given the people in their Programme for Government.  There is no other grouping in this House which can reflect anything <Col N="1489" /> near the level of experience, talent or commitment which this Government have.  I have no hesitation in commending this Government and their programme to this House.</P>

      <P>The appointment of Ministers and Ministers of State is the responsibility of the Taoiseach.  It will probably not be of interest to anyone except me that 16 years ago to the very day I was elected to this House after a by-election. Since then I have seen people come and go from this House.  I am sure that in a personal sense this is a day of excitement and joy for the new Ministers and Ministers of State.  I am sure also that it is a day of sorrow and disappointment for others.  I do not want anything I say to be taken personally.</P>
      <P>One of the most significant statements made today was made outside the House by the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, the proposed Minister for Finance. He indicated that he would not be a candidate for the leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party on the next occasion this issue arises.  The appointments announced by the Taoiseach today are about the preservation of Fianna Fáil in Government.  They are also about preparing for the next occasion on which they consider whether they should stay in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very interesting to analyse that statement and its consequences for those who belong to the gang of 22.  Both Deputy Reynolds and my constituency colleague, Deputy Flynn, have to a great extent removed themselves from the Fianna Fáil leadership race.  Does this not reflect, in part, the hand of Commissioner MacSharry in this issue?  Does it mean that the Taoiseach will continue to lead the Government until the next general election when Mr. MacSharry will be inveigled back by some method <Col N="1490" /> to stand in a constituency which hopefully he will win and thereby become the great white hope, the great champion, who will lead Fianna Fáil in Government in the years ahead?  This is an analysis worth considering.  I predict that it may not be too far from the truth.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to Deputy Flynn for the work he carried out in the west as Minister for the Environment.  As one of the big spending Departments he had the opportunity to put resources which had not been provided previously at the disposal of local authorities.  I recognise that and I want to put it on the record.  However, he failed dramatically in other areas of major concern to the people of my constituency.  I shall deal with these issues at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Taoiseach that the west has literally been thrown to the wolves.  Despite the calling by the Bishops of conferences on the decline of income or people living in the west, the decline in population and other related problems, only one Deputy from County Mayo, Deputy Calleary, and one Deputy from County Galway, Deputy Fahey, hold ministerial appointments.  This is a far cry from the days when the former Deputy, Mr. MacSharry, Deputy Flynn, the former Deputy, Mr. Gallagher, the Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator Doherty, drove around the west in State cars representing all sorts of Departments.  Connacht has been thrown to the wolves in that sense.  I regret this very much.  People will not forget this at the next general election.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate Deputies Davern and McDaid on their proposed appointments.  I disagree entirely with Deputy De Rossa who stressed the necessity for the Minister for Education to have educational qualifications. Deputy Davern will have to rise to the challenges facing him.  We will all have our personal views on that.  I disagree with Deputy De Rossa's interpretation of the need for the Minister holding this portfolio to have adequate educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>I had known Deputy McDaid for many <Col N="1491" /> years, having been an acquaintance of many of his former school mates in Galway.  It behoves him both as a Minister and personally to clear up as a matter of urgency the allegations in regard to various activities in which he participated a few years ago.  Perhaps the Taoiseach was aware that by appointing Deputy McDaid as Minister for Defence the heat would be taken off certain areas and transferred to some new controversy.</P>
    <P>The appointment of Deputy Ahern as Minister for Finance was predicted by the media.  In fact, they went so far as to say that he could have had any Ministry he wished.  If this is true, his influence must be very great indeed.  It is probably more practical to suggest that with over 1.5 million voters in the Dublin area this is a serious move by the Government to win back votes they lost in the recent past.</P>
    <P>Even though he will not admit it publicly, I am sure Deputy O'Hanlon is glad to leave the Department of Health and that a great burden has been lifted off his shoulders.  I can guarantee him that the county managers and engineers in counties Cavan and Monaghan will be sending faxes to him very quickly so that next July or August he will be in a position to allocate grants to those areas.  In doing this he will be able to show up the people who have been campaigning over the past number of years for the pothole problem to be resolved.  I wish the Minister every success in this very broad ranging and major spending Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy seems to be moving in reverse having gone from being Minister for Finance to Minister for Foreign Affairs to Minister for Agriculture and Food and now Minister for Labour.  Nice man though he is, I think this is an indication of his leadership chances.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to appoint Deputy O'Rourke as Minister for Health.  I fear our chances of having a regional technical college located in Castlebar are well-nigh snookered given her admonition to the former Minister for the Environment during the Presidential election campaign <Col N="1492" /> to remove himself forthwith across the Shannon.</P>
    <P>I wish all the appointees every success in their new ministries.  In particular, I want to congratulate Deputy Michael Kitt, whom I sat beside at school, on his proposed appointment as Minister of State.  He has been a Member of this House for just over 16 years.  The Taoiseach has admonished the Deputy's brother for voting against him.  Deputy Kitt represents the same constituency as former Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy.  Deputy Ahern and Deputy O'Donoghue are very capable men and I wish them every success in their appointments.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet are tired and shell-shocked. While new appointments will give them a short new lease of life they will fall back into the same bunker in trying to deal with the problem of 300,000 unemployed, our balance of payments deficit and the enormous tax burden.  The Taoiseach should prevent the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, from travelling around the world.  It was obvious from his display on the &ldquo;Six-One&rdquo; news that he has spent too long at the Wailing Wall in Israel.  I have never witnessed such an exhibition of hysterics. I hope Peter Brooke did not see that broadcast.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has to deal with very sensitive international issues and his display on the &ldquo;Six-One&rdquo; news was an absolute disgrace.</P>
    <P>A cult has grown up around this Government through the personage of the Taoiseach.  Even though he is a wise politician of great experience I believe that even if he were to wash himself in Jeyes fluid every morning he would never get rid of the cult of &ldquo;stroke politics&rdquo; which has grown up around this Government. The pack of 22 who are baying behind him will always be there and the cold winds blowing across those back benches will begin to warm up after a while.  The six people who always stand by the Republic, or who profess to stand by the Republic, will within six months be snapping at the leader's heels.  For <Col N="1493" /> these few short months of reasonably clear Government I wish them the best of luck in getting down to the serious business of attempting to grapple with the problems facing us, and we will deal with the next storm when it blows up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I congratulate all the appointees on their appointments and as someone who jousted with the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, for some brief time in that portfolio, I wish him well in his new appointment.  He did endure a very turbulent period when I was spokesperson and I inflicted as much damage on him as I could at the time but he is none the worse for wear now.</P>
      <P>I regret very much the movement out of office of the five office-holders and I wish them well in the future.  The only non-political point I wish to make is that I regret the Taoiseach has missed the opportunity to reorganise the Departments. In the transport area, road transport, traffic issues and road construction are dealt with by the Minister for the Environment; aviation and sea transport are dealt with by the Minister for Transport, and ports and shipping are dealt with by the Minister for the Marine. There is a hue and cry among everyone in the transport sector that there would be one single Ministry to deal with all aspects of transport.  That opportunity has been missed yet again.  However, the major point I wish to make in this debate is on the role of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard over the last few days that this was an internal matter for one party, namely, Fianna Fáil.  This debate on tonight's appointments is not an internal matter; it is a matter for the House and the public.  We are dealing with constitutional appointments.  The Progressive Democrats were established on 21 December 1985.  I cannot understand how there is not a total sense of <i>déja vu,</i> some sense of reminiscence amongst those members of the Progressive Democrats about the months before and after the period when the Progressive Democrats were established.  At that time we again had the club of 22, all they went <Col N="1494" /> through, the expulsion of Deputy O'Malley, and I think it is fair to say that all six individual Deputies in the Progressive Democrats would be in Fianna Fáil tonight were it not for the leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.  They took a principle stance on a number of issues about standards in public office, about a style of Government.  I remember distinctly Deputy O'Malley saying he found it unacceptable to read Government decisions in the newspapers or to hear of meetings on matters which were not discussed in Cabinet; yet we had a recurrence of these events recently.  He resigned from the Cabinet and was then expelled from the party.</P>
    <P>If we are to look back at those events and the role of Deputy O'Malley now one has to reasonably conclude that all of that would not be seen now as a position of principle but as a leadership heave by Deputy O'Malley against the Taoiseach in the same way as recent events have been contrived to be an attempt by Deputy Reynolds to heave against the Taoiseach.  Therefore, we must depart from any semblance of principle, any semblance of a higher plane which the Progressive Democrats seek to put themselves, when they now turn away from the politics of personality of which their own creation was part.  Deputy O'Malley said in 1985 that the Taoiseach was not a fit person to hold office.  That situation must be contrasted with his remarks today when he said that he would not be sidetracked or distracted with issues of personality.  He said that he had been uncomfortable in recent times but he would not be compromised.  I suggest, given the revelations that have taken place in this House today, in relation to Deputy McDaid &mdash; against whom I have no personal animosity &mdash; and Deputy O'Malley's singular stance on extradition, he must surely be moving from being uncomfortable to being compromised.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how the Deputies of Limerick East and Galway West can go back to their constituencies when, in those constituencies, Ministers have either been fired or have been precluded <Col N="1495" /> from office &mdash; particularly in relation to Deputy O'Dea &mdash; simply because they have stood up to the Taoiseach.  I do not understand how they will not be obliterated at the next election by people who backed the Progressive Democrats, who saw their stand of principle at the time against the Taoiseach, all of the things we are hearing at cumann meetings and comhairle ceanntair meetings in Galway West and so on.  I do not see how the issue of a secret ballot in 1983 could be a vital issue and now it is not a matter of any significance.  I do not see how Deputy O'Malley could say: for evil to succeed requires good people to do nothing, and pretend not to hear the debate now.  I was convulsed with feelings of revulsion in relation to the performance of the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; yesterday, where he was weeping crocodile tears about the plight of the Ministers of State from Galway East and Galway West who were to be sacked and said that at Cabinet level he would vote against it whereas tonight at 10 p.m. he will vote in favour of it.  That type of cynicism and hypocrisy is so unacceptable that it is no wonder young people are turning away from politics. It was nauseating that he should go on radio and pretend he was sympathetic to their plight when it is known how he will vote tonight.  He should be honest about it and say he believes he has no choice but to take the action he is taking. Who does he think he is fooling?</P>
    <P>The new line coming from the Progressive Democrats is that it is their national duty.  There is a great danger in politics that when you start believing your own propaganda you totally lose the run of yourself.  To say that the public, in any election would not deliver their verdict and try to form an alternative Government, or even the same Government or even give Fianna Fáil an overall majority, to deny the public that right and say there is no alternative was the height of arrogance.  It reminds me of when I first got involved in politics in the late seventies. I was told there was an inherent historical factor about Fianna Fáil that <Col N="1496" /> they believed they were the traditional party of Government, that their whole history was imbued with being in Government. I believe a touch of that is now hitting Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Molloy whereby they think they are indispensable to stable government in this country: such rubbish I have never heard. It is their personal desire to stay in office for as long as possible, to cling like a limpet to office and all the trappings it has, when they clearly see from any sample of public opinion, be it certified opinion polls by all the range of different research companies, by telepolls, etc. it is clearly shown that the maximum support the Taoiseach has is somewhere around 30 per cent and is lower in certain instances.</P>
    <P>Arising out of this debate, there is no way out for the Progressive Democrats. They have to look at their future in the context of the present; at present they will swallow anything the Taoiseach asks them to swallow.  A party that set out with reasonable principles will end up as a party of expediency.  They will fall into the same trap which Fianna Fáil will fall into.  On Friday last the Taoiseach on radio and television defended his leadership of Fianna Fáil since 1979.  When the Taoiseach took over some 12 years ago, in December 1979, Fianna Fáil had a majority of 18 seats.  The legacy of the Taoiseach is that Fianna Fáil will never ever have an overall majority again in the foreseeable future because of the depths to which he has brought them.  Leaving aside the debt he has left the party, the bitterness in personalities and all the internal issues, the fact remains that he has removed for them the opportunity of overall Government.  He has submerged the identity of Fianna Fáil into the folklore hero of a survivor.  What do Fianna Fáil stand for on Northern Ireland, on the economy, and on jobs?  They stand for what the Taoiseach says they stand for; pragmatism, expediency and whatever suits tomorrow's crucial vote.  That submergence of a great party will now affect the Progressive Democrats whereby everything is dictated to by the order of how to get through today, <Col N="1497" /> tomorrow and how to extend the lifetime of this Government.  I regret that this Government is unlike previous Governments: Mr. Lynch reappointed Mr. Haughey, although obviously he did not agree with him; Deputy Cosgrave appointed Deputy Garret FitzGerald and Deputy FitzGerald appointed Deputy Paddy Cooney.  They appointed different personalities who were not clones.  Now we have a situation in which to be a Member of a Cabinet one must be a Haughey clone.  One must swear allegiance publicly.  Tolerance of another person's point of view is vital within a party and within a Cabinet.  I regret that now we have Haughey clones and that unfortunately extends to the two Progressive Democrats members of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened attentively to Deputies Kenny and Yates.  Deputy Kenny forecast the future which I suppose is part of the exercise that Opposition Deputies indulge in from time to time.  Unfortunately, as usual he was wide of the mark.  When the Deputy referred to the Euro-constituency of Connacht/Ulster and to ministerial representation he did not say that when the last Fine Gael/Labour Government were in power there was only one Minister in Connacht/Ulster, the former Minister, Deputy Paddy O'Toole from Mayo, whereas now there are four senior Ministers in Government from Connacht/ Ulster and four Ministers of State.  There is very good representation from that part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank both Deputies Kenny and Yates for their good wishes to me. Deputy Yates referred to the fact that the two new appointments are constitutional appointments.  It is unfortunate that they have not been treated as such in this House by the Opposition.  If they were, Opposition Deputies would not have come in here and attacked personalities by inneundo and unfounded allegations. Indeed, Deputy Yates indulged in that with regard to Deputy McDaid.  The two new Ministers, Deputies McDaid and <Col N="1498" /> Davern, are two honourable men who will make a valuable contribution to Government.  I will be proud to serve with both of them in Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to national duty.  We all have a national duty.  We as Members of the Fianna Fáil Party have an obligation in co-operation with our colleagues in Government from the Progressive Democrats to ensure that we provide efficient and effective Government in the interest of the people.  I am proud of the history of Fianna Fáil in Government going back to 1932.  Fianna Fáil have been responsible for all the major social and economic developments here since 1932.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has been referred to. One of the sad effects of all the hype in the Dáil in the last six weeks is that it may have deflected attention temporarily from the fact that the Taoiseach has given first class leadership since 1987.  If we cast our minds back to 1987, when this country was in a state of turmoil, when there was financial chaos, we can recall that the Government from 1987 to 1989 and from 1989 to date have provided stability and brought about an economic miracle.  Without the Taoiseach we would not have been able to achieve that. Because of his relationship with the social partners he was able to bring about the programme for national recovery.  It is important not to forget that.  The Taoiseach has given first class leadership and will continue to do so as long as he is leader of the Government.</P>

      <P>We do not want to forget the unemployed who recognise that the present Government will help their case.  If I was the Deputy I would not talk too much about the unemployed and the rate of increase in unemployment in the period from 1982 until 1987 when the Deputy's party and the Labour Party were in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> Unemployment went up at a much faster rate then than it has gone up since.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is at its highest now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are cogent reasons which have often been pointed out in this House as to why unemployment has gone up in the last two years.  The fall off in emigration, which took 40,000 people each year from the live register, has now ceased because of difficult economic circumstances in the US and in Britain.  That is well recognised. The people are at home and there is an obligation on us to provide for them. The number of jobs has stayed up over the last two years.  That did not happen when the Deputy's party were in Government.</P>
      <P>I will be leaving the Department of Health to go to the Department of the Environment, so I would like to reflect on some of the achievements in the Department of Health in recent years.  A very solid framework has been laid down for the main areas of health care in the last few years.  I established the Commission on Funding under Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien.  When they reported, we consulted widely and established a group under David Kennedy to look at the Dublin hospitals where there were serious problems with regard to referral, co-operation and co-ordination and where there were problems with regard to the ongoing care of patients in the community.  He reported in record time and following on his report we moved immediately to implement a number of the recommendations that could be implemented without legislation. We also decided to establish a major new Dublin regional health authority to manage and administer the services in the greater Dublin area. Legislation is now in the course of preparation for that new structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also bought in Mr. Noel Fox, a management consultant, to look at the services and how we might get better value for money.  Everybody in the <Col N="1500" /> House recognises that the funding available is limited and it is important that every pound spent is spent effectively and efficiently.  A pound saved in one area is available to spend in another area of greater priority.</P>
    <P>Throughout the eighties there has been an ongoing debate on the health services and on where new moneys coming on stream should be spent.  The consensus is that the money should be spent in the community.  That was recognised by the Government in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and it was also spelled out very clearly in the new joint Programme for Government.  That will ensure the development of community based services for those with mental handicap, physical disability, psychiatric illness and for children.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the health promotion unit in 1988 was another great success.  We transferred the functions of the Health Education Bureau to the Department of Health where they have the full clout of Government with them. A number of initiatives were taken there, including an initiative for the development of the anti-smoking programme, nutrition programmes and a major programme is being prepared on an alcohol policy.  There is also a programme on the prevention of AIDS.  Health promotion is very important.  It is well recognised that many of the illnesses that afflict us are contributed to by our lifestyle.  It is important that the public should be well informed as to what contributes to good health and to maintaining good health, avoiding the illnesses and trauma that can afflict people.</P>
    <P>With regard to legislation, we introduced a number of important pieces of legislation during the last three to four years.  I should refer to the changes in the eligibility system that came about on 1 June.  There are just two categories of eligibility now where there were three. The changes will ensure more equity in the distribution of beds, with beds for public and private patients designated, and that will be to the advantage of public patients.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1501" /> We also introduced valuable legislation on nursing homes for the elderly which was passed by the Oireachtas last year.  It provides among other things for a new system of registration under which all registered health board homes, whether for profit or voluntary, will be obliged to operate.  The Act also provides for a new, fairer approach to subventing nursing homes based on the merits of each individual applicant.  This will replace the present unsatisfactory system which did not guarantee that the limited funds were channelled towards the most appropriate patients.</P>
    <P>The Government also introduced the Child Care Act, which also passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer recess.  That Act is very important, replacing the 1908 Children Act and imposing a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of any child in the community who is not receiving adequate care and protection. It also gives the boards new powers to provide family care and support services and introduces new legal procedures enabling health boards and the Garda to intervene where children are neglected or abused.  It takes account of the many recent practical and cultural developments such as the need for legal controls, pre-school services and a modernised statutory framework for the regulation of children's residential centres.  The new Act updates the grounds on which children may be taken into care and introduces new provisions regarding legal representation for children involved in care proceedings.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the other community based services mentioned earlier, the Government are committed to making the necessary resources available for its implementation.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> contains a specific reference to the new Act and we will, as promised, proceed with a phased implementation of the Act in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Another important issue in the area of child care has been the question of recognising adoptions effected outside <Col N="1502" /> Ireland.  The Government were conscious that children involved in inter country adoptions were particularly vulnerable and that our laws and practices would have to ensure that their best interests were fully protected.  The Adoption Act, 1991, which was passed earlier this year, sets out statutory procedures for recognising adoptions carried out abroad.  While the Act was framed primarily with Romanian adoptions in mind it has the advantage of being applicable to adoptions granted in countries throughout the world.</P>
    <P>They were just some of the major pieces of legislation that were passed during my time in the Department of Health.  I have already referred to the fact that because of the amount of expenditure involved every effort must be made to increase efficiency and effectiveness; otherwise services would be denied to some people.  That was a very important part of the work, because, as the House knows, 22 per cent of what the Exchequer has available is spent on health services.  That is what is being spent in the current year.</P>
    <P>I should say now that I am leaving the Department of Health &mdash; and I can say it with some authority &mdash; that we should be very proud of our Irish health service. Next year it will be 40 years since I entered university and I will have spent that length of time in the health service at one level or another.  I can say with authority that we have a health service that we can be justly proud of.  We have in place all the modern technology that is available.  We have the range of services that are available anywhere in Europe, administered in a highly skilled and professional way.</P>
    <P>While we are proud of our health services we also must be proud of the 60,000 people who work in our health service. They are committed and dedicated people who compare with any that are available anywhere in the world.  That is well recognised.  A consultant told me recently that when he and his family go abroad they insure themselves so that they will be brought to Ireland if they are ill.  I think that is a very high tribute to <Col N="1503" /> our health services.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank those 60,000 people working in the health services for the co-operation I have received from them over the four years I have been in that Department and for the excellent quality of service that they are providing for so many of our people.</P>
    <P>Of course, like everybody else in the House I recognise that there is still much work to be done, that there are improvements that could be made.  I have no doubt that my colleague, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, the new Minister for Health, whom I wish success in the Department, will bring about further improvements in the health service.  Of course she will have the same problem that successive Ministers have had over a long number of years, that is, working within the constraints of a finite resource.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word in tribute to the public servants in the Department of Health.  It is one of my regrets that the public do not seem to know or appreciate the commitment and dedication of so many of our public servants, the workload they have to bear in our Departments of State, their knowledge of the health service, their sensitivity and caring for people.  What we can be very proud of here is the high quality of our public servants.  On this occasion I would particularly like to pay tribute to the public servants I worked with in the Department of Health.  It is only right also that I should pay tribute to the two Ministers of State in the Department, Deputies Noel Treacy and Chris Flood, who have provided a very valuable service to the public and did tremendous work in the Department.</P>
    <P>If I have one regret about my time in the Department it is in regard to the level of debate in this House.  There is a need for constructive debate in all Departments, but particularly in health.  We can say that about a lot of areas of policy in this Department.  In the last six weeks, for example, we have had far too much hype and innuendo and unproven allegations and personality politics.  It does <Col N="1504" /> not reflect well on this Chamber.  It certainly does not serve the interests of the Irish people.  I, for one, always welcome a constructive debate on health and will welcome it in my new Department.  Too often there is a lack of any sort of reflection in the debates that take place. Members just jump on some bandwagon and do not give the sort of attention and reflection that I believe a debate in an area that is so important for the people of the country merits.  We must all be sensitive to the needs of people.  There is a caring philosophy in this House and I believe it could be reflected in the debates that take place.</P>
    <P>There is very important work to be done and I therefore commend this motion to the House.  As I said already, there is a very comprehensive Programme for Government agreed between ourselves and our partners in Government. It is important that we now carry out that programme and it is in the interests of the Irish people that we should do that.  That is why we are here. The Opposition have a constructive role to play in this House if they want to play that role.  They have not played it in recent times.  This role was not played today by a number of Members in relation to our two new colleagues in Government, two exemplary men who will make a major contribution to Government in the coming years.  It is important that we all get down to the job of dealing with the issues.  Included in those issues are unemployment, the Estimates which are being prepared, the finances which have to be balanced.  We have a good record.  We have reduced interest rates, inflation and taxation. That is what we must look at.  It is important that the Government are allowed to get on with that task and are not deflected by innuendoes and allegations, something we have had too much of during the past six weeks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The gasps of incredulity which went <Col N="1505" /> around this House this morning when the Taoiseach announced the appointment of the two new members of the Cabinet tell their own story.  Deputies, including those on the Fianna Fáil back benches, were stunned by the announcement.  The nominations are not simply uninspired, they are dangerously and potentially seriously damaging.  As spokesman on Defence for The Workers' Party, I want to concentrate particularly on the appointment of Deputy McDaid to the important and politically sensitive position of Minister for Defence.  I would like to have been in a position to welcome the new appointment; certainly Deputy Daly was nothing to write home about, but I believe the appointment is a disaster and will send the wrong message to the members of the Defence Forces, the Provisional IRA, the security forces in Northern Ireland and the people of Northern Ireland themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa was the first Member to raise in the House this morning Deputy McDaid's involvement in the case of a man who managed, by virtue of a controversial Supreme Court decision in March 1990, to evade extradition to Northern Ireland where he had been serving a long sentence for Provisional-related activity.  I heard Deputy McDaid on the radio at lunchtime trying to downplay his role in the affair when he suggested that he simply gave a statement to &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; saying that he had been with a friend of his at a stag party in Donegal on the night on which this friend was alleged to have committed a serious offence.</P>
    <P>Let us look for a brief moment at the history of this so-called friend of the new Minister for Defence.  James Pius Clarke was arrested in March 1978.  On 1 June 1979 he was found guilty on ten counts of attempted murder, wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm and possession of firearms with intent to endanger life and was sentenced to concurrent sentences of 18, 15 and 14 years imprisonment.  The facts on which Mr. Clarke was arrested, charged and convicted are set out very briefly in the <Col N="1506" /> judgment of the High Court on the extradiction application of Mr. Clarke delivered on 28 July 1989.  I wish to quote the first paragraph of that judgment.</P>

      <P>The judgment states:</P>
      <P>Mr. and Mrs. William Harper lived in a remote farmhouse near Castlederg, County Tyrone.  They were there on the evening of the 2nd February, 1977, with their three sons, one of whom was a member of the Ulster Defence Regiment.  A group of at least eight armed men attacked the house at about 8 p.m. and riddled it with bullets. By a piece of great misfortune, while this attack was taking place Mr. and Mrs. Harper's married daughter, Phyllis Kennedy, and husband and two young sons aged seven and three arrived at the farmhouse in their car. The gunmen fired on Mr. Kennedy and his car.  One of Mr. Harper's sons, as well as Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy and their sons, were injured in the attack.</P>
      <P>As I said, that quotation is taken from the judgment of the High Court delivered in July 1989 which sets out the facts.</P>
      <P>Mr. Clarke was charged and convicted on his own admission statement.  At his trial he was represented by two Queen's Counsel.  No objection was made by his learned legal team or himself as to the admissibility of that statement and he gave no evidence in his own defence denying the charges.  I have listened to Deputy McDaid suggest that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Mr. Clarke, while serving these sentences escaped from the Maze Prison on 23 September 1983. During the course of this mass escape a prison warder was murdered.  Mr. Clarke was arrested in the Republic in December 1984 and jailed for 18 months on a charge of hijacking a car in April that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Clarke participated in the Provisional IRA structures in Portlaoise Prison and a short time later participated with a number of top IRA prisoners, including the man convicted of the murder of Lord Mountbatten, in an unsuccessful attempt to shoot or blast their way out of the prison.  For this he was sentenced to an additional three years in prison.  As I said, this is a matter of public record so the issue surrounding <Col N="1508" /> Mr. Clarke is not whether or not he was rightly convicted of offences in Northern Ireland.  Subsequent to his return to this jurisdiction he continued open association as a member of the Provisional IRA in Portlaoise Prison and committed two further offences for which he was convicted and sentenced by our own courts.</P>
    <P>Following his release in 1988 he was held on warrants from the RUC seeking his extradition to Northern Ireland to complete the sentence for the attempted murder and other related offences.  In July 1989 the High Court ruled that he should be extradited to Northern Ireland but this decision, as I said, was overruled by the controversial decision of the Supreme Court on 13 March 1990.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy McDaid comes into the House to answer the questions I want to put to him.  I listened to him on the RTE &ldquo;Six-One&rdquo; News when he tried to distance himself from these events.  I hope he will come into the House to answer these questions himself.  Did he swear an affidavit providing an alibi for Mr. Clarke for the night on which the attack took place on the UDR man and his family in Castlederg in February 1977?  Mr. Clarke claims that he did and said so on oath in the High Court.  Mr. Clarke also claims now that he was in fact in the company of Deputy McDaid in a pub in Letterkenny on the night the offence took place.  Did Deputy McDaid subsequently withdraw this affidavit and statement and, if so, why?  Why is he now trying to down-play his role in this affair?</P>
    <P>He was present in the Supreme Court for the decision in the case and film shown on the RTE news on the night of 13 March showed him figuring prominently among a group of people chairing Mr. Clarke as he came out from the court. We should remember that this is the Mr. Clarke who was not just involved in events in Northern Ireland but in two subsequent IRA offences for which he was convicted and tried in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Photographs in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i> the following day showed a happy looking Deputy McDaid <Col N="1509" /> among a jubilant group celebrating the release of Mr. Clarke.  The photograph in the <i>Irish Independent</i> showed Deputy McDaid among a group of what I presume were Provisional supporters.  The new Minister for Defence was shown standing beside a person holding aloft a poster which states &ldquo;Oppose Extradition&rdquo;. Deputy Noonan said earlier that the photograph was taken outside the Four Courts but it was not.  The group shown surrounding Mr. Clarke had crossed the bridge over the Liffey and had travelled a considerable distance up the quays on the opposite side.  Shown beside Mr. Clarke is Deputy McDaid. Mr. Clarke went on to hold a press conference with the media.  Deputy McDaid was not, as he claimed on radio today, simply a spectator at the court, he was there to support Mr. Clarke and he chaired him from the court and accompanied him to an informal impromptu press conference a good distance from the Four Courts, on the other side of the River Liffey.  That is not the action of a spectator or the action of a man who says &mdash; he shares the same GAA club &mdash; that he had nothing to do with Mr. Clarke.</P>

Does he support and subscribe to the views of those other people shown in the group surrounding Mr. Clarke leaving the Four Courts when it seems clear a strong anti-extradition position was exhorted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Provisional IRA are possibly the greatest scourge facing us.  I am quite prepared to set aside the serious political differences we have with other parties in this House in order to combat the Provisionals and their supporters.  We did this very recently on Dublin City Council when we joined forces to deny Sinn Féin the use of the Mansion House for their annual orgy of hate, otherwise known as their Ard-Fheis.  The move was widely <Col N="1510" /> praised and applauded on both sides of the Border as sending a clear message to Northern Ireland that the people on this side of the Border do not want to have anything to do with the Provisionals. What sort of message has the Taoiseach sent to the people of Northern Ireland in his desire to appoint as Minister for Defence a man who describes himself as a friend of a person convicted of serious Provisional IRA offences and who joined so enthusiastically in celebrating the fact that he had managed to evade being sent to Northern Ireland to serve the rest of his sentence for terrorist related offences there?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

      <P>What message does this appointment convey to Mr. and Mrs. William Harper whose remote farmhouse near Castlederg was riddled with bullets fired by at least eight armed men in an attack for which Mr. Clarke received his 18 year sentence and never denied his guilt when he was on trial before the courts in Northern Ireland? Mr. Clarke was not, as Deputy McDaid said on television, innocent in his own mind of these charges.  As recorded publicly by Deputy McDaid, in his view Mr. Clarke is innocent of these charges.  As a man who will accept the position to uphold the Constitution, to be the premier officer of the Defence Forces, how can he justify that statement in view of the fact that Mr. Clarke at his trial, represented by two Queen's Counsel, did not challenge his statement of admission and did not offer any evidence in his own defence at the trial to deny the charges? Should we endorse the appointment of such a person as Minister for Defence? We cannot and should not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is this House being asked to do in supporting the appointment of Deputy McDaid as Minister for Defence?  When interviewed by the media today, and asked why he felt he was picked by the Taoiseach to be Minister for Defence, he said he believed it was part of the campaign of the Government to win a <Col N="1511" /> second seat in his constituency.  Is that the basis upon which Deputy McDaid feels he is suited to the job of Minister for Defence at a time when the Government are debating common security and defence issues with our partners in Europe?  Our next Minister for Defence is being presented to us and his only qualification for the job is the fact that there is a second seat to be won in his constituency.  For too long in this House I have watched Ministers for Defence being appoined with no regard for the seriousness of the portfolio and today we have perhaps had the worst example of that line.</P>
    <P>What of the Progressive Democrats?  I am astonished that their leader, Deputy O'Malley, did not make any reference in his speech to the appointment of the two new Cabinet Ministers.  Demands of political expediency might prevail on him to ignore the ludicrous aspects of the appointment of Deputy Davern to the post of Minister for Education but surely if his party's generally admirable policy on Northern Ireland is to mean anything, he and his colleagues cannot go through the lobbies and endorse the appointment of Deputy McDaid, for the reasons I outlined?</P>

      <P>Over the weekend Deputy Haughey was described in the national media as having succeeded in <Col N="1512" /> achieving a Houdini like escape yet again to survive an attack on his position as leader to Fianna Fáil and remain in office as Taoiseach.  Houdini Haughey; he is well named.  Having made that fantastic escape from the legitimate criticisms of those in his own party who were not happy, he has now plunged himself, and his new Cabinet &mdash; as he described it here today &mdash; into another major constitutional issue and row.  I cannot understand it.  What have Deputy McDaid and Deputy Davern done for the Taoiseach over the last number of days to warrant this great payoff?  There is nothing on the record of this House or elsewhere which would qualify either man for the respective jobs which they are now asked to take on.  I hope in the small way I have illustrated my contribution that it is clear there are very good reasons for not having considered them for the jobs. What have they done to deserve this? The House deserves an explanation and in the absence of one being forthcoming, this House has no alternative &mdash; I respect your position, Acting Chairman &mdash; particularly the Progressive Democrats Members who are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Progressive Democrats members of the Government must look very carefully at their position.  I listened to Deputy O'Malley earlier.  He wondered whether the Opposition were fixated about the small party he represented.  He said there were only six of them as against 77 Fianna Fáil members.  What concerns me about the Progressive Democrats is that they specifically laid down as one of the basic tenets of their existence, good government and decent straight politics in high places, credibility and being above reproach.  If that is so how can they support the decision and vote in favour of the motion tonight?  It is incumbent on <Col N="1513" /> all of us who respect the notion of proper Government to vote against it as we will be doing.</P>

It was not my intention to speak but my knowledge of Deputy McDaid is that he is a fine man and the people of Donegal are very lucky to have such a good representative.  It is unfair that many of these charges have been made against him.  The impression is being created abroad that he is a sympathiser of the IRA but that is not so and he has stated that clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan and I have almost always been on opposite sides politically. However we agree entirely when it comes to condemnation of the IRA and Sinn Féin.  If somebody is accused of a crime and Deputy McCartan happened to be in the same place as that person at the time the person was supposed to have committed the crime I believe the Deputy <Col N="1516" /> would come forward whether or not he knew the person was a member of the IRA who had been involved in other criminal acts.  I believe he would say he saw the person.  Any Member would act in that way.  Otherwise we would be guilty of &mdash; as they used say in the old movies &mdash; framing someone.</P>
    <P>Every time a Cabinet appointment is made it is an opportunity for the Opposition to have a go at the Government.  I am hurt by the accusations that have been made against Deputy McDaid.  They are unfair and cannot be substantiated.  I would like to pay tribute to the Ministers of State and to Deputy Albert Reynolds who was a fine Minister for Finance.  I wish his successor, Deputy Ahern, success as Minister for Finance.  He has a very good mind and he will do a good job. We should be very grateful to Deputy Reynolds for the marvellous contribution he has made to restoring the public finances.</P>
    <P>When we came back to office in 1987 the Taoiseach, in addressing the first meeting of the parliamentary party &mdash; as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is aware proceedings of the parliamentary party are confidential and must not be revealed publicly but I will break the rules on this occasion &mdash; said that the state of the finances were so bad that if we carried on spending as we had been, we would be bankrupt in three years.  He said we would not receive enough money from taxation, customs and excise, VAT and so on to pay the interest on the loans and that the World Bank would be forced to run the economy until such time as we had straightened out our finances.  I remember going to the Taoiseach after that meeting and telling him it was the best speech he ever made and that I would follow him to the death on it.</P>
    <P>We have had a very tough four years in restoring the finances, and it was Deputy Reynolds who had to make the hard decisions.  There is nothing more difficult than a Minister for Finance having to refuse his fellow Ministers the finance they need.  No Minister suffered more than the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, who did a great job under <Col N="1517" /> very difficult circumstances.  Ministers have to make unpopular decisions and, sadly, many people suffer, but it is nothing in comparison with what they would suffer if a Government were negligent and gave away money in order to win short term approval.</P>
    <P>After the election in 1989 we were lucky enough to be able to form a Government with the Progressive Democrats. I am one of those in the Fianna Fáil Party who has no difficulty whatsoever in living with the Progressive Democrats. Some of my best friends are members of that party.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Ethics in Government: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy G. Mitchell on Tuesday, 12 November 1991:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann being of the opinion that it is necessary that there be an explicit, effective and well understood code of ethics governing elected politicians, as well as State board members and senior officials of Government Departments and State companies, and that it is necessary to create a greater openness and accountability in public affairs through freedom of information therefore resolves:</P>
    <P>(1)  to establish a Parliamentary Ethics Commission (hereinafter referred to as `the Commission') consisting of the Ombudsman, the Comptroller and Auditor General and a Judge of the High Court to perform, inter alia, the functions set out hereunder;</P>
    <P>(2)  to request the Commission to draw up, after consultation with the Committees for Procedure and Privileges of the Dáil and Seanad, a code of ethics governing MEPs, Dáil Deputies, Senators and Councillors and to make provision for the subsequent enforcement of such a code;</P>
    <P>(3)  that the code referred to in (2) above will deal, inter alia, with <Col N="1519" /> relationships with outside bodies, disclosure, artificial transactions and abstention from involvement where conflict of interest may arise;</P>
    <P>(4)  to request the Commission to draw up a detailed provision for a register of politicians' interests, on the basis that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in the case of Ministers and Chairmen of Parliamentary Committees, the material in the register would be available for public inspection as of the time of their appointment and for five years after their appointment has ceased,</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of other politicians, the material would be available at all times for inspection by the Commission, and would be published in any case where the Commission felt this was necessary in the light of its investigation of allegations made to it of breaches of the code of ethics;</P>
    <P>(5)  that the Government should draw up a scheme for more substantial State funding of political parties (excluding those who support violence directly or indirectly), on a basis of a ratio of the parties' proportionate electoral strengths to the size of Gross National Product, to cover separately ongoing expenses and election campaigns, so as to reduce the reliance of parties on private donations;</P>
    <P>(6)  that the Commission be requested to make recommendations to Dáil Éireann as to a maximum contribution that might be made by any one individual, organisation, company or group of associated companies to any one political party or to any one individual candidate, and as to a maximum amount that might be spent in an individual election campaign by either a party or an individual candidate;</P>
    <P>(7)  that all political parties and candidates keep accounts of income and expenditure, and that these be lodged for inspection with the Commission so <Col N="1520" /> that the Commission may determine whether there have been any breaches of the provisions outlined above;</P>
    <P>(8)  that a Freedom of Information Act be enacted at the earliest opportunity so that every Irish citizen shall have free access to official documents, including tapes and database, as a normal democratic right of citizenship, subject only to the restrictions which may be necessary having regard to:</P>
    <P>(a)  the security of the State or its relations with a foreign State or international organisations,</P>
    <P>(b)  the central finance policy, monetary policy, or foreign exchange policy of the State,</P>
    <P>(c)  the inspection control or other supervisory activities of a public authority,</P>
    <P>(d)  the interest of presenting or prosecuting a crime,</P>
    <P>(e)  the public economic interest,</P>
    <P>(f)  the protection of the personal integrity or economic conditions of private citizens and</P>
    <P>(g)  the protection of the environment;</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(9)  that where a Minister, or public body, claims a restriction of access, under paragraph 8 above, a citizen shall have right of appeal to the Parliamentary Ethics Commission whose ruling shall be binding on all concerned, subject only to the courts of the land.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1.</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes the Government's determination as set out in the recently published Programme for Government to ensure the highest standards of ethical behaviour in the conduct of all State and commercial business dealings and <Col N="1521" /> fully supports the specific proposals set out in that Programme including:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the introduction of a register of material interests for all members of the Oireachtas as from September, 1992;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the introduction of regulations which will include provisions to apply to State bodies, to regulate business standards, including provisions that:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Board members and any persons involved in the management and/or control of such companies will be required to disclose any direct or indirect personal interest in the company's business,</P>
    <P>&mdash;there will be severe penalties for non-disclosure, including forfeiture and recovery of all clandestine profits or personal gains made at the company's expense;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the requirement that persons proposed for appointment to Boards of all State agencies and companies should make a declaration of any interests relevant to their membership of such bodies;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the introduction of an appropriate code of conduct for employees in each State company, together with an adequate system of internal audit;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the putting in place of firm procedures to apply to State companies the principle of competitive tendering required under current Government contract procedures in the civil service, these procedures to apply to both works contracts and to supply and service contracts;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the taking of steps to ensure the better regulation of those offering investment services;</P>

      <P>Deputy Howlin has eight minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to maintain the tranquility established by the previous speaker but I cannot guarantee that I will succeed in doing that.  We are dealing with a Fine Gael motion on ethics and standards in public life and the need to have some degree of transparency and regulation into the financial affairs of Members of this House and others so that we can restore again the confidence that has been sorely eroded in recent months and years, a confidence that the people of Ireland want vested very firmly in their elected representatives.  Last night I said that I approached this motion almost with a sense of <i>deja vue.</i> We have sought in the Labour Party for almost two years to incorporate either into the rules of this House or by way of legislation a basic code of ethics for those involved in public life in Ireland and the history of that is now known to everybody.  In February 1989 the Leader of the Labour Party wrote to the Ceann Comhairle outlining proposals for a code of ethics and for a register of Members' interests.  I as Labour Party Whip followed up on 19 October by tabling a comprehensive motion incorporating those proposals before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Unfortunately, the debate that took place on those motions in 1989 and 1990 was less than edifying because it became abundantly clear to me very quickly that the two major parties in this House, both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, had no intention of allowing that particular code of conduct and that declaration of Members' interests to be enshrined into the rules of this House. They were first referred to the Whips for consideration, until I raised it again when it was referred to the parliamentary parties for consideration.  After months and months no progress whatsoever was <Col N="1523" /> made to have those basic principles enshrined in the rules of the House.</P>
      <P>I am stoical by disposition and I decided to try another avenue and the Parliamentary Labour Party authorised me to produce a Private Members' Bill, which was published in my name on 26 February 1991.  This Bill was the next step in the development of the proposals we put before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It had three fundamental principles: gifts over £200 to office holders would be public property; there would be a register of Members' interests; there would be a transparency in the funding of political parties so that people who make substantial and sizeable contributions to political parties would be known to the public and so that any potential conflict of interest could be seen and diverted.  Unfortunately, when that Bill came before the House in May of this year, it was voted down by the combination of the Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats parties.  I said last night that the Progressive Democrats privately lauded the Bill and wanted in their hearts to support it, but unfortunately they had finished one macho deed that day in demanding an inquiry into the beef industry and I think they are precluded from performing on a macho basis more than twice in the same day.  Unfortunately, our Bill was defeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tonight we are faced with another attempt.  I do not regard it as perfect, indeed it is quite flawed in many ways, but it still incorporates a fundamental principle that there be transparency in the way we do our business in this House. For that reason the Labour Party will be supporting the motion tabled by Fine Gael when we vote at 8.30 p.m.  There are matters of fundamental principle and it always goads me when people object because they do not like the phraseology, the structure or the sloppy wording.  If the principle is right, let us work on the principle and get the drafting right later on.  I said also that I was amused because when we produced rules of the House at <Col N="1524" /> the Committee on Procedure and Privileges we were told they were inappropriate and they were kicked to touch; and when we produced a Bill we were told that legislation was not the proper way to do it but that it should be done by way of rules of the House.  That underscores clearly to me that there is a fundamental unwillingness, particularly from the Government side of this House, to have this sort of transparency and accountability that most civilised Parliaments have as a matter of course.</P>
    <P>In the couple of minutes remaining I wish to deal with one issue which was raised initially by the former Minister for Finance when discussing the Labour Party Bill and which was addressed again last night by the mover of the motion, and the Minister of State and Government Chief Whip, the funding of political parties. I want to put it on record that the Labour Party have always had total transparency in relation to our funding as we publish annual accounts and all donations are a matter of public record.  Hopefully other parties will do likewise.  However, I believe the time has come when we have to look at the proper funding of political parties.  The Labour Party are not averse to the suggestion put forward by the mover of the resolution last night.  I think this matter should be considered seriously by an all party committee of this House so that we can get away from the underfunding of political parties and of public life, where lobby groups come in here with far more research backup and authority behind them than the legislators who are enacting the legislation in this House.  For that reason I would be dismayed if the tone of the Minister of State's remarks were to be put into practice.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State suggested that we had to uncouple the funding of political parties from the issues of ethics because the Government were going to move forward with great gusto on the issue of ethics.  Having buried the issue for two-and-a-half years, there is a certain nerve and cheek attached to that assertion.  It was never more opportune to bring back public confidence in this House.  The <Col N="1525" /> erosion of public confidence that I alluded to in my speech in May has gone on with gusto and the happenings of the past number of months have damaged to a greater extent the public confidence in this House.  We need to bring back the authority of this House, the accountability of Government and the responsibility of every Member of this House.  I hope that all parties will accept these fundamental principles when they are put to the vote at 8.30 p.m. this evening.</P>

      <P>I could not help thinking when listening to the final words of Deputy Howlin about confidence in this House being undermined that no one is doing more to undermine it than ourselves. I really think we are giving it a terrible blow.  I am not talking about this side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but all sides of the House.  The Opposition are being politically opportunist and are behaving in a somewhat reckless manner in many instances.</P>
      <P>I commend my colleague Deputy G. Mitchell &mdash; we both serve together in the constituency &mdash; who is an honest, hardworking fulltime politician like myself.  We know what it is like to be a fulltime politician: it is very difficult indeed, because of the fact we have to pay the overheads for running our constituency out of our Dáil allowances and that certainly does not make it easy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that our amendment to the motion is entitled to be supported, first of all because it is the Government's responsibility to govern and to introduce the legislation.  It has already been said that in September 1992 a register will be set up in the Library showing the interests <Col N="1526" /> of Members.  That register will be designed along the lines set out by Members of the House at meetings of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. If other people feel they can police themselves then I do not understand why we should not also, until such time as it can be shown that all the parties are in cahoots with each other in trying to defraud the public or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The standards in this House are very high.  It is important to note that people outside the House have very little realisation of the financial sacrifices made by many full-time Members.  It is a big help if one has another profession to fall back on.  I should resent very much an outside commission deciding for this House &mdash; this is our Legislature, we have the ultimate responsibility and we are trusted by the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;every time we go before them to behave in a manner which is in accordance with their expectations. The public have recourse at subsequent elections to take action against anyone who goes against that and infringes on the trust that has been placed in us.  I think I can say, from fairly lengthy experience, that people are very quick to know if a Member is behaving in a manner of which they disapprove, and that will certainly reflect in the subsequent election results for that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like other people to subject themselves to the same kind of stringent examination that is being encouraged outside the House.  For example, Deputy Mitchell last night referred to the news media as one certain group.  RTE, for example, are a huge organisation with millions of pounds to spare.  It would be interesting to know what responsibility they have towards making sure that there is no vested interests among their employees or that people who have contracts with them do not get favourable treatment or other benefits.  That is possible. What about the people who make films and sell them to the station?  How much do the station pay for those films? <Col N="1527" /> Is it the going rate?  Who examines those matters?  There are many questions that could be asked.</P>
    <P>I consider it important that journalists who write for certain papers should have no vested interest in supporting a particular line, perhaps because of outside vested interests that would like them to take a certain line on issues.  In that regard, I am not necessarily talking about outside this country, I am talking about outside their own profession.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of society that could stand up to a better scrutiny than is operated at present.  For years and years Members in the House have advocated the establishment of a press council. We still do not have a press council. Why do the press not set up a press council to monitor themselves?  They have talked about it.  I remember that the late Vivion de Valera used to talk about an allocation of £10 a year being made in the supplementary budget to help to set up a press council.  I think that that is an organisation that is very much needed. All of the time we hear complaints about the size of libel awards, and many of those actions might not arise if there were a press council.</P>
    <P>Members here have the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  At least if someone in the House gets out of line or says something that is defamatory of somebody outside of the House he or she can be brought up and censured.  It is a very serious offence for anyone to be censured by his or her own peers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Government are considering this matter and I am glad there is agreement around the House on it.  I know that the public perception may well be that we in the House are feathering our own nests, that we will pay for ourselves to run for re-election with their money and that there will be all kinds of arguments of that nature put forward.  However, we should stand together and explain that this move is in their interests because we do not want to have to be dependent on companies giving huge donations.</P>
      <P>I personally should like to have a limit on spending in different individual constituencies by individual candidates but, unfortunately, it is very difficult to do that and it is something that could not be policed very effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>How would that be done? If someone decided to employ a certain number of people to go out and campaign for him or her or to do something similar and then pay them cash, how would that be found out?  How would it be stopped? That is a little too much to expect.  As a full-time politician, I am very supportive of limiting the amount of money that can be spent by each candidate.  I think that it would be great if that could be done: we would know exactly where we stood and we could actually raise money to reach that target figure in advance of elections, if that were possible.  Deputy Mitchell and myself agreed at the local elections that we would not put up posters.  At least we cut our expenditure in that way and I think that many people were also pleased in that the environment did not suffer from too many posters, which people tend to complain about. There are certain other areas in which we could make changes, but I am fully supportive of the State funding political parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, the question of maximum contributions is one that is difficult.  If people want to give to maintain the democratic process &mdash; and it is something that it is important to maintain &mdash; let them, but <Col N="1529" /> let political parties be not so dependent on gigantic contributions that they might be accused of becoming indebted to a person or organisation in the sense of perhaps granting favours in the future. In all my political life I have always told people that I cannot get them anything to which they are not entitled, all that I can do is to speed up the process by which they do get that to which they are entitled.  That is what they are here for. We are the buffers between the people and the bureaucrats.  When people are not getting their entitlements we can go straight in to find out why not.  That is our main function, representing the people.</P>
    <P>I note that a Freedom of Information Bill is being examined at the moment.  In fact, we state here in our amendment to the motion &ldquo;and further notes that the question of freedom of information is a matter which the Government intend to examine carefully with a view to the framing of appropriate legislation&rdquo;.  That has to be done very carefully.</P>
    <P>It is a good idea that the House should have the kind of debate that we are having.  It is good that people know that all parties would welcome a situation in which the interests of public representatives can be examined.  Local authorities have a register of interests; I am actually on that register myself as a member of Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>I have agreed to share my time, so I should like to conclude by saying that a register of Members' material interests will be established from September 1992 and available in the Oireachtas Library. In fact, I think this provision goes further in the case of backbenchers than the proposals in this motion.  &ldquo;The details of the operation of this register will be worked out in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and any comments which Deputies may have on this matter might more profitably be directed at the Committee&rdquo;, and there I quote from the speech made here by the Minister of State last night.  We should be happy enough to accept that and to see where it goes from there, but let us not be seen to be foolish by putting ourselves completely under the authority of other people.  This <Col N="1530" /> Legislature is the ultimate authority in this country but, the people are our judges when we go before them.  I always contend that if everybody who is employed had to go before the people every few years on the basis of their performance perhaps we would move at an even faster pace and our country could be wealthier than Switzerland.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank my colleagues for agreeing to share their time with me.  I will not detain the House very long.  I was interested to hear Deputy Howlin say that he was a stoic in these matters.  Perhaps his stoicism will be tested this evening at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I do not have fundamental complaints with this motion although I might argue some of its detail. There appears to be a feeling among Members of this House that there must be seen to be transparency of Members' actions, backgrounds and business, professional or whatever.  As a public representative I contend the public have a right to know details of my financial connections. As Deputy Briscoe said, there is in Dublin Corporation a register the public are quite free to examine during office hours when they can check on my finances, interests and so on.  However, I can assure the public that, like most Members, it is my overdraft which is my main cause of concern.</P>

    <P>There is one point I want to make this evening, which is that increasingly political thought in this country is moulded by people outside this Chamber. Deputy Howlin spoke of different pressure groups lobbying for their interests. Most organs of the media have a range <Col N="1531" /> of commentators and reporters dealing with different aspects of political, social and economic life.  Such people have a large input in the shaping of thought in this Chamber.  Yet they are comprised mainly of a shadowy body of men and women, answerable to nobody, with the exception of the editors of their papers and circulation managers.  Perhaps Deputy Gay Mitchell would reflect further on this matter.  If we are to draw up a register of interests of Deputies and Senators there should be drawn up also a register of interests of commentators, people who comment on our actions here, many of whom come from diverse political, economic, social and religious backgrounds.  For example, I should like to know the background of the leader writer of the main daily papers I read. Such knowledge would help me form an opinion of his or her background and interest and allow me form an opinion as to whether such commentary was written from a value-free position.  Unfortunately, most organs of the media do not have this.  The late John Healy, who at the beginning of each election campaign nailed his colours to the mast &mdash; and not always to the Fianna Fáil mast &mdash; at least declared an interest at the beginning of an election campaign.  I contend that political reporters, social commentators and so on should declare an interest; we should know their backgrounds. Possibly when the Government book of interests is opened in the Dáil Library Members can peruse it as well to ascertain the background of people who contribute to the moulding of Irish political thought.</P>

      <P>From a reading of the motion and the amendment tabled, one ascertains that the difference between them is whether this House controls the activities of its Members or whether such control should be handed over to an outside body.  For example, paragraph (1) of the motion calls for the establishment of a parliamentary ethics commission.  It is that which would present me with greatest difficulty in that nearly all of the other <Col N="1532" /> issues addressed are to be the subject of programming ensuing months.  In that way it could be contended that the tabling of this motion was an attempt to jump the queue somewhat.  We need to examine this question of the appointment of a parliamentary ethics commission to control our affairs, handling the declaration of interests or the various other issues addressed in this motion.  I see the establishment of a parliamentary ethics commission as being in direct conflict with the Constitution &mdash; the Minister of State may have referred to that fact last evening &mdash; in that the Constitution is very clear and precise in stating that Members of this House should control their activities and not hand over such control to any outside body.  I say that in the context of what is being addressed in this motion. I am not a legal person but I would perceive a direct clash with our Constitution in that regard.</P>
      <P>I predict that the public will identify very quickly with the basic issue of the cost involved, the cost of such a commission, in that it is specified that its members should be comprised of various people outside this House.  It could be contended that such people are being paid already to carry out their duties and that there would not be any extra remuneration involved.  I would totally disagree with any such suggestion because all such bodies established tend to expand.  If anybody needed evidence of that fact they need look only at the Office of the Ombudsman where there are demands annually for more finance, more staff, more expenditure of public finance for that Office.  We must remember that public finances are comprised of taxpayers' money; it is taxpayers money we are talking about and not some pot of gold we dig up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could foresee this proposal growing to the point of it becoming a quango, what Deputy John Bruton described in the course of his contribution as a quango.  Indeed, he declared in the early eighties his intention to remove these overlapping layers of bureaucracy, quangos, saying he would eliminate them all. Now there appears to be a suggestion for <Col N="1533" /> the establishment of yet another.  Bearing in mind the cost to the public purse, I disagree totally with the establishment of an outside body for a fundamental reason, that it calls into question the integrity of the Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I know there are groups of people &mdash; almost invariably peer groups &mdash; who monitor the rules, regulations and actions of various bodies.  For example, we do not hear the Judiciary or the legal profession suggest that we should establish a group of politicians to oversee their work.  That might ring some bells in some people's minds.  There is no such suggestion, because the legal profession trust themselves.  They would tend to say: how dare anybody else question our integrity; how dare they suggest that we be capable of the type of misdemeanours often placed at politicians' doors; we will be controlled, governed and regulated by a peer group.  For that reason I would object to handing over control of our activities to any outside body.  That is the fundamental difference between the motion and the amendment.  The amendment goes far beyond the terms of the motion in introducing issues needing to be addressed at this time.</P>

      <P>I am not as experienced in such matters as Deputy Garret FitzGerald. I do not know when to interrupt or heckle, but I will keep a vigilant watch and endeavour to find out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two previous speakers have referred to the funding of political bodies and paying for elections.  I would have to support that kind of thinking on the basis that there is not equality of opportunity. We are aghast at the amount of money spent during the American presidential election campaigns.  In my constituency I could be running against a millionaire businessman.  How could I compete on an equal footing?  I am a professional politician with no source of income other than my salary from this House.  I do not go on lecture tours, publish books or run a business.  A long look is needed at the <Col N="1534" /> financing of political parties.  This would not solve all difficulties but it would ease some of the public disquiet.</P>
    <P>There has been a clamour for public inquiries on various issues.  I have costed a few of the inquiries which took place three or four years ago.  The lowest cost was approximately £1 million.  It is easy to call for this type of thing but the public are entitled to ask if it is necessary to expend money in this way.</P>
    <P>I urge that the amendment be accepted.  Deputy FitzGerald asked why these other items in the amendment should be included at this stage.  Many of these matters are related.  It is significant that the proposals in the amendment are published prior to the putting down of the amendment.  The introduction of the register of material interests is proposed for September 1992.  I already have to declare interests at local government level and I do not see why anybody should be excluded.  It is good discipline. A freedom of information Bill is also related.  There is no point in having some form of control which the public cannot check.</P>
    <P>I am not as familiar as some other speakers with the workings of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I have had to sit in on a few meetings of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I have seen open and frank discussion and a great effort by Members to examine each issue.  They are capable of looking at other issues and coming up with guidelines. I have total trust in them.</P>
    <P>I have covered three basic points: the questioning of the integrity of Members of this House, cost and the Constitution itself.  There is one other proposal included in the motion which I believe could not be implemented.  I refer to the code of ethics governing MEPs.  Can we as a State Legislature restrict our MEPs in ways that others are not?  I am not sure exactly what is meant.  A code of ethics for MEPs is drawn up at the European Parliament and we should not attempt to overlap.</P>
    <P>I urge the adoption of the amendment because of the extra areas it covers.  I worry about the kneejerk reaction to <Col N="1535" /> public disquiet which led, for instance, to legislation requiring the muzzling of dogs.  There is a danger that Deputies Bruton and Mitchell could fall into the same kind of trap in this regard.  The amendment provides for internal control and a declaration of interests but excludes an ethics commission outside this House.  On last weeks &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; it took about a quarter of an hour to drag out the interests of a Member of farming.  It can be difficult to elicit such information but I am sure these difficulties can be surmounted.  It is right that the public should know these things upfront and not through a television programme.</P>
    <P>I work closely with Deputy Gay Mitchell on the Committee of Public Accounts.  He is a totally committed and very fair person.  On examination of the amendment he will see that it goes far beyond what he has been calling for and I strongly urge its acceptance.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party will be supporting this motion to establish a parliamentary ethics commission.  We are not entirely happy with every detail of the motion.  Some aspects of Fine Gael's proposals we disagree with &mdash; for example, the proposed basis for the funding of political parties.  We disagree with some of the proposed limitations on access to information and we question the kind of commission which Fine Gael propose to establish and how it would interrelate with democratically-elected bodies.  But we support the principle that mechanisms must be established which ensure the highest standards of honesty and integrity in public and business life. We need to provide for greater openness and accountability in public affairs and greater public access to information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome this debate and the motion which has brought it about.  It is <Col N="1536" /> a debate which is intended to turn our attention to the solutions to some of the problems which public life in this State has recently experienced.  It is a debate which is very much in the context of the political debate in this House and in the country generally over the past few weeks and it relates very much to the other item on the Dáil agenda today, the appointment of new Government Ministers. Over the past number of weeks one word has dominated public debate.&mdash;&ldquo;confidence&rdquo;. Confidence was lost in senior executives of a State company and they were forced to resign.  Confidence was lost in the chairpersons of certain State bodies and they were asked to step aside. This House witnessed a most acrimonious debate of no confidence in the Government.  Fianna Fáil spent the last week deciding whether or not they had confidence in their leader.  Today this House is being asked to vote confidence in new Ministers and, by extension, in the Government.</P>
    <P>To date only Members of this House or those involved in the companies concerned have been allowed to express their confidence or lack of it in the various people concerned.  However, there is a wider issue of confidence which has not yet been allowed to be expressed and which the motion before us raises in a very direct way, that is, the question of public confidence.  Over the past number of weeks public confidence in the Government has been reduced to an alltime low.  Public confidence in business has been eroded.  This has been confirmed by the findings of a recent opinion poll which showed that three quarters of those questioned believed that standards in politics and business life were falling. Public confidence in politics and democracy has also been eroded.  There has always been a latent attitude that politician's are on the make and are only in it for what they can get out of it.  That view has been strongly reinforced by the events and revelations of the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>Some Members of this House have argued &mdash; and Deputy Briscoe subscribed to this view in his contribution &mdash; that <Col N="1537" /> those of us who have raised questions about the conduct of business, behaviour and accountability of some politicians should have remained silent.  It has been suggested that the erosion of public confidence is the fault of the Opposition TDs who raised the questions or the media who reported the events rather than those who have been in Government and positions of responsibility and whose answers were either non-existent, evasive or incomplete.  Is it being suggested that we should have remained silent?  Are we being told that having been supplied with information we should have buried it and not done our duty by insisting on accountability from Government Ministers?</P>
    <P>The events of the past number of weeks have certainly contributed enormously to the erosion of public confidence in Government, politicians and business. How much worse would it be in the long run and how much more damaging would it be to public and business life if we all lived a lie, if Opposition politicians remained silent and journalists printed only the good news supplied by the Government press office?  Surely that would ultimately lead to an even greater erosion of public confidence and greater cynicism.</P>
    <P>The debate tonight is about how to restore public confidence in politics and business life.  We need to do two things to restore public confidence.  First, we need a cleansing of the body politic and, second, we need to put in place new relevant politics and new mechanisms to make sure that such events can never happen again.</P>
    <P>I am disgusted with what has passed for politics in this State in the recent past.  I belong to what I call the Donogh O'Malley generation, the generation which grew up in the Ireland of the sixties and early seventies, the first and only generation for whom emigration was not an imperative and who could hope to make a living and a home in our own country.  Many of us were lifted out of poverty by free education.  We had hope. It was a time of change.  We glimpsed a wider world through the new medium of television.  Some of us were influenced by <Col N="1538" /> the civil rights and anti-war movements. Some of us questioned the versions of history which we had been taught and we wondered if patriotism was not better served by working for our people than by dying for our country.</P>
    <P>When we now see this country sliding back into economic depression we wonder if our children will have to follow the sad stampede to Maryfield, Virginia, and the humiliating lottery for a chance to make a living in the same cities which once gave refuge to the victims of the famine.  What has become of our independence and pride?  Our island is rich in resources &mdash; the sea, good land, relatively unpolluted air and large deposits of mineral resources.  By European standards we have a relatively under-populated land.  Our people are talented and excel in almost every endeavour.  Our films can win Oscars, our young musicians can excite the world and our emigrants can make good in every land.  Yet after 70 years of independent statehood our Government are still not capable of harnessing the talent and wealth of this land to provide for our small population.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is not just a question of competence or policies.  There is a crisis of confidence in this country because there is a strong suspicion of corruption.  It is sad that there should have to be a motion before this House to establish an independent commission to force honesty on politics and business and reverse the widespread public perception that politicans are dodgy and business people corrupt.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the vast majority of politicians, whatever their political persuasion, have the highest integrity and are motivated by a wish to serve the public.  So too are the vast majority of public servants and business people. What is the problem?  The problem first is that some have abused their positions. The problem too is that we have inherited a political and business culture in this State which has rewarded sharp practice, encouraged social crimes such as tax evasion and regarded political rogues more like favourite characters in a soap opera <Col N="1539" /> than people who hold some of the highest offices in the land.</P>
    <P>The circumatances which have led to the tabling of this motion are part of the cleansing of Irish politics.  This country must rid itself of the mohair suits and what they stand for.  The mohair-suited generation of politicians took over the running of this country from the founding fathers of the State.  The mohair suits behave as if they had inherited not the Government but the ownership of the country.  To the public they proclaimed the great national aims, while in private they pursued their own aim of making as much money as quickly and as effortlessly as possible.  They substituted exploitation of the country for service of the people. They substituted a parasitic style of business for productive enterprise.  They cultivated a culture of cynicism.  They were cynical about the people and the people have become cynical about politics.</P>
    <P>They have turned the country into a chancer's paradise.  Property speculators rip off the taxpayer and the family trying to buy a home.  Tax evasion has become something to be proud of, rather than a cause for shame.  While public services are starved of resources, a whole new profession of tax consultants and accountants have grown up to help wealthy people avoid making a fair contribution to the well-being of all.</P>
    <P>For years we have been told that it is necessary to create a climate for enterprise but the climate which has been created encourages not enterprise but speculation, not wealth distribution but tax avoidance and not prosperity but poverty. It bloated the greed of the few and inevitably it had to get sick.</P>
    <P>The scandals of the past few months have not been an aberration.  They are the result of 30 years of selfish greed and business gluttony.  The public want an end to it.  The people are scandalised by the two-tier society which recent events have exposed.  Every day there is new evidence that in Ireland there is one law for the rich and another for the poor.  The vast majority of people of this State are simply trying to get by.  Nearly 300,000 <Col N="1540" /> people have no jobs, that many again have emigrated over the past decade and some of those are now rightly demanding a political say, a vote, in how the country is run.  Those who have jobs worry about whether they will still have them five years from now.  What will be the economic consequences of European union? Will our children have any future on this island or will it become an offshore golf course for the rich and powerful of the new European super state?</P>
    <P>People look to politicians for leadership for government and for solutions. What they are finding is a Government not selflessly addressing the nation's problems but hand in glove with some of the greediest elements in our society.  We now need new publicly acceptable standards of ethics in public life and that is why I welcome the motion before us.  I should like to deal with some of the details in that motion.</P>
    <P>There should be no question but that a register of interests for Deputies and Senators is necessary.  I welcome the fact that there is a promise &mdash; admittedly rather vague &mdash; contained in the agreed Programme for Government which refers to a register of all Members' material interests.  The question arises as to whether that covers the interests of relatives, or does it cover beneficial interests which Members may have but which may be disguised by some means, mezzanine companies, or some of the other buzz terms that have come into our vocabulary in recent times?</P>
    <P>There should, in my view, be a requirement also that Members declare in whose interest they are acting in this House. Something which emerged in the United Kingdom arising from the establishment of a register of interests in the House of Commons was that many MPs were acting as consultants or advisers for in some cases commercial interests.  In fact it was shown that 170 out of the 650 MPs had on a paid basis some kind of brief for an outside interest.  It would be interesting to know if any Members of this House &mdash; quite apart from their own personal interests and their own material interests and the way in which they may conflict <Col N="1541" /> with their role as legislators &mdash; are consultants or advisers on a paid basis to commercial interests or to lobbies which may wish to influence the passage of legislation in this House.  I would like to quote a comment made by a Labour MP in the United Kingdom in relation to this matter when he raised a question about it in the House of Commons.  He asked was it in order for a member of the House to prostitute himself and to try to sell for personal gain specialist knowledge obtained through his membership of the House and through dealings with Ministers. That is a matter that needs to be addressed in the context of any register of interests which is established in this State.</P>
    <P>The second issue which has arisen concerns the funding of political parties. Unlike the Minister of State, who spoke yesterday, I believe the issue of the funding of political parties is directly related to the issue of ethics in public life and directly related to many of the issues which have been under debate for some time.  Much of the public concern arises from the corporate funding of political parties and from the size of contributions which are made to them.  There is an understandable belief that if a company or a private individual gives a large donation to a political party or to an individual politician they will expect something in return for it.  That is an understandable belief in the kind of political culture that has been encouraged and developed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Political parties are an essential component of our democratic system.  We need to recall the degree of influence which political parties have on our democratic system.  Most of the Members of this House were selected initially by political parties.  Political parties operate the short-listing system for membership of this House.  For example, membership of the Seanad is heavily dependent on political affiliation.  Local government and the appointments to many bodies, whether State bodies or bodies appointed at local level, is often on the basis of political affiliation.  The funding of political parties is a very crucial issue and <Col N="1542" /> clearly there are problems in relation to the funding of those parties.  At least three of the political parties in this House have publicly declared that they have serious financial problems.  Political parties, like any organisation, are essentially voluntary bodies made up of people who would join voluntarily and give a limited amount of their free time to advancing a particular political point of view.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the degree of horror which was expressed by the chairman of the Progressive Democrats when the suggestion was made about the State funding of political parties.  I might add that the chairman of the Progressive Democrats seems to get much more attention in the public airwaves than any Member of this House.  I sometimes wonder what the Taoiseach would say if an officer of The Workers' Party, for example, who was not a Member of this House was to get anything remotely like the amount of coverage he gets.  Leaving that aside, he suggested there was something inherently wrong with political parties, which are such an essential component of our democratic system, being funded through the State.  Yet, if we look at it, there are a whole range of bodies which benefit from State funding. Trade unions benefit from State funding for the purposes of amalgamation and they benefit from State funding for the purpose of training for their members and the Irish Management Institute and managerial bodies benefit from State funding for training and for various other purposes.  Many voluntary organisations benefit from State funding through the National Lottery.  What is so outrageous with the idea of State funding for political parties to enable them to do the work and to contribute to the political and democratic fabric of our society?</P>
    <P>There is, however, another side to that coin to which Deputy Howlin referred. That is, if there is to be State funding for political parties then parties must be prepared to declare the contributions which are made to them by individuals or by corporate bodies.  There should be a requirement that contributions over a certain limit be declared publicly and the <Col N="1543" /> public should know from whom political parties are getting large contributions. There should be some limitation put on spending and on the promotion both by political parties and by individual politicians at election time.  The term &ldquo;a level playing pitch&rdquo; has been used in this House in relation to many matters, but political activity is not a level playing pitch.  Clearly, the two largest parties in this House are at a financial advantage at election time and are able to have a large number of newspaper advertisements. Individual politicians spend very large sums of money in order to get elected. I know of one case in the recent local elections where an individual candidate is reputed to have spent £25,000 in an election campaign to win election to a county council.</P>

      <P>Very few local election candidates would have been able to keep two vans permanently on the road for the entire duration of the local election campaign advertising on his behalf, or would have mobilised the number of canvassers, meals, entertainment and so on during the three weeks of the election campaign.  I do not think the sum of £25,000 is an inaccurate estimate.  The point I am making is that there should be a limit on spending in elections by individual politicians and by political parties because otherwise we will get into the United States situation where the right to be elected will be conferred on those who can spend the most money or who can get ascess to the most money. This brings us back to the quagmire in which we have been over the last period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sharing my time with Deputy Mac <Col N="1544" /> Giolla.  I want to make a final point which needs to be looked at.  To some extent I share the concerns that have been expressed by Members of the Government side about the idea of having to establish another quango to deal with the question of accountability of politicians. Many of the difficulties we have in this area and which we have had in the recent past are due to failure of the Dáil to be able to address our problems.  This House, as presently structured and as the rules of this House allow us, is not to make Ministers accountable.</P>
    <P>Many of the questions raised about business dealings and so on have not been answered.  As long ago as last February I attempted to ask the Minister for Education questions about Carysfort and those questions eventually ended up being asked on the broadcasting air waves.  There is an urgent need to reform the procedures of the House so that we can have proper accountability.  The kind of question time we have, where the pursuit of questions which may be of major public interest is limited to at most three or four minutes of a highly structured old fashioned style of debating and questioning needs to be reformed.  We need a more open, more direct style of accountability in this House by Ministers to the Members.  If we got that, if we got answers to our queries, the necessity for establishing inquiries would be eliminated. If we got accountability in this House on behalf of the public many of the problems that have now arisen might not have arisen in the way which they arose.</P>

      <P>I will not go into the recent scandals.  The need for an ethics commission was there well before that.  I support the motion rather than the amendment because there is a commission. There is not much point in passing a motion here unless there is some monitoring system to ensure that what <Col N="1545" /> we are proposing is put into effect.  I am afraid that the Taoiseach's amendment does not do anything in that regard.  It is simply a pious platitude without any way of ensuring that what is suggested will be done.</P>
      <P>Throughout the eighties in particular there has been greatly increased pressure on public servants and on politicians by speculators and developers because there is much more money to be made in land development.  Where millions of pounds can be made pressures increase on public servants.  We have had a fine Civil Service and local government officials of great integrity throughout the history of the State, but in recent years cracks have begun to appear.  That is very worrying. If they are not halted they could expand and we could end up with a corrupt Civil Service, local government and police force as has occurred in other countries. It must be halted now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An indication of what was occurring became public when a Garda investigation into the planning process was started.  Certain planning scandals were uncovered, not from within the Civil Service or local authorities or from within the planning area.  The scandal was discovered by a Garda investigation which arose from the fact that a builder disclosed to the Minister for the Environment certain information with regard to moneys being offered.  The former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, called in the Garda.  The Garda investigation proceeded for a time and showed that a senior planner in An Bord Pleanála was involved.  An Bord Pleanála is the end of the road for all planning decisions.  One cannot go higher and there is no appeal against them.  They are the protectors of the planning process.  If there is corruption or anything wrong at the lower end of the scale, at county council or corporation level, it comes before An Bord Pleanála and they are the arbiters of supposedly absolute integrity. Yet a senior planner in An Bord Pleanála was arrested by the Garda having been alleged to have received £16,000.  That Garda investigation, to my knowledge, was not completed.  The last I remember <Col N="1546" /> seeing about it in the newspapers was that the superintendent had said that he had now reached a stage where he would have to question certain politicians.  I read that in some newspaper, but it never happened.</P>
    <P>I date the silence of the superintendent and the halting of that investigation and the end of that story from the date on which Deputy Ray Burke was appointed Minister for Justice.  I date it from that time because I cannot recall hearing anything about it since.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us what happened to that Garda investigation?  Did the superintendent make a report?  Did he complete his investigation and make a report?  Can the Minister publish that report so that we can see what happened?  There was a great furore at the time, but suddenly it ended.  That is not what should happen to an investigation.  The result should be made public.  We should know what happened. We should know who was investigated. We should know which politicians the superintendent wanted to question, why they were not questioned and why the investigation was stopped. Where is that superintendent now?  I would like to know that too.</P>

If there was a corrupt senior planner there must have been other corrupt people down along the line.  One person at the top cannot do the thing on his own.  There must be a thread running through the builders, speculators, or people of that nature with possibly politicians in between.  That should have been investigated. There is need to monitor all of this.</P>

    <P>There should be some monitoring also of the famous bovine TB eradication scheme, which has been going on now for from 25 to 30 years.  To date £1.5 billion has been spent on the scheme and we are still as bad as ever we were.  Where <Col N="1547" /> did the money go?  I understand that an average of £10 million per year goes to vets.  With 1,000 vets, that would be £10,000 per vet.  That is not an incentive to them to eradicate TB.  There should be an investigation into where the money is going, into who is creaming off this £1.5 billion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I will not speak for more than a few minutes.  I welcome the opportunity to raise a number of points in support of what is a very thorough and comprehensive motion introduced by the Fine Gael Party.  Earlier this year we had an opportunity to discuss some of the matters referred to in the motion but on balance, and with respect to Deputy Howlin of the Labour Party, the debate on the Labour Party Bill was over-concerned with the question of gifts.  If I remember correctly, the main speaker for Fianna Fáil on that occasion was the Minister for Finance who dealt almost exclusively with gifts and sidetracked the <Col N="1548" /> debate to such an extent that the important issues addressed in the motion were somewhat forgotten.</P>
      <P>Clearly the existence of a register of financial and other interests is a necessity, having regard to the workings of our democratic system.  Indeed, the constitutional position of this Assembly would require such a register.  Even local authorities, on which a vast majority of Members of this House serve, have such a register of interests.  This is one more reason for us to have such a procedure on a compulsory basis.  In view of the widespread cynicism among the general public, a fact that has been acknowledged by Members on all sides of the House in recent times, we need, as an absolute priority, to get our house in order by means of a comprehensive programme of Dáil reform, including the kind of procedures laid down in this motion.  Openess and transparency are necessary in the handling of the business of Parliament. There is a great need for us as legislators to restore the primacy of Parliament in compliance with the place Dáil Éireann is accorded under our Constitution.</P>
      <P>When dealing with the question of ethics in Parliament I wish to deplore a practice that has grown in recent years, particularly with reference to the present Government where important announcements of State are made at meetings, functions, dinners and party political gatherings outside the confines of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>That was always done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This further erodes the institution of Dáil Éireann and that must stop.  I understand that a register of interests was proposed almost three years ago at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of this House and has not yet been completed.  In replying to public anxiety and because of their indefensible position on the matter, the Government parties were forced in the recent Programme for Government to make reference to such a register.  However, the fact that this register of Members is <Col N="1549" /> purely voluntary makes it a meaningless and worthless exercise.  I would hope that the committee, referred to by Deputy Briscoe, that is to seek to examine this matter will ensure that this register of financial and other interests will be compulsory and that it will be obligatory on Members from the Taoiseach right down to the most junior backbenchers to register their interests, if any.</P>
      <P>The second point I wish to refer to is the matter of State funding for political parties which we should have no hesitation in putting in place.  This scheme will, of course, be coupled with checks and balances, such as the publication of annual audited accounts of each political party, a ceiling on private donations to political parties and, perhaps most important, a set of regulations dealing with the manner in which candidates spend money at election time.  This principle of the State allocating some funds to political parties is already in place and it is important to remember that such State funding, if expanded, would not be spent solely on electioneering but would provide Deputies, being elected Members of this Assembly, with the necessary research and facilities to enable their task as legislators to be undertaken to the best of their ability.  It is most unfortunate that when this matter was discussed in the House earlier this year the Progressive Democrats, from outside this Chamber, were prepared to dismiss the matter out of hand.  Perhaps it is because of the big business backing of that party, or that the well-heeled professionals that run that party were somewhat afraid that donations to that group and moneys expended by that party on electioneering might some day become public.  As public representatives of whatever persuasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mrs. Barnes) Acting Chairman (Mrs. Barnes)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mrs. Barnes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy to conclude within the next few seconds to allow Deputy Gay Mitchell and Deputy Garret FitzGerald time to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask Deputy Mitchell for just one minute to conclude. <Col N="1550" /> Members of the House should be able to contribute freely to debates on the lawmaking process without being compromised from any source.  I believe that the setting up of a parliamentary ethics commission, coupled with a commitment for a system of State funding for political parties will allow Government and Deputies to perform their duties under the law and under the Constitution.</P>
      <P>In a year when two separate debates took place on this issue it would be a pity if the Government were to use the sledgehammer approach of the division lobbies to defeat this measure in the manner in which the Labour Party Bill was defeated earlier this year.  I would ask the Government to have a rethink and between now and the time we vote on this matter to come up with something a little more compromising than the amendment proposed last night by the Minister of State on behalf of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a couple of points.  If we look at the Government amendment we see that it differs substantially from the original motion put down by my party.  Some of the differences are to the good, adding useful material in regard to State enterprises, State bodies and the standards that should apply there.  There is a welcome reference to the taking of steps to ensure the better regulation of those offering investment services.  These I would be happy to add to our motion without difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, everything else is dropped with the single exception of the introduction of a register of material interests of all Members of the Oireachtas from September 1992, a register which will list the names of the companies and concerns one is associated with, but no more.  That is what a register is in other parliaments. What has been dropped is, I think, of great importance.  They include two main subjects.  One is the concept of disclosure by Members of their financial position or income from other sources, expenditure, liabilties and assets, when they become Ministers and for some years thereafter, not publicly, because that would be to <Col N="1551" /> ask more than is necessary and therefore more than is desirable, but to a commission of a kind that would command public acceptance and confidence, that information to be used only if a Minister fails to disclose something that is discovered or if some material information arises that he has behaved financially improperly, in a manner not covered by his disclosure.</P>
    <P>We could argue about the composition of the ethics commission.  It seems to me that if such a commission is to command confidence amongst the public who are now unhappy and alarmed at the things they have heard, worried about and lacking in confidence in politicians in a way which is very damaging to politicians and politics as a whole, then we need some body which is not simply composed of politicians themselves.  How often do politicians themselves &mdash; that is the Committee on Procedure and Privileges &mdash; in fact deal adequately with problems that may arise?  I do not think that would command great confidence.  One can argue about the composition of it.  What one cannot argue about &mdash; and nobody has I think, so far argued about it &mdash; is the desirability of having some such system because unless that exists people will not be confident that some politicians, however few they may be, have not in some way derived financial benefit, from their position as politicians, of an improper kind.  There is only one way to clear that and that is to establish this system.  Yet that has been deleted by the Government with the support of the silent Progressive Democrats who contributed nothing to this debate.</P>
    <P>The other provision relates to the financing of politicial parties.  That too, has been deleted.  I think it is important. I know from my own experience as leader of a party what has happened in our party and I know that at no stage when I was leader, or since, or previously&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not think he should give my constituency colleague a chance to conclude?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1552" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that at no stage was money ever received from anybody or any favour given to a person because of it.  If there was any suggestion or hint that money was being provided in the expectation of such a favour the money was returned instantly, and that did arise in one or two instances.  Can we, however, expect the public to believe that this is true of all parties all the time?  Is it right that these doubts should exist when we can resolve the problem by the simple method of having State funding of an impartial kind by some process as set out here?  I would like to think that those on the other side of the House from both parties will rethink this in the general interest, their own interests as well as ours.  There is no party interest here.  The interests of politics are at stake here.</P>
      <P>The other points I want to make are simply to endorse what Deputy Mac Giolla has said.  I have been very concerned watching that inquiry peter out.  I think that if the police inquiry has got nowhere there should be a public inquiry and no amount of inquiry fatigue should prevent an inquiry into that planning scandal to root out any element of misbehaviour in that area so that confidence can be restored where it has now been destroyed in the planning process.  That is vital and I entirely endorse what Deputy Mac Giolla has said in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been an interesting, if limited, debate and I am glad the Fine Gael Party have had the opportunity yet again to put this proposal to the House.  I am also grateful for the constructive contributions which have been made.  I deliberately avoided making any provocative statements or using language which might excite other Members, accusing other parties in the House of being lesser beings or suggesting that this potential weakness was to be found on one side or corner of the House.  It affects us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very disappointed with the Minister of State's reply to my speech.  His speech was obviously put together by a number of different Departments and read out badly in the House.  Indeed, it <Col N="1553" /> took me quite a while to work out exactly what his amendment was saying.  The pages of his speech were not numbered, another indication that it was hastily put together, but he stated: &ldquo;I cannot see how the imposition of the proposed commission would be consistent with this fundamental concept in our Constitution&rdquo;. He went on to speak about the right of the House to regulate its own affairs.  It was extraordinary that he should say this some weeks after the Goodman inquiry was set up.  It is an extraordinary statement. We are entitled to make whatever laws and regulations we wish once they are consistent with the Constitution and it is wrong to use the Constitution as a shield against the public interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State went on to ask if it was &ldquo;being suggested that the electorate of this country have elected a Legislature which is so corrupt that we cannot order our own business or regulate our own Members&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>No suggestion along those lines was made and I resent that question.  The Minister of State is being defensive.  This is the Lower House of Parliament, the important House and it is right that these issues should be raised and debated here. That is our job and that is what we are being paid to do.  It is wrong for the Minister of State to come into the House to raise such a question, I presume at the behest of some scriptwriter.  I have a higher regard for this House than the person who wrote that script.  That is not what lies behind those proposals.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State went on to say:</P>
    <P>On the question of public funding of political parties once again the main Opposition party have attempted to link this question with the general issue of ethical standards in public life.  I suspect a degree of opportunism here.</P>
    <P>That is another defensive comment.  In my opening speech I quoted what Deputy John Bruton, the Leader of Fine Gael, said in launching Fine Gael's proposals on integrity in public life on 28 November 1990.  He said:</P>
    <P>Businessmen who seek help from the <Col N="1554" /> State, whether through grants or tax concessions, must know that the same rules apply to them as to everyone else. There should be no chosen champions, no sweetheart deals and no discretionary concessions.  The same rules should apply to all and be seen to so apply.  Fine Gael believe that this requires that there be legislation to guarantee high levels of integrity in public life.</P>
    <P>That was said almost one year ago.  Why then is there this suggestion of opportunism? The Minister of State made that comment having listened to me read Deputy Bruton's comments into the record.  This does nothing for the debate on the very serious issue before the House.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Deputy Howlin and the Labour Party for their support, in principle, for this motion.  I was also pleased to be in a position to support, in principle, legislation they introduced about six months ago.  I have been led to understand by the members of my party who are members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that difficulties were encountered at that committee with the Bill because that Bill included a proposal that information relating to the overdrafts of spouses and related matters should be declared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Some matters should be private and others public.  Difficulties were created for the members of parliament in Australia where such a declaration has to be made when the spouse of one member said she was not going to declare her interests and that it was none of parliament's business.  She told the High Court the same thing.  In many cases our spouses live separate lives.  While it is only fair that we should declare our interests it is also fair that spouses and members of our families should declare their interests privately to the commission who would only make their interests public when a conflict of <Col N="1555" /> interest arises.  That is the reason I believe a parliamentary ethics commission would work.  If I had a 21 year-old son, which I do not, I know what he would tell me if I informed him he had to declare his interests.  He would tell me to get out of politics.  It would be unrealistic to go to those lengths but there is general support in the House for the principle.  I appreciate in particular the support of the Labour Party in that regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe said that we do far more to undermine ourselves than anybody. Perhaps that is true but in the motion before the House I have not sought to point the finger at anybody or to suggest that it arises from any particular case.  None of us is in a position to point the finger.  I agree with his suggestion that there is a possibility of a conflict of interest in the media, in the trade union movement, in business and in all walks of life but if we want them to put their houses in order we must do so first.  If they do not do so we can require them to do so by legislation but we cannot do so if we do not put our own house in order first.</P>

The Ombudsman, the Comptroller and Auditor General and High Court judges are all paid by the State.  No one is suggesting that they should sit in an office all day waiting for something to happen.  It is nonsense to suggest that it would impose a cost on the State.  He suggested that this was a knee-jerk reaction to recent events but I would point out to him that in November 1990 Deputy Bruton published proposals in this regard.</P>

I suggest that many Members have interests which they do not want to declare and most of those are not in conflict with their public duty.  They are fearful of declaring them, which is what I have done, as they would be held to ridicule and emotive terms would be used <Col N="1557" /> against them.  That should not happen. We are entitled to presume the honesty and integrity of Members of the House. When I was first elected to the city council in 1979 I had a low regard for the city fathers.  I thought they were a lot of old fogies.  However, I now have the highest regard for city councillors, Deputies, Senators and MEPs.  Many of us have shortcomings but we all set out daily to serve the public interest.  Of course, we must take into account the human weakness of temptation.  I was asked in a radio interview this morning whether all politicians are crooked.  Certainly not, that is not the suggestion behind this.  I am one of the people in this House who defend and uphold the rights of Members because we get a raw deal a lot of the time and do not stand up for ourselves.

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>Go gcomhaontóidh Dáil Éireann leis an Taoiseach d'ainmniú na Teachtaí Nollaig Ó Dobharáin agus Séamus Mac Daibhéad chun a gceapaithe ag an Uachtarán mar chomhaltaí den Rialtas.</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputies Noel Davern and Jim <Col N="1561" /> McDaid for appointment by the President to be members of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy James McDaid as Minister for Defence poses for this House and indeed for the country some very serious questions for the future security of the State.  The Minister of Defence is a key Ministry in security matters, particularly in relation to Border security.  Deputy McDaid, the proposed incumbent is a man who is alleged to associate with, and to fraternise with people who have engaged in subversive activities.  Deputy McDaid who has been nominated to government by the Taoiseach has made public declarations against extradition and has been seen to actively support the anti-extradition lobby.  A report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 4 November 1989 covering James Pius Clarke's application to the High Court for bail, stated that Mr. Clarke the witness, said: &ldquo;that a local TD had said he was with him in County Donegal when it was alleged that he (witness), had been involved in the attempted murder of the UDR man&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was the case referred to in this House this morning by my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  Deputy O'Keeffe said: &ldquo;If I remember correctly, that case was the MacIntyre case.&rdquo;  Deputy Proinsias De Rossa immediately corrected him and said: &ldquo;No, Clarke, he was convicted, a convicted Provo&rdquo;.  Deputy O'Keeffe thanked Deputy De Rossa for the correction.  Deputy McDaid was asked about this today on the radio programme &ldquo;News at One&rdquo;.  In the RTE interview he was asked: &ldquo;Do you want to deal with the specific charge?&rdquo; He [that is Deputy Jim O'Keeffe] was saying that you gave evidence for a convicted Provisional IRA man&rdquo;.  In reply Deputy McDaid said: &ldquo;This is totally untrue.  If he would research his speech properly he would understand that I was interviewed on a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme in which I said that I happened to be at a stag party a long time ago of a friend of <Col N="1562" /> mine and that particular person happened to be there.  That is the only time that he could accuse me of anything like that but, naturally enough he would exaggerate it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an entirely inadequate account of Deputy McDaid's knowledge of James Pius Clarke.  Deputy McDaid was, in fact, on an anti-extradition protest outside the Four Courts and was standing beside James Pius Clarke as he was released. Footage of this was shown on television on the &ldquo;Six-One News&rdquo; before the interview with Deputy McDaid.  When pushed by Mr. Seán Duignan about his acquaintance with Clarke, Deputy McDaid said &ldquo;he was merely a spectator outside the court&rdquo;.  Let me ask the House, does a spectator outside the court usually associate so closely with the appellant, as this picture very clearly shows.  This is a picture, which the Taoiseach may be interested in, that shows Deputy McDaid shoulder to shoulder with Mr. Clarke on that occasion.</P>

      <P>I wonder whether a spectator at a court follows the appellant 200 or 300 yards up along the quays on the lower side of the Liffey, as this picture in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 14 March 1990 depicts.</P>

      <P>I think the Taoiseach should know about this.  Here is Deputy McDaid right beside an anti-extradition poster.  According to a report in the <i>Donegal People's Press</i> of 16 March 1990, James Pius Clarke praised the efforts of Deputy Jim McDaid, Councillor Bernard McGlinchey and MEP and Deputy Neil Blaney.  In fact in the <i>Donegal People's Press</i> of 16 March 1990 the headline on the front page was &ldquo;Welcome <Col N="1563" /> Home Jim&rdquo;.  Inside a further heading said: &ldquo;Letterkenny Rejoices at Clarke's Release&rdquo; and on page 7, under the heading &ldquo;Rapturous Reception&rdquo;, there were pictures of scores of &ldquo;no extradition&rdquo; posters and a report of the official welcoming party in Letterkenny on that occasion which included Deputy Jim McDaid, the chairman of Letterkenny UDC, Councillor Blake and Councillor McGinchey.  One would have to ask if this is the normal activity of a mere casual spectator.  In short, within hours of his nomination for the post of Minister for Defence, Deputy McDaid has contradicted himself: he clearly had known Mr. James Pius Clarke and had met him not only at a stag party of a friend of mine a long time ago at which that person happened to be.  That is the real situation and I think Deputy McDaid should clarify his position on all these matters to the House this evening.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's nomination of Deputy McDaid really jolts one's memory and brings one back to the years 1969-70, the time of the gun-running.  One can only assume that the Taoiseach is back in his good old form and what he is doing is actually proposing to anti-extradition Deputies as members of his Cabinet.  I wonder how this rests with Deputy O'Malley and his &ldquo;stand by the Republic.&rdquo;  I wonder how Deputy O'Malley and the Progressive Democrats can sit so comfortably over there, knowing that the security committee of the Cabinet now consists of none other than the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, the proposed Minister for Defence, Deputy McDaid, and, I think, the Attorney General.  Can one have confidence in the security committee of this Cabinet?  I put it to this House that we cannot have confidence in such a committee. It is an absolute disgrace that a combination of people of such irresponsible and untrustworthy calibre can sit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I now wish to comment on the Minister's who have departed from Cabinet. In particular I would like to convey my good wishes to Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn who as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with special responsibility for women's affairs did great work.  She has also done particularly good work in Europe.  It is unfortunate that because she and other Ministers would not support the Taoiseach in a parliamentary party vote he should see fit to dismiss these people from Cabinet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Such was the belief among all parties in Donegal &mdash; Fine Gael, the Independents, The Workers' Party councillor &mdash; in the innocence of this man that Donegal County Council passed a motion opposing his extradition, including Deputy Harte, who sat behind Deputy Noonan when he made the outrageous remark that I was a Provo fellow traveller.  People in Donegal will know my views on the Provisional IRA.  I despise them for their murderous campaign, which has brought <Col N="1566" /> so much heartbreak to thousands of our fellow Irishmen.  I despise them for their ongoing attempts to corrupt countless young people by recruiting them to an organisation which brings nothing but tragedy to this country.  I pray to God that they will cease their activities without further delay.</P>

Suffice it to say that I need quote only one, taken from <i>The Irish Press</i> of 26 March 1990, almost 18 months ago:</P>
      <P>As far as the general principle of extradition is concerned, I want to make it quite clear that I have no time whatsoever for the perpetrators of such horrible atrocities as Enniskillen and Darkley, regardless of their motives.  I believe that if those accused of such crimes were located within our jurisdiction they should be extradited, provided that sufficient and appropriate evidence accompanied the warrant and that our authorities were satisfied that the accused persons were guaranteed fair treatment and a fair trial in the jurisdiction which sought their extradition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure of the comment being made by Deputy Brennan, but I am delighted to see him in the House for a change.</P>
      <P>The scheme as promised by the Minister seeks to protect and enhance the countryside by encouraging farmers and landowners to follow conservation friendly farming practices.  This scheme is entirely voluntary and the response of the people in the Slieve Bloom area has been most positive.  This countryside is of high environmental quality, with considerable landscape and nature conservation interest.  From an agricultural point of view, much of the land provides a very low economic return and farmers were looking forward to the plan being implemented and the necessary cash returns being forthcoming.</P>
      <P>A period of almost nine months has elapsed since the Minister made the specific and unambiguous commitment but nothing seems to have happened since. The scheme is an important part of the entire rural development process and with 70 per cent of the funding available through the European Community I cannot understand the inactivity of the Minister in this regard.  I am sure that the Minister of State opposite is fully aware of the present farm income crisis that has drastically reduced the incomes of farmers in County Laois, which is primarily an agricultural county.  I ask whatever Minister for Agriculture and Food, if any, the country might have tomorrow that he or she would locate this file in the Department forthwith and make the necessary arrangements through the European Community to implement this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the enormous success of this programme in certain areas of the Scottish Highlands and the western isles.  There has been a tremendous response on the part of farmers across the Border in Northern Ireland <Col N="1570" /> to the scheme introduced four years ago and which to date has received an investment of over £5 million.  The Minister will be aware that in 1975 the Slieve Bloom area was designated as an environmental park.  Appropriate conservation programmes in the area must stem directly from the low profitabiity of existing farmlands there.  As a result of the lower economic return there has been an increased tendency for hill sheep farms to be sold off for afforestation. More generally there is a lack of expenditure and investment on traditional farming operations which over time would help to protect and enhance the environment.  The growth of forestry plantations at the expense of hill sheep farming is not necessarily a threat to the environment of the area, but the prospect of continuous afforestation, where the whole of a hillside for many miles is planted with a limited range of coniferous trees, must have serious detrimental effects on the natural beauty of the area and may damage the habitat on which wild birds, animals and other natural flora and fauna depend.  The farmers in the Slieve Bloom area rightly deserve this designation.  I urge the Minister to act in this matter forthwith.</P>

Council Regulation (EEC) No. 797/85 permits member states to introduce schemes under which annual premiums may be paid to farmers who undertake to introduce or maintain, for at least five years, farming practices compatible with the requirements of the protection of the environment and of natural resources or with the requirements of the maintenance of the landscape and the countryside. The EC contributes 65 per cent to the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the Government's environmental action programme a decision was taken to introduce an environmentally sensitive areas scheme in Ireland. Accordingly, an interdepartmental committee was set up to recommend areas <Col N="1571" /> suitable for designation as environmentally sensitive.  Following the report of the committee the Minister announced in February 1991 that two areas had been selected on a pilot basis, one in the Slieve Blooms, Counties Laois/Offaly and the other at Slyne Head, County Galway. The Slieve Bloom environmentally sensitive area comprises the entire district electoral divisions of Kyle and Nealestown in County Laois and Roscomroe in County Offaly.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated at that stage that a suitable scheme would be sent to the EC Commission for approval. There was no undue delay in drawing up the draft scheme in the Department and in forwarding it to the Commission. Negotiations with the Commission on measures of this kind usually take some months.  In addition to negotiating with the Commission the proposal has also to be submitted to the Committee on Agricultural Structures and Rural Development which is representative of both the Commission and the 12 member states, for their opinion.  Then the Commission take a formal decision.  There is no question of implementing a measure in advance of formal approval by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The present position is that formal consultation within the framework of the EC Committee referred to took place on 24 October.  Final approval of the scheme is expected very shortly when we should be in a position to invite applications from individual farmers in the pilot areas concerned.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In raising this matter I want to make it quite clear that I hold no brief whatsoever for people who deal in illegal drugs where farming is concerned.  Indeed, I would contend that no penalty is sufficiently severe if such people set out to damage our beef industry.  Nonetheless, in these circumstances it would appear to be a question of using a sledge hammer when a smaller implement might have been just as useful.  We are talking of very genuine people who earn their living under licence and who are being branded as criminals.</P>
      <P>I can understand the effort to put an end to any dangerous practices being perpetrated but there could be nobody more obvious on any road than some person in a van.  In this age of massive unemployment, with many skilled people having lost their jobs, surely it would not be difficult to deploy extra inspectors to keep an eye on such people?  I feel very concerned for the plight of people who have spent considerable amounts of money building suitable rooms close to their homes where they can store drugs and who can no longer keep them, or who may have invested in vans, finding their livelihood abolished because this general plan has been introduced leaving them with nothing.  We must remember there are families depending on them and that we have much unemployment. Therefore, I contend this is overdoing it.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to take another look at the matter, to go for the black sheep, but not to include everyone in that category because there are too many decent men involved who have devoted almost a lifetime to this way of life.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy <Col N="1573" /> Browne for having allowed me share his limited time.  I support everything he has said.  There are people nationwide, in my county also, who have engaged in this business for many years, bona fide traders. I do not think anybody would accuse them or suspect them of pushing substances that would be illegal in any way. We all agree with the campaign of the Minister and his Department to give our beef industry the best possible name.  We must depend on that good name if we are to sell our produce abroad.</P>
      <P>In replying would the Minister indicate whether it is his intention in the future to allow people apply for licences to establish businesses at a fixed place?  I am aware that according to the relevant regulations people who are in the business are allowed to take orders at home and deliver medicines in their vans to various parts of their region.  Is it the Minister's intention to allow such people apply for licences to establish, for instance, new businesses at marts or other areas where farmers congregate so that they can get the product they seek without too much trouble or hassle?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Browne and McGinley for raising this important matter for those representing rural constituencies.  I am well aware of the circumstances to which they refer and know at least two reputable van salesmen.  The position is that the Animal Remedies (Prohibition of Certain Sales) Regulations, 1991, to which both Deputies referred, come into operation on 1 December.  The regulations, which apply to all animal remedies, prohibit save under licence the following activities:</P>
      <P>(1)  The sale by mail order or from a travelling shop, vehicle or an automatic vending device, or</P>
      <P>(2)  The making of visits from house to house for the purpose of soliciting, collecting or obtaining orders for any such remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations do not apply to any visits <Col N="1574" /> for the purpose of soliciting or collecting orders when such visits are made to persons at their respective places of business and the persons who are so visited are lawfully entitled to sell the animal remedy for which the order is sought. Notwithstanding the licensing possibility, there is an absolute prohibition on the sale of an animal remedy from other than a fixed premises.  Therefore, it is not possible to issue licences for sales from vehicles, travelling shops and so on.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the introduction of the regulations were twofold.  First, under a recently adopted EC Directive it is necessary to introduce a system whereby all outlets engaged in the retail supply of veterinary medicines are specifically authorised and strictly controlled by the authorities in the member state.  To comply with this requirement arrangements for the introduction of a comprehensive licensing system are in hand. The type of controls required mean that only permanent fixed premises will meet the criteria for such authorisation.  The new regulations are a first step in this direction.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the role of van salesmen in the distribution of illegal drugs has received widespread attention.  It is extremely difficult to monitor the activities of mobile outlets and this fact has been greatly abused by many engaged in this line of business.  In addition to selling totally prohibited substances these persons have also engaged in the supply of prescription only medicines such as antibiotics. Strict regulations were introduced in 1986 to confine the availability of these products in order to prevent indiscriminate use.  In order to protect public health it is necessary to ensure that these substances are used responsibly and only where absolutely necessary in food-producing animals.  It is a regrettable fact that nearly half of the successful prosecutions taken for breaches of veterinary medicines legislation related to the illegal supply of controlled or prohibited substances by van salesmen.  I am satisfied that this new legislation will further strengthen the ongoing campaign against the illegal use of veterinary medicines.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> Two other concerns arise from the supply of veterinary medicines by vanmen.  All veterinary medicines must be produced to the highest standards of quality in order to ensure safe and effective use.  The guarantees of the safety, quality and efficacy given by the authorisation system are dependent on the proper handling and storage of the medicine prior to use.  Many van salesmen carry medicines in their vehicles from the time they take delivery to the time of sale.</P>
    <P>During this period medicines may be subject to extremes of temperature which at the least may result in loss of potency but more seriously they may deteriorate to form dangerous compounds.  There is also the hard-sell aspect whereby farmers are induced to purchase and use unnecessary medication.  Quite apart from consumer concern arising from over-use of medicines, farmers do not need to be forced into incurring additional input costs.</P>
    <P>I know to my own certain knowledge at least two van salesmen in my immediate area who are highly reputable and give a very good service.  A good service has been given to farmers over the years by their local salespersons.  This is particularly true in the case where farmers wish to place an order to have goods delivered at a later date.  For this reason I am prepared to issue licenses for the purpose of visits from house to house to solicit or collect orders subject to the following conditions: the representative may have no animal remedies with him in the course of his duties; the order will be taken in the form of an offer from the farmer to purchase the animal remedies; the order must be returned to a fixed premises for acceptance, and the animal remedy must be delivered to the farmer by a means of distribution which does not involve the use of the representative collecting the orders.  I will be issuing application forms for such licences to all persons who have inquired about them.</P>
    <P>I should add that the regulations do not prohibit the delivery of orders taken <Col N="1576" /> at a fixed premises.  No licence is necessary for such deliveries.  The regulations only apply to the sale of animal remedies and do not affect the sale of other products direct to farmers.  I would hope that a reasonable and equitable resolution of this problem can be brought about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a major crisis in the railway mode of transport.  We do not want the standard reply that the Government provide CIE with a generous level of financial support to provide essential transport services.  Fundamental decisions must be taken now.  Are the Minister and the Government prepared to stand idly by and see the present railway mode gradually disintegrate?  In effect this is happening because of the indecisiveness of the Department over the years.  The general public are becoming increasingly disillusioned and angry.</P>
      <P>In my constituency commuters along the outer suburban rail route in towns such as Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Lusk, Donabate, Malahide and Portmarnock cannot depend on the service any more to get to their place of employment. Trains seldom run to schedule, are cancelled at short notice and breakdowns have become the norm.  Where their jobs are at stake, can we blame commuters for turning to other modes of transport? This would be a tragedy, given their preferred option for public transport.  I demand immediate action to remedy the problem.</P>
      <P>One of the causes of the problem is the unreliability of the locomotives.  It is disgraceful that the last locomotive was purchased in 1973, some 18 years ago.  In addition 80 per cent of the company's fleet is over 25 years old.  New locomotives are urgently required if any semblance of a service is to be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another major area of concern is the lack of carriages, which is especially damaging at peak times.  The need for additional railcars was identified in 1985 when a submission was made to Government by CIE for authorisation to build <Col N="1577" /> 45.  It was not until 1991 that a decision was taken.  This was for 17 new railcars, a totally inadequate number.  That delay ended the coach building industry at Inchicore, which is an utter disgrace.  Carriages will now have to be purchased outside this country.</P>
    <P>Critical to quality and safety of service is track renewal.  Is the Minister aware that over 850 miles of the rail track in this country are over 50 years old and nearly 300 miles of timber sleeper track are over 25 years old, both outside their life expectancy?  Given the need for safety, need I say more?  The alternative to replacement of track is a reduction of speed, which in essence means a reduction in service and so drives customers away from the railways.  The failure to renew the track represents, in effect, a decision to bring traffic on these lines to a halt, and could ultimately lead to the closure of all branch lines with the exception of the main lines to Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Belfast.</P>
    <P>Railways have enormous social and environmental benefits by way of reduced road usage.  They cause less pollution and emit less noise.  In view of the social importance to both urban and rural communities throughout the country, will the Minister state why the railway mode received only £30 million compared to an allocation of £600 million for road infrastructure from the EC Structural Fund?  Will the Minister accept that a major anomaly exists whereby railways must pay for their own infrastructure, including heavy interest charges, as opposed to roads which are automatically funded from the Exchequer?  Will the Minister rectify this anomaly?</P>
    <P>Major decisions are required.  I ask the Minister and the Government, on behalf of the people, to follow the line taken by other European countries and give preference to public rail transport rather than roads.  This would save the railways and would be in the interests of the general public.  Do the Minister and the Government want to be recorded as depriving the people of the public transport service which has been at the social heart of the country throughout the <Col N="1578" /> years?  It is time for decisions and I am asking the Minister to act.</P>

      <P>Is maith an rud go bhfuil an rún seo os comhair an Tí anocht.  I am glad of the opportunity to respond once again to a question on this matter.  The total subvention to CIE in respect of the provision of essential public transport services will amount to over £108 million this year or over £2 million per week.  More than £86 million of this amount will be spent on the railways. In addition, the Public Capital Programme provides a sum of £36.2 million, of which £10.3 million has been allocated for expenditure on railway signalling, new rolling stock and other rail related infrastructure.  The allocation of resources within the group's individual capital programme is a matter entirely for the board.</P>
      <P>I should add that the total State subvention towards railways in the ten year period since 1980 amounts to over £856 million which represents a very substantial commitment to the railways by the Government.  As I made clear on several occasions recently in the House and elsewhere, there are no proposals to close or downgrade railway lines.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to amalgamate the three secondary schools in Gorey, Loreto Abbey, the CBS and the vocational school.  These schools need extensions or new buildings.  They accommodate approximately 1,000 pupils and service Gorey town and the surrounding district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After persistent pressure on the Department of Education, agreement was reached in 1985 to build a co-educational school and to locate the vocational education committee on the same campus.  It was proposed that some of the facilities would be shared by the vocational education committee and the amalgamated secondary schools.  A site was secured and plans drawn up.  The three schools in question spent a considerable amount of time preparing for rationalisation and a climate of co-operation existed in expectation of progress. <Col N="1580" /> However, delay after delay stifled this co-operation with the result that dispondency set in.</P>
    <P>In November 1989 the Minister informed a deputation that there could only be one school under unified management. She also stated that once agreement was reached building on the school would start immediately and that finance was available.  Agreement was reached after several meetings which involved much compromise by the three schools who were assured that the building would commence in 1990.  The Minister announced at the annual general meeting of the AMCSS on 9 May 1991 that building work would commence and £4 million would be allocated.  Of course, this announcement was warmly greeted by the people of Gorey and the surrounding district.  Unfortunately, nothing happened since then and people have become very aggravated.</P>
    <P>These three schools have approximately 40 pre-fab buildings between them which cater for approximately 40 classes per day.  Pre-fabs are estimated to have a life span of approximately ten years.  These pre-fabs are 18 or 19 years old and are extremely difficult to maintain. Last year the Christian Brothers spent in the region of £6,000 on their pre-fabs. These pre-fabs have leaking roofs, rotten windows, rotten frames and the toilet facilities are an absolute disgrace.</P>
    <P>At a parent-teacher meeting which I recently attended as a parent a request was made for a fire officer's report and a health officer's report to be compiled immediately.  I have no doubt that these reports which will be presented to the Minister will not be favourable.  Even if work on the school was to commence tomorrow it would take approximately two-and-a-half years to complete.  Meanwhile the pupils and staff have to put up with these atrocious conditions.  When will the Minister sign the document in respect of this school?  We know that everything else has been cleared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <P>These schools are located at Deputy D'Arcy's home town of Gorey. I see Deputy Browne in the House and I <Col N="1581" /> am sure he will support our request.  It was the Minister who decided to amalgamate these three post-primary schools, the vocational school, Loreto Convent and the CBS.  All of these schools had plans for the replacements of the pre-fabs which they have to use.  The Minister visited these schools, met deputations, made commitments and invited tenders some months ago.  Now we are told that the design team and so on are holding up the work.</P>
      <P>We are asking the Minister to honour her commitment that the appointed tender will be sanctioned in December and that the money will be provided in the 1992 Estimates.  That was a very specific, fair, open and honest commitment. These schools cater for over 1,000 students and this is one of the biggest requirements in the county in terms of education.  I ask the Minister to honour her commitment and give the contractor, who I understand is from Athlone in her constituency, the go ahead to carry out this work.</P>

      <P>It is an absolute disgrace that the Deputy allowed it to reach the point he did.  I want to outline for the Deputy the extensive progress made in <Col N="1585" /> the last two years.  In August 1990, or thereabouts, we completed the planning and asked the school authorities to apply for planning permission.  On 12 September we received tenders in the Department to proceed with the project. Those tenders are under examination and it is expected that the examination will be completed at the end of this month. Pending the availability of money in the 1992 Estimates the facility will then be ready to go to contract.  I wish to put it to Deputy Connaughton that the reason for the delay in this school has nothing to do with me or my Department; it has to do with the fact that up until December 1988 absolutely nothing &mdash; not even a pen had been put to paper &mdash; was done to get this school started.  This school for special children with a handicap was located in prefabricated accommodation for 27 years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Corley, Freeman, Duffy, Leonard and O'Brien families from the Kilkelly area of County Mayo have children attending Ballyhaunis Community School.  Until this summer the standard of transport was adequate to say the least.  However, as and from September there was a rearrangement of <Col N="1586" /> transport.  The situation, for example, of the O'Brien family from Cloughvalley is that they leave home at 7.30 a.m. each day and at this time of the year it is dark. They are collected at 7.50 a.m. and arrive at Ballyhaunis Community School at 8.10 a.m.  The school does not open until 9.05 a.m.  Therefore, they have to wait for 55 minutes each morning.  They are collected at the school at 4.50 p.m. are dropped off at 5.10 p.m. and finally walk to the house at 5.30 p.m.  That is a total of ten hours, the longest working day in the country.  It is dark when they leave in the morning and dark when they return home.</P>
      <P>The problem is not one of cutbacks but rather that the mini-bus in question collects those children and, having deposited them in the morning, then collects a second group of mentally handicapped children for St. Anthony's School in Castlebar.  I do not think this is an adequate standard of transport, it is appalling.  There are mini-buses in the area which would be more competitive than that doing the run at present.  I am asking that the collection be rearranged because what is involved is a question of mismanagement or bad management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Higgins for his contribution.  Up to the end of the 1990-91 school year those pupils were collected in the morning at 7.55 a.m. and arrived in Ballyhaunis at 8.30 a.m.  School commences at 9 a.m. in Ballyhaunis.  In the evening the service departed Ballyhaunis at 4.20 p.m. and pupils were set-down at approximately 4.35 p.m. or 4.40 p.m. The revised operating timetable for the pupils affected and who are now travelling on the mini-bus is as follows: morning pick up at 7.50 a.m. and they arrive, in Ballyhaunis at 8.10 a.m.  In the evenings the mini-bus departs Ballyhaunis at approximately 4.40 p.m. or 4.45 p.m. and sets-down the pupils at approximately 4.55 p.m.  It is a feature of the scheme that many children arrive early before school commences and provision is normally made by school authorities to accommodate those pupils and allow them to study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the service provided, <Col N="1587" /> while not as good as that which operated at the end of the 1990-91 school year, is well within the time limits for travelling and waiting times set down by my Department.</P>
    <P>I would like to add that I have no proposals to alter the existing arrangements which are in place.  I would like to remind Deputy Higgins that the times which I have set out are normal times which have been in operation since school transport was begun 16, or so, years ago.  We all accept, as I pointed out in the recent debate in the Dáil, that we would prefer to pick up children at a later hour in the morning and leave them home at an earlier hour in the evening but the reality is that since the transport system was begun children, in some cases, have to be picked up earlier than would be normal and left home later than we would wish.  That has been normal provision in this scheme since its commencement. The times are no different from that which pertains throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy F. Fahey, the problem of building a new vocational school at Mooncoin, County Kilkenny.  This school has been the subject of debate for a considerable number of years.  As my colleague Deputy Connaughton stated, it has been announced on so many occasions now that I find it difficult to keep track.  Promises have been made by Government representatives, including my colleague, Deputy Aylward, in <i>The Munster Express</i> in December 1990 when he stated that he has received the good news from the Minister for Education that work would commence in 1991 to provide a new vocational school at Mooncoin.  Those buildings and prefabricated buildings are still there to be seen.  They are atrocious. <Col N="1588" /> The board of management, the staff, parents and pupils are to be complimented for meeting the requirements of the second level curriculum in view of those conditions.  I regret that the teaching staff and parents, because of the situation is so serious and because they have received so many undertakings and false promises, have had to take the unprecedented action of going into industrial dispute.  This is a very difficult decision for teachers and parents but they had to go through with this in recent days because of the lack of action by the Minister for Education to meet obligations and promises made over the years.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to allay the fears of the community in Mooncoin by announcing tonight a start-up date for this project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify the position regarding the provision of a new vocational school at Mooncoin, County Kilkenny. As the Deputy stated, this has been the subject of debates between both of us on a number of occasions.  The most recent development is that Kilkenny Vocational Education Committee were requested to submit revised plans with an appropriate cost reduction.  In December 1990 the vocational education committee were authorised to invite tenders for the project. In March 1991 an incomplete preliminary tender report was received in the Department from Kilkenny Vocational Education Committee.  Following correspondence on the matter a revised preliminary tender report as submitted in May 1991 and this report was the subject of ongoing correspondence with the vocational education committee until recently.  Kilkenny Vocational Education Committee were authorised on 25 October 1991 to request their design team to prepare a final report which is now awaited from the vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 14 November 1991.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The GATT Uruguay Round negotiations commenced in 1986 and were due to be completed by the end <Col N="1376" /> of 1990.  However, this proved impossible because of wide-ranging differences in a number of areas including agriculture between the principal parties to the negotiations including the EC, US, the Cairns Group and Japan.</P>
      <P>Discussions have been continuing in the GATT throughout most of this year and in so far as agriculture is concerned these have been concentrating largely on technical issues.  While many of the technical agriculture questions have been clarified, the principal political matters remain unresolved.  A further attempt is now underway in the GATT to bring the negotiations to finality and all of the main participants are committed to seeking agreement by the end of this year or early next year.  The most recent impetus to the GATT round negotiations came at the weekend during discussions in The Hague between the Community and the US when both sides agreed to show flexibility to bring the round to a successful conclusion by the end of the year. While both the US and the EC say that some progress was made on agriculture at the meeting, significant problems still remain and negotiators from both sides were instructed to continue their work in Geneva in the coming days.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the Community's agriculture offer provides for a 30 per cent reduction in overall support over ten years from 1986, based on an aggregate measurement of support together with subsidiary commitments on border measures and on export supports. The US and the Cairns Group have been seeking a 75 per cent cut in support and protection for agriculture over ten years with a 90 per cent cut in export subsidies. This shows the extent of the gap to be bridged between the two sides.  Obviously, the impact of further concessions by the Community would depend on the extent and type of concessions involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the negotiations proceed I will be insisting that the community's global approach which requires coherence between commitments is fully respected. This is fundamental to the maintenance of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I will also be seeking to ensure that credit is <Col N="1377" /> obtained for reform measures taken by the Community since the commencement of the Uruguay Round and that both the modalities and conditions including rebalancing attached to the Community's acceptance of tariffication are met.  Another major point for me is that the various compensatory mechanisms which may flow from Common Agricultural Policy reform are accommodated within the &ldquo;green box&rdquo; of support policies to be continued without discipline.</P>
    <P>I would also wish to advise the House that this issue will be discussed by Community Ministers in the Agriculture Council on 18/19 November when I will be emphasising the concerns to which I have adverted.</P>

    <P>I would refer the Deputies to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 242 of 16 October 1991 on the reasons for delay in making the 1990 scheme payments.</P>
    <P>As for the proposal to increase the suckler cow premium grant for 1991, I am anxious to see it approved quickly by the EC so the increased rate can be applied to all payments made under the 1991 schemes for non-suppliers of milk and for small-scale milk producers when they commence next month.  I am seeking approval, therefore, as a matter of urgency, as it will mean up to an extra £12 million to farmers in Ireland for 1991.</P>

      <P>In August 1990, the Government decision to restructure Siuicre Éireann stipulated that the company should give an undertaking to provide a free site and make a contribution to £2 million towards the establishment of a new industry in Tuam.  An agreement was reached subsequently, on foot of the Government decision, between the company and Tuam Community Group.</P>
      <P>In September 1990, the company finalised details with the IDA and a private developer regarding the construction of a 20,000 sq. ft. advance factory on 1.5 acres on the sugar factory lands in Tuam. In addition to the free site the company agreed to pay the cost of its development. The company undertook to guarantee the rent for the new factory for three year or until a tenant was found.  Furthermore, the company agreed to provide a second site, free of charge, on the same terms applying to the first advance factory.</P>
      <P>The company indicated that in consultation with the community group, they would consider further investment in Tuam within the context of the Government decision and in the light of progress achieved.</P>
      <P>I understand that because of difficulties relating to the provision of sewerage facilities to the site, the developer has withdrawn and the building of the advance factory has not taken place. However, the company &mdash; now Greencore plc &mdash; is fully committed to the £2 million contribution and to the completion of the advance factory projects on their site.  The matter of the provision of appropriate sewerage services is not under the company's direct control. Nevertheless, I am confident that all the interests involved will pursue this matter through to a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>The company as part of the £2 million contribution have agreed to contribute £250,000 to Action Tuam Limited towards the purchase and construction of an enterprise centre at the Weir Road, Tuam.  I understand that £150,000 of this has been paid already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 45, 46 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>To be reclassified from less to more severely handicapped status an area must be homogeneous, consist of poor land and have the characteristics of low farm incomes and heavy dependence on agriculture. The reason why the remaining areas of counties Cavan, Monaghan, Galway and Kerry were not reclassified was because the results of the 50 per cent random survey of farms in these areas carried out by my Department in 1989 indicated that they did not meet these requirements.</P>
      <P>The five criteria for the designation of disadvantaged areas in the first instance are laid down by the EC Commission and my Department have no discretion in the application of the criteria in regard to the admission of new areas to the less severely handicapped category.  It follows from this that existing areas must comply with more stringent criteria to be reclassified and in fact, two of the criteria were modified for national reclassification purposes to allow income areas heavily dependent on agriculture to be reclassified while maintaining a reasonable modulation between levels of handicap, which is a Community requirement.</P>
      <P>I must assure Deputy Connaughton that I am fully satisfied with the method by which the survey was carried out.  In the case of County Galway, all of the county was included in the proposals to Brussels and as a result of my Department's efforts, 95 per cent of Galway is now classified as more severely handicapped compared to 53 per cent of the county previously.</P>
      <P>However, under the appeal panel procedures relating to reclassification announced recently, excluded areas can appeal the assessment made before 6 December.  All excluded areas will be given the opportunity to have their case reviewed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Sugar Company had the considerable independence which was appropriate to a commerical State body.  This meant that day-to-day commercial decisions were a matter for the company, as was the practice under successive Governments.  My relationship with the company was subject to the limitations of the Sugar Manufacturers Acts 1933-82 and of their articles of association.  I am satisfied that I discharged fully my statutory obligations in respect of the company until they became a public limited company earier this year, after which I had no such obligations.</P>

      <P>A wide range of measures is currently in operation to promote growth and adaptation in agriculture.  Obviously, the price support arrangements operated under the Common Agricultural Policy provide opportunities for agricultural growth, although this is restricted in certain sectors by quantitative limits on production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there is a series of investment schemes, including the farm improvement programme and the scheme for the control of farmyard pollution. A scheme for installation aid for young farmers operates which provides a premium for farmers under 35 years of age at the time of their first installation <Col N="1393" /> in farming.  A scheme of grant aid for investments in alternative enterprises has been introduced under the operational programme for rural development.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the problems of low farm family income being experienced by some farming families in the west of Ireland, in common with some families outside the west of Ireland and outside the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the agricultural sector, very many measures are in operation which provide support and assistance to farmers in addition to social welfare provisions where applicable.  The EC funded market support measures enable the producer to benefit from returns considerably above those which the market alone would provide. In addition, subsidies under the disadvantaged areas programme and all the livestock schemes are of particular benefit to low incomes farmers in the disadvantaged areas, which have recently been extended.  The operational programme for rural development was recently launched to improve the living <Col N="1395" /> standards of those residing in rural areas. This is a multi-sectoral programme which will involve investment of £100 million up to and including 1993 in alternative enterprises, rural infrastructure, small and Community enterprises and agricultural and fisheries training.  In addition the EC's own initiative on rural development known as &ldquo;LEADER&rdquo; has been put into operation.  Under this, group projects will be funded to the extent of £34 million.  While those schemes are nationwide in operation it is clear that substantial benefit from them will accrue to the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Finally a package of measures aimed specifically at the west of Ireland &mdash; the western package &mdash; has been in operation, with the assistance of Community funds since 1980.  Many of the elements contained in it will be continued on a nationwide basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 58 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>The badger is a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976 and may only be removed under licence issued by the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works.  ERAD's attention is focused on the role of the badger in TB spread only after exhaustive investigations have eliminated other possible causes.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the director of ERAD that it is now generally accepted that wildlife, and in particular, the badger have a role in the transmission of bovine TB.  ERAD's wildlife research is at present concentrated on the badger and a national project is in place with the aim of quantifying the effect which badgers have on the bovine TB problem in Ireland.  However, it is important to stress that the effects of badger removal on bovine disease levels must be measured over a three to five year period. Interim results from a project conducted in east Offaly have shown a 23 per cent drop in bovine disease levels in the first two years after removal of infected badgers although it is too early to draw firm conclusions.</P>
      <P>In 1991 to date a total of 1,747 badgers have been removed under licence from the Wildlife Service of which approximately 10 per cent have been found to be infected with bovine TB.</P>

      <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food have analysed the <Col N="1399" /> impact of the Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals on Irish agriculture. A preliminary analysis published in July pointed towards an annual loss in aggregate farm income of £87 million if the current proposals were to be fully implemented.  This is a loss compared to the situation in 1990 excluding exceptional subsidy payments.  It is not a comparison with what the situation would be in future years if no policy adaptation took place.  Since July, further analysis has been conducted by the Department in association with the farm organisations. It is expected that the results of further analysis will soon be publicly available.  Commissioner MacSharry has not issued any detailed quantification of the effects of his Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals on Irish agriculture. I would expect that the final outcome of the negotiations would differ substantially from the current proposals.</P>

      <P>Specific figures for the period in question are not yet available. The latest period for which data is available on appeals for reclassification under the beef carcase classification scheme is 1 January to 30 April 1991, in respect of which I have already supplied information to the Deputy in a written reply on 5 June last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I understand from preliminary results to hand that the number of appeals for the period May to August 1991 should be in keeping with the rate of those lodged during the whole of last <Col N="1401" /> year and during the first four months of 1991.  The number of appeals as a percentage of total slaughterings during these periods were in the range 1.6 per cent to 1.8 per cent.  I also expect that successful appeals during the May to August period will be about 24 per cent of the total, which is also in keeping with last year's rate and that of the earlier part of this year.  This would represent a level of some 0.4 per cent of the total kill.</P>
    <P>Total slaughterings at beef export plants during the period in question were 405,772 head.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any serious or widespread problem relating to the inaccurate completion of application forms under the 1990 and 1991 suckler cow premium schemes.  If Deputy Creed has specific cases he wishes to bring to my attention, however, I will be pleased to have them examined.</P>
      <P>I know, however, that a large number of applications under the 1990 special beef premium scheme would have to be rejected but for the flexibile approach which the EC Commission adopted at my request for that year in the interpretation of the relevant regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These concessions were granted in recognition of the possibility of confusion <Col N="1402" /> among applicants in that year, the first in which 100 per cent on-farm inspections were not carried out.  The Commission was adamant, however, that the regulations had to be strictly adhered to by all applicants in 1991 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Despite warnings to this effect which issued to all applicants with the 1991 application forms, some seem to have repeated the mistakes of 1990.  It is too soon yet to say how widespread this problem is but I am having it kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>Meantime, I asked the EC some time ago to review the rules of this scheme and I am continuing to press them on the matter.  Unless, however, they respond positively to that request in time for any changes to affect the 1991 scheme, I will not be able to consider the flexible approach suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The INTERREG Programme is designed to assist the local populations of the internal border areas of the European <Col N="1403" /> Community to overcome the disadvantages arising from their relative isolation within national economies and within the EC as a whole.  It aims to stimulate local economic activity by providing financial assistance through various themes covering tourism, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, environmental protection as well as regional and human resource development.</P>
      <P>The INTERREG Programme was prepared jointly by the authorities in Northern Ireland and in Dublin and applies to the Six Northern Counties and to Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth on the southern side.</P>
      <P>The programme which runs to the end of 1993 provides for a total expenditure in Ireland in excess of £100 million with £58 million being provided through Interreg and the balance from national and local contributions.  The range of measures which will be eligible under the agricultural part of the programme covers projects involving improvement of animal, avian and plant health, anti-pollution measures, assisting community development and measures related to horticulture.  I expect the Commission to adopt the criteria for selection of individual projects in the near future and this will clear the way for consideration of applications for aid under the Interreg Programme.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the assistance which the INTERREG Programme will provide in the Border region will result in the creation of much needed enterprise which will augment farm incomes and the local economy generally.</P>

    <P>The Central Statistics Office has not carried out any separate examination of farmer numbers as part of their general projection of population to the year 2000.</P>
    <P>A decline in the numbers of farmers has been part of a worldwide trend in developed economies in recent decades. Ireland, like other countries, has experienced such a decline, which has occurred as a result of improved farming technology and greater efficiency in agriculture generally.  In recent years the decrease in this country has averaged between 1 per cent and 2 per cent per annum and it may be expected that this level of decline will continue.  The low proportion of farmers under the age of 25 years does not of itself suggest a serious future decline because very many of the young people engaged in agriculture are doing so in informal partnership with a parent and so do not appear in official statistics as farmers.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>the reason a sea fishing boat licence was not granted to a person (details supplied) in County Waterford despite the fact that an offer was made on 10 June 1988; if he will outline the steps which now need to be taken in this particular case to secure the said licence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my written reply to a question tabled by him on this matter on 2 July 1991.  As I stated on that occasion, one of the conditions of the licence offer made on 10 June 1988 was that it would lapse if the applicants had not purchased a vessel within three calendar months of the date of the letter containing the offer.  No application to <Col N="1410" /> extend this period was received nor is there any record of any further communication from the applicants until November 1989, by which time licensing policy generally had been revised.  A letter setting out the position was sent to the applicants on 6 June 1990.</P>
      <P>In view of the current European Community policy on fleet capacity, and the constraints imposed by that policy, sea fishing boat licences are only being considered in cases where applicants can demonstrate that they are in a position to remove 100 per cent replacement tonnage and horsepower from the current sea fishing boat register.</P>
      <P>A new application for a sea fishing boat licence in respect of a specific boat was made by the applicants in November 1989.  A further application, in respect of a different vessel, was made by one of the applicants in August 1991.  Neither of these applications, however, included proposals for replacement tonnage and horsepower.  Should the applicants now wish to proceed with either of the applications they should submit a replacement proposal in line with current policy as outlined above.</P>

      <P>The Development Education Support Centre was established in 1986 to provide support in the form of professional expertise to a range of organisations involved in the implementation of development education activities in Ireland.  It was also intended that it should act as a stimulus to encourage other groups to become interested in development education activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Development Education Support Centre is financed from the bilateral aid fund.  A review was conducted by my <Col N="1411" /> Department in 1988 of development education activities supported by this fund and the report's findings included a positive assessment of the work of the centre. On the basis of this review, it was decided to continue financial support for the centre.</P>
    <P>A further such review of development education activities is being carried out this month.  Decisions on future support for these activities, including the Development Education Support Centre, will be made when the review is completed.</P>

      <P>The role of the European Council in the formulation of broad economic policy guidelines for member states is part of the wider question of the respective roles of Community institutions which both Intergovernmental Conferences are currently discussing.  Whatever the outcome of these discussions, it is unlikely that the Treaty will specify the precise aspects of member states' economic policies which should be covered by guidelines: that issue is likely to be determined by Council on a pragmatic, learning-by-doing basis.  In view of this and having regard both to other provisions of the draft Treaty and to the principle of subsidiarity, I would feel that the guidelines should, at this stage, be addressed primarily to broad budgetary aggregates and to general policy issues of Communitywide relevance.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the person referred to by the Deputy submitted a number of incomplete late claims for repayment of VAT and excise duty on hydrocarbon oil used as fuel in a registered sea-fishing boat.  The claims covered several periods dating back to 1987.  The statutory provisions require that claims of this nature should be submitted not later than six months after the end of a three month <Col N="1414" /> period during which the oil was used. However, late claims are allowed where a satisfactory explanation is forthcoming and sufficient details are available to establish the accurancy of the claims.  The commissioners have been in touch with the applicant in regard to the completion of the claims and the provision of supporting information.  This process has only recently been completed and the repayment claims have been forwarded for processing.  The applicant has already been informed that one claim has been disallowed as the boat in question was not registered for the period covered by the claim as required by the statutory repayment provisions.</P>

      <P>Every effort is made to have payments under the farm investment aid scheme made at the earliest possible date.  Claims are, of course, processed strictly in order of receipt and, therefore, the period between receipt of a particular claim and its payment is affected by the overall volume of claims to be processed at the time in question and the position in regard to budgetary resources.  Having regard to the level of claims currently on hands, it is likely to be about two months before a payment of £2,490 can be made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>The welfare of animals kept for farming purposes, including pigs kept in intensive units, is covered by the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act, 1984.  The EC Council of Ministers recently adopted a new Directive laying down minimum standards for the protection of pigs kept in intensive farming systems.  The Directive provides, among other things, for a ban on the tethering of sows in new farming systems built or newly commissioned after 31 December 1994 and for the phasing out of the tethering of sows in all systems after 31 December 2004.  I propose to adhere to this time schedule.</P>
      <P>Intensive pig units do not constitute a health or pollution risk when properly operated.</P>

      <P>The animals concerned which represented a small number of the cattle in the feed lot referred to, had been treated with the synthetic hormonal <Col N="1417" /> substance trenbolone acetate.  This substance was marketed as an anabolic steroid under the brand name Finaplix prior to the introduction of the ban on hormonal growth promoters.  It is not related to clenbuterol or to other beta-agonists.</P>
      <P>Cattle in which the use of hormonal growth promoters was confirmed were surrendered to authorised officers who destroyed the animals and buried the carcases.</P>
      <P>A prosecution in respect of 12 individual offences was taken at Carlow District Court on 1 June 1988.  The defendant pleaded guilty and was fined a total of £300, £25 on each offence.</P>
      <P>The offence took place prior to the introduction of the European Communities (Control of Oestrogenic, Androgenic, Gestagenic and Thyrostatic Substances) Regulations, 1988.  Many of the extensive powers and penalties available under this legislation were not applicable in 1987.  At the time of the offence the maximum penalty available was £100 fine and-or six months imprisonment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In December 1990 the European Community authorised a food aid package to the Soviet Union.  There <Col N="1423" /> were two elements to this: a food aid programme valued at 250 million ECU and a credit guarantee facility to the value of 500 million ECU.</P>
      <P>The food aid programme commenced in June-July of this year with the EC Commission inviting tenders for the manufacture and supply of specified products to the Soviet Union.  Where possible, products stored in intervention were supplied.  The commodities being provided are as follows: whole milk powder 49,000 tonnes, canned beef 14,800 tonnes, baby food 7,300 tonnes, pasta 2,500 tonnes, beef carcases 8,000 tonnes, canned pork 5,200 tonnes and tomato concentrate 3,000 tonnes.</P>
      <P>Under the food aid programme Irish companies were successful in their tenders to supply 3,000 tonnes of whole milk powder and some 3,000 tonnes of beef for cannning.  This food aid is being given to hospitals and institutions in designated cities in the Soviet Union.  The EC Commission informed member states recently that deliveries of these products were almost complete.</P>
      <P>With regard to the credit facility, the EC is organising loans of 500 million ECU to the Soviet Union through a group of international banks for the purchase of foodstuffs.  A portion of the credit facility will be used to purchase foodstuffs in the Soviet Union's former trading partners in Eastern Europe, but the major part will cover the supply of products from within the Community.</P>
      <P>The products to be supplied under the credit facility include the following: cereals 2,550,000 tonnes, beef 200,000 tonnes, vegetable oil 150,000 tonnes, whole milk powder 25,000 tonnes, rice 17,000 tonnes and soya products 10,000 tonnes.  It is expected that supplies of these foodstuffs will commence as soon as some technical problems relating to the financial aspects have been overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Soviet Union is seeking further assistance from the international community in relation to food supplies and the EC is at present finalising arrangements for the provision of an additional <Col N="1424" /> credit line of 1.25 billion ECU to the USSR to cover both food products and medical supplies.</P>

      <P>I have received representations from a number of local authorities, including Mayo County Council, about various difficulties with the higher education grants scheme.</P>

    <P>As I have recently stated in answer to other related questions, the Government in their recently published programme are committed to bringing forward proposals for the reform of the third level grants scheme and for amending the scheme in a number of areas.  The programme also includes a commitment to ensure complete equity and transparency <Col N="1432" /> in its operations, taking into account the question of criteria for the inclusion of wealth/assets in determining income/ eligibility for all State supported schemes where means is a condition of eligibility. The matter is being examined at present by my Department.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee report referred to by the Deputy related specifically to the higher education grants scheme and has, of course, been overtaken by the more wide-ranging commitment in the recently agreed Programme for Government.</P>
