      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>whether he specifically raised the question of increased EC Structural Funds being made available for the financing of the proposed Dublin light rail public transport system with President Jacques Delors at his meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, 19 November 1991; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As I indicated in my speech to the House last week, I focused in this meeting on the major issues likely to arise at next week's EC Summit in Maastricht, including the broad basis of the operation of the Structural Funds, rather than on any of the countless projects which are or might be eligible for aid from those funds.  The Deputy will, of course, be aware that the whole question of a light rail system is within the remit of a working group which have yet to report to the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for having agreed to take this question.  I hope the precedent has been well noted <Col N="1762" /> in quarters where it matters.  In respect of his discussion on the broad basis of the application of the Structural Funds, would the Taoiseach say whether the question of changing the ratio of support for such public transport infrastructural type facilities was discussed in general rather than its specific application to the Dubin light rail project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the question of flexibility in the use of the funds and in the intervention rates was discussed in a general way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the deliberations of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and other groups examining this matter, may I take it that, as a result of the Taoiseach's discussion with President Delors, an application for assistance by way of Structural Funds' financing to Brussels will meet a different response in terms of the percentage ratio of support than might prevail currently?  Would the Taoiseach be optimistic about such an application receiving a higher rate of intervention than currently anticipated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to identify any one particular project as being likely to get more or less.  The emphasis in my discussion with President Delors &mdash; and I should say he was very sympathetic &mdash; was to the effect that we need greater flexibility of scope in the use of the funds, in other words, the sorts of projects that can be covered and, second, that we would press very hard for flexibility in what they call the intervention rates, namely, the percentage which the Community will contribute.  I would be optimistic that, in the new tranche of Structural Funds &mdash; this would not apply to the existing funds &mdash; from 1993 onwards there will be greater flexibility under both those headings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Taoiseach, as a Dubliner, will be making a passionate plea &mdash; for the reasons of this intervention anyway, I am making that <Col N="1763" /> presumption &mdash; for consideration to any application that might be made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply on 12 March last to a previous question from Deputy Quinn, I said that the <i>Europen</i> campaign was concentrated in 1988 and 1989, with some run-over into 1990, and, as had always been intended, the Government's continuing activities designed to promote preparation for the completion of the Single European Market were being carried out by the Government Departments and State agencies appropriate in each case.  I suggested that if the Deputy had a specific query in regard to any area, he might table a question to the appropriate Minister.</P>
      <P>A market survey in May-June, 1989, confirmed that the <i>Europen</i> campaign had been successful in raising awareness of the Single Market programme and had led to a very significant increase in awareness on the part of Irish business.  It is not proposed to initiate a new centrally co-ordinated campaign on this particular subject in 1992.  Departments and agencies concerned will continue to take initiatives as necessary, as exemplified by the FÁS initiative on training and retraining for the Single Market and the <i>Countdown 92</i> initiative undertaken by the Minister of State for Trade and Marketing in the first half of this year, in addition, of course, to the many continuing programmes of departments and State agencies, especially those reporting to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The Government, of course, will be publishing a White Paper on the results of the Intergovernmental Conferences on political union and economic and monetary union, in advance of a referendum. The referendum campaign will no doubt reinforce consciousness of the Single Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1765" /> It is difficult to give any comprehensively valid assessment of preparedness but the overall economic results, especially in regard to exports, of the past two to three years, suggest that the general state of preparation is satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that Irish business does not appear to be sufficiently alert to the opportunities and indeed dangers of the Single Market after 1993, the fact that at that stage they would be exposed to dangers on the home market they have had to themselves to date?  There is no indication, particularly from the unemployment figures, that Irish business is being geared to take advantage of 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a very keen awareness on a widespread basis of the advent of the Single Market.  The best single proof of that is the performance of our exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been performing well for seven or eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The performance is improving all the time.  It improved again last month.  Figures available to me today, which will be published shortly, will prove that we have performed very well again this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been the case for seven or eight years and it is not due to <i>Europen.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very superficial remark by Deputy Barry.  The year 1990 was a very difficult one in international trading.  There was a recession in the UK and in the United States and a general falling off in world trade.  In spite of that, our export performance was excellent through 1991.  That is a very good indication that our firms are aware of the prospects in the export market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that if one looks behind the gross <Col N="1766" /> figures for our admirable export performance, one finds that the companies performing most effectively are subsidiaries of multinationals?  Our concern and, I suspect, the concern of Deputy Barry, is for the performance of the indigenously-owned sector which does not have the network of information which the multinationals have.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that middle management and workforces in small and medium sized enterprises are getting the level of informatiom necessary to enable them to perform at the end of next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fairly wide-ranging question.  I would emphasise that every business firm should be well aware of the advent of the Single Market and the opportunities offered, as well as the dangers.  I believe there is a widespread acknowledgment of that fact.  I also agree with Deputy Quinn that the big multinationals operating here are doing better than indigenous industry.  A great deal of effort is being concentrated on indigenous industries in an endeavour to get them up to speed in preparing for the potential markets that will open up after 1992.  Managements and workforces who do not alert themselves and do not prepare will suffer the consequences.  It is very important that even this exchange of views across the House be fully reported and brought to the attention of everybody concerned.  We should emphasise the importance of making every possible preparation for the advent of the Single Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I dislike the word &ldquo;indigenous&rdquo; and the term &ldquo;SMEs&rdquo;.  Will the Taoiseach accept that the prime difficulty facing small and medium sized businesses which are Irish owned or located fully here is their lack of marketing ability? Will he arrange with Bord Tráchtála to second for one year to small and medium sized businesses graduates from the marketing schools, most of whom now emigrate, and arrange that this scheme be funded by the Government?  That will be a signal of the Government's interest and <Col N="1767" /> it will have beneficial effects on both exports and employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with that.  Those sorts of plans and initiatives are being taken.  There are Structural Funds available for marketing initiatives. The key factor is competitiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Fortunately Irish industry is in a very satisfactory position at present in regard to competitiveness. Industrialists will admit that this is of vital importance and they urge the Government to maintain that competitiveness in so far as possible.  I attribute a great deal of our success in maintaining a competitive edge to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  I again emphasise to all the social partners the need to continue with those programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will no doubt be aware of the reports of the Committee on Industrial Organisation which his late father-in-law initiated. Unfortunately many of the recommendations of those reports were ignored by smaller companies and the Government of the day, of which I think Deputy Haughey was a member, did not see fit to reinforce the message conveyed by those analyses.  Since the Taoiseach's Department have taken on themselves responsibility for the <i>Europen</i> campaign, will they run a new survey based on 1991 as to the level of awareness among small indigenous companies?  Will they follow up the consequences and results of that survey?  Will the Taoiseach initiate a new programme to target those people who are not prepareed to face the realities of 1992?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to consider the question of a survey on its merits.  We will do that.  We meet representatives of industry on an on-going basis and they are very much aware of <Col N="1768" /> our views.  It is also a fact that representatives of industry with whom we are in touch have a constant campaign going to alert their members to the situation which is coming closer every day. If it is the view that a further survey with follow-up action would be beneficial, that can be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit that I am about to engage in a commercial.  I agree that competitiveness is vital for the survival of our industry.  Two areas in which we are sadly uncompetitive are energy and transport.  I recommend that the Taoiseach study a report adopted by the British-Irish interparliamentary body this morning, produced under the chairmanship of Mr. Stuart Bell, MP, who is with us now.  It is a very valuable contribution to increasing our competitiveness in the transport sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very definite commercial.  Yes, of course I will study that report.</P>

      <P>In so far as my Department are concerned, work is at an advanced stage on the preparation of legislation to amend the National Monuments Acts.  These changes arise from the Supreme Court judgment in the Derrynaflan case.  In addition, I am considering proposals for the establishment of the National Heritage Council on a statutory basis.  The council, whose responsibilities relate to the physical heritage &mdash; archaeology, architecture, flora, fauna, heritage gardens and certain inland waterways &mdash; have been operating on a non-statutory basis since 1988.

Many Departments, of course, have sections responsible, under their Ministers, for the co-ordination of their EC work.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  Does he accept that my question is a manifestation of the increasing democratic deficit between laws which are formulated in secret in Brussels and are introduced here unannounced through regulation or sometimes through legislation in this House?  If one were to ask elected Members who are accountable to the citizens of this Republic, what Directives are in draft form or final <Col N="1772" /> draft form in any area of competence the Community now possess they would not be able to say.  The proposed schedule of legislation is circulated but there is no where in his House one can find a schedule of draft directives which will affect the lives of Irish citizens.  Is it not time we had in every Department a person with exclusive and unique responsibility, among whatever other task they may have, to be able to quote to any citizen what laws are proposed and how they are progressing.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a further point because I think the Taoiseach needs to be made aware of this.  When elected Members of this House contact a Department they are informed that Mr. X or Miss Y is handling the matter but when they subsequently contact that person they are informed, for example the Department of Justice, that on the instructions of the Minister of the day no official is allowed to deal with a mere Member of the Oireachtas and that all inquiries have to be rechannelled through the Minister's office.  The Minister's office does not know what is going on in Brussels.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers rightly like to afford special consideration and courtesy to Deputies' queries.  The practice varies from Department to Department.  For <Col N="1774" /> example, it would be impossible in the Department of Agriculture and Food to channel all queries through the Ministert's office because of the far flung nature of that Department.  In so far as EC Directives are concerned, I see no reason why information officers should not be able to reply immediately to queries about directive and draft directives or, alternatively, undertake to have the information made available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that, apart from monitoring progress of relevant draft Directives here, there is also some merit in monitoring whether or not other member countries are complying with the draft Directives? For example, the Taoiseach will be aware that in January of this year the EC draft Directive in relation to the mutual recognition of proficient qualifications was signed by this country and has not been signed by a number of other countries and that this is of vital importance to graduates in this country.</P>

    <P>The first preliminary report was published on 21 June 1991 &mdash; two months after Census day.  This gave the population broken down by county and sex.

    <P>The third and final preliminary report which was issued on Friday, 22 November 1991, contained a breakdown of the population by broad age group and sex at county, urban and rural district level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 86, 240 and 258 together.</P>
      <P>I am committed to a policy of maintaining a safe and healthy working environment for my staff, as required under the Act.  To this end, my Department have, in consultation with staff, prepared a written statement specifying the manner in which safety, health and welfare will be secured.  The statement sets out my Department's general policy on safety, health and welfare and specifies the organisational arrangements for carrying out that policy.  Provision has been made in the statement for on-going consultation with staff on matters related to safety and health.  The main forum for such consultation will be a joint safety committee which is in course of being established.  Consultation will also take place at each work location with safety representatives who have been appointed by staff.</P>
      <P>The management authorities of schools, colleges and education agencies are the employers of their staffs and as such responsibility for implementation of the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, rests primarily with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to increase awareness of the provisions of the Act, 1989, and in order to standardise safety statements as far as possible, my Department propose to <Col N="1778" /> issue a circular to school authorities to assist them in preparing such statements.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority has produced guidelines on safety statements. These guidelines are designed as an aid to employers and the self-employed in drawing up a safety statement and a copy of the guidelines will be sent to all schools.</P>
    <P>Additional information is also available on request from the Health and Safety Authority &mdash; Headquarters &mdash; Davitt House, Mespil Road, Dublin 4 or any of its regional offices.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Irish Vocational Education Association has consulted with insurers and legal advisers in relation to the 1989 Act and has organised seminars and briefing sessions for the chief executive officers and clerical/administrative staff of vocational education committees in relation to the matter.</P>
    <P>The three teacher unions are making joint arrangements following discussions with my Department for the training of safety representatives.  This involves, initially, training a number of tutors (teachers) who in turn will train a number of other teachers to act as safety representatives in schools.  Fifteen teachers have already been trained as tutors and my Department have agreed to allow paid substitution for the days on which the tutors are engaged in training.</P>
    <P>On 20 September 1991, the Department of Education, in co-operation with the National Industrial Safety Organisation (NISO) and through sponsorship from the Church and General Insurance plc., issued a video on safety in school science laboratories, to all second level schools and third level colleges.</P>
    <P>In so far as the university sector is concerned, the Higher Education Authority met the college buildings and safety personnel in order to assess progress on the implementation of the provisions in the Act and the authority is satisfied that the colleges have been actively implementing the legislation.  The authority will continue to monitor the situation and keep my Department informed of progress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1779" /> The replacement or upgrading of sub-standard buildings is being addressed at all levels through an extensive building programme which is proceeding within the limits of the available resources.</P>
    <P>Safety has always been a crucial consideration in the design, construction, improvement and fitting out of educational facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to welcome the Minister to his first Question Time.  Would he agree that many of our primary and secondary schools are clearly sub-standard and are in breach of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989?  May I ask him who pays to have the corrective process put in place &mdash; is it the Department of Education or the board of management? Obviously, the Minister will agree that many hazards will have to be removed in these schools in order to render them safe.  I am sure the Minister would agree that boards of management connot afford to put the corrective processes in place. Therefore, who will pay &mdash; the Department of Education or the board of management?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the first statement that many of the schools are in such a bad condition.  However, payment will be a matter to be discussed with the Department through the extensive building programme which is going ahead.  It will be a matter for the local management committee to point out where there are dangers.  There are many dangers in schools that have nothing to do with buildings &mdash; play areas, swings and so on.  The standard of school buildings is by and large very much up to the mark.  I hope that the school safety committee would be able to point out the dangers and, perhaps, take corrective measures where no money is required for those improvements.  If moneys are required for those improvements the matter should then be referred to the Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 278 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have undertaken unit cost studies of recurrent costs in primary and post-primary schools.  The studies are <Col N="1782" /> being conducted in conjunction with consultants and analysis of the data concerning expenditures by schools at each level is still ongoing.  Information arising from the study will be made available in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that under &ldquo;Education&rdquo; at paragraph 69 (h) of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> there is a clear commitment to the production of this unit cost study, that was in January of this year and 11 months down the road a relatively simple exercise, which has already been done by the National Parents' Council, has not been produced? Will the Minister give a definite explicit date by which this will be produced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know when it will be completed but I am urging that it be completed as soon as possible because it will obviously have an effect.  We will go back to talk to the Department of Finance about this matter to see where cost-effectiveness can be implemented to benefit everyone, including pupils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware from the National Parents' Council survey that it has been proved that an increasing amount of essential expenditure in schools is now being underpinned by bingo, barbeques, raffles and so on and that parents dread sending their children back to school in September because it means they have to dig deeper into their pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that people do not enjoy getting involved in their local schools.  When resources are scarce parents make a tremendous effort.  Apart from that, schools have expanded their programmes.  There are many bus tours and continental tours run by schools nowadays. The efforts made by parents give them a sense of involvement with the local school and, in any event, most of these people are already involved in parish activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11,17 and 18 together.  I would refer the Deputies to the statement I made on the Seanad Adjournment on 21 <Col N="1785" /> November which covered most of the matters raised in these questions.</P>
      <P>In relation to the valuation of £3.8 million received from the Valuation Office in August 1989, the Department's understanding was that the Valuation Office determined the valuation from a commercial point of view, i.e. market value, and not on the basis of its value for appropriate use as an educational institution, and that the valuation for the property was equivalent to its land value. While professional reports are confidential I can indicate to the House that the report of the Valuation Office was in the form of a short letter which expressed the opinion that the market value of the property at that time, August 1989, was in the region of £3.8 million.</P>
      <P>My Department have clarified that the valuation related to the position at a particular time and that, in addition, in arriving at what was a low valuation the valuers took account of specific conditions which imposed restrictions on the use of the property.  For example, the sisters would be occupying part of the building for two years, which would limit development in that period, and despite this a purchaser would have to undertake over that period at a cost of the order of up to £2 million maintenance and security.</P>
      <P>The valuation did not include a sports complex and related land which was part of the property.  A separate five acres of land was included as playing fields; this area is zoned for housing and would have a substantial saleable value in its own right.  The valuation was somewhat lower than the value which would have been arrived at if calculated simply on the basis of a cost per acre for the overall site area. The valuation would clearly have been much higher if the restrictive conditions had not been a factor, which was the position when the property was being acquired by UCD.  In addition, the Valuation Office have confirmed that a valuation carried out in August 1989, would have little relevance at the time of acquisition almost one and a half years later, when completely different market conditions would apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1786" /> I would emphasise that ultimately an agreed price would be determined on the basis of negotiations rather than a valuation arrived at separate from such negotiations when, of necessity, any valuation would have a subjective element. In this regard an alternative valuation provided for the Mercy Order by a reputable firm of valuers fully supported their offer for sale to my Department of the buildings and 15 acres of land for £8.5 million.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances the valuation of £3.8 million provided by the Valuation Office would have served as a basis for an opening offer should it have proved possible to enter into meaningful negotiations for its purchase at that time.  This was not possible then as the price was stated to be not negotiable and the time allowed for consideration of the offer was unrealistic.</P>
    <P>Solicitors for the vendors subsequently stated, on 2 October 1989, that they were open to an offer but one which they confirmed would have to be firm, and realistic, in the context of the vendors' asking price of £8.5 million for the buildings and 15 acres or £10 million for the buildings and 20 acres, and be received before 5 October 1989, i.e. within three days, which was the date on which tenders were due for the entire property. This option could not be taken up because of the time scale and because an appropriate use had not been found for the property.</P>
    <P>A greatly reduced offer of £8.25 million for the buildings and 20 acres, received in February 1990 was similarly not taken up on the grounds that an appropriate educational use for the buildings had still not been determined.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that at no time was an offer of sale made to the Department at a price less than the eventual purchase price of £8 million negotiated by UCD.</P>
    <P>Suggestions were made that the Department should purchase Carysfort on the basis of negotiation.  This suggestion was not feasible since the Department do not operate third-level colleges. A further consideration was that unless a definite use for the premises had been <Col N="1787" /> established before its acquisition, substantial maintenance, insurance and security costs would have arisen.  The suitability of the premises for use as a regional technical college was considered. A detailed study carried out by technical officers of the Department made it clear that it was not suitable for this purpose.  Its use for the business graduate school was not in question at that time in view of the plans to develop it at Roebuck.</P>
    <P>As the President of UCD noted in his recent statement, the situation changed in 1990 when financial problems arose regarding the development of the business school on the Roebuck site.  The possibility thus presented itself for the first time that the Government's policy on expanding third level places and UCD development plans for its business school could not coincide.</P>
    <P>The proposal by UCD to develop their graduate business school at Carysfort presented an ideal use for the property. The range of facilities available in Carysfort, residential accommodation, language laboratories, lecture theatres, sports facilities, etc., make it ideally suited as a business school.</P>

      <P>We had that discussion before in regard to mentioning people in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1788" /> I would remind the House that the question of making the facilities at Carysfort available to UCD was in question since 1987 when a committee chaired by the then Chairman of the Higher Education Authority recommended accordingly.</P>
    <P>The college has the authority, under its charter, to buy and sell land.  The State has never had any reason to believe but that the authorities of all the universities have acted with the utmost integrity and professionalism in these matters.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by the UCD authorities that it was only after intensive negotiations, using all necessary technical and commercial expertise available to them, that the final price of £8 million was agreed.  The UCD authorities are happy that the acquisition has provided them with the finest campus in Europe for its purpose and that it represents excellent value for money.  I fully concur with the view, which is fully supported by expert technical evaluation carried out by the staff of my own Department.</P>
    <P>All proper procedures were followed in relation to the purchase of Carysfort. The payment of a grant to a university, for the acquisition of a property, through the Higher Education Authority, is determined on the basis of the property being required for the educational purposes of the university, that due process of negotiations were followed and that the acquisition represented value for money.  My Department satisfied themselves that all these conditions were met in accordance with normal procedures, which do not include the seeking of an independent valuation outside of any evaluation carried out by technical staff of my Department.  I am fully satisfied that the negotiating team acted professionally and responsibly in concluding negotiations and arriving at an agreed price.  To suggest otherwise would be to impugn the integrity of the high calibre people involved.</P>
    <P>Authority from the Department of Finance and Government were secured as was Dáil approval for the necessary Supplementary Estimate and payment was <Col N="1789" /> made in the normal way through the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of Carysfort is a major addition to the third level education sector providing an ideal facility for a major business school and freeing up not fewer than 600 undergraduate places in Belfield, in line with Government policy to expand the availability of third level places.</P>
    <P>The accounting officer of my Department has replied to the query from the Comptroller and Auditor General referred to in the question and the reply is similar to the statement I made in the Seanad on 21 November, to which I have already referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply of six pages is a prime example of using the art of tautology to take up as much time as possible; it is a filibuster.</P>
      <P>Initially I should have welcomed the Minister to his first session at Question Time.  Let me also say he would be very foolish to allow himself to be used as a smokescreen in this hottest of political potatoes which goes right to the Taoiseach's own front door.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree it is very strange that, one month after the Valuation Office valued the 20 acres of land and the college at £3.8 million &mdash; and the Comptroller and Auditor General was quite clear and specific about this &mdash; the Mercy Sisters through their solicitors informed the Department of Education that the price was negotiable, that they were open to offers, that a reasonable bid should be made and they would bring the price down accordingly, and that the Department of Education decided not even to reply to that correspondence, let alone enter negotiations?</P>

      <P>Research in this area is carried out by my Department on the basis of on-going monitoring and assessment of the provision for modern languages in the post-primary school system.  It is the policy of my Department to encourage as many children as possible to take at least one European language in addition to Irish and English, from the beginning of their post-primary education, that is from age 12.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Primary Curriculum Review Body considered the question of the introduction of a modern continental language in the senior classes of primary school but recommended against it.</P>
      <P>The arguments relating to time and curriculum overload, as well as the demands of the two languages on the present curriculum, were cited as influencing this decision.</P>
      <P>My Department, through the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, are undertaking a full examination of the recommendations of the Primary Curriculum Review Body.</P>
      <P>As European languages do not form part of the prescribed curriculum for primary schools the number of national schools which are supplying tuition in such languages is not available to my Department.</P>

      <P>The number of schools in the post primary sector which provide modern languages has increased by 63 per cent in the past ten years.  This is a welcome increase.  However, the review body decided against the introduction of modern languages in primary schools.  I can understand their reasons for doing so.  Given that they concentrate on solid educational matters, disadvantaged schools do not need or require them whereas some more well off schools would introduce them.  At some date in the future languages should be introduced somewhere along the line.  This is being done in some schools.</P>

      <P>In relation to the substance of Question No. 13, do I take it that the Minister is telling us that the findings of the Primary Curriculum Review Body are <i>ex cathedra</i>?  Is it the view of the Department that the most beneficial age for the introduction of a European language is the age at which children enter secondary school?  Is the Minister not aware that the language aptitude of a person &mdash; there is such a thing as a language aptitude &mdash; goes into decline after age five?  Children, at a young age, can easily absorb three languages. I do not think the Department have dealt with this question in depth, with respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy; some pupils have communication problems.  People will have to be trained to teach languages.  The Deputy has said that children as young as five can easily absorb languages but in many instances the results obtained in <Col N="1793" /> Irish and English up to the age of 12 have not been great, particularly among the disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept the contention that it is desirable that the greatest possible number of school children should be able to speak at least one other European language when they leave the system?  What practical steps has he taken to achieve that objective, including the introduction of a European language at the earliest possible date, as my colleague, Deputy O'Shea, has said, consistent with their ability to absorb such a language?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that we have been at a disadvantage given that children in other European countries can speak two or three languages at home.  I can see that it would be desirable but we are talking here about a tremendous spread of primary schools and of a requirement that teachers have French, German, Spanish or Italian.  This is being done in some schools, although I do not have the statistics.  We will probably look, at some date in the future, at such a plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 70 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" /> The Primary Curriculum Review Body did not make any specific recommendations in regard to the establishment of working parties.  In line with their remit, the review body gave particular attention to Irish, English and mathematics and to the issues of assessing pupil progress and evaluating the system overall.  The review body also examined and made recommendations relating to a number of other curriculum issues, including health education.</P>
    <P>While the review body noted that health education is of sufficient importance to warrant inclusion on the primary school curriculum, it was acknowledged that the constraints on time are such that the addition of another subject would introduce an element of overload that would not be helpful and can only lessen the instruction time available for existing subjects.  Accordingly, the review body recommended that health education should be treated as a cross curricular theme in primary schools.</P>
    <P>In addition the review body recommended an examination of issues relating to sexuality education and the implications for the primary curriculum.</P>
    <P>The task of developing a strategy for curriculum reform in the primary sector has been assigned to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  The council's remit includes reviewing and advising the Minister for Education on the curriculum for primary schools with particular reference to curriculum development arising from the recommendations of the Primary Curriculum Review Body.  Health education is one of the areas the NCCA will be examining.</P>
    <P>My Department have facilitated the development of health education programmes for pupils through the secondment of two primary teachers to two health boards.  Furthermore, my Department are in consultation with all health boards with a view to co-ordinating existing programme material on health education for pupils for transmission to the NCCA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's view in regard to the need for the <Col N="1798" /> inclusion of health education at primary level?  Will he agree that such health education should include issues relating to sex education, particularly in view of the recent statistics of teenage pregnancies, as some of the girls were barely out of primary school?  Will the Minister agree that this is a matter of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>My initial reaction is that I should hate to see the innocence of children taken away by bringing heavy matters to bear on them.  However, I am shocked at the abuse and degradation of very young children.  It is a matter which must be dealt with very carefully and we are asking the body to look at it because it is a very sensitive subject in some schools. Unfortunately, parents &mdash; to whom the body should be able to turn &mdash; are abusing children in some cases.  Teachers are aware of the problem and are watching for signs of abuse while not necessarily including it in education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that his views are in direct conflict with those of his predecessor?  She agreed that health education, particularly sex education, should be included in the primary curriculum.  Does the Minister disagree with her view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not disagree. However, the recommendation came from the NCCA and they are using the cross curriculum issue in the schools to try to bring it in generally.  However, I do not see much point in explaining sex activity to very young children in primary schools unless there is a danger of abuse to such children.  In cases of that kind, they would have to be made aware of the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is a danger. Everyone has been horrified by details of recent court cases; we will look at the matter and see how children can be made <Col N="1799" /> more aware of the problem without being too explicit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As there is proven evidence from the daily newspapers and from the statistics from Childline that, last year, 29,000 calls were received from children seeking help, will the Minister agree that there is a crisis which needs to be addressed?  Apart from this there is a need (a) to train teachers to deal with the problem and (b) to teach children themselves as to what inter-personal contacts are normal and healthy and what are not, so that they will be in a position to communicate their fears to teachers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the frightening figures and I am sure all Members are shocked by the growing number of these abuses.  I am quite prepared to look at the matter in view of what the Deputy said in relation to educating teachers to watch for signs of abuse at an early stage in a child's life.  We must try to improve the system so that if we cannot prevent child abuse we can at least rescue him or her immediately such signs are noticed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at the failure of Cork Corporation to adopt their estimate of expenses and to strike a rate for 1992.  Where a local authority fail to adopt an estimate the ultimate sanction provided by law would involve the removal of the councillors from office and their replacement by a commissioner who would discharge the functions of the <Col N="1800" /> elected councillors.  I would very much regret having to resort to any action of this kind and being forced to remove from office public representatives elected by the people of Cork as recently as last June.  I would not like to see them in a position where they would have to be removed from office.</P>
      <P>My overriding concern as Minister must be the provision and maintenance of essential local authority services for the people of Cork city and the protection of related employment.  It is imperative, therefore, that the statutory estimates process, which underpins the provision of these services, is satisfactorily completed. This is one of the fundamental responsibilities of local authority elected members but, if they refuse or fail to discharge their responsibility, it then becomes my duty to make other arrangements in the interests of the whole community.</P>
      <P>My Department received a report this morning from the Cork city manager outlining the factual circumstances of the failure of the corporation to fulfil their statutory duty to adopt an estimate and to determine a rate for 1992.  I have not received a request from the corporation that they be afforded another opportunity to consider and adopt the estimate for 1992.  I am considering all aspects of the situation and I will make a decision on the matter in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will recap briefly on the main points of my speech last Wednesday.  I described the Roads Bill as the most comprehensive and far reaching legislation on roads to have been brought before the Oireachtas since the foundation of the State.  The Bill has two main objectives, first to establish the National Roads Authority on a statutory basis and to update, strengthen and modernise the law relating to public roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III of the Bill establishes the National Roads Authority, who will have overall responsibility for planning and supervising the vital task of construction, improving and maintaining the national roads network.  It will be the duty of the Authority to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads and they will have also important specific functions.  The Authority will prepare medium-term plans for the development of national roads and will make provision for the preparation of road designs, maintenance programmes and schemes for the provision of traffic signs on national roads.  They will secure the carrying out of construction, improvement and maintenance works on national roads.  They will allocate grants for works on national roads.  The Authority will have power to issue directions <Col N="1956" /> to road authorities and will also be able to carry out the function where the road authority fail or refuse to comply with that direction.  They will promote the case for EC assistance and the provision of private funding for national roads.</P>
    <P>The Bill also brings together the main legislative provisions governing the administration of public roads thereby providing in one enactment a modern legislative framework for the National Roads Authority and local authorities. Among the main changes in road administration are the following: the classification of public roads will be simplified into three categories, national, regional and local.  There will be a clear definition of which authority will be responsible for each category.  The power to abandon public roads and extinguish public rights-of-way is being devolved to local authorities. The concept of a protected road is being introduced as a halfway house between a motorway and an ordinary road.  Local authorities will be able to provide motorway service areas and cycle-ways. Local authorities have been given improved powers to deal with dangerous roadside trees and structures, temporary dwellings and unlawful roadside trading.</P>
    <P>When I finished speaking last week I had given a brief outline of the content of sections 1 to 19 of the Bill.  I propose, therefore, to now continue, starting with an outline of section 20.</P>
    <P>Section 20 will enable the National Roads Authority to give directions to road authorities to carry out certain statutory procedures, such as the making of compulsory purchase orders and motorways schemes, or to carry out works. Before issuing a direction which would require a road authority to materially contravene a development plan or a special amenity area order, the National Roads Authority will have to give notice to the general public and the relevant road and planning authorities and consider any objections or representations received.  This procedure mirrors that for a material contravention of a local authority development plan.  Under section 20 (5) the National Roads Authority will have a reserve power to carry out the <Col N="1957" /> functions specified in the direction when the road authority refuse or fail to comply with it.  The Minister will have a reserve power to make regulations requiring the Authority to obtain his approval in specified classes of cases before it exercises these reserve powers.</P>
    <P>Section 21 defines the role of the National Roads Authority in relation to EC assistance for national roads.  The National Roads Authority will prepare documentation required to make applications for EC financial aid &mdash; both grants and loans &mdash; and will participate in the promotion of the case for EC assistance. As Deputies are aware, the operations of the EC Structural Funds in Ireland are now largely governed by the Community Support Framework concluded by the Government and the EC Commission in October 1989.  Like all other agencies whose activities are supported by the Structural Funds the National Roads Authority will have to operate within the framework of this and any future Community Support Framework.  In practice, the National Roads Authority will be responsible for preparing the national road elements of future operational programmes covering roads and other transport and will take part in the negotiation of those programmes with the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>Section 22 enables the Authority to make recommendations on the content of local authority development plans and obliges the Authority to have regard to the effects of building a new road or improving an existing road on the proper planning and development of the local area in which the road is, or is to be, located.  The National Roads Authority will have to consider the environmental effects of any works and have regard to the local development plan and any approved special amenity area order.</P>
    <P>Section 23 gives the National Roads Authority an input into the traffic management functions of the Garda Commissioner and the Minister in addition to their own specific functions under sections 19 and 20.</P>
    <P>Section 24 gives the Minister power to pay grants to the Authority.  Section 25 <Col N="1958" /> allows the National Roads Authority to borrow up to £500 million with the sanction of the Minister and Minister for Finance. Section 26 empowers the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowing, while section 27 is a standard provision enabling payments to be made from the Central Fund on foot of a guarantee. I should stress that these are enabling powers only.  The National Roads Authority, in the first instance, will have to carry out an assessment of the scope for private investment in the national road network and in doing that they will have to take account of the availability of EC grant assistance and the limited scope for generating a roads cash flow, through tolls, to remunerate any private investment.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides for the appointment of the Authority, comprising a chairman and between nine and 13 ordinary members.  Section 29 provides for the appointment of a chief executive, though the Minister will have the power under section 28 to assign the chief executive's functions to the chairman.  Section 30 enables the Authority to employ their own staff, while section 31 empowers public authorities &mdash; that is, Government Ministers, statutory bodies or local authorities &mdash; to transfer staff to the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>Section 32 contains a range of provisions enabling the Minister, the National Roads Authority, road authorities and public authorities to provide staffing and other services to each other. Section 35 contains standard superannuation provisions for staff of the new Authority.</P>
    <P>Section 33 prohibits Members of the Oireachtas and of the European Parliament from being members of the Authority and provides for the secondment from employment of members of their staff while serving as Members of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament or nominated as candidates for election. Under section 34 members of a local authority may not be employees of the Authority unless their employment is in a class or grade exempted by the Minister. <Col N="1959" /> Elected members and staff of local authorities are not, however, precluded from being members of the Authority.</P>
    <P>Sections 36 to 38 contain standard provisions requiring members and staff of the Authority to disclose a beneficial interest in any matter being dealt with by the Authority, prohibiting the improper disclosure of confidential information and prohibiting attempts to improperly influence members of the Authority or their staff.</P>
    <P>Section 39 gives the Minister a general power to issue mandatory directions and advisory guidelines to the Authority.  The Minister has a similar power for road authorities in section 15.</P>
    <P>The Third Schedule, applied to the Authority by section 40, deals largely with technical and procedural matters.</P>
    <P>Part IV re-enacts the main provisions of the Local Governments (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974, with some additions and amendments.  I shall not go through all the provisions in detail, but let me draw your attention to the most significant sections.  Section 43 introduced the concept of a protected road which, as I explained earlier, is a halfway house between a motorway and an ordinary public road.  The procedures for a protected road are flexible, allowing access to it to be banned or restricted and also allowing for a prohibition or restriction on its use by certain types of traffic.</P>
    <P>Sections 48 and 49 deal with the environmental impact assessment of road projects.  Environment impact assessments will be required for the construction of motorways and busways and for certain other types of road projects prescribed in regulations.  It is my intention to make new regulations under this section prescribing those categories of road projects already covered by the existing environmental impact assessment regulations.  Even outside the prescribed categories, the Minister will have the power to require the preparation of an environmental impact statement for any other proposed road development likely to have significant effects on the <Col N="1960" /> environment.  Road authorities will also be obliged to carry out an environmental impact statement on any project they consider likely to have significant environmental effects.</P>
    <P>Section 52 introduces a new power to provide service areas on motorways and protected roads.  A road authority will be able to provide a service area itself or to enter into an agreement with a private operator to provide one.</P>
    <P>Part V re-enacts the Local Government (Toll Roads) Act, 1979, with amendments.  The main changes from the 1979 Act are the transfer to the National Roads Authority of tolling powers in relation to national roads, an explicit power in section 58 enabling a road authority with the approval of the Minister to revoke a toll scheme and, finally, a modernised procedure for the making of toll by-laws under section 59.  Tolling powers for the National Roads Authority represent a logical extension of their overall responsibilities in respect of national roads and complement their borrowing powers under section 25.  Since the development of national roads will be fully funded through the National Roads Authority, it seems only reasonable that they, rather than the local authorities, should be able to avail of any toll revenue from those roads.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that the scope for tolling is very limited and any revenue obtained in that way by the National Roads Authority will be ploughed back into the national roads.  I also hasten to add that the new power to revoke a toll scheme is not in any way intended to allow the National Roads Authority or road authorities walk away from the obligations under existing toll agreements made with private investors.  The terms of those agreements will continue to apply.</P>
    <P>Part VI contains a range of miscellaneous provisions &mdash; some new, some updated and strengthened.</P>
    <P>Section 65 will give a new power to road authorities to provide cycleways.  A cycleway is a road or a part of a road designed for the exclusive use of pedal cyclists or pedal cyclists and pedestrians. It differs from a cycle lane which is just <Col N="1961" /> a part of a road reserved for cyclists through the use of road markings.</P>
    <P>Section 66 prohibits temporary dwellings on national roads, motorways, busways and protected roads and enables road authorities to remove and store them.  This provision will only apply to about 6 per cent of total road milage and is justified by the strategic importance of those routes and the heavy traffic on them.</P>
    <P>Section 67 strengthens the existing powers of road authorities under the Local Government Acts, 1925 and 1946, to deal with roadside trees, shrubs and vegetation and gives them a new power to deal with dangerous structures on or near public roads.  A new statutory obligation is placed on landowners and occupiers to ensure that roadside structures, trees, shrubs, etc., do not present a danger to road users.  Road authorities will also henceforth be able to take emergency action where there is an immediate and serious hazard to road users.</P>
    <P>Section 68 is a new provision prohibiting unauthorised caravans, vehicles, etc., used for advertising or for the sale of goods or the provision of services on any public road.  It also prohibits unauthorised signs and advertising hoardings.  Road authorities will have power to remove and store any unauthorised caravan, sign, etc., and, as in section 66, there will be a procedure enabling the owner to recover it.</P>
    <P>Section 69 replaces provisions in a number of Acts, primarily section 76 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, relating to the extinguishment of public rights of way. This section also devolves the power to local authorities, with the Minister retaining a residual power of consent where a national or regional road is affected.  The new powers also provide a greater degree of flexibility, for example, allowing an extinguishment to come into force on a specified date or when specified conditions have been met.  At present an extinguishment takes effect on the day it is confirmed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 70 is a new provision requiring <Col N="1962" /> the organisers of prescribed types of road races to give one month's notice to the road authority and the local Garda superintendent. It also gives road authorities power to prohibit the holding of a road race, to prohibit it unless specified conditions, restrictions or requirements are met or simply to specify conditions, restrictions or requirements.  Section 71 updates the powers to temporarily close public roads currently contained in section 35 of the Local Government Act, 1955.</P>
    <P>Section 72 to 76 are procedural in character dealing with powers of inspection, the service of notices, offences and penalties and expenses of the Minister. Section 75 sets out the penalties for the various offences listed throughout the Bill.</P>
    <P>The First and Second Schedules respectively deal with repeals and minor and consequential amendments.</P>
    <P>I am sure from this necessarily brief review the House will agree that this is a comprehensive and important Bill which will provide a good foundation for the development of our public road network well into the next century.  In particular, it will put in place a strong and effective National Roads Authority which will get on with the task of urgently upgrading the national roads in partnership with the local authorities.  I approach the debate on this Bill with an open mind.  I want, in conclusion, to assure the House that I will be listening very carefully to all constructive suggestions and criticisms made during our deliberations.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which the Minister insisted was being honoured, which I find is not now being honoured.  In fact, I find he was mistaken in some of the allegations he made.</P>
      <P>The quality of our national roads network is of fundamental importance to our economy.  It is important <i>vis-à-vis</i> its efficiency and the competitiveness of our economy.  Bad roads retard economic development.  Indeed, it has been estimated independently that bad roads in Ireland add 20 per cent to the cost of rural manufacturing industry.  Traffic congestion, bottlenecks and delays impose clear cost penalties on the Irish haulage sector because of the tachograph regulations.  The accumulated cost of an inefficient roads network and a highly taxed haulage sector means that Irish transport costs are twice the European average.  For example, it is estimated that, on averge, transport costs account for 9 per cent of export values, in other words, for every £100 of Irish exports, £9 are attributable to transport costs, double the European average of 4.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>The credibility of the Government on the establishment of the National Roads Authority and providing that Authority with a statutory base is very weak.  Fianna Fáil first promised this Bill in 1987, over four years ago.  As of February 1989 the sixth draft of the Bill had been circulated. Over four years after it had first been promised it is now introduced in this House.  That indifference and neglect is matched only by the Minister's successor's complete failure to provide adequate resources to bring our roads network up to a European standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the operational EC programme for infrastructural development from 1989 to 1993 there was larger support than ever from the EC for funding for roads, up to 75 per cent of a route development made available.  Given that these new resources were being made available, what did the Government do?  They decided to cheat the Irish motorist and EC taxpayer by substituting EC resources for Irish Exchequer funding.  In fact, the Exchequer will contribute only a net 17 <Col N="1964" /> per cent of the cost of this five year roads programme from 1989 to 1993.</P>
    <P>Given the tax return on the construction work in the form of PAYE and PRSI from the works this programme will generate, they will actually make a profit on their investment given the low level of capital input.  This means the Exchequer will have contributed less to the construction of national roads over the period 1989 to 1993 compared with the previous five years Exchequer funding. This five-year roads programme will result in 16 per cent only of the national roads network being upgraded.  It is a matter of total frustration and annoyance to the Irish transport sector, industry, agriculture and tourism that road development is such a low priority with this Government.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that, until there is a single Minister and Department of Transport dealing with all aspects of road, sea and air transport, we will not have an integrated, efficient raods transport network. At present we have a Minister for the Environment, his Department and local authorities dealing with roads and traffic matters and some degree of law enforcement in relation to them.  The Minister for Transport is responsible for aviation and shipping, for semi-State companies and certain haulage issues, such as licensing regulations and laden weights.  The Minister for the Marine is responsible for ports, shipping and marine issues.</P>
    <P>I might cite the example of Denmark where they reorganised their Government Departments to ensure they would have an integrated policy by having a single Ministry for Transport dealing with all modes of transport.  Those working in and dependent on the transport sector here are confused and baffled by the lack of coherence at this level of inter-departmental responsibility.  We believe there should be a single Minister, acting in a coherent manner, leading to the evolvement of an efficient integrated transport network, reducing our peripherality and heading to lower transport costs.  We contend this lack of coherence is one of the fundamental flaws of this <Col N="1965" /> Bill, that is, the total omission of infrastructural responsibility for our railways as part of the functions of the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that the National Roads Authority should have responsibility for the upgrading and maintenance of the national network of roads and railway track.  Rail transport is the only form of transport where the operators, Irish Rail, have to pay the total cost of the infrastructure, the permanent way.  This costs over £44 million per annum.  It is a disgrace that the EC operational programme for 1989 to 1993 provides not one penny for the railways outside Dublin, although resources under that programme amount to over £1 billion.  The small figure of £36 million is to be used for rolling stock in the Dublin area.  All road expenditure is on the basis of 75:25 and it is shameful that not one penny was applied for in respect of the railways.</P>
    <P>I attended a public meeting in Galway last night.  People there are wondering why it takes two hours and twenty-five minutes to commute to Dublin by train. It need take only two hours if there were continuous welded rail all the way.  I understand it is provided from Heuston to Portarlington, but only 18 miles of the remaining 88 miles from Portarlington to Galway are done.  This work could be done at a cost of £18 million or £1.8 million over ten years.  To put those figures into context, it cost £35 million to build five miles of the Athlone by-pass, while it would cost £18 million to update 70 miles of track.  That illustrates the value for money provided by the rail-ways. The Minister may say it is not a matter for his Department but it is a vital infrastructural and transport issue and it underlines the weakness of <i>ad hoc</i> planning in relation to transport.  The lines from Ballina, Westport, Castlebar, Galway and Sligo to Dublin are being downgraded by stealth through lack of investment in the permanent way.  Trains can achieve speeds of 90 miles an hour on continuous welded rail but not on jointed tracks.  The proposed authority <Col N="1966" /> should be a national roads and rail authority and should come under the aegis of the Minister for Transport.</P>
    <P>Under successive Governments from the thirties to the sixties policy in relation to the haulage sector was designed to safeguard the position of the railways. Many changes have taken place in transport liberalisation in recent decades, particularly the legislation in the 1980s to open up the haulage sector to intense competition within the private sector. This will be added to by cabotage in terms of international competition.  We will shortly have a bus competition Bill which will open up passenger services to similar intense competition in terms of fares and the scheduling of routes.  The original basis of the protective legislation in terms of haulage and passenger transport services was the protection of the railways. Now that these changes have taken place, there is a compelling case for more positive support in terms of infrastructural capital grant aid to the railway sector to ensure its survival.  The Government cannot ignore this problem and express surprise in years to come over the time it takes to travel from Dublin to Westport or Sligo by train and the fact that fewer people are using the services.  We will be tabling a series of Committee Stage amendments to ensure that the Authority is expanded to deal with the purely infrastructural requirements of Irish Rail. This would also include the possibility of the ultimate conclusion that the solution to Dublin's transport needs is the development of a public transport network, probably a light rail system, which could come under the aegis of a national roads and rail authority.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the independence of the Authority.  I am aware that one of the reasons for the delay in bringing forward this legislation has been the internal debate whether the National Roads Authority should be an executive office within the Department of the Environment under the control of the Minister, which would merely mean the renaming and reclassification of the roads division of that Department, or the establishment of a semi-State authority independent of <Col N="1967" /> the Department and the Minister for the Environment.  It is absolutely vital that the National Roads Authority be an independent arm of Government, acting with the singular objective to expedite the upgrading of the standard of Irish roads to a European level.  They should be free to articulate views in the way, for example, that the Combat Poverty Agency do.  They should also be free from political interference in relation to the prioritising of route development. Because we now have a Minister for the Environment from Cavan-Monaghan rather than Mayo, we do not want to find that primary route development moves from the west to the north-east.  This is no way to plan infrastructure.  We need independence of action.  Knowing the Minister's record of support for the health board in his own area, I have no doubt that he would not be behind the bush in looking after his constituency needs.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the National Roads Authority do not become another layer of bureaucracy, wedged between the Departments of the Environment and Finance on the one hand and local authorities on the other.  Such a buffer might only add to the bureaucracy delays and problems of the current road construction programme.  To avoid such a dilemma, it is imperative that local authorities have a strong consultative relationship with the authority and that the Government allow them to do their job on an autonomous basis.  We will be tabling a number of amendments because we believe the present draft does not allow sufficient consultation with local authorities and their engineering staff. We must ensure that in terms of maintenance, local authorities will not be in a worse position financially in carrying out their responsibilities.  I am referring specifically to the maintenance of former national roads which have been downgraded or bypassed.  The maintenance funding to date to local authorities in respect of national primary routes has been so low that they cannot attempt to maintain the hard shoulder of such roads. <Col N="1968" /> Deputy Howlin will verify that the Wexford county manager recently outlined to us that for some time it has been the case that the inadequacy of funds has prevented any work on the hard shoulders of these roads.  It is an acknowledged fact of policy.  If under this legislation local authorities are to be given added responsibilities and delegated to do certain work, it is vital that they are not made the scapegoats for financial cutbacks and that they be given adequate resources.  In this area the independence of the authority is vital.  It must be ensured that the position regarding shortsighted savings does not worsen.</P>
    <P>The procedures for compulsory purchase orders do not take account of local residential or community views which may be expressed through local public representatives.  I will be seeking to insert amendments so that in the first instance compulsory purchase orders will continue to be carried out by local authorities. Only in the event of a clear conflict of views between the local authority and the National Roads Authority would the matter be taken up by the Minister, who would have to sanction such a compulsory purchase order.  It is vital that we do not have unaccountable bureaucrats determining in isolation the sensitive issue of compulsory purchase orders.  The track record of local councils in this regard has been fair and reasonable, bearing in mind sensitivity to local needs and the requirements of progress.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that in virtually every conceivable case the acquisition of land for route development should be carried out exclusively by local authorities. They should be democratically allowed to carry out their role in this regard and only in an extraordinary dispute where the local authority are being totally unreasonable should the Minister, who is accountable to this House, as opposed to the National Roads Authority, who are basically accountable to nobody, take action.</P>
    <P>I am deeply concerned, as are my party, about Part V of the Bill which deals with toll roads.  Under the Minister's proposals, the National Roads <Col N="1969" /> Authority will have power to levy tolls on new motorways they build, and to levy tolls on new highways they will only need the approval of the Minister.  The local authority will have no say in the matter. The National Roads Authority can decide to collect the toll themselves or sell the franchise to a private company. Income earned from the tolls can be used to repay finance borrowed for road construction which under the Bill they will be allowed to raise.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are opposed to such sweeping powers which, in effect, amount to the possibility of new and penal taxation. That is not to say we are opposed to tolls in principle.  We believe tolls should be limited to roads where there is a private investment factor only.  In cases where there is total public funding, tolls should not apply.  Therefore, roads which are publicly funded by Irish taxpayers and the European authorities should not be used as a vehicle for raising new Exchequer revenue.  If it is necessary to supplement the existing roads programme which is publicly financed with new roads which are privately financed, they can be the subject of such a toll.</P>
    <P>I understand there are only two toll facilities in operation at present under the Local Government (Toll Roads) Act, 1979, namely, the East Link and West Link bridges over the River Liffey.  In view of the fact that the Irish road user pays the highest rates of taxation in Europe, such a major departure from existing policy should be vigorously opposed.  The figures are quite startling when one combines the revenue from VAT and excise duties on petrol and auto-diesel, with VAT and excise duties on the purchase of motor vehicles as well as other taxes.  Including motor taxation, this amounted to a total taxation of £1,061 million in 1988; £1,221 million in 1989 and £1,280 million in 1990.  Enough is enough.  More tolls for publicly funded roads can only be an additional unfair burden on the Irish road user.</P>
    <P>To put it frankly, Irish motorists pay £3.5 million every day to the Exchequer. To put this in context, the total requirement needed to bring our roads up to <Col N="1970" /> the European standard by the year 2010 would be £230 million per year.  When one compares this to the figure of £1,280 million one can see that the Government are taking in huge resources from motorists. The Government should not introduce a new tax by the back door which would add to transport costs on our primary, inter-city and arterial radial routes at a time when there is a huge disparity between taxation on transport North and South of the Border.  I should like to give some examples of this.</P>
    <P>The VAT rate on fuel and vehicles in the Republic is 21 per cent and 15 per cent in Northern Ireland.  The excise duty on vehicles in the North is zero while it is 6.5 per cent in the South.  The rate of excise duty on a hectolitre of oil is approximately 10 per cent higher in the South than in the North.  When one adds to this higher insurance costs and dearer prices for parts, one can see how the haulage sector in the South are being crippled by a loss of market share to Northern Ireland hauliers and they have to cope with the existing unfair competitive base.  Goods are transported from the most southerly points of the Republic &mdash; Cork and Kerry &mdash; to Larne, across to Stranraer and then to the south of England.  This is illogical and means huge losses to Irish ports, such as Rosslare, Cork, Dún Laoghaire and Dublin, in terms of the central and southern corridor. The Government have already taxed haulage transport out of existence and any proposal to introduce toll roads would not only make us uncompetitive in Europe but would add a further burden to the soft touch &mdash; the Irish motorist. This would be unacceptable.  If the Government wish to introduce a supplementary programme over and above that set out by the EC, the Department and the National Roads Authority, for building more toll roads, then only a modest level of toll should apply.  There would also have to be strict control of the toll and a local authority input.  The proposal to repeal the Local Government (Toll Roads) Act, 1979, set out in Part V, goes too far.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the funding of road <Col N="1971" /> construction in more detail.  The Department of the Environment estimate that the total cost of upgrading our national roads network to an acceptable standard would be £3.3 billion at 1987 prices.  At the current level of investment this would not be achieved for 30 years.  This is unacceptable. A more reasonable target would be the year 2010, which is just under 20 years away.  This would require an average annual investment of approximately £230 million per annum at 1990 prices.  When the Government were negotiating with the EC Commission they did not honour their original application under the plan entitled &ldquo;Ireland Road Development 1989 to 1993&rdquo;.  This envisaged a total investment of £687 million, including an Irish Government commitment of £171 million.  When the operational programme was subsequently published in 1990 the total was reduced to £518 million and the Exchequer's contribution was cut by £30 million.  It is shameful that the Irish Exchequer funding position should have been reduced in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of getting this money was to bring us up to a European standard.  If one compares the average funding for roads projected over the five year period of the current plan with the previous five years, one can see that total annual expenditure is projected to rise by 24 per cent.  However, when one takes into account that EC funding is up by 78 per cent, one can see that net State expenditure is down by 19 per cent.  This deceitful, shabby and cheap substitution of funds will mean that in years to come when people look back at our preparation for the Single European Market they will see that, instead of bringing our infrastructure up to an acceptable competitive standard, we diverted the funds for current purposes in a shortsighted and irresponsible manner.  It will be seen that we shored up our budgetary position with EC resources instead of using them for the purpose of providing long term meaningful benefits.</P>
    <P>In view of this lack of commitment it is important that there is now long term <Col N="1972" /> planning.  This is at the core of whether the National Roads Authority will be successful. Fine Gael believe that a target date of the year 2010 should now be set to implement the roads programme outlined by the EC in 1989.  Furthermore, it is vital that an interim target should be set for the necessary road development being achieved by the end of the next five year programme.  The present programme will run to 1993 and the next five year programme will run to 1998.  What we are saying is that 60 per cent of the EC target to bring us up to a European standard should be achieved by 1998 and the total programme should be implemented by the year 2010.  This minimum target should be 60 per cent of the total programme.</P>
    <P>There should be a clear signal from this House as to what the National Roads Authority are obliged to achieve.  All the road maps and routes have already been set out.  The design work in terms of what needs to be done is already in place, what we need is action and implementation. To make matters worse the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, on 6 March 1991 outlined a list of new projects to commence at that time.  He announced that £114.6 million was to be invested in major road improvement schemes.  There was no breakdown of this figure for new starts.  Reliable industry sources suggest that some £30 million of this £114.6 million was exclusively for new projects which were to commence for the first time in 1991.  I regret to say that my allegations in September that the then Minister was not honouring his commitments of 6 March have since been confirmed, despite the Minister's denials. The Minister said at the time that my claims were absolute rubbish and that I had got it wrong again.  I stand over my claim that no excavation work has commenced or will commence this year on the northern cross route linking the N1 and the N3, i.e., linking the western toll bridge and Dublin Airport.  Neither the Portlaoise by-pass nor work on the Euro route at Kilpeddar, Glen of the Downs will commence this year.  Despite the former Minister's bluster it is quite <Col N="1973" /> obvious that independent constituents of the road transport industry see through this waffle.  I quote from the Alliance of National Road Users press release of 11 September in which they said they were: astonished at the Minister's blanket assertion that all eight EC supported projects due to commence in 1991 were on target.  They went further and stated: &ldquo;The Minister's remarks are not supported by the situation on the ground&rdquo;. The former Minister with his age old practice of bluster and bluff has been exposed yet again.</P>
    <P>Clearly, we have a situation whereby we are not honouring our commitments. Further information has come to hand since.  The northern cross route is at least eight months behind schedule.  Construction has not yet commenced on any of the following projects: the £50 million Lucan-Kilcock by-pass; the £16 million Mullingar by-pass; the £29 million Portlaoise by-pass and the improvement work at Kilmacanogue and Glen of the Downs costing £8 million.  The fact is that the Minister clearly set out on 6 March the programmes that would commence this year but that is all in ribbons.  There is no logical or acceptable explanation in the context of delays or tendering that will satisfy a situation whereby even the most modest programme, agreed by the EC, is not now going to be implemented.  It is no wonder we are being humiliated in Europe.  I will go further and draw the Minister's attention to the report of the EC Court of Auditors which oversees Community spending.  It has called into question the operation of a number of EC financed schemes in Ireland.  I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 28 November 1990 &mdash; the day after the annual report of the Court of Auditors was published:</P>
    <P>... the court criticises agricultural schemes and projects financed under the Community's regional development fund, for &ldquo;sloppy management&rdquo;, failure to correctly apply spending rules, and the &ldquo;withholding of essential information&rdquo; necessary to Brussels in order to improve EC schemes.... While recent reforms of the European <Col N="1974" /> Regional Development Fund &mdash; which, <i>per capita,</i> benefits Ireland more than any other EC member state &mdash; are &ldquo;much vaunted&rdquo;, according to the auditors, administration of the funds has &ldquo;barely improved&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ireland is accused in the report of receiving funds &ldquo;considerably higher than its quota&rdquo; for regional development. The Government's use of EC moneys for the national roads development programmes has resulted in &ldquo;no significant improvement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The whole principle of EC funding is not to give money to the Paddys &mdash; the whole principle is one of additionality, to help poorer peripheral member states to reach European standards.  Yet, in a shabby and cheap way we are substituting this Euro gravy to prop up our budgetary situation.</P>
    <P>This is not only a tragedy of neglect because of the continuing horrific series of road accidents which are the result of an inadequate national road network, but is extremely grave in so far as the EC authorities are concerned.  The EC Court of Auditors are not happy with the present Government's performance in terms of road development.  I should like to quote from a statement from the CII on 23 August 1991 in which they say:</P>
    <P>The CII roads policy committee strongly urges the Minister for the Environment to take all the necessary steps to accelerate the current roads programme, so that at least the approved EC assistance for roads, up to the end of 1993, will be drawn down.</P>
    <P>When replying on Second Stage I would like the Minister to give a commitment that all the EC moneys will be drawn down for the period up to 1993.  I know questions will be raised by the Court of Auditors and by the Commission in relation to the way we have failed to keep our promises.  It will be impossible to argue for increased funding after 1993 from the EC Commission when our performance has been so pathetic.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to the issue of non-national roads &mdash; the 94 per cent of roads <Col N="1975" /> about which the average resident and tourist has so many complaints.  These roads are known as regional or local roads under the reclassfication in Part II of this Bill.  It is the poor standards of these roads that have made Irish roads the butt of European jokes, not to speak of the constant problem of damage to vehicles.  Frustration has turned to anger among Irish motorists on this issue to the extent that in the last local elections specific single issue candidates were elected to councils &mdash; not so far from the Minister's area &mdash; on the issue of the state of our county roads.  Total road mileage throughout the country is 57,000.  County or regional roads comprise roughly 53,600 miles of that total.  Local authorities have been squeezed in their budgetary situations since the abolition of domestic rates in 1979.  The domestic rates support grant from central government in lieu of revenue from household rates has not kept pace with local authority requirements or inflation.  Local authorities faced with this position cannot reduce expenditure in many areas of fixed administrative overheads such as the running of the fire brigade service, housing administration, insurance and so on.  Even though there has been some increase in the discretionary non-national road grants from the Department of the Environment to local authorities, the total level of expenditure on minor roads has not been adequate.  The grant in 1991 was £68.13 million.  Most local authorities are down to a resurfacing cycle of county roads of over 25 years, in some cases it is as high as 37 years.  Essentially, this is a problem of resources.  The present funding mechanisms are not working.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that a local roads fund should be established to maintain and improve non-national primary routes.  This would be made up of receipts from motor taxation paid to local authorities. In 1991 revenue from this source to local authorities was £161 million.  I understand that currently total expenditure on non-national roads for 1991 was made up of a total of £130 million &mdash; £80 million by way of grants from the <Col N="1976" /> Department of the Environment to local authorities and £50 million from the internal budgets of local authorities.  If the grants system were to be replaced by allowing the motor tax receipts to be used in this way funding would be increased by some £31 million this year.  I suggest we abolish the road grants for non-national roads, do away with that administration and use the motor tax receipts which would be spent exclusively on the basis of mileage.  A minimum level of funding of £160 million is needed to resolve the problem that can only otherwise get worse as time passes.  Savings made in the short term on the maintenance of our county roads will have to be paid for in years to come.  The level of expenditure should be based exclusively and solely on mileage of county roads in each administrative area or county.  Local authorities would not be allowed to divert such funding into other areas of their activity.  Unless a political commitment is given for a new funding mechanism of this kind there will be no progress, only deterioration, on the issue.  This is an area where radical reform is required.</P>
    <P>After the abolition of rates in 1979 we had the domestic rates support grant.  The previous Minister, Deputy Flynn, in the late eighties introduced the notion of discretionary grants for non-national roads.  This has been increased dramatically to a level of £80 million, but it is still not enough.  There is a huge variation in the quality of minor roads in different counties.  We must have uniformity throughout the country and we must have quality roads.  This can only be achieved with a proper resurfacing and maintenance cycle.  We all know that dumper trucks putting a bit of tar and chippings here and there is not the solution to the problem of potholes.  We need a new funding mechanism.  On the basis of the principle that the user pays, there will be broad acceptance by motorists that the bigger the car the more one pays and that this money should contribute to the local authority setting up a local roads fund which will not be diverted to any other area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" /> When one takes into account the abolition of road grants and the £30 million that would normally go to the Exchequer from the local authorities, a total of £160 million will have to be paid by the Exchequer for roads.  Unless such an investment is made some county councils will have to apply the abandonment clause in this Bill to some roads.  Roads are capital assets which have to be maintained. If not, the strengthening work which will be needed in future will be even more expansive.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, Fine Gael will submit proposals for a road audit of each local authority by the National Roads Authority.  It is vital to have a cost benefit analysis as to the value for money being obtained by local authorities in their expenditure on roads.  Such an analysis should be carried out on a biannual basis to show regional variations in contractors' prices and the relative merits and demerits of using private contractors as against permanent council staff.  I do not have an ideological view on whether the councils should use their own resources or private contractors.  If we were totally dependent on private contractors there would be a rip-off.  The contractors would get together and agree not to compete on price.  As against that, we can achieve better work practices and greater efficiencies if we have clear cost comparisons between private contractors and the cost of maintenance by local authorities.  The objective of the road audit would be to arrive at uniform costings for each local authority in terms of strengthening and road surfacing works.</P>
    <P>In my analysis of different counties with regard to road problems, grants and so on, not all the problems can be accounted for in financial terms. Although the mileage is the same for funding in each county we have a deplorable disparity in the quality of roads. At a recent meeting I was told that the number of engineers in one local authority exceeded the number of road workers.  I do not know if that is true but an audit would highlight this and it would include the performance aspect, to ensure that roads are brought to an <Col N="1978" /> acceptable standard in each area.  It is not good enough to leave comparisons as to the quality of our road network to a pothole competition on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Hour&rdquo;.  We need an appropriate inspection process that would show up local authorities who are not doing their job properly.</P>
    <P>We will also table amendments on Committee Stage to deal with the annoyance and irritation that many road users endure due to disruption to traffic from road openings.  This applies particularly in metropolitan urban areas.  I am referring to road works carried out by other than road authorities or local authorities, including the ESB, An Bord Gáis, work on water supplies and works done by other private contractors.  We need order in this chaos where vital roads in our cities are repeatedly opened, causing delays, traffic congestion and hardship to motorists. We will seek a licence or permit system for such road openings which will have clear cost penalties for delays in completing the works or for a failure to replace the roadway satisfactorily.  Ordinary motorists find nothing more frustrating than being stuck behind some little plastic tent erected by Telecom Éireann or An Bord Gáis reducing three lane roads to one lane of traffic so that people cannot get to work on time or keep appointments.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, for instance we need a licensing system so that utilities cannot open up roads at will.  Various authorities should have to work together when roads are opened and there should be penalties for delays.  Companies should not be able to work at their leisure.  They should have to pay a fine if the work is not completed quickly or if the road is not repaired properly.  There is no reason the local authorities should have to bear the cost of replacing roads due to the sloppy workmanship of other State bodies.</P>
    <P>In terms of road prioritisation and overall road strategy, it is imperative that we give priority to the roads that connect to our seaports.  We are an island economy with a very high dependence on foreign trade.  We export more than 70 per cent of everything we produce and <Col N="1979" /> we rely on seaports for the movement of 99.8 per cent of our overseas trade.  Our dependence on foreign trade is higher than that of the UK, Japan or the US. Our dependence is the highest in the EC, except for Belgium and Luxembourg. Our European partners have a market on their doorsteps.  They also have access to high speed rail, motorways and inland waterways to transport their goods while we are totally dependent on our seaports.</P>
    <P>Following the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1992 we will be the only country without a landlink to the European Continent.  Road access to Dublin Port is poor, adding considerably to access costs while Belfast, Larne and Warrenpoint are served by ports and/or dual carriageway systems.  Our principal ports of Dublin, Rosslare, Waterford and Cork should have the highest priority for haulage and tourism access to have the most beneficial impact on reducing our transport costs.  One of the disadvantages Irish ports and Irish shipping services suffer relative to the services operated in Northern Ireland, and particularly through Larne, is the infrequency of sailings. Traffic congestion and failure to meet departure times on shipping schedules imposes huge cost penalties.  Therefore the highest priority in terms of road development is our links into and out of our commercial seaports.  This is absolutely critical.</P>
    <P>In terms of competing demands, should it be political constituency pressure that determines on which routes the money is to be spent?  I believe not.  It is up to this House to state the priorities. Dublin Port, for instance accounts for 7.5 million tonnes of trade, or 40 per cent of all exports, and employs some 5,000 people within an 800 acre compound. Dublin Port is absolutely vital.  One of the problems is that it is clogged up.  One of the reasons people use Larne instead of Dublin Port &mdash; and the same would apply to Dún Laoghaire &mdash; is that there are may be one or two sailings a day by Sealink or the B &amp; I Line whereas there is a sailing every half hour from Larne. If someone is trying to meet a 9 o'clock <Col N="1980" /> sailing here and gets stuck in traffic in the city centre they have to wait 12 hours for the next sailing.  This causes huge problems for all the &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; modern concepts of the manufacturing industry which is to keep one's stock levels as low as possible and one's cash flow as tight as possible in producing a given product at a given time.  I know from my own constituents the frustration of people in, for example, the mushroom business or the fresh fruit and vegetable business, who are trying to meet very tight deadlines for the Tescos and Sainsburys because of delays and holdups on our sailings.  The first priority must be the roads to our ports.</P>
    <P>In relation to Part VI of the Bill concerning the prohibition of temporary dwellings on national roads and other unauthorised activities on the side of the roads, I would like to make two points. First, I believe it should be an offence to have a wandering animal on a roadway. There have been too many horrific accidents, particularly from wandering horses, for this problem to be ignored any longer.  The existing Animals Acts and the powers of the Garda and local authorities are inadequate, as are the penalties for such wandering animals which are extremely dangerous to the motoring public.  I would like to dwell on this for a moment.  Some areas have a more severe problem than others in relation to wandering horses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a problem on its own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a local problem immediately adjacent to Deputy Yates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right and it was adjacent to another Member of another House, but I will not go into that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that if a horse, or often a herd of horses, is wandering along the M11 or the N17 and someone decides to drive them off the road and into a field belonging to an adjoining landowner, or lets the horses wander onto that land, if <Col N="1981" /> they come out of the farmer's land, he is responsible for any accident, even though he may never have known about it and was not negligent.  Leaving aside the fact that in my own constituency there have been some horrific, totally unacceptable events, where small children in housing estates have been kicked and injured by wandering horses, we need to ensure that the law is strengthened in this area.  On Committee Stage, I will ask the Minister to use this legislation to take very tough and rigorous action to ensure that, people who have no land and have no intention of taking out any land, let their horses run loose, there would be strict penalties for forfeiture for owners of such animals if they are found on a national primary route or any route, because not only is there danger to motorists but there is the crazy situation where innocent people can be found guilty if there is an accident. The people who own the horses know this well but they put these horses on to someone's land because they know that if the landowner puts them off he will be responsible if there is an accident.</P>
    <P>Second, some flexibility is needed in relation to some of the prohibitions the Minister is providing for.  There is a need to create a facility in this Bill where certain roadside trading, in limited circumstances, on a seasonal basis, would be allowed.  I would envisage some regulations being introduced by local authorities on a permit basis that would allow people to, for example, sell strawberries, potatoes or other fruit or vegetables in season.  This is the custom in my constituency of Wexford.  I am sure anyone who has travelled from Dublin to Rosslare has seen very attractive displays well in off the hard shoulder, people minding their own business, and ample space for parking, but this is only for a couple of weeks in the year.  Obviously, there would be a problem on high speed motorways and we should adopt a different attitude, but on the ordinary primary route that has a single carriageway there should be a facility where somebody could get a permit from a local authority. I have had a number of people in touch with me who feel that the powers of this <Col N="1982" /> Bill are too rigid, too inflexible and should allow for certain seasonal trade.</P>
    <P>There are other small traders who are not really a road hazard selling vegetables and, in some settings, they can add to the amenity and the attractiveness of certain areas.  Perhaps the Minister would consider allowing some flexibility by the introduction of a new section in this Part to encompass such activities.</P>
    <P>In case I do not get back to it later, there is a section in the Bill which allows a new franchise to be set up for roadside activities.  The Minister does not specify what he has in mind, whether it is to regulate this new development where chip vans are setting up on roads as fast food outlets.  When one thinks about it one realises that it is nearly all articulated trucks that are parked beside these laybys because there is no place in towns for the drivers to park so that they can get something to eat.  Is that what the Minister intends to regulate or what is proposed? This needs to be looked at and I would favour local authorities and public representatives on the ground being given responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the membership of the National Roads Authority. It is not clear from section 34 of the Bill how the Minister proposes to fill the ten to 14 person membership.  In order to ensure that this Authority has a certain dynamic, it is essential that road users form an essential part of any appointees. I ask the Minister to give a commitment to appoint representatives from some of the following organisations: the CII, the Irish Road Hauliers' Association, some agricultural interests, tourism interests, the SIMI, the Irish Ports Association and Irish Rail, local authority representation and perhaps a nominee of either or both the General Council of County Councils and the Association of Municipal Authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no reference to this in his speech and he seems to have total discretion in this matter.  I believe that in terms of harmony with local authorities, they should have an avenue in which to have an input into the National Roads Authority.  Most of all I believe this roads <Col N="1983" /> programme, roads construction and roads policy unit should be driven on a consumer/transport demand basis.  The people who know best what is required are not in ivory towers, they are not designers or engineers but they are using the roads.</P>
    <P>It is important that the staff of this Authority be of the highest calibre and the remuneration for the chief executive should be generous to attract such a person.  I will also be seeking to include an amendment that any transfers of staff from either the Department of the Environment or the local authority to the National Roads Authority would be done without compulsion and that any such transfers would involve voluntary consent and the agreement of such staff.  That is absolutely vital.  We will be seeking to amend the Bill so that the consent of the staff or their trade union would be required.  I do not believe we should get off on the wrong foot in terms of insisting that staff be transferred because they have a lifetime service in the roads section of the Department of the Environment or wherever.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the Minister for the Environment and the Authority is unclear.  I note that the Confederation of Irish Industry in their statement when the Bill was published referred to this point.  I would like to refer to their press release in which the former Minister stated that the Authority will report directly to him.  The Bill is silent on this point.  Certain sections give the Minister huge powers in relation to the range of work of the Authority or works that he may remove from the Authority.  Therefore I am seeking clarification as to what the role of the Minister will be in relation to the Authority.  The Bill should be amended to establish that the Authority will report directly to the Minister.</P>
    <P>We also envisage the Authority being independent in so far as they would be given a block grant and would decide, as they see fit, which route developments should receive priority.  In this regard the inclusion of section 39 seems to be <Col N="1984" /> extraordinary.  If we fail to get a satisfactory explanation we will seek to have it deleted.  It seems to give the Minister the power to direct the Authority in relation to any of their functions as he sees fit.  On an initial reading it seems, if the section is to be implemented fully, the Authority will be a mere puppet and it will therefore undermine their independence. Essentially, Fine Gael are in favour of the National Roads Authority reporting directly to the Minister, having autonomy in carrying out their functions, being adequately staffed with people of high calibre and having sufficient finance to complete the required investment programme in the shortest possible time frame.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, given any analysis of the number of cars per population throughout Western Europe, with Ireland having an average of 4.7 persons per car as against the European average of 2.7 persons per car, that the number of cars in this country will continue to grow.  It is vital that our roads be adequate to meet this increased growth.  On this basis, Fine Gael will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage but we will be seeking on Committee Stage a commitment that the Government are prepared to ensure that this new Authority will have the resources to do their job effectively.  We will be seeking to strengthen the Authority, where necessary, while allowing consultations with local authorities.  Most of all, we will be seeking to give them a timetable within which to provide for this country a road network which is on a par with those of our European competitor countries.</P>
    <P>I would like to respond briefly to some of the points made by the Minister and to raise some specific points which I would like him to take up so as to avoid unnecessary amendments.  As I said, we will be tabling amendments to ensure that the definitions will encompass the activities of the rail service.  In relation to the definition of &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo;, which is defined in section 2 of the Bill &mdash; this is a vital issue &mdash; will the Minister say whether public lighting will be included, given that public lighting forms a vital <Col N="1985" /> aspect of road safety?  If traffic signs and the design of roads are included so, too, should public lighting.  The motions which have been passed <i>ad nauseam</i> year after year at the annual conferences of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland and the General Council of County Councils show that they have sought continually the inclusion of public lighting on national primary routes, the 6 per cent of routes which will come under the aegis of this Authority.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill, section 10, deals with the classification of roads and the assignment of functions, and provides for three types of road, national, regional and local.  Would the Minister clarify whether a national secondary road will be considered a national regional road? The Minister should take the opportunity to upgrade a number of roads, given that the local authorities acquired properties along many roads even though they had not got the go-ahead from the Department because they had not been reclassified. Therefore, I would like the broadest possible interpretation to be put on a national primary road, and I ask the Minister to clarify where what is currently a national secondary road will fit in.  I would also like the Minister to indicate by whom and on what basis the roads will be reclassified.  Will it be done by the Minister or by the National Roads Authority?</P>
    <P>Section 10 (2) (a) states that &ldquo;the Minister may make regulations prescribing classes of public roads ... making provision for the assignment of responsibility for the maintenance and construction of such classes of public roads&rdquo; and so on, but I think he should also make regulations providing for an assessment of the physical quality of national roads.  I have received as I am sure the other spokes-persons for the other parties have, representations from engineers associations, including the association of county engineers of local authorities, seeking to ensure that they do not get a raw deal and be expected to do a job which is impossible within a certain budget.  A new subparagraph (iii) should be inserted in subsection (2) (a) to provide that an <Col N="1986" /> assessment of all national roads be part of the work of the Authority.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to clarify the position in regard to rural areas. Work carried out in rural areas initially under a local improvements scheme often involves the district committees of the local authorities or the ward committees surfacing a route for the first time with a contribution from local residents.  Will the declaration of a public road be made at that stage or at what point will a local authority be able to take a road in charge?  Section 11 (5) states that a certificate of a roads authority that a road is a public road shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence thereof.  Does that mean a certificate will be issued after a local improvements scheme has been carried out?</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about section 12 which deals with the abandonment of public roads.  A new procedure is being put in place whereby it will be easier to abandon public roads.  I do not know if it is Government policy to abandon public roads in rural areas or what the intention is but section 12 (2) (a) states that a road authority shall publish in one or more newspapers where the public road proposed to be abandoned is located and that if objections are made an oral hearing shall be held, to be conducted by a person appointed by the Authority for that purpose.  I am not happy with this provision.  It is all very well to have an oral hearing and to listen to someone's point of view but if at the end of the day, regardless of the objections made, they decide to go ahead with the plan, the procedure will be just a sham and a whitewash. Section 12 should be amended to provide that a decision by a local authority to abandon a public road would require a clear majority.  It could well be the case that either a county manager, the National Roads Authority or some other faceless bureaucrat would decide at will to abandon roads with the idea that, having decided a few years ago that local authorities should no longer be responsible for hedge cutting, the people who use county roads should be responsible for them and that the local residents should get in touch with Roadstone and <Col N="1987" /> do the resurfacing work themselves.  Certainly some whiz kid in the Department of Finance will think up that idea.  Therefore there must be local democracy and the abandoning of a public road, should be a reserved function of local authority members.  Only in exceptional circumstances should the Minister be able to over-ride it.  I would like the Minister to indicate what exactly he has in mind.</P>
    <P>I have also received representations from the same engineers' associations in relation to the amount of money to be set aside for roads which are to be downgraded; in other words what will the position be with regard to maintenance works on a residual road which was a main road before a by-pass was built?  Will local authorities receive additional resources, because it is often taken for granted that they will maintain it?</P>
    <P>Section 13 could be strengthened by making provision for additional consultations. It should be obligatory that consultations be held annually between the engineering staff of local authorities and members to ensure there is no misunderstanding over the amount necessary for maintenance works.  Section 13 is quite explicit and states that road authorities, namely local authorities, can be burdened with this.  It is envisaged that local authorities will be responsible for carrying out maintenance work.  Therefore there should be an obligation on the National Roads Authority, before allocating finance, to consult to find out what will be required.  That level of consultation is not built into the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to urban district councils &mdash; they are very dear to my heart &mdash; which I understand the Government intend to abolish.  That is ludicrous, undemocratic and unfair.  The Government intend to replace them, in the typical slavish pursuit of what they have done in Britain, by mock district councils which do not have a role or meaningful involvement, as opposed to the special needs of urban and municipal areas, <Col N="1988" /> which have stood the test of time for generations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout the Bill the almost extinct species of urban district councils are referred to.  What will happen when they are abolished?  Will the Minister clarify whether he intends on Committee Stage to completely redraft the Bill bearing in mind the whim of the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, on the day?</P>
      <P>We will be tabling amendments to try to set up the local roads fund.  In relation to section 15, any amendment I might table which would be a cost on the Exchequer would be ruled out of order under the Standing Orders of this House. However, section 15 needs to be strengthened; it should specifically state, as part of the powers of the Minister, that he could issue directions and guidelines to a road authority and provide sufficient finance for such matters as the hard shoulder to which I referred earlier.  As subsection (1) stands local authorities are vulnerable to being made scapegoats because of budgetary restraint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech, referring to section 17, the Minister said that any additional functions he might give to the National Roads Authority would be with the express approval of the Dáil and Seanad; I have read section 17 carefully and I cannot see any mention of the Dáil or Seanad. Where is it specifically provided for?  Subsection (3) states that the Minister may make regulations providing that any function relating to national roads conferred on him or on a road authority under any enactment ... or on the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1987 shall, where the Minister is satisfied that the function could be more effectively performed by the Authority, in lieu of being performed by him or by that authority or by the Commissioner, be performed by the Authority with effect from a date specified in the regulations.  Is it envisaged that a new road traffic corps will be established in the functions of the Authority?  It is certainly something <Col N="1989" /> worth considering but I should like to be told explicitly what new functions will be devolved in relation to the former functions of the Garda Commissioner. We will be looking for a timetable for the implementation of the roads construction programme.</P>
    <P>There are omissions in section 19 which need to be addressed.  At present they are listed from (a) to (g).  Will the Minister consider on Committee Stage adding specific functions in relation to road safety, specific legal responsibility for training local authority staff in relation to the above function and a specific duty to comply with the harmonisation of EC road standards and markings?  I am not an expert on engineering but I have been advised that one of the problems engineers face in relation to new road development is the carrying out of testing of soils and materials.  This should be a specific function of the Authority, particularly in relation to bridge construction.</P>
    <P>We are setting up a body which will not be accountable.  For example, if it was decided that the Minister's Department, in conjunction with the local authority, acquired property belonging to a friend of Fianna Fáil, a Member of this House or whatever, and an outlandish price was paid for it, we could harangue the Minister in this House and raise it at local authority level.  It strikes me that there are not checks and balances in the system in relation to the acquisition of property.  Human nature being what it is, consideration should be given to tabling an amendment which states that the acquisition of land would not be at a greater value than a maximum value set out by the Valuation Office.  They are the State body who have the expertise in relation to valuing property.  I am talking about instances which would not involve compulsory purchase orders; some limit should be set to ensure that there is no room for abuse.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier in relation to acquisition of land in section 20, we will be seeking an assurance that any compulsory purchase order will have an element of consent by the local authorities. There must be local democracy <Col N="1990" /> at this level.  There should be a specific requirement on the Authority in section 20 to liaise with local authorities on road plans.  Section 20 (5) (a) states that subject to paragraph (b), where a road authority refuses or fails to comply with a direction under subsection (1), the Authority may, notwithstanding any other enactment and in any case in which it appears to it that the circumstances so warrant, decide to perform the function specified in the direction subject to such modifications (if any) as it considers appropriate.  The word &ldquo;it&rdquo; should be replaced by the words &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; because it is for the National Roads Authority, as I understand it, to give local authorities a kick up the transom and to assume their own role if they are not satisfied with their performance.  Section 21 should also include the railways.</P>
    <P>The road audit should be included in a separate section whereby it would be a direct function of the National Roads Authority to oversee, in a professional competent way, the value-for-money and performance of local authorities.  There should also be a new section to deal with road openings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin will recall that in the Child Care Act discrepancies between &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; featured very prominently. In section 26 I cannot understand why the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister, &ldquo;may&rdquo; guarantee the funding.  It should read, &ldquo;shall&rdquo; guarantee the funding.  Section 28 deals with the membership of the Authority. I should like to see a specific mention of certain groups and I am open to suggestions as to which would be the most worthy.  However, I do not think that political hacks should be appointed to the Authority.  The Authority will be a multi-billion pound operation and, therefore, we must have people of the highest calibre and competence.  There is also need to represent ports and other strategic aspects of our infrastructural development. In section 30 consent of the Minister to staff transfers should not be obligatory.  Similarly in section 31 consent of the Minister should not be obligatory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1991" /> When the Department of Posts and Telegraphs ran our telecommunications and postal service, it was possible for employees or people involved with that Department to become Members of this House and of local authorities.  Section 34 (2) provides that where a person is even nominated as a candidate in a county council election, that person would immediately be precluded from having any association with the National Roads Authority.  Unless there is a very good argument why a person should not stand for election while he is an employee of the National Roads Authority, that provision is not necessary.  We will be considering very carefully the penalties, terms of disclosure of interest and confidential information in relation to tendering and so on.  We will be seeking a legal provision where a person would immediately have to resign his position on the Authority if there is breach of any of the provisions in these sections.</P>
    <P>Section 39 gives extraordinary powers to the Minister to do as he sees fit.  It provides that the Minister may give a direction in writing to the Authority in relation to any of the functions assigned to them by or under this Act and the Authority shall comply with the direction. It also states that the Minister may give policy, financial or other guidelines to the Authority in relation to the performance of the functions assigned to them.  If a literal interpretation is taken of section 39, all the other sections would seem highly irrelevant in that the Authority would be a puppet of the Minister. It would be just a renaming of the existing roads section of the Department of the Environment.  I will certainly be seeking to ensure that that provision is modified or deleted.  While there should be general flexibility in order that we do not have to come back with new legislation every time extra powers are required, there is no need for the Minister to be able to wave a stick and give a direction to remove any of the functions of the Authority as he sees fit.</P>
    <P>In relation to protected roads, I understand that the Local Government (Roads <Col N="1992" /> and Motorways) Act, 1974, is being amended.  I would like a proper definition of a protected road, how it varies from existing roads and whether all public roads will be defined as protected roads. Section 43 deals with this matter, but it is not clear from that section what category of road is referred to.</P>
    <P>In relation to the start-up time of the Authority I have referred to the fact that it took four years, from the time Fianna Fáil first promised this Bill, for the Bill to be brought before the House.  There is a question as to when the Authority would come into being.  I believe that a deadline of 1 March should be clearly set out in the legislation.  I support all the aspects relating to implementation of European Directives on environmental impact assessments and so on.  Section 15 relates to the acquisition of land and is a matter of concern.  Local authorities should retain a reserved function in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have received representations from the engineers' association that there should be a clear legal provision for lane rental for the period under which construction works are carried out.  There is no legal provision for this at present. There should be a fixed period during which the part of the roadway on which the works are being carried out would be transferred to the developer or constructor. I referred earlier to the service areas which are dealt with under section 52 of the Bill.  I would like to know what is included in this section.  Are we talking about catering facilities, chip vans or other large vehicles?  What exactly is envisaged?</P>
    <P>We will be opposing nearly all of Part V of the Bill.  Toll roads should not be a back door to new taxation given the existing appalling levels of VAT, excise duty and other taxation.  We will be seeking to insert a new section to provide that it will be an offence if an animal, including a horse, is found wandering on the road, given the appalling accidents that result from stray animals, and the owner will be held responsible.</P>
    <P>My party have taken a very constructive attitude to this Bill.  We believe <Col N="1993" /> it has fundamental flaws.  The opportunity has not been taken to co-ordinate transport policy in that there is no reference to one Minister dealing with all transport matters.  Now is the time to do this.  Roads, aviation, haulage, shipping and ports should come under one Department.</P>
    <P>We need to refer to the decline of our railways and ensure that all future EC programmes include funding for rail-ways, unlike the present programme which does not provide one penny for railways outside Dublin.  There should be a natural roads and rail authority to deal with that issue.  There should be a clear timetable for investment and a programme should be set up to bring our roads up to European standards.</P>
    <P>I have outlined in chapter and verse how the previous Minister and this Government have failed to do anything other than substitute EC funds to shore up their own budgetary position.  They did not use these once-off funds to the benefit of a lasting infrastructure.  Instead they breached the principle of additionality. We will be supporting the Bill on Second Stage even though there are fundamental flaws in it.  At the end of the day we want to ensure that we have the most modern and up-to-date transport infrastructure and a competitive transport sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Yates in wishing the new Minister for the Environment well &mdash; I hoped he would be here today.  There is a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> about the old team of Deputy Yates, the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, and me addressing this issue as we also spoke on Health for some time.  I hope our achievements in the environmental brief will be more rewarding, from the Opposition perspective, although in the health area we had our moments.  Perhaps the Minister of State will convey our good wishes to the Minister.  I hope that in his very difficult brief he will meet with some success.  In the initial week or two of his Ministry he has faced problems which obviously will have to be addressed <Col N="1994" />&mdash; I am referring to the funding of local authorities.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority Bill has been long promised and long awaited. Finally we have an opportunity to address the core issues of the main transport arteries.  I will begin by quoting from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreed between the Government and the social partners in January of this year.  The section headed &ldquo;Roads and National Development&rdquo; puts our position clearly enough.  It states:</P>
      <P>Roads are the predominant form of internal transport accounting for 96% of passenger travel and over 90% of freight travel.  National primary roads which represent less than 3% of the road network account for 26% of road traffic; two-thirds of traffic on national primary roads being work-related.  A review by the Department of the Environment estimated the long-term development of the road network would require an expenditure of approximately £9 billion, of which £3 billion related to national primary roads.  Roads are one of the few remaining areas of our national infrastructure that are seriously deficient and because of their dominant role in internal transport, investment in them is essential to improving the competitiveness of the Irish economy <i>vis-à-vis</i> other EC member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a truism that Ireland is an island and during the course of 1993 when the channel tunnel is completed we will become the only remaining island nation in the EC.  All other EC member states will have direct rail links with other member states for the conduct of trade, importing and exporting goods.  It is quite clear that we will have to address this fundamental problem in the context of our rate of unemployment which stands at 265,000 people, one of the highest percentage rates of unemployment in the EC.  People over the age of 60 years and those on training courses are discounted from the figure of unemployed so as to ensure we do not have an unacceptably high unemployment figure.  There is a <Col N="1995" /> strongly held view that next year we will have an unemployment figure of 300,000 people and it is clear that we will need to have a very comprehensive solution to that problem.  Transport is an integral part of that solution.</P>
    <P>Access transport costs a huge amount of money and places an inordinate burden on the business community of this country.  It has already been pointed out that we are a trading nation and are more dependent than countries like Britain, Japan or the United States on our export earnings.  Access transport is a fundamental and crucial issue and was recognised as such in the National Development Plan which was submitted by the Irish Government to the EC in March 1989.  I should like to quote the following extract from that document:</P>
    <P>It is estimated that transport costs for Irish exporters to Europe account for between 9 per cent and 10 per cent of export sales values and that these costs are approximately twice those incurred by Community countries trading with one another on the European mainland.  This cost penalty applies to the great bulk of Ireland's international trade not only exports but also imports of materials and capital goods.</P>
    <P>Last week during the debate on the Maastricht Summit, we discussed the implications of the completion of the internal market and the next phase of European development and integration, where we move, as the Charter states, towards ever closer union.  That ever closer union may well be a fact of life for the other member states but it is not a fact of life for us, hampered as we are by the very inadequate and costly access routes to our EC partners.</P>
    <P>We will have to have very clear coherent policies if the objective of cohesion that we spoke about for two days last week, and which the Taoiseach has put as the foremost essential objective of our demands at Maastricht, is to be achieved. In a statement earlier this year, the EC Commissioner for Regional Policy, Mr. Bruce Millan pointed out as a result of <Col N="1996" /> studies carried out by his directorate in the Community that the average GDP per head of population ratio of the ten most prosperous regions in the Community is two-and-a-half to three times greater than the average GDP per head of population ratio in the ten poorest. There is a huge gap between the wealth of the poorest and the wealth of the richest in the Community.  This gap is not narrowing; in fact, it is widening and many of the measures we will take will exacerbate this.  What must be at the core of this debate is a mechanism in the transport field to offset that inequality.</P>
    <P>We have to start on the basis that this legislation deals with one sector of the problem, namely road transport.  We are not dealing with our national roads system in a comprehensive way but with 6 per cent of it to be exact.  Of course this is a crucial 6 per cent, it is the life blood of our business community.  It is the mechanism we have to get our goods to the ferryports and from there on to our markets abroad.  We cannot deal with the problem if we talk in terms of road transport in isolation.</P>
    <P>It has long been said that we need an integrated transport policy and not one that suggests that the high cost of transport and our isolation from the market can be addressed by solving the problem of road transport alone.  That will not be the case.  If we manage, as I hope we do, to have the best internal transport system in the world which will get our goods to the ferryports, we still need to solve problems in our ferryports and access difficulties from there on or we will still be at nought.</P>
    <P>A number of issues need to be addressed and I hope they will be addressed in an integrated way.  I had hoped for clearer proposals on an integrated transport policy dealing not only with the issue of our main national arteries but with our railway system.  Those who listened to the radio this morning will have heard people express their frustration with our inadequate rail service.  We have the ridiculous situation that on mainline routes there is a speed restriction to a maximum of 50 miles per hour.  Indeed, in parts of <Col N="1997" /> the country tracks are being taken up to strengthen tracks on another route.  The system is being cannibalised instead of trying to put into place a decent rail transport system.  It would certainly be cost effective in terms of land usage and of its impact on the environment.  Rail transport is infinitely more efficient and sensitive to the environment than road transport yet Government policy basically ignores the whole issue of rail transport. That is to our eternal shame.</P>
    <P>No significant State funds or, more particularly, funds provided under the sub-programme on peripherality of the EC are being invested in our rail system. A transport solution that addresses roads in isolation is incomplete and unacceptable and will untimately fail to meet the real threats to this country.  The real threat is that our life blood, our young people will be sucked out of this country into the heart of job rich wealthy Europe. That will continue at an exacerbated pace if we do not address the issues I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The management of our national roads programme is important.  The National Roads Authority were established on an interim non-statutory basis on 20 July 1988 and the promised legislation to put them on a statutory footing was promised a long time ago.  I have said in the past that we have suffered greatly from a patchwork approach to our national roads system.  We could all instance cases in which an efficient, progressive, development-led local authority that handled their road system well, were situated adjacent to a local authority that were not so good in that regard, resulting immediately in a bottleneck.</P>
    <P>The analogy establishing a national artery of roads must be the national grid for electricity, the national gas pipeline or the efforts put in from the mid-1970s onwards in establishing a national telecommunications link.  A telecommunications link was co-ordinated, resourced and was put up as a priority. In the mid 1970s Ireland moved from having one of the most backward telecommunications systems to one of the <Col N="1998" /> best systems in the world by having a co-ordinated interlinked system and a resource commitment towards achieving that goal.  The roads system requires nothing less.  It requires professional co-ordination and very significant sums of money in order to achieve that.</P>
    <P>I have said that different bottlenecks cannot be allowed to thwart the objective of a smooth roads network.  For example, those of us from the south-east know that until very recently it was very frustrating trying to travel from Wexford or Rosslare to Cork.  There was a very good roads system for most of that journey, but there was a narrow band in the middle of Kilkenny county where the road was not a priority.  The result was a horrendous road from New Ross to Waterford.  That stretch of road was in the care of Kilkenny County Council and the road was not a priority for them &mdash; it was a link between Waterford, Cork and Wexford but since it was not a link for Kilkenny the county council neglected it for a long time.  I am thankful that that problem has finally been remedied.  Such bottlenecks occur throughout the country, and I believe there is a need for co-ordination and clear planning.  Obviously, none of that work could be done without proper resources, either.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates mentioned the position in another EC country, Denmark.  I should also like to comment on the position in Denmark because that country is a reasonable example for Ireland to study closely.  I shall not deal with the integrated transport ministry Deputy Yates talked about but it is something I support very strongly.  That is what I mean when I say Ireland needs an integrated transport policy led by an integrated transport ministry that knows what it wants to achieve and knows that it does not do that in isolation but in an integrated way.</P>
    <P>I wish to talk about the way the roads system in Denmark is structured.  Denmark is a small EC country like ours and it has many of the same problems in relation to resources.  It is not gas rich or rich in other resources and it is a very <Col N="1999" /> large agricultural producer, like ourselves. Thus, Denmark is a good country to study.</P>
    <P>Under the Danish Road Act, 1972, national roads were divided into three categories.  Category 1 consisted of 4,600 kilometres of main roads, which included the motorways.  That national road network is administered by the Road Directorate, which would be the equivalent of a National Roads Authority and which operates as an integral part of the Transport Ministry.  The Roads Directorate has a statutory basis for its operation and for its financing.  The second category of roads is 6,500 kilometres of regional roads, administered by 14 regional authorities. The 55,500 kilometres of local roads fall into the third category, those roads being administered by Denmark's 275 local authorities.</P>
    <P>To go slightly off at a tangent, it is interesting that there are 275 local authorities, sub-regional authorities, in a country such as Denmark, which is geographically much smaller than ours.  Note should be taken of that fact when the House tries to nobble some of our own small local authorities in other measures that have been threatened, or promised, will come before the House.</P>
    <P>Each of the previously mentioned levels of public administration in Denmark is responsible for the roads network that is assigned to it within the mandate received from central Government.  The responsibility of administration is properly resourced.  Denmark provides a reasonable model for Ireland to examine. The National Roads Authority would have responsibility for the main artery roads and they would have proper resources to put the framework together; the regional roads would be the subject of the new regional authorities which will, it is to be hoped, be set up now that the Local Government Act is the law of the land, and county roads would be the responsibility of county councils.</P>
    <P>I now wish to talk about county roads. The state of most of our county roads is nothing short of scandalous.  The issue is horrendous, with engineers pulling their <Col N="2000" /> hair trying to put a patch together to make roads passable.  In desperation, many local authorities have threatened to simply abandon county roads and put up a sign: &ldquo;This road has been abandoned by your local authority.  Progress at your own peril.&rdquo;  The national roads issue needs to be rectified and, as I say repeatedly, it cannot be addressed in isolation. Transport must be the issue, and it must be addressed in an integrated fashion.</P>
    <P>A cycle of resurfacing county roads that varies from 25 years to 40 years in some instances is completely unacceptable. The level of frustration among the general public is clear.  Several counties indicated that the electorate would not stand idly by and allow communities to become isolated, to be physically cut off, or to be forced to take extraordinary, roundabout routes when trying to do their business and get on with their daily lives.  The county roads system has to be examined.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at the percentage of expenditure on roads.  Under the EC sub-peripherality expenditure programme on all transport modes, 62 per cent of the money spent goes towards the national primary roads.  The balance is divided between all the other kinds of transport, from regional airports to regional and county roads, with 13 per cent of the total going on non-national roads.  That position needs to be remedied. We should remember the old saying, a stitch in time saves nine.  The neglect of the county roads system will be extremely expensive in years to come because when the fabric of the roads is destroyed we will no longer be talking about the surfacing of roads but about building roads from scratch.  Unfortunately, that is a problem now faced by many local authorities.</P>
    <P>People should not have to hope that a representative from their local county becomes Minister for the Environment in order that their roads might be saved, which message came across this morning. Every county deserves to be treated in like manner.</P>
    <P>I wish to make another point in relation to county roads.  I do not mind being <Col N="2001" /> parochial on occasion and I think Deputy Yates shares a certain sense of frustration that County Wexford came at the bottom of the list of county road grants per kilometre&mdash;</P>

      <P>Wexford, as a county, has decided that county roads are a priority. Always we have funded them substantially from own resources, I might add own resources that were extraordinarily scarce, but we cannibalised and attacked other programmes so that we would have sufficient money to maintain our county roads at some standard. The principle seems to have been, the more money one spends on roads the less one receives from central Government. That is not a very good principle because counties who decided that as they were not receiving a sufficient grant from central Government, they would not spend money on county roads.  Now it appears those counties are to be praised and rewarded for their inattention while counties that endeavoured, with totally inadequate resources, to maintain their county roads system are disadvantaged. I hope the Minister of State will take note of that and endeavour to do something about it.  I had digressed slightly to deal with county roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to revert to the main focus of the Bill which is, of course, the main roads system.  Under this Bill the <Col N="2002" /> National Roads Authority will have overall responsibility for planning and supervising, construction and improvement of the national roads network, not necessarily a bad thing.  They will be required to have a plan for the development of national roads.  Obviously, they will have to overcome any existing bottlenecks, and there are many.  I hope when the National Roads Authority are established, they will have regard to existing bottlenecks and, rather than looking at grandiose plans for designing new roads from scratch, they will examine the current roads system and ascertain where limited expenditure can have tremendous results in terms of eliminating perhaps a few hundred yards of bottlenecks existing on virtually all our main roads.  It should be a priority of the National Roads Authority to draw up a plan of action to eliminate narrow bottlenecks.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority will have a number of other functions.  One will be to promote the case for EC assistance, another, on the financial side, will be to borrow in respect of the national roads system and the third in the financial area &mdash; which will raise a few eyebrows &mdash; will be to take upon themselves the issue of tolling roads where they deem it appropriate.  Let me deal with those three functions briefly.</P>
    <P>The EC assistance requirement is a good thing in that it will mean somebody with a function, a clear view and singular responsibility, will be making a case to the EC for funding for the roads system, but it should not be by way of direct access.  Obviously the National Roads Authority will have a role to play in terms of national roads but I contend their rate should be slotted into an integrated transport plan; it should not be the be all and end all in itself.  The fundamental weakness of this overall strategy is that the roads system is supposed to solve our transport problems whereas I patently and clearly state that it will not.  It is a mistake on many fronts &mdash; the jobs front, about which I spoke, the business front and the environmental front &mdash; to put all our eggs into this basket, as we have done for a very long time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2003" /> The EC plan on roads should comprise one segment of a jigsaw which includes a clear funding mechanism and lobby group for the railway system, for the development of our regional airports and for the development of our ports.  It should be placed before the EC in a coherent, clear manner.  The notion that we have a super strong lobby group for the roads disadvantages the other transport areas which is not in our national interests.  In respect of borrowing I hope the National Roads Authority will not turn out to be another mechanism or vehicle for the Government to borrow money simply to avoid the odium of the State borrowing, it being transferred or converted to a State agency borrowing.</P>
    <P>The serious reservation I have on the third front would be with tolling.  We have a resistance to the notion of tolls, certainly on national routes; we have had no tradition of it in recent centuries.  I predict there will be very strong resistance to the concept of tolling if it is taken from local elected members.  That is fundamentally wrong, undemocratic and, I predict, will spawn public resistance. Again, it follows the pattern about which I spoke in relation to the Local Government Bill, indeed in relation to virtually every Bill with which we have dealt in recent years, which is to erode the job, functions and responsibility of local elected members because we are afraid of them.  I do not think it would be appropriate that tolls be decided by the National Roads Authority.  That should be a job reserved for local authority members, as it is at present.  The Labour Party will viciously resist this proposal on Committee Stage should the Bill reach that stage.  I contend it is a fundamental flaw of the Bill.  I hope the Minister will think again because, if that proposal is carried, he will be giving a very large stick to beat anybody who wishes to toll any project.</P>
    <P>I would be willing to examine the issue of tolling as it obtains in the case of the two bridges that exist.  I do not think there is any public resistance to them because, first, they were a private venture <Col N="2004" /> and, second there are alternate routes, but, when one imposes a toll on a route to which there is no practical or convenient alternative, one is on a slippery slope to great resistance.  Any decision in relation to that matter should be for the local elected councillors in the areas concerned. I want to give a very clear signal to the Minister now that the Labour Party will be opposing that principle on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Another function of the new National Roads Authority will be in relation to signs.  The issue of signs on roads is an important one warranting clear attention. Deputy Yates and I represent a county favoured with having a very successful port.  Last year, for example, 1.1 million people used Rosslare Harbour, a significant number of those having taken the N11 to Dublin and the N25 to the West.  In such circumstances, with a large tourist market, of course one will endeavour to arrest or attract some of those tourists into bed and breakfasts, local restaurants, cultural centres, shops etc.  The plethora of signs on our national roads were a traffic hazard because people, trying to read the signs, were not paying attention they should have been as they drove their vehicles and, second, they were extraordinarily unsightly.  By and large, Wexford County Council have eliminated that problem but, unfortunately, other counties have not been as efficient.  There is need for a clear national policy on road signs, what is acceptable and what is not.  We have guidelines in terms of new finger-post signs, which are colour-coded and, once people become familiar with them, are meant to be clear.  I fear that regulation is honoured more in the breach than in the observance.  There is a clear need to improve the whole sign mechanism, to co-ordinate signs.</P>
    <P>There is a problem now with many towns which are by-passed.  There are ring roads around many towns nationwide with many more planned, ring roads which are absolutely essential if traffic is to move with any degree of efficiency and if communities are not to be choked to death by fumes from vehicles back to <Col N="2005" /> back on narrow urban streets.  Obviously, I welcome the many by-passes, nonetheless, there is need for a balance to be struck between by-passing towns and communities and starving them of any economic commerce.  We need to devise a co-ordinated mechanism that allows the advertising of the existence of some of these towns and villages on a national basis.</P>
    <P>I know other Members want to speak but I want to deal as quickly as I can with a number of other issues.  What I am endeavouring to do is put down a series of markers and observations so that I can elaborate further on Committee Stage, but I hope these will be noted and addressed. The concept of protected roads is of their being a halfway house between ordinary roads and motorways.  What exactly are they?  The new categorising of roads is less than clear.  I hope the Minister will say clearly how he proposes to designate roads.  There is a number of roads which should be declared national primaries.  Will the national secondaries become primary roads?</P>
    <P>I welcome the putting of EC Directive 337 of 1985 on a statutory basis.  The requiring of an environmental impact assessment in respect of any proposed road is welcome.  It is already the practice but it is right to use this opportunity to put it into legislation.  The Minister's predecessor had experience in his county of difficulties in securing community agreement on road plans.  It is desirable to achieve consensus in these matters.  I do not believe we can steamroll through a community at will.  No Minister or authority should be able to do it.  It is for the local elected representatives to listen to the views and wishes of the people they represent and to take a democratic decision.  I hope the issue of the siting of roads will not be the exclusive prerogative of the Authority but that it will require a degree of consultation and the positive acceptance of the democratic local council who represent the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the power in the Bill to provide cycle-ways.  Although we have produced cyclists of world renown, we <Col N="2006" /> do not provide great facilities for them. Anyone visiting any other Community country will find great cycle-ways which enable people to cycle without the risk of being run over by a juggernaut.  Holland is exemplary in this matter.  I do not suppose we will get to the stage of having bicycle paths and routes exclusively for bicycles but we could go some way towards allowing people to cycle safely by providing cycle-ways, especially at a time when the value of cycling and exercise generally are greatly appreciated.</P>
    <P>I welcome the prohibition on temporary dwellings in section 66 and the prohibition on the use of unauthorised vehicles and caravans for trading.  I feel strongly about two issues in this regard. The first is the issue of professional traders. A number of people, who set themselves up as professional traders, operate from their vans.  They do not pay proper taxes, do not pay wages or charges and contribute virtually nothing to the Exchequer at local or national level. They also compete with established traders. This is wrong and we must do something about it.  A company in the north of my county who produce metal gates for farms are being put under severe threat by cowboy tradespeople selling substandard gates from the back of vans at crossroads.  That company pay tax, pay their employees and their PRSI contributions and pay VAT, but obviously they cannot compete with traders who pay nothing and sell many gates at the side of the road for half price.  We will have to address that issue.  I hope this Bill will at least get rid of them from the national primary roads.  It is not a solution but it is an issue which can be addressed at this level.</P>
    <P>Another category of trader has been mentioned by Deputy Yates.  I refer to those who sell seasonal produce such as strawberries, raspberries and new potatoes.  It is traditional in certain parts of the country to see in early summer the strawberry sellers setting up.  It adds a lovely ambiance and it is very pleasant for tourists to see fresh fruit, vegetables and honey on sale by the roadside.  We need some mechanism to allow that to <Col N="2007" /> continue, as long as it is consistent with road safety.  Sometimes it can cause a problem and I suggest we devise a licensing mechanism whereby the engineering staff of the local county council would approve a site on a straight stretch of road where cars could safely pull in.  This would add to the ambiance of travelling in the summer.  In addressing the problem of people setting up shop on the side of the road I hope we do not kill off such a desirable seasonal activity.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 67 which devolves powers to local authorities to deal with dangerous trees and structures.  I welcome the statutory obligation being placed on landowners to deal with this serious problem.  In recent years we have had stronger winds and there has been a number of serious accidents and some fatalities because of fallen trees.  Most county councils have carried out an inventory of dangerous trees and structures adjacent to our main roads system. That should be continued as a matter of urgency before we reach the heart of the winter.</P>
    <P>Before the Bill is enacted we should signal to local authorities that this work should be done.  The issue of cutting and trimming trees is important but it can be very contentious at local level.  A landowner may be cantankerous about removing a dangerous bough overhanging a road.  We must put safety first. Untrimmed shrubs at junctions can cause difficulty by obstructing the sight line but some truculent landowners will refuse to carry out the trimming, perhaps because they do not like the local authority or for some other obscure reason.  We need to bring the forces of law to bear on people who in any way make our road system less safe than it should be.</P>
    <P>I want to comment briefly on section 69 which relates to the extinguishment of public rights of way.  I know that all the Minister wants to do in this section is modify the existing arrangements under the 1963 Act and devolve the function to members of local authorities.  This is a good mechanism and I welcome it. However, I want to make one comment <Col N="2008" /> in relation to this issue.  I have long held this view but I have not had the opportunity previously to voice it.  Rights of way are a very important issue which has been very seriously neglected.  In recent years we have lost access to a huge number of areas because landowners have built walls or extended gates thereby blocking off rights of way people have had for generations.  Sometimes this is not noticed until a person who normally uses a right of way suddenly finds he cannot walk the path he has always walked.  I use this Bill as a vehicle to make this very strong point.  The right of access to places of interest which generations of people have walked and enjoyed is an integral part of our heritage. Unfortunately, these are increasingly disappearing.</P>
    <P>We in this House have to make a start on this important issue and say we want those rights of way vindicated.  I believe very strongly in this and I hope the Minister for the Environment will indicate to local authorities that they have a responsibility to act in the public interest to protect rights of way and that in any dispute or controversy their reponsibility is to protect the rights of the community. Too often due to a lack of resources, time and interest we do not take action and lose rights which as I have said have been enjoyed by generations of people.  I hope that point will be clearly accepted by the Minister and that he will take some action on it.  Maybe this will require amending legislation or tabling an amendment to this legislation in order to strengthen the hand of local authorities in relation to the vindication of that right.  Those of us who live in rural areas are very concerned about the constant erosion of rights which once they are extinguished can never again be re-established.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to the problem of wandering horses.  As I commented when he was speaking, he has had a very direct and personal interest in this matter, but it is one that needs to be addressed. Some of the legal-minded Members of this House might agree that it is ludicrous to have a law which provides that a stray horse which wanders on to your land is <Col N="2009" /> your responsibility when he is wandering off it: if he wanders off your land into a car or, more tragically, into a child walking past, you are responsible.  That is patently not fair and something should be done about it.  There are insufficient pounds, insufficient resources and insufficient provision made at local authority level to tackle the problem of wandering horses which unfortunately is becoming all too prevalent.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment briefly on the standing of the National Roads Authority. Deputy Yates referred briefly to this issue.  Will the Authority stand as a corporate entity on a stand-alone basis or will they be a sort of division of the Department of the Environment?  We need to know this.  They should certainly be subject to the Minister but not subject as if they were a section of the Department. They should be subject to the Minister only in so far as he is subject to this House and we, as an assembly, can have questions answered and have our fears expressed directly to them.  I think there is a growing frustration among Members of the House at the fact that when we establish an agency, body or semi-State sector we suddenly give away all our responsibility.  How many times have we put down parliamentary questions only to receive a letter from the Ceann Comhairle stating that the question is ruled out of order because the Minister has no responsibility in the matter, that it is a matter for a certain agency?  There is a democratic deficit, to use that much abused phrase in recent weeks, in relation to this issue.  I hope that there will be accountability in relation to the actions of the National Roads Authority should it be established by this and the other House.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority should have a clear policy role.  They should also have a role, subject to the Minister, in relation to the operation and planning of national roads.  I have referred already to the issue of compulsory purchase orders but I want to reinforce this point.  Local authorities must have primacy in these matters.  I do not believe we should give this responsibility to the National Roads <Col N="2010" /> Authority.  As I said in relation to disputes we have all witnessed in recent years, we have to bring the community with us and the mechanism best designed to do this is the will of the local community expressed through the locally elected council.  As a base, we should try to keep that as an acceptable principle. There may well be reasons when a local authority might be totally obtuse and obstructive and we might have to look again at the power given to them.  Some residual power should lie with the Minister in such cases but as a rule and principle it should be a matter for local authorities to decide on the routes of roads, particularly those which involve the compulsory purchase of land.</P>
    <P>I have already stressed the importance of transport and the need to have an integrated policy for growth.  I should like to refer briefly to a submission to the European Commission by the Socialist Group of the European Parliament and the Labour Party members on Dublin City and County Councils last month on transport development for economic growth in Dublin.  This tried in a coherent and clear way to put forward the policy options for a comprehensive and integrated transport policy for Dublin.  We need to have this on a national basis.  The needs of Dublin are certainly clear and we support the notion of a light rail system for Dublin city and not the butchering of Dublin to make way for the ever-increasing demands of motorcars. There have been some very welcome changes in attitude to this issue in Dublin City Council since the local elections and the change in personnel there.  I strongly believe that we need an integrated national transport plan.  We will not achieve this if we deal with roads in isolation. The needs not only from the perspectives of public policy, jobs and the economy but also from an environmental perspective, demand of us that we deal in a holistic way with this issue.</P>
    <P>I have notes on a section-by-section basis which I will not use at this stage.  I will reserve these for Committee Stage as it is important that other Members have an opportunity to contribute. <Col N="2011" /> Therefore, I give a guarded welcome to the Bill; I say &ldquo;guarded&rdquo;, as I believe it has very serious flaws which we have to address.  I have no doubt that the Minister will be true to his word in having serious regard for the wishes, observations and fears expressed by Members on all sides of the House during the course of this debate.  When replying I hope he will show a willingness to accept fundamental change.  I will be listening to his response to Second Stage with great interest.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with 6 per cent of our roads.  The whole issue of a transport policy should not hang and rest on 6 per cent of our national roads in isolation from the rest of the roads system and in isolation from the rest of the transport options which are available.  I hope the issue of local democracy I mentioned will be addressed and not further eroded as is intended by some of the provisions of the Bill.  I hope it will be possible to build a consensus towards having a rational decent transport system that will benefit the whole community and allow Ireland to thrive in the integrated Community of tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank Deputy Howlin for yielding right-of-way at this stage of the debate, and resisting the temptation to go through the Bill section by section, thus enabling me to make a contribution.  He spoke eloquently about rights-of-way.  Deputy Howlin, Deputy Andrews, and I am sure the Minister, will be interested to know that last night Dún Laoghaire Borough Council became the first local authority to adopt a plan on rights-of-way under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  That little piece of history has some relevance to the topic under discussion this evening.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann believing&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  that the transport needs of the country require a co-ordinated <Col N="2012" /> national transport policy which would place greater emphasis on the development and promotion of public transport,</P>
    <P>(2)  that the priority should therefore be the establishment of a National Transport Authority rather than a simple Roads Authority,</P>
    <P>(3)  that the proposed National Roads Authority would severely diminish the capacity of elected local councillors and local communities to influence decisions regarding the development of roads, including decisions regarding tolling,</P>
    <P>(4)  that the proposed National Roads Authority will facilitate the privatisation of road maintenance with consequent job losses in local authorities,</P>
    <P>declines to give a second reading to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are suggesting the Dáil decline to give a second reading to the Bill because as both previous speakers have said there are fundamental issues and flaws in this Bill which require to be addressed.  The Minister in his opening remarks stated that the Bill had two purposes: to establish the National Roads Authority on a statutory basis and to update the law regarding public roads.  In so far as the Bill is dealing with the updating of some of the laws in relation to public roads I do not think there will be a great deal of dispute about it.  The main purpose of the Bill is to establish the National Roads Authority on a statutory basis and that has to be questioned from the point of view of principle and the fact that it is the core issue of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Last week, Dublin City Council dropped their plans for the controversial Eastern By-pass.  Yesterday Dún Laoghaire Borough Council initiated steps to drop the controversial St. Helen's motorway from their plans and earlier this year Dublin County Council decided against tolling the new Dublin Ring Road around the north-west and south of the city.  If this Bill is passed the National Roads <Col N="2013" /> Authority will be able to override these decisions by the democratically elected councils.  Under this Bill the National Roads Authority can, and probably will, build the Eastern By-pass, despite the objections of Dublin City Council and of local people.  The National Roads Authority can, and probably will, build the controversial St. Helen's motorway which will destroy Booterstown marsh. The National Roads Authority can, and probably will, place tolls on the new ring motorway around the city.  The National Roads Authority will not even have to apply for planning permission for the construction of new roads so that local authorities and local communities will have little influence on their actions.  The National Roads Authority will be able to give instructions to democratically elected councils.  The National Roads Authority will tee up the privatisation of road maintenance and probably cause thousands of redundancies in local authorities as a result.  The National Roads Authority will be hand-picked by the Minister for the Environment and their term of office will be determined by the Minister.  They will have no accountability to the Dáil, to local councils or to local communities.</P>
    <P>This Bill will do nothing to tackle the appalling state of this country's roads.  It will not fill a single pothole, repair a single set of traffic lights or reinstate a single footpath.  Instead, it will turn the private road builders lobby into an arm of Government, it will give them easier access to EC Structural Funds, it will cut out what they consider to be irritating delays caused by local communities or environmental organisations raising their concerns about road projects.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a make-believe consultation with the public but the new National Roads Authority will have all the power.  This Bill is an assault on local democracy.  It is taking away the functions of local authorities to plan, design and maintain national roads and it gives the Minister for the Environment the powers to allocate any other road he wishes to the roads authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill will allow the Authority to borrow up to £500 million &mdash; more than <Col N="2014" /> any other public organisation in the State.  The Bill will undermine the rights of local communities and environmental organisations who up to now have been able, with some success, to lobby their local councillors about road plans.  The local councils will no longer have the power and the National Roads Authority will not even have to apply for planning permission to build new roads.  Surprisingly, this Bill has received little public attention so far.  Perhaps councils, local communities and the environmental movement do not yet realise how draconian this proposed legislation is.  It is one of the most anti-democratic measures to come before this House in a long time.  If it is not stopped it will rob the people of whatever limited say they have over their local environment.  This Bill is a road builders charter.  In one go it sets aside over ten years of public controversy over major road plans, it upstages the debate about the balance between public and private transport and it endangers the interests of local communities, local authority workers and the public.  In my view it is a Bill which should be faced up to on Second Stage.  For that reason The Workers' Party propose that the Dáil should decline to give a second reading to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The fundamental question that has to be addressed is, why do we need a National Roads Authority?  Both Deputies Yates and Howlin in their respective contributions spoke about the need for an integrated transport policy here.  That is a view with which I concur. We need an integrated transport policy. To give effect to an integrated transport policy we need a national transport authority who would have responsibility not just for the roads element of transport but for the other elements in the transport fabric &mdash; the elements which have been referred to already, air transport, sea transport, rail transport and so on. Instead what is being proposed is the establishment of a National Roads Authority, with very significant powers, who will have responsibility for roads.</P>
    <P>At worst, the establishment of a national roads authority will erode the <Col N="2015" /> say of the public and of local authorities with regard to roads, it will clear the way for roads to be constructed against the wishes of the public, for tolls to be placed not just on new roads but on existing roads, and will clear the way for the privatisation of roads maintenance.  At best a National Roads Authority inserts yet another layer of bureaucracy between local authorities who will at least continue to have some function in relation to non-national roads and the Department of the Environment who at the end of the day will have responsibility for the provision of finance.  That, presumably, will add to administration costs, will delay the processing of applications for road funding and will do nothing to tackle the real issue that is, the state of the existing roads network.</P>
    <P>There is a case for an integrated transport policy and for the establishment of a national transport authority to give effect to that policy.  The fact that within the week the Maastricht Summit will take place was mentioned.  We had a two day debate in this House last week on the implications for this country of the completion of the Single Market and the development of economic, monetary and political union in the European Community.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that following the completion of the Channel Tunnel Ireland will be the only sea blocked member state of the European Community, the only member state without road access to the rest of the market. Emphasis has been placed on the implications of that for Irish industry and its competitiveness.  It has been stated that transport costs contribute 9 per cent to industry's costs and that that is twice the average in the rest of the Community. That in itself is not a case for the establishment of a National Roads Authority. That is a case for addressing the difficulties in transport between this country and the rest of the Community rather than necessarily within this country.  In that respect there are many issues which require attention, for instance, the problem of air transport.  There is a big nettle <Col N="2016" /> to be grasped in relation to the Shannon stop over and so far the Government have shown a marked reluctance to grasp it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to the extent to which constituency and local considerations contribute to policy making in this country, before he went on to talk about strawberries and roadside trading and galloping horses in Enniscorthy.  The Deputy is right in many respects.  It seems that constituency and local considerations are preventing both wings of the Government from facing up to the issue of the Shannon stop over.  The development of regional and local airports, shipping, and our peripherality and competitive disadvantage due to our transport system are, for understandable reasons, occupying the minds of the Confederation of Irish Industry.  Deputy Yates quoted the CII to suit his argument; I will quote the CII in support of my argument.  The CII Newsletter of 13 August 1991, under the heading &ldquo;Shipping &mdash; the missing link in the transport chain&rdquo; says:</P>
    <P>The cost of transporting goods from Ireland to the main EC markets is, at nine per cent of export values, twice that of our international competitors. Policies have been established by the Government, and Structural Funds secured, for investment in transport infrastructure, particularly roads, ports and airports.  The missing link is access capacity by sea.  Vessels currently operating on the main routes are unsuited in size, cellular configuration and speed to match the needs of industry in 1991 and beyond.</P>
    <P>It goes on to argue that:</P>
    <P>investment in this area is an integral part of the transport infrastructure system linking Ireland with the rest of the Community in the same way that roads and rail-ways are regarded between continental Member States.</P>
    <P>This country has a disastrous position in relation to shipping which arises mainly, although not exclusively, from the liquidation of Irish Shipping some <Col N="2017" /> years ago &mdash; a matter that has not been adequately explained or addressed. There is the question of port policy.  If I may be forgiven for raising a constituency interest, there is considerable local concern in my constituency about the future of the car ferry at Dún Laoghaire.  We are aware that in Government circles, there is a lot of discussion about port policy in the greater Dublin area and for some time now the Government have been pressed to address that question. Are they going to concentrate all the investment in the development of port facilities at Dublin Port, or work out a strategy which will provide for goods and freight to be moved through Dublin and passengers to be moved mainly through Dún Laoghaire?  This is an area that should be addressed.</P>
    <P>We also need to address the transport problems in Dublin, including the problem of roads which has already been mentioned. A few weeks ago we had a major consultancy report commissioned by the Dublin Transportation Review Group suggesting that the past two decades have been more or less wasted and that there is an urgent need to devise an integrated transport system for the traffic choked capital city.  Again, the emphasis is on an integrated approach to transport.  The report stated:</P>
    <P>The vision must be a shared one and, therefore, needs to be established by consultation with Government and businesses but, most importantly, with the general public.  Many cities have learned that even the best strategy will not come to fruition without a consensus of acceptance (among the citizens).</P>
    <P>The emphasis in that study is on the need for an integrated approach to transport policy and on the need for consultation in order to bring the people with us.</P>
    <P>Outside the Dublin area, there is the question of the balance between rail transport and road transport.  There is a debate about the extent to which transport should be private or public and what mix is appropriate.  Within that context roads are clearly important.  I am not for <Col N="2018" /> one moment making a case against road improvements or road development.  I go along with much of what Deputy Yates said in relation to the problems that have arisen, the delays and the frustration created by by-passing towns and the improvement of some of our main national roads.  All these arguments do not justify the establishment of a National Roads Authority outside the context of transport policy.  We cannot establish a roads authority and leave the rest of the problems without any authority or co-ordination, and apparently with little or no Government policy or action on them.  When most people here address themselves to the problem of roads, their interest is primarily in the maintenance of existing roads or in upgrading non-national roads.</P>
    <P>The pothole problem has given rise in one county to the emergence of a very significant political movement. The establishment of a National Roads Authority will not resolve the problem of potholes. What will resolve the problem of potholes is the making available of funds to local authorities to enable them to maintain the road network they have.  It is significant that this debate is taking place at a time when local authorities are addressing themselves to their annual estimates.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose there is nobody in a better position to address the issue of young people in our society than one who represents the constituency of Dublin West.  There are probably more <Col N="2019" /> young members in our constituency than in any other constituency in the country.</P>
      <P>Dublin West embraces what were a number of County Dublin villages at the commencement of the seventies.  The constituency was expanded in the early eighties to take in that densely populated area of Ballyfermot.  Out in the county Lucan-Clondalkin and Blanchardstown, two of the three new satellite towns, Tallaght being the third, were put forward by the then county council as three new satellite towns with a projected population of 100,000 by 1991.  As we address this issue here this evening, Tallaght has a population in excess of 80,000, Lucan-Clondalkin over 60,000 and the greater Blanchardstown area close to 50,000. Within those populations the demographics highlight the very large teenage population and the whole age structure of that horseshoe on the west side of Dublin.</P>
      <P>That leads one to identify and endeavour to meet the challenges that this vast young dynamic population throw up to the political system, to the local authorities, to the educational systems and all the relevant bodies that have a responsibility to provide the framework within which our young people can express their talents and abilities.</P>
      <P>There is great fragmentation in what I will call the direct line of responsibility for coping with the challenges, the difficulties and the provision of opportunities for young people.  This fragmentation is of great concern to anybody representing a large constituency where last week the Minister for Justice, in a reaction to a very serious teenage disturbance that arose in my constituency, responded with the appointment of a task force to look at the problems in the urban areas.  These disturbances stemmed from the difficulties of a small but very vigorous group of young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can try to identify the problems and ask why we are having this task force. One must ask if there is anything in Deputy Deenihan's Bill, if there is anything in what the Minister has been attempting to achieve.  In trying to cope <Col N="2020" /> with the challenges of responding to the young people's demands we find, looking back over the last decade, that our talented young people have been fortunate. There has been a reasonably high success rate of securing employment.  Unfortunately large numbers of our talented young people have left our shores.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey and Deputy Deenihan have been very active in this area over quite a long period. This exodus is more obvious in the rural constituencies.  In the greater Dublin area emigration from constituencies seems to go unnoticed until one goes knocking on doors to discover the parents are highlighting this aspect.</P>
    <P>All of this leaves young people with a sense of hopelessness, a sense of no real future, a future without real opportunities. Having sat on the boards of management in a number of post-primary schools and colleges and having looked at the whole area of FÁS apprenticeships and third level education, I find that there tends to be fragmentation and a need for some sort of cohesion.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House cannot accept the Bill because of the aspects already articulated by the Minister. However, the fact that Deputy Deenihan has brought this Bill before the House gives us the opportunity to discuss this matter and that is welcome.  I hope that at the end of the debate some new positive ideas will have emerged that will help us to make progress on this very challenging matter.</P>
    <P>In the likes of the north Clondalkin area, probably 4,000 to 5,000 of a population of 20,000 are teenagers.  Many of them have met the statutory requirement and have concluded their formal education. Because of the lack of openings and apprenticeships many of the young people, boys particularly, find it difficult to get a foot on the first rung of the ladder of employment.  There are these short snappy FÁS courses that tide young people over, enable them to gain some experience and stream them for employment which will possibly, but only possibly, emerge.  If one visits the FÁS centres in Ballyfermot or Tallaght one discovers <Col N="2021" /> that their success rate after the courses is not as good as one would like because the opportunities are not there.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency there is a debate emerging regarding the provision of services and facilities for young people.  Can we truthfully say that the limited resources that are being provided are being directed to the right areas?  We must look brutally at the limited funds and direct them accordingly.  In Dublin County Council some years ago we were discovering a demand for resources for indoor sporting activities for the young population in various parts of the county. Very glossy well presented proposals were coming forward from parts of the county that were fairly adequately provided for anyway.  However, because they had the local architect or bank manager or other professional on the committee in particular communities their comprehensive submission was much better researched and had a much better chance of raising the local contributions so that those projects got approval.</P>
    <P>However, the large local authority housing estates that were a reaction to a centre city housing crisis were being neglected.  In these areas where seven-eighths of the homes were built and owned by Dublin Corporation, officialdom and elected members were not responding by endeavouring to provide the assistance necessary.  Eventually we devised what were called the CODAN areas with the intention of weighting the spending of our limited resources on community projects in those areas.  I suggest that we agree, collectively, that whatever national lottery moneys or other resources are made available they should be directed, perhaps in a three year programme, towards the provision of proper facilities and back-up services in those areas most in need of them.  Each of us has received demands in respect of very worthy projects from clubs in our constituencies, such as the local rugby club, GAA club and so on.  However, we will have to concentrate on providing the limited resources available to those areas where a steel container, acting as a dressing room, would represent a major step <Col N="2022" /> forward and where other facilities to provide limited cover and protection should be provided as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will use the task force which has been set up recently to get across the message he has been pioneering while recognising, given the limited resources available, that we will always feel enough is not being done in this area.  I suggest that a financial package should be arranged for this task force, at the appropriate level, to allow them tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>While I may be moving away from the content of the Bill which Deputy Deenihan introduced, let me cite a number of examples in relation to the provision of facilities for young people.  What is required in large estates in County Dublin is a floodlit astro surface with proper dressingroom facilities, including showers, to allow young boys in those areas to dissipate their tremendous energy in street leagues and soccer competitions. This is what is needed by young teenagers in any community of over 1,000 houses.  However, these are not to be found in my constituency which perhaps contains as many as 20,000 young people.</P>
    <P>Indoor facilities are also limited and existing facilities have been provided by the local community with limited resources from the local authorities and possibly one-quarter of the amount required from national lottery funds.  We have a number of under-funded projects which are struggling and barely meeting the needs of the adult population in the area and they are certainly not adequate to meet the needs of the young teenage population.</P>
    <P>These leisure centres which may be provided by commercial companies in the Blanchardstown and north Clondalkin areas will include bowling and other indoor sporting facilities in addition to cinemas.  These are essential.  We must, however, tackle the difficulties which have arisen in Neilstown, in my constituency, head on and endeavour to provide facilities, not to accommodate the 50 blackguards or brats who cause problems but the other 4,950 who do not cause problems and who have been denied <Col N="2023" /> basic facilities which could be to hand. That is what we must attempt to achieve. There has been a proliferation of soccer clubs in my constituency.  I am sure the same has happened in your own constituency, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. People in County Dublin have given up their time to look after lads who play that game.  Local authority pitches have been provided but where is the coaching or scholarships which will provide an outlet for young people with talent in these communities?</P>
    <P>Much has been achieved in the sporting arena.  I call on the Minister of State with responsibility for sport to recognise that despite our best efforts to get the co-operation of the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI, to date no national stadium has been built.  Such a facility could be provided in my constituency.  With a little ingenuity and the support of the commercial sector, some practical proposals should emerge to provide not just a national stadium but recreational facilities which should be built around such a complex.  I sincerely hope such a complex could be provided between the satellite towns of Tallaght, Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown which will be accessible from the national primary network.  At such a facility teenagers could be used to set up competitions.  I believe that, with the commitment of our leading sports people, particularly during the summer months a range of sporting facilities could be provided in a complex built on a 100 acre site, scholarships could be provided and teenagers from all over the country could come there to compete.</P>
    <P>It is very worrying that qualified operatives cannot secure permanent employment. Opportunities and outlets should be provided for young unskilled and unqualified people so that they can find a place in the workplace.  As I said earlier, I have to deal with this problem more than any other Deputy given the age structure in the new urban areas.  I sincerely hope the task force will address this issue.  It must be very frustrating for Members on all sides that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has a committee <Col N="2024" /> reviewing industrial policy, who will not report before the end of the year, while the Taoiseach's Department also are chairing a task force on unemployment. We now have yet another task force whose function is to tackle what is already well known.  One often wonders why it has taken us so long to come up with firm, realistic and practical proposals to tackle some of these issues.  Why did we have to wait for 40 to 50 young brats in Neilstown to burn stolen cars, which necessitated the fire brigade being called, before we set up a task force?  It is obvious that we have had this problem for some time and there is plenty of information to hand, yet we had to wait for that national headline before we got that type of reaction.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the political system is on trial in those large urban areas.  The previous Government faced the same difficulties.  When the then Tánaiste and Minister for the Environment, Deputy Spring, recognised that major problems were beginning to emerge in large urban areas, particularly in County Dublin, he decided to appoint a development co-ordinator to co-ordinate activities to ensure that these facilities and job opportunities would be provided for these young populations.  I welcomed his decision at that time but people seemed to get bogged down deciding who they should report to and the initiative never got off the ground even though there was a real need for it.</P>
    <P>Local government has been further fragmented.  This, in theory, has brought local representatives closer to the community but have better services been provided or dynamic improvements been made to facilities for which the local authorities in large urban areas are responsible? We have to come to the conclusion, unfortunately, that the answer is no, that the situation is grave and getting more serious.  I sincerely feel that if this Bill &mdash; which this side of the House cannot accept &mdash; does anything it gives us the opportunity to discuss the plight of young people and the necessity for action on their behalf.  I hope dynamic action will follow and that the industrial <Col N="2025" /> policy review, the task force on unemployment and the new task force, will co-ordinate a new programme with the Minister responsible.  However, the Minister has a limited responsibility and depends on a number of other Ministries and organisations to respond to the desirable policies which he believes we should be pursuing.  There is great frustration at the lack of action and because these problems have been allowed to grow and develop.</P>
    <P>There is another problem which needs to be identified and a &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; response and practical assistance is needed.  Parents are responsible for their sons and daughters but if they are not exercising responsibility or capable of being responsible, then the local system or community must, in some shape or form, deal with the problem.  For example, when the board of management of a community college have to make a decision to expel a young pupil the parents are called in.  Usually the mother comes alone, the child is from a broken home and there are various difficulties. The child, who is not under parental control, is causing problems as he has drawn a knife on another pupil in the college. One rotten apple in the barrel &mdash; probably ten in 1,000 &mdash; can cause great problems and difficulties which are very difficult to tackle.  Out of approximately 5,000 teenagers in north Clondalkin, 50 have caused the setting up of a task force from which I hope something good will come.  I have no doubt that throughout the country in large urban areas the problems to which I referred also pertain and need to be addressed.  I hope there will be dynamic action as a result of this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very timely bacause we have to look very seriously at our economic policies of the last 20 years.  I am convinced that these policies <Col N="2026" /> have failed us.  Last year's much hyped economic growth of 7 per cent represented a decline in jobs of 5,000 which represents the extent to which the policy has failed.  Most people know those figures but one which has escaped the notice of many is the extent to which the recent growth in unemployment has been concentrated on our young people.  In the last 12 months alone youth unemployment has grown by a massive 40 per cent, which is a total indictment of the policy for our young people.  We now have almost 80,000 young people under the age of 25 unemployed.</P>
      <P>Where are the class of 1981, the class of children who were then aged ten to 14 years?  The sad facts are revealed in the recent census of population published last week on the age groups.  There were 340,000 children in that age group at that stage and an alarming figure of 76,500 of them have now left the country although they are barely in their early twenties. Nearly a quarter of the class of 1981 have left.  They were the cream of our youth, bursting with potential, and they are now in another country.  Sadly, many of them as we learned from the streets of London are no credit to this country.  If the outflow of emigrants has declined in the last 12 months it is precisely because of the point I made earlier, that youth unemployment has grown by 40 per cent.  In 12 months an extra 23,000 people have gone on the dole.  One might say that the bulk of that class &mdash; another 20 per cent &mdash; are now unemployed.  Therefore, nearly half the class of 1981 have either emigrated or are unemployed.  An equally alarming fact is that of that class, 25,000 left school without any educational qualification.  That says something serious about an education system which we like to spend a lot of time praising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment experience of these children has been grim; the children who left school without any qualifications spent 45 per cent of their time out of work.  We must face up to the tragedy that our education system &mdash; although it is good &mdash; is not getting through to many of our young people; they are trapped <Col N="2027" /> in a vicious circle of deprivation.  It is appalling to see figures which I noted recently, that in some parts of this city as many as 10 per cent of children are leaving school without the basic three Rs, although they are not functionally illiterate. It does not take much imagination to realise what the prospects are for those young children who cannot basically read or write.  It will not be long before they slip into a life of intermittent employment and perhaps much worse.</P>
    <P>There are structural barriers in our education system to give children a chance to get through.  At present fewer than 5 per cent of the children of unskilled workers get through to any sort of third level education and a minuscule proportion get into university.  The gap between what we put into the education of a school drop-out at the age of 15 or 16 and a graduate is a yawning one.  We spend about £7,500 on the child who leaves school without a qualification &mdash; and much of the money does not get through to that child &mdash; and, in contrast, we spend £26,000 of taxpayers' money educating the graduate.  That contrast must be addressed and this Bill is designed to look seriously at the sort of issues that face young people today.</P>
    <P>It is an equally grim fact &mdash; and Deputy Lawlor referred to it extensively &mdash; that many of the class of 1981 have slipped into a life of crime.  Last year 9,000 persons under the age of 21 were convicted in our courts.  Young people make up over half of all those convicted in our courts.  All parties in this House agree that the response to this growing problem is not a crude question of extra policing or tougher sentencing.  Indeed, we would all seriously question whether the 2,000 children and young people who ended up in prison or detention last year learned anything from their experience in detention which would lead them from a life of crime.  The likelihood is that they are more likely to slip into a life of crime following that experience.</P>
    <P>We have not developed the sort of services which can reach out to young people at risk of slipping into a life of <Col N="2028" /> crime.  To take one example, in our cities today there are 800 homeless children who are extremely vulnerable to slipping into a life of crime.  While the problem of the young homeless has grown, the number of places available to them has declined.  Like Deputy Lawlor, I welcome the Minister's announcement of a task force embracing the Departments of Health, Education, Social Welfare, Labour and others.  However, let us look at what the Bill is trying to do.  It is seeking to enshrine a permanent policy-making role involving people from those Departments so that we can have a coherent approach to the problems facing young people today.  It would not be just a once off task to deal with the problems in Neilstown and produce a report in a few months' time so that the Government can be seen to be doing something about them.  This would be a permanent, critical, independent body that would be there at all times to review policy in relation to young people.  That is why this is such an important and timely Bill.  It is ironic that at a time when the Government are describing this as a bureaucratic approach to young people's problems they are forced following an outbreak of crime in a small part of this city to do something that is only a half-baked attempt compared to what this Bill proposes in such a constructive way.</P>
    <P>Another group of the class of 1981 are the ten thousand people who were born with a significant impairment of their physical or intellectual capacity.  They, most of all, have had huge obstacles placed in the way of developing their full potential &mdash; for example, access to care, education, therapy, training and employment have been cruelly rationed to these people.  For some of these people and their carers, they have been strained almost to breaking point.  All Members know of the plight of carers who are struggling to deal with a problem that will not go away because they cannot get placements for these people.</P>
    <P>As we look back on the school photograph of the class of 1981 and ask where are they now, the answer is a sorry indictment of current policy.  The emigrant, <Col N="2029" /> the unemployed, the school drop-out, the juvenile offender and the person with the disability make up well over half of that class.  It is difficult to look any of them in the eye and say that we have not failed them as a country.  Policy has failed to tailor itself to the needs of our young.  It is families with large numbers of young people and those with single parents who have figured in the surveys as those most prone to poverty.  Young people have become prey to homelessness, sexual abuse and substance abuse on a scale that was unimaginable ten or 20 years ago. Growing numbers of young people are, sadly, becoming marginalised as we have seen only this week.</P>
    <P>If we look at the tax code we find it makes no allowance for the cost of providing for our young people.  If young people are unemployed and choose to stay at home with their parents they get only a fraction of the social assistance they would get if they left home.  If they seek training they face the frustration that most apprenticeship places are already spoken for for people with contacts in the trade.  If they aspire to drive a car they are treated as if they are already proven reckless drivers by having to pay premiums of £2,000 or more.  This puts driving completely out of the reach of young people.</P>
    <P>In the last ten years there has been a huge change in sexual attitudes among our young people.  Young people today face enormous pressures and hazards that did not exist when we were going to school.  We cannot overlook the dramatic changes in sexual attitudes and sexual behaviour in the world in which this generation of young people are growing up. Young people are becoming sexually active at a younger age and this is of enormous concern to all people.  Last year over 2,000 babies were born to unmarried teenage mothers.  I have no doubt that these children brought enormous joy to those young mothers' lives but for many of them it has destroyed an opportunity of making full use of their young lives.  All too often, as the statistics show, they slip into lives of deprivation. I often wonder how many of the 4,000 <Col N="2030" /> young Irish women who have gone to the UK to have abortions are young single teenagers who had to face a situation whose description defies comment.  It is grim to think of young people going to clinics in the UK on their own to have an abortion, often anonymous and undeclared.</P>
    <P>Our education system has not got to grips with the need to equip our young people to cope in this vital area of their lives.  Education must impart to our young people a self respect and a respect for one another in their sexual relationships. It must give them the confidence to say no in a world that is increasingly macho and that puts young people under pressure to conform to that image.</P>
    <P>Sadly, another growing threat to our young people today is the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, particularly AIDS. Official efforts to inform young people about the risks of this disease are not getting through, and this must be faced up to.  However strongly we feel about the responsibility of them engaging in casual sexual relationships, we cannot but feel even more strongly about their irresponsibility of engaging in such relationships without protection, exposing themselves and their partners to risks.</P>
    <P>This Bill is particularly timely.  There is a catalogue of problems facing young people today, many of them in the health area where there is increasing evidence of substance abuse and of young people contracting diseases related to behavioural patterns rather than to traditional illnesses.  We have to get to grips with policy throughout a whole range of issues that affect young people if we are to deliver the sort of policy they deserve. This Bill is a positive and valuable contribution towards doing that and should commend itself to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  First, I congratulate Deputy Jimmy Deenihan on taking the initiative and bringing this Bill before the House.  It gives us a great opportunity to discuss some of the problems facing our young people today.  Initially I would like to <Col N="2031" /> refer to the speech by the Minister of State at the Department of Education last week and his subsequent broadcast on national radio in which he indicated that what is needed in our youth services is more money.  He went on to say that he was making trojan efforts to ensure that the £10 million available for youth services this year will be available once again next year.  However, he did not indicate that of that £10 million, all but approximately £50,000 was lottery money.  With the national lottery growing year by year it would be disappointing if that money was not available once again for youth services.  Perhaps a greater proportion of it should be made available for youth services, as was initially intended.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out to the Minister of State that it is his job to ensure that those services are available to our young people.  The former Minister for Education, when in Opposition, indicated to the then Minister for Education, former Deputy Gemma Hussey, that if she was unable to get sufficient funds to run her Department and provide the educational services needed, she was not doing her job properly and should step aside.  I repeat for the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, the words of that famous lady, that if he cannot get the funds to operate the youth services entrusted to his care he, as Minister of State at the Department of Education, should step aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss youth services and the many excellent suggestions raised in the Bill.  For example, section 5 refers to the provision of suitable training courses for youth leaders. There are tens of thousands of people who week after week throughout the country give of their time, energy, enthusiasm and commitment in providing the out of school services and activities our young people look forward to and from which they gain so much.  Scout leaders, youth club organisers, Foróige people, culture group teachers and many sporting clubs, hurling, football, handball, rugby, soccer and so on, play a major part in helping our young people <Col N="2032" /> develop into well adjusted and responsible adults.  I sometimes think that the role these adults play in helping our young people to develop is not recognised. One of the important aspects of this Bill is that it would give those adult groups around the country an opportunity to meet.  It is very important that we provide the resources for the facilities with which these adult leaders can develop the sporting skills of our young people which together with their formal school education equips them to take their place in adult society.</P>
    <P>The youth services do not operate in opposition to schools but rather complement them and help to complete a person's education.  The training facility as outlined in the Bill would be invaluable in helping the many voluntary leaders to better equip themselves to play their important role in our young people's development.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the establishment of local youth advisory committees which should provide a forum at local level in which views and experience can be shared, policy formulated, and young people encouraged to take an active role in deciding their own destiny. The formation of such a group would have enormous benefits for the youth services in the area.</P>
    <P>Young people are experiencing an increasing level of alienation from the political system.  When my colleague, Deputy Austin Currie, contested the 1989 general election in Dublin West he commented on the high degree of apathy and distrust of politicians that he experienced during the canvass in this part of Ireland as compared with his former home in Northern Ireland.  I was amazed to learn that he received such a reaction. Indeed, Deputy Deenihan found, in a survey he conducted in the wake of the sordid scandals of recent times, that 88 per cent of the young people surveyed thought that these events had damaged the credibility of the Government and 71 per cent agreed that politicians had failed this country.  Not only is that a damning response, to us as politicians but it also indicates their disillusionment with the <Col N="2033" /> way politics is being conducted.  Indeed, as I look around at the attendance at branch meetings &mdash; and I believe the same is true of other parties &mdash; the small number of high calibre young people who become involved is very worrying for the future.  Young people bring new life and blood into an organisation and their idealism and involvement give a new impetus to it.  We must, by our actions, set an example which they would wish to follow and thereby get involved in political parties.</P>
    <P>Our young people are crying out for a code of ethics in public life.  They want to see high standards in high places.  They are sick of the scandals emerging in private and public sector companies. Young people agree with the call for a register of interests of TDs and Senators. Can they be impressed by the Taoiseach's recent announcement that we should abandon the multi-seat PR system for a new system so that he could achieve stable Government?  Does this mean a one-party Fianna Fáil administration with all the attendant mismanagement and cronyism that goes with that?</P>
    <P>Young people will be very critical of the Minister's rejection of this Bill.  Why are the Government so afraid of allowing youth organisations have a united voice at national level?  Why is the Minister so opposed to the formalisation of youth services?  Are the Government going to prevent progress in youth services because they are unable to provide suitable funding?</P>
    <P>I ask all sides of the House to support this worthy Bill.</P>

Regardless of who is in office at any given time, it has been our experience that Private Members' Bills have been used too often as a political ploy to embarrass the Government of the day.  I do not think any such unworthy motive applies in this case.  Deputy Deenihan is making a sincere effort to address a complex and serious problem and he is to be commended for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a bit disappointed with Deputy <Col N="2034" /> McGrath's comments on his constituency colleague, the former Minister for Education &mdash; a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I wish to share my time with Deputy Martin, and I regret that I did not ask before this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a precedent for that.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope this is not the result of jealousy of the Minister's success in her task, because it is widely recognised throughout the country that both she and the Minister of State have made a tremendous contribution in education.</P>
      <P>The question must be asked whether this Bill offers any practical improvement in the operation of youth services.  I am afraid the answer must be in the negative. I agree with the Minister of State's comment that we have had more than enough reports, committees and that what we need most is extra money.  I am sure that everybody in this House supports this comment because any resources allocated to youth services is money well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan's Bill gives this House the opportunity of examining the obvious defects in the present system.  I believe they can be overcome; not by bringing in new legislation but by co-ordinating and streamlining the administration of all the measures already in place.  As pointed out in the Bill, at least five Government Departments are involved in one way or another in youth services and very often it is a case of one not knowing what the other is doing. Voluntary organisations throughout the country are engaged in sterling work day-in day-out with young people, and especially with those who are most deprived.  I am well aware of the work of Ógra Chorcaigh, Foróige, the National Youth Federation, the GAA, the Girl Guides, the Scouts, and all sporting organisations.  Indeed, we never hear of the great work of many voluntary organisations. I would particularly like to mention a Capuchin, Father Roch, who provides training opportunities in one <Col N="2035" /> scheme or another for approximately 150 homeless boys and girls, many of whom come from broken homes.  I am very glad to acknowledge that he is getting great assistance from the Department and particularly from the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey.  His work is also well recognised by the people of Cork and long may it continue.  We have a Minister of State with responsibility for youth and sport and it is absolutely essential that his office should be fully aware of and involved in what various Departments are doing in this area.  Instead, we have seen instances where funding has been allocated to certain youth projects unknown to the Minister of State, simply because the relevant Department did not inform him.  I suggest that a co-ordinating committee be set up under the direction of the Minister of State on as permanent a basis as possible with a representative from each Department involved.</P>
    <P>We have all been made vividly aware in recent times of cases of what was known in the past as juvenile delinquency, only now it has developed into downright juvenile crime.  The horrifying consequences include attacks on life and limb; we hear of cases of child drug abuse, of glue sniffing, cider parties and so-called joyriding incidents and so on. The list is endless and very depressing. The worst excesses occur usually in large, urban-sprawl areas with populations of anything from 25,000 to 100,000 people and with very few facilities to brighten the lives of young people.  We are told that so-called problem children or teenagers are a small minority but even such a small minority constitutes too many because of the consequences for society.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to be patronising by putting all of the blame on parents, but each of us should put ourselves in the place of such a parent, maybe a single parent in poor housing, perhaps unemployed, with teenagers who have no recreational facilities in their locality apart from meeting their peers at the street corner.  From such meetings can come the kind of behaviour that is often described as a protest against a society <Col N="2036" /> they see as depriving them.  I doubt whether those young people would define their motives in quite such profound terms but I am certain of one thing; if any such group had a decent youth club or sports facility nearby, they would be much more likely to expend their excess energies in a manner in which they could enjoy themselves without causing so much concern to their parents and their neighbours.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister of State must feel frustrated that the hoped-for sports centres that were promised, with funding from the natinal lottery, have been so slow in materialising.  Perhaps there are good, practical reasons for the delay, but I, too, am very disappointed. It could be that our expectations have been too grand and too ambitious.  We talk of Olympic-size swimming pools and national sports centres but perhaps we should first concentrate our efforts on much smaller projects, strategically located in the kind of areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Nowadays it has become the fashion to demand that the lottery funds everything under the sun.  It should be remembered that one of the primary purposes for which the lottery was set up in the first place was to assist youth and sport.  The two are closely connected.  If the entire proceeds of the lottery were to be devoted to that one area there would still not be enough funding.  In times of financial stringency, such as the present, it is vital that we clearly identify our priorities.  I suggest that the youth services occupy a very high place on the list. It should not be the case that we cannot afford to spend the money, we simply cannot afford not to tackle this major crisis with as great an urgency as can be generated.  The alternative is to allow the development of an ever-growing threat of the creation of a criminal class, which in turn would tax our penal system to the limit and beyond in economic terms alone.  If the necessary money is spent now, the return later will be tenfold. What could be conserved in terms of the quality of life is beyond calculation.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Minister of <Col N="2037" /> State will agree with virtually every word I have said and that if he is given the funds and the necessary co-operation by the Government Departments concerned he will tackle this major problem with tremendous vigour.  We must all try to convince the Department of Finance to think along the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, there are some things that can be done without delay.  I understand that there are about 40,000 youth leaders throughout the country, mostly volunteers. They belong to a variety of bodies, some of which were formed by splitting away from other groups &mdash; perhaps for good reason, I do not know &mdash; but I am sure that all have one objective in mind, and that is that agreement be reached on a national standard of training and of certification of youth leaders.  That could be achieved if a body such as the National Youth Council or the National Youth Federation, or both, were to be asked by the Minister to consult with every group and come up with a standard system within a period of, say, 12 months.</P>
    <P>My second point is that an inter-departmental committee as I have described should be set up by the Minister without delay.</P>
    <P>My third point is that all grants allocated to youth projects of any kind by various Departments should be channelled through the office of the Minister of State or if for some reason that is not possible, the Minister should be consulted in advance either directly or through the inter-departmental committee.</P>
    <P>If those suggestions were acted on the ground work would be laid for a much more effective service for our young people.  Then perhaps the case could be made more clearly for a greater level of the kind of funding so urgently needed if we are to address the problem seriously.</P>
    <P>Like most Members in the House, I am sure I could go on and on.  We talk so much about our young people but I do feel that we must give more recognition to the role of those who are endeavouring to do something positive for youth in the many organisations that I have mentioned. I know that the Minister is very <Col N="2038" /> committed in this respect and that he has a close association with youth organisations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I had a pleasant experience last Saturday night when I deputised for the Lord Mayor of Cork at the 60th Anniversary celebrations of the Eighth Cork Scout Troup the founder of which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Next Saturday will suit if the Deputy succeeds in getting a couple of his colleagues to see sense, particularly the two who voted for the service charges here in 1983 but who voted against them on Sunday night.</P>
      <P>The founder of the troup I have referred to was a man by the name of John O'Donoghue.  Sixty years later he was witnessing the result of his work.  It was a pleasure to attend such an occasion when the work of a committed person in the community &mdash; a person who worked behind the scenes &mdash; was acknowledged. Other people, too, who attended the function had given their whole lives to community work.  All of us here as legislators &mdash; irrespective of our differences &mdash; owe it to those people to assist them in every way possible in helping to deal with the many complex issues and problems in our community.  I hope that the contributions to this debate from all sides will be positive and will give the Minister the support he so urgently needs in going to the people who make the decisions seeking the resources necessary to allow him implement the many policies and projects he would so dearly like to establish. I am glad to have had the opportunity here this evening to speak and I hope that progress will be made as a result of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>First I pay tribute to Deputy Deenihan for introducing the Bill in so far as it allows the House an opportunity to discuss youth services and youth affairs and the policy of the State in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also pay tribute to the Minister of State with responsibility for youth affairs, <Col N="2039" /> Deputy Frank Fahey, who has done particularly good work in the Department throughout the years.  In particular, he has succeeded in having raised very significantly the level of funding for youth services in the past years.  He should be given credit for that.</P>
    <P>I have been disappointed in the debate in that it has been somewhat predictable in concentrating on the existing youth services.  In some respects there has been a lack of any critical analysis of the existing services, and these need to be radically reappraised.  Serious questions need to be asked, including the question of the relationship between the youth services and the mass of our young people.  To what extent do young people on the streets in the rural townlands and elsewhere know of the existence of many of the national youth organisations?</P>
    <P>I remember giving an address to the National Youth Council about three years ago, and in this regard I must preface my remarks by saying that I am in no way critical of the personnel involved; they do extremely good work, are very highly motivated and many are voluntary youth workers.  It was stated that the council represented more than half a million young people and at the time I made the point that if a survey were to be conducted we might all be appalled at the lack of knowledge among young people of the existence of such bodies as the National Youth Council.  That is a point we should reflect on.  We should also consider to what degree that should affect and influence our policy on youth services.</P>
    <P>The question of funding has been raised.  The Minister should be complimented on being frank and honest in his contribution to the debate.  For much too long people have expected Ministers to come to the House and say that a system was adequately funded and needed no more money.  The Minister came to the House and said that he had raised the funding from the figure of £4 million, where it stood when he took office, to £10 million today but that he <Col N="2040" /> would like a lot more money to do many more things.  That was a perfectly sensible, honest thing to say.  Yet the Minister was berated and criticised by the Opposition for having said that.  We should also ascertain whether the funds at present being allocated are being expended effectively and directed sufficiently to the people and activities on the ground.  My preference would be to fund organisations and activities providing services to many young people, be they sporting activities, scouts, girl guides or in other youth club arenas.  In addition, I contend we should fund equipment, jerseys, footballs, and other sporting equipment.  We should endeavour to reduce the amount of funding expended on bureaucracy.  At times one gets the feeling there is too much bureaucracy in the youth services area, that too many resources are gobbled up by that bureaucracy with insufficient being released to activities on the ground. While I may not be totally accurate in that, that is my instinctive feeling, one shared by many people.  That is why I said at the outset there is need for a reappraisal of our youth services.  We should analyse the present funding to particular bodies, investigate their real membership not just that advanced, the type of activities in which they engage and so on, to ensure such funds are properly allocated to people and activities on the ground.</P>

      <P>Not particularly, no; I will come to that later.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us is not a particularly comprehensive one.  It is fairly light in substance, proposing the appointment of an advisory committee.  I have no tolerance of advisory committees; that is what they are, simply advisory.  There is never any guarantee that, no matter how good their advice, it will ever see the light of day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of that contention, its provision should be more water-tight.  As the Minister said, and as anybody who has studied the subject will know, there have been ample documents, policies, advice and so on produced in relation to what we should be doing in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, there is already the National Youth Council whose role, I understood, was to advise Government, Ministers and people in general on youth affairs, to make representations and lobby on issues pertaining to young people and the range of services available to them.  One might well pose the question: what would be the relationship between this proposed advisory committee and the National Youth Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No statutory role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are creating an extra layer of bureaucracy within a system which contains too much already.  Sometimes there are too many people advising young people on what they should be doing.  We should remember that young people attend school from 9 a.m. until 4.15 p.m., they may be taking grinds from some other teachers and at night they go to clubs and are told something else.  I contend we can overdo that advice.  I am a great believer in providing money for the requisite facilities for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also examine the existing infrastructure because there is an incredible amount of duplication.  I think it was Deputy O'Shea who referred to the availability of community schools and their facilities to young people within their respective communities.  I happen to be a member of our local vocational education committee and this is something I am pursuing actively.  While accepting the Minister's contention that that is essentially a matter for the local boards of management, we should acknowledge <Col N="2042" /> that the record of such boards of management to date, particularly in my area in Cork, providing facilities for youth clubs and organisations has not been satisfactory.  For example, there are excellent community halls in many community schools, excellent playing fields, indoor arenas and so on but what tends to happen is that professional groups, people at work, who can afford the fee being levied, dominate the timetable and schedule of activities in many community halls almost every evening.  I know of a number of youth clubs, under-age sporting clubs, who would not have great resources, experience enormous difficulty gaining access to such halls because they would not have the requisite fee to avail of these community facilities. Rather than spend more money, more capital funding, providing individual youth clubs with premises and so on, there is dire need to examine existing facilities and ensure that they are made available to existing youth clubs and sporting organisations, which is not happening at present to the required degree.</P>
    <P>While at times we may not want ministerial involvement in local boards, in vocational education committees or whatever, from time to time we have received ministerial circulars on the need to appoint teachers and parents to various vocational education committees and so on.  It would be no harm if the Minister were to issue a circular directing vocational education committees to give preferential treatment to youth clubs based in communities where community school facilities exist because that is very important.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt adequately with the need for a register of youth organisations; this is in existence already in his Department.  On the provision of training centres for young people, Deputy Deenihan made us aware of the fact that there is already a broad spread of responsibility over the whole arena of youth affairs. Rather than extend that spectrum of responsibility we should endeavour to contract and centralise it more.  I am somewhat wary of travelling down different <i>cul-de-sacs.</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2043" /> The most significant development that has taken place in the overall education of young people has been the Outreach programme.  If we can provide additional funding for that programme we should because it has had a tangible impact, particularly in certain areas of Cork, on those young people most at risk, that is, those who have left the normal school scene early.  The Outreach programme is beginning to meet their needs.  It is a programme that should be developed further, something on which resources should be concentrated.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education have made available considerable information to young people at the various youth information centres nationwide.  In particular, they have produced a video on emigration, one that embraces the full experience of the emigration process which is very important for young people.  If we are to provide information for young people in any specific area, emigration must be at the top of any priority list.  If young people take a decision to leave we should at least ensure they are well equipped to do so.</P>
    <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Deputy Wallace, about the outstanding work of Fr. Roch in Cork.  The one problem Fr. Roch has encountered is that his activities do not fall under the aegis of any specific Government Department or, indeed, committee.  Rather his activities are funded by a variety of institutions, including the Departments of Social Welfare and Education and the vocational education committees.  We should examine institutions like those provided by Fr. Roch ascertaining how we can allocate them a more secure annual level of funding thereby ensuring their continuity and a future planning base.  Annually Fr. Roch seeks funding from a host of institutions which is not satisfactory.  That is a tradition that has grown up from Fr. Roch and the Capuchins and illustrates the original point I was making, that we should allocate precious resources to people on the ground doing something practical to help young people rather <Col N="2044" /> than tying them up in further layers of bureaucracy, appointing people simply to sit behind desks.  Fr. Roch can do with a lot more money and undertake an awful lot more work to the ultimate betterment of a particular community and city.  I support everything Deputy Wallace had to say in that respect.</P>
    <P>I might draw the Minister's attention also to Foróige who are concerned at the level of grant aid they have received in recent years compared with other national youth organisations.  They contend they are not receiving a fair slice of the cake.  In the forthcoming allocation of funds I would ask the Minister to carefully examine their case and ascertain whether he could make more funds available to them.  They have been warning us of a serious position in relation to staffing.  They are an organisation who have provided a very good service to young people nationwide, particularly in the city of Cork.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I contend we need less duplication, less bureaucracy with a greater allocation of funding to activities on the ground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I compliment Deputy Deenihan on its introduction.  In the past I, as a Corkman, might not always have agreed with him but I have no difficulty in sharing his philosophy as expressed in this Bill.  If somebody had the capacity to sum up the debate in an unbiased way he would have to indicate that the Bill was an effort to facilitate young people to organise themselves. One must ask what Deputies on the Government benches have to fear from young people who have become organised? Why this feigned praise for the Bill and the refusal to accept it?  What about the new thinking which should dominate at least young politicians in their approach, the thinking that would reject <Col N="2045" /> the knee-jerk, reactionary and negative posturing we have seen?  Why not accept the Bill and use it as a blueprint and amend and improve it later?</P>
      <P>In the age profile of this House, the Minister of State would fall into the younger category and many other young Deputies have contributed from the benches opposite.  They reacted in a manner that is no longer relevant if we are to advance the cause of youth and society.  There is evidence of unease and embarrassment in the content of some speeches from Members opposite who praised the Bill but, almost as a footnote, found some petty excuse to reject it.  It is an enabling Bill which would facilitate young people to organise themselves.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder that young people should seek to become organised, especially when one looks at the legacy which a failed political and economic system has left them.  If they are not facilitated to organise and take over the reins for the future, there is little hope for this country.  Even in the absence of the Government's goodwill, there is ample evidence to show that young people are taking hold of their own destiny and are no longer prepared passively to accept Government diktats as gospel. The political and economic system has left our young people with a huge debt around their necks, moneys borrowed for political gain, with no positive benefit to the community.  Politicians who cynically express pious platitudes about concern for young peoples' issues but vote in a cavalier manner, disregarding the concerns of young people, will ultimately feel the brunt when young people are successfully organised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy McGrath, referred to the levels of cynicism and apathy.  I have seen in my constituency &mdash; I am sure this is more broadly based &mdash; evidence of young people grasping the nettle, taking the reins of their future in their own hands.  On Saturday last I attended a meeting of Young Fine Gael in my constituency.  The 50 people in attendance were very trenchant in their views and concerned about their future. They are no longer prepared to take a <Col N="2046" /> back seat or let this House decide their future without expressing their views. Young people have a difficult time.  They are adversely affected by the unemployment problem.  Those lucky enough to have a car face a major problem with motor insurance.  It appears that the only solution that can be offered is the emigrant ship.  Lest we should benefit from their abilities and education, we refuse to allow those who go abroad to voice their opinions by casting the vote.  It is ironic that a Private Members' Bill to allow emigrants a vote was rejected by the Government parties, yet the new Programme for Government cynically proposes to look at the issue.  Young people will not fall for that sort of cynical opportunism.  The Government will rue the day when young people become organised.  They will deliver a telling message to politicians who attempt to score political points on their backs.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises the bureaucracy in the current system.  Five Government Departments are responsible for implementing and directing a whole range of youth services.  We propose to streamline the system.  Deputy Martin lavished praise on Father Roch who is doing such excellent work in Cork, but he went on to mention the difficulty experienced by Father Roch in securing funding because he had to go from one Department to another.  A recognition of that bureaucracy is inherent in this Bill and it proposes setting up an advisory body to advise the Minister for Education on how best to co-ordinate an approach to eliminate that bureaucracy. Is there any more telling evidence of that bureaucracy than the lack of suitable detention centres for young offenders?  Judge Pringle in Galway recently admonished the Government for their failure to provide suitable accommodation.  No Department will take responsibility for it.  Young offenders end up in Mountjoy because there is no suitable accommodation elsewhere.  That is appalling.  That and a whole range of other difficulties are addressed in this Bill.  Youth organisations <Col N="2047" /> could direct their correspondence to the proposed advisory committee and seek their assistance in resolving problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the major issues which should be addressed by the advisory committee if established &mdash; if they are not established I ask the Minister to take note of the remainder of my contribution &mdash; is the lifestyle and education of young people today.  Health educators have pointed out that many of the characteristic diseases of the 20th century are due not to causes beyond people's control but to their lifestyle and, therefore, to some extent by the choices they make as individuals or a community.  Illnesses due to diet and a lack of exercise are one part of what they have in mind, as are diseases due to environmental pollution.  Added to that are diseases due to stress and the mental and psychosomatic diseases which may follow from an inability to find constructive ways of dealing with our feelings and emotions.  Added to that are those diseases which arise from abusive substances, for example, tobacco, alcohol and various legal or illegal drugs.  Many would say these latter substances are the crucial aspects of health education in the teenage years since it is in those areas <Col N="2048" /> that young people may make choices which are likely to affect them and their families for the rest of their lives.  Finally added to that, and perhaps most contentiously, are the effects on people of the irresponsible choices made in their teens or early adulthood in regard to sexual involvement.  This issue has, of course, taken on a new and even more deadly aspect since the advent of AIDS and the HIV virus.</P>
      <P>On the question of AIDS, what is now needed is positive action by the Minister for Health on the availability of condoms. Condoms cannot be presented as the be all and end all solution to that problem; they merely act as a safety net.  The Government cannot shirk their responsibility in this regard.  All medical evidence points to the fact that while condoms do not offer 100 per cent protection against AIDS, they do limit the chances of catching AIDS.  Regularly in this House we hear of increases in the numbers contacting HIV and AIDS but still the Minister and the Government try to pass the buck in relation to the availability of condoms. The previous Minister for Health tried to pass responsibility for condom distribution outlets to the local health boards.  Now we hear the new Minister for Health is going to adopt a different approach.  I call on the Minister and the Government to make it immediately clear to this House what they intend to do about the easier availability of condoms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Solvent abuse is another issue of great concern to young people and parents today.  The figures on fatalities from solvent abuse in 1988 show that nine deaths took place &mdash; six males and three females &mdash; and that people as young as ten years and as old as 26 years have died from solvent abuse.  Yet the main method of recording deaths from solvent abuse is through newspaper reports.  This is a sorry indictment of the Department of Health, the Minister and the Government. The time has come for some immediate action to be taken by the Minister in relation to whole area of solvent abuse.  The framework provided in this Bill for setting up an advisory committee on youth work would be one method by <Col N="2049" /> which the scourge of solvent abuse could be addressed.</P>
    <P>What is needed therefore, in relation to young people and health education is an education for living programme, an education which highlights the need for responsible choices and focuses on the feelings and motivations leading to choices as well as on the effects on oneself and others of the choices that are made. If such an education for living programme is effective its effects should be visible in a change in behaviour among young people.</P>
    <P>Greater co-ordination in health education and other youth issues is needed if we, as legislators, are to be serious about our commitment to the youth service. Pious platitudes about the youth of Ireland being its greatest asset ring very hollow indeed when evidence of a non-co-ordinated approach to the youth service is the reality.  This Youth Services Bill would go a long way towards providing a very good framework by which youth issues as they arise and affect young people in 1991 can be addressed in a realistic manner.  The advisory committee proposed in this Bill would help to make health education a reality for young people.</P>
    <P>Health education should begin at an early age.  Schools, together with parents, have a responsibility to ensure that children learn to respect and care for their bodies and understand the importance of following a way of life conducive to good health.  Primary school programmes should be based upon a positive and holistic healthy lifestyle approach that is child centred and not upon a diseases orientated and negative perspective. Health education and health promotion in second level schools and youth organisations is vital because young people are prone to an increasing range of influences upon their lifestyles, such as negative peer group pressure and the media as well as a growing sense of self-image. It is during adolescent years that young people adopt patterns of behaviour which can threaten their health, such as smoking, drinking alcohol, poor diets, etc. Programmes such as the Drink Awareness for Youth Alcohol Education pack, <Col N="2050" /> a joint initiative between the National Youth Council of Ireland, the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and the youth affairs section of the Department of Education, should be commended and encouraged.  To date, over 700 facilitators have been trained in the use of this valuable pack.</P>
    <P>The necessity of ensuring that there is consistency between what is taught in the classroom or youth club and what is happening in schools or youth clubs needs to be addressed.  This means, for instance, that teachers and youth leaders should refrain from smoking in the presence of young people and that canteens should apply strict healthy nutrition guidelines.</P>
    <P>Young people do not exist only in schools or youth clubs.  Health education and promotion also involve education about environmental issues and the creation of a safe environment in which young people can live.  The community also has a role to play in raising young people's sense of responsibility and self-esteem while, in turn, young people can help adults in the community.  The family and the Government, in quite different ways, can provide a medium in which young people have the power to make choices which encourage a health promoting lifestyle.  We, as legislators, must ensure that health education as promoted among young people in Ireland must contain reference to the importance of relationships in young people's lives.  Any programme must address such issues as social skills, self-worth, emotions and friendships at various levels.  It must also address the need for people to look after themselves with reference to proper exercise, rest, healthy eating, personal safety, substance use and personal health.  It must further address community and environmental issues such as education on care of the environment, community involvement with young people and how young people might get involved in communities in a constructive, educational, and worthwhile manner.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a real commitment by the Department of Education towards a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio. <Col N="2051" /> This is a key issue in this debate.  It is only by working with small classes that teachers can effectively engage pupils in a proper experimental type health education programme.  Thus the whole area of teacher training and in-service training for teachers needs to be examined.  If student teachers are not given the opportunity to perceive health education as an important part of their roles as teachers and the part they can play in the development of a health promoting school, then it will be difficult to retrieve that position later.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that teachers, youth workers and all those who work directly or indirectly with young people are helped to understand the aims, principles and practices of health education in as broad a perspective as possible.  This perspective of health education should provide those involved with young people with a better understanding of the term &ldquo;health education&rdquo; to include the physical, social and psychological aspects.</P>
    <P>On a practical level, I call on the Government to encourage and support in terms of finance and resources all agencies currently engaged in health promotion in Ireland today.  Money spent on health education in a planned and structured way involving the co-ordination of all agencies is an investment in the future health and wellbeing of the country.  Thus, as outlined to the House, we need to move away from a very narrow focus on health education towards a more holistic approach which enhances the education of young people, adults and the community in general.</P>
    <P>I again stress the need for greater co-ordination in health education and other youth issues which this Bill facilitates in the creation of the advisory committee on youth work.  It is only by this approach, and all it involves in terms of adequate resources being provided by the Government, that we can begin to be serious about health education and young people in Ireland today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatLee" hpid="Dr. Lee Dr. Lee">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter. Every day the unsuspecting population of Dublin are put at extreme risk with the storage of and the passage through Dublin of highly dangerous and toxic chemicals by rail.  Located in Dublin port not one mile from Fairview, Clontarf, North Strand, Ballybough and Croke Park areas is the Asahi storage plant for highly dangerous and toxic chemicals namely, acrylonitrile and methyl acrylate. They are awaiting transport by rail to the Asahi plant in Ballina, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>Acrylonitrile is vinyl cyanide.  On combustion it gives off cyanide gas which kills, in a matter of seconds, by inhalation through the lungs or through absorption of the skin.  It has a low flash point which means it ignites very easily.  When exposed to the atmosphere because it is heavier than air and lighter than water it forms a fog or a haze.  Its dispersal is entirely dependent on the weather conditions prevailing at the time.  If it is a calm day it will hang over Dublin Bay like a shroud killing all before it.  This cloud would make the Union Carbide disaster in India look like a tea party in comparison.</P>
      <P>Trains daily, unbelievably, ferry at evening rush hour from Dublin port 12,000 gallons of acrylonitrile, 10,000 gallons of methyl acrylate and 16,000 gallons of gas oil through north Dublin which has a population of 250,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An additional hazard for the unsuspecting people of Dublin is the transportation of approximately 400 tonnes of anhydrous ammonia from Marina Point in Cork to Arklow in County Wicklow. Ammonia as we know is a highly irritant and toxic corrosive gas.  Why must the train from Cork to Arklow go through Dublin?  It does not make sense.  International fire authorities have stated that ammonia is extremely dangerous in close contact with acrylonitrile.  Amazingly, these trains pass alongside the same <Col N="2053" /> section of track at or about the same time during rush hour every evening.</P>
    <P>The population of north and south Dublin are needlessly, for the profit motive, put at risk by the passage of these chemicals through its city.</P>
    <P>The storage plant in Dublin port was foisted upon the Dublin Port and Docks Board by the then Fianna Fáil Government because of the siege mentality of the Japanese economy who wanted access to EC markets and saw Dublin port as an ideal location.  Murphy's law states that if it can happen it will happen.  It has happened three times in Dublin Port in the last three years &mdash; on 20 February 1988 when the <i>Tipperary</i> and <i>Sumburgh Head</i> were in collision at virtually the same location as last week's tragic accident between the <i>mv Kilkenny</i> and the <i>mv Hasselwerder;</i> on 30 January 1987 when there was a derailment of Asahi chemical rail containers at Dublin port and two years prior to that when there was a major leakage of acrylonitrile in the midlands from a faulty valve on the Asahi train.  The examples are numerous.</P>
    <P>It is grossly irresponsible of the Minister, and the Government, to allow the continued storage of these deadly substances in Dublin Port.  It is damnably irresponsible of the Minister and his Department to allow such substances to be transported by rail through Dublin, across the midlands, to Mayo.  The solution is simple.  The Minister must insist that the acrylonitrile be transported directly by sea to Ballina.  They have the facilities, the terminal and the necessary expertise.</P>

      <P>In addition, it would give 60 extra jobs to Ballina.  I ask the Minister to act now before it is too late.  The people of Dublin and this country are being put at serious risk if this situation is allowed to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The <Col N="2054" /> storage of dangerous chemicals in Dublin Port and throughout the State is controlled through the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the Dangerous Substances Acts, 1972 and 1979 and regulations made under those Acts.</P>
      <P>Certain industrial activities, which include the storage of dangerous chemicals, are governed by the European Communities (Major Accident Hazards of Certain Industrial Activities) Regulations, 1986 and amendments to these regulations made in 1989.</P>
      <P>The transport of chemicals by road through Dublin or through any part of the country is governed by the Dangerous Substances (Conveyance of Scheduled Substances by Road) (Trade or Business) Regulations, 1980 and amendments made to these regulations in 1986.  The provisions of these regulations are based on the requirements of the European agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road, otherwise known as the ADR Agreement.</P>
      <P>The general protection of the public is governed by section 7 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, which requires every employer and self-employed person to conduct his undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that members of the public who may be affected thereby are not exposed to risks to their safety or health.</P>
      <P>A booklet originally published by my Department and now available from the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health entitled, <i>Guide to Conveyance of Dangerous Substances by Road,</i> provides general guidance on the subject to employers and employees including drivers, consignors and carriers. The Federation of Irish Chemical Industries has also published a code of practice for the transport of hazardous chemicals by road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority are responsible for the enforcement of legislation governing the storage and transport of dangerous substances by road. The inspectorate of the authority carry <Col N="2055" /> out regular road checks with the assistance of the Garda Síochána to ensure compliance with the requirements of the relevant legislation.  In addition they carry out regular inspections and checks of the storage facilities in the Dublin port area.  No fatalities have occurred which could be attributed to dangerous substances since the introduction of the 1980 regulations.</P>
    <P>The Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications are responsible for regulating the transport of dangerous substances by rail and a Bill to give effect to international regulations on the transport of dangerous substances by rail, known as RID, is being prepared at present by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications.</P>
    <P>Tank containers and tankers used in the transport of dangerous substances by rail already comply with the specifications of the international union of rail-ways and trains carrying dangerous goods, and are operated in accordance with the requirements of RID.  I am satisfied that the legislation available and the arrangements for its enforcement are sufficient to ensure that consignors and carriers of dangerous substances together with those involved in the storage of dangerous chemicals discharge their primary responsibility in relation to the safety of the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork Corporation have failed to adopt an Estimate and now face abolition.  The editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> today points out that the problem does not end there and that Limerick and Waterford are likely to follow suit.  I wish to inform the Minister that Dún Laoghaire Borough Council are facing the same prospect.  We began our statutory estimates meeting on Tuesday last on a draft estimate which provides for the retention of water charges &mdash; and Dún Laoghaire is the only <Col N="2056" /> part of the greater Dublin area which has such charges; the introduction of a sewage charge of £30 per household, and an increase in the commercial rate which is 3 times the rate of inflation.  All the members of the council indicated that they would vote against this estimate.</P>
    <P>This is consistent with a motion which the borough council passed last September, which declared an intention to abolish water charges in the borough and which sought a meeting with the Minister for the Environment, well in advance of estimates time, to discuss the financial situation of the corporation.  The Minister's predecessor did not accede to that request and I am now asking the present Minister to agree to meet this week, or early next week, with a deputation from the borough council to discuss our financial problems, so that we can avoid a doomsday situation.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire's basic problem is the same as that of other local authorities. The rate support grant which they have received from the Department of the Environment is too low.  It has failed to match the promise made when the domestic rates were abolished and taxes increased that local authorities would get from central Government the same moneys which they would have collected in rates.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire Corporation are now getting from the Department of the Environment only £1 out of every £4 to which they are entitled.  This is leaving an annual shortfall of over £10 million. But, Dún Laoghaire has two other problems, first, the level of rates in Dún Laoghaire in 1977, the base year, was far below the rest of Dublin and the rate support grants were originally based on this suppressed rate.  The second problem is the rate base.  Only 27 per cent of valuations in Dún Laoghaire attract rates; this is only half the rate base of Dublin city.  The net result is that Dún Laoghaire is not getting enough money from the Department of the Environment. The corporation do not have the money, even with service charges, to provide an adequate service to the public.</P>
    <P>Moreover, Dún Laoghaire is the only <Col N="2057" /> part of the greater Dublin area which has water charges.  Citizens of Dún Laoghaire borough cannot understand or accept why they must pay on the double for local services while their neighbours in Dublin city and county &mdash; often literally across the road, or down the street from them &mdash; do not.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire's borough councillors meet again on Tuesday evening to discuss the annual estimate.  It does not appear that it will be possible for the council to adopt an estimate this year.  This will put Dún Laoghaire in the same predicament as Cork, and possibly Limerick and Waterford.</P>
    <P>The possible abolition of the councils has been mentioned by the Minister as an option, but it is an unrealistic and undemocratic option.  Could the Minister seriously contemplate abolishing four of the largest local authorities in the country, only months after they were elected by the people &mdash; in many cases with a direct mandate to resist water and service charges?  Where does the Minister think that would lead?  How does he seriously expect large urban areas to be governed without elected representatives?  Apart from the possible political consequences for the Government parties, the abolition of councils would lead to municipal anarchy &mdash; a situation which I, and I am sure every Member of this House, would not wish to contemplate.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, therefore, to meet with the local authorities who are now in trouble, and specifically to meet with Dún Laoghaire Borough Council as we have requested.  I ask him also to make available an increase in the rate support grant for these local authorities to enable them to adopt acceptable estimates of expenses.</P>

      <P>Dún Laoghaire Corporation were notified of their rate support grant allocation for 1992 on 22 November last.  The allocation is just over £3.8 million and this is the same as in 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Dún Laoghaire Corporation have been treated in the same way as all other local authorities.  The rate support grant replaces in part the income from rates formerly applicable to domestic dwellings and agricultural land and the former grant for rates and contribution in lieu of rates on Government property, commonly known as the &ldquo;bounty in lieu of rates&rdquo;.  This income varies from local authority to local authority because of differences in valuation levels and in rate poundages applied by councils over the years.  These variations together with adjustments arising from other changes in local finances in recent years, including the elimination of certain levies and statutory demands and the writing off of capital loans from the local loans fund, are reflected in differences in rate support grant allocations for individual authorities.  The direct payment of ESB rates to local authorities is also a factor in these adjustments.  Because of all these adjustments, it is not possible to make direct comparisons of rate support grant allocations between various local authorities, but I assure the Deputy that the allocations for 1992 are the same across the board as for the current year.</P>
      <P>My Department have commissioned a study on rate support grant.  The London Institute of Fiscal Studies are examining the matter at present and their report is expected at the end of this year.  When the report is received the Government will consider a new equalisation system for the way the grant is distributed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the difficult financial position facing Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  I do not know of any local authority in the country that have not got difficulties of one sort or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Dún Laoghaire Corporation are now in the middle of considering their estimates for 1992.  I know it is never an easy task but the decisions must be taken by the elected members of the corporation.  I as Minister am not involved in this process.  I am aware that <Col N="2059" /> some time ago the corporation requested a meeting with the Minister to seek additional funding of £1.2 million so that they could abolish domestic service charges.  My Department replied that any decision to levy or not to levy service charges was a reserved function of the elected members when they were considering their estimates.  More recently, the corporation sought a meeting again with the Minister to discuss the finances of the borough corporation.  The Minister has declined that request just as he had to refuse to meet other local authorities on this particular matter, which in a special way, is the clear responsibility of the councillors themselves.  Dún Laoghaire, like all the other local authorities, have been notified of their rate support grant allocation for 1992 and it is up to them now to make their own decisions.  That is what they were elected for.</P>
      <P>The decisions for 1992 for the services to be provided by Dún Laoghaire Corporation must be made by the elected members of that corporation.  It is one of their fundamental responsibilities to adopt their estimate and to strike a rate for 1992.  I sincerely hope they complete their obligations in this very important matter.</P>
      <P>I should mention that 24 county councils, two county boroughs and 32 urban councils have adopted their spending estimates for 1992.  I sincerely hope that Dún Laoghaire will be added to the list. I should point out that the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Brian Hillery, has also been in touch with me in connection with this matter.  I also pointed out to him &mdash; and I want to point out to the Deputy &mdash; that it is solely a matter for the Dún Laoghaire Corporation elected members what they want to do.  The same rates support grant applies to every corporation, county council and urban council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you for selecting my subject for debate this evening.  As the Minister knows, and everyone in this House is only too well aware, the country is facing into an unprecedented budgetary situation which will require the greatest economies in public spending for 1992 and, I suspect, for some years to come.  In this extremely difficult financial climate one would expect cuts would begin at the top.  Surely it behoves every Minister to lead by example.  Unfortunately, this is not what we find with the newly appointed Minister for Defence, Deputy Vincent Brady.</P>
      <P>If the extent of the expenditure on his new offices at Coláiste Caoimhín is as high as is reported, that is, in excess of £100,000, it seems that this is where the newly appointed Minister has put his priorities.  What makes matters worse is that I have been told a major revamp of the offices was carried out on the instructions of his predecessor, Deputy Daly, just a year ago.  The scope of this new work included wallpapering, painting and the installation of a shower and changing room in the ministerial suite.</P>
      <P>Another disturbing factor in the refurbishment is that the Minister has ordered that a passageway leading to his office should be sealed off for the Minister's private use only.  The effect of this is to force his staff to walk the long way round when moving through the building.</P>
      <P>While we would all accept the Minister is entitled to comfortable office accommodation, nevertheless the scope of this refurbishment, including as it does the installation of a shower and changing room for the Minister's sole use, surely cannot be justified.  Of course, the sum of £100,000 is very small beer compared with the colossal and outrageous expenditure of £17 million on the Taoiseach's palace at Upper Merrion Street, but it is totally unjustified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Department of Defence has £100,000 or so to spare, there is a number of ways this money could be better spent, such as on the provision of proper blank ammunition to enable <Col N="2061" /> military manoeuvres to be carried out in a proper fashion.  This ludicrous situation has already been raised in the House and has been admitted by the Minister.  Better still, why not use the money saved to make some improvement in the scandalous conditions of many Army barracks throughout the country?</P>
    <P>Obviously the Minister gives priority to luxury office accommodation for himself over the basic necessities for our Army. Let there be no doubt about the importance of our Army and its role in securing the safety of this State from outside aggression or internal subversion and the importance of the training they receive before they go on peace-keeping duties. This blatant overspending is another example of the arrogant way in which this Government are operating.  I call on the Minister to call a halt immediately to this unnecessary scheme.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to refute this outrageous allegation.  The suggestion made by Deputy Garland is simply not true and I consider that it is grossly irresponsible of him to make such a suggestion.  It is typical of the type of nonsense indulged in by the Deputy without any basis in fact.  This mistaken idea was first mooted, as far as I am aware, in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> of last Sunday, 1 December.  I was astonished at that report which was a distortion of the correct position.  I already issued a public statement of rebuttal yesterday. This rebuttal was given considerable publicity and was repeated on both the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo;.  I was, therefore, appalled that the Deputy should resort to this scandalous allegation.  A simple check with me by the Deputy could have immediately made clear to him that there is no substance in the suggestion that I even contemplated any works on my private offices at the Department of Defence of the order of £100,000 value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The factual position is that I raised with the Office of Public Works the possibility of having certain essential repair and maintenance work carried out.  This is a <Col N="2062" /> very old building and constant maintenance is required.  For example in the past week a badly leaking radiator pipe necessitated urgent attention, including the lifting of a watersodden carpet to remedy the situation in one of my offices, an office not occupied by myself but by staff.</P>
    <P>For the record I wish to make it clear that I would not under any circumstances countenance the expenditure of a sum of the order mentioned by Deputy Garland or the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> on my private offices, nor is there any question of redoing work undertaken by my predecessor in office.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would just like to say that Deputy Garland should be ashamed of himself coming into the House here with such a suggestion obviously endeavouring to obtain some cheap publicity.</P>

I am calling the Deputies I have selected in the following order: Deputy Ted Nealon and Deputy Austin Deasy.  Each Deputy is entitled to two minutes in respect of each matter and each of the statements will be followed immediately by a two minute reply by the appropriate Minister or Minister of State.</P>

      <P>I have the greatest admiration for the fishermen of Killybegs. I met them many times and I filmed with them when I was in television. They are hardworking and enterprising, they are the industry leaders in seeking new fishing grounds, in introducing new equipment and in pursuing new ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are exceptions.  It is very hard for anyone to admire the activities of the Killybegs based tank boats that fish illegally within the limits of Killala Bay and Sligo Bay at great cost to the livelihoods of the local lobster and crab fishermen.  These Killybegs based fishermen are the Long John Silvers of the <Col N="2063" /> lobster pots.  They come inside the legal limits allowed them in search of mackerel and herring, they even come inside the base lines of the bays.  Not only are these encroachments illegal, they are contrary to the specified conditions in their licences.  They operate with two boats towing very heavily weighted nets and they simply take up all the lobster and crab pots of the local fishermen that come in their trawl, leaving behind them wakes of destruction.</P>
    <P>Our local fisherman lost 29 lobster and crab pots on one day recently and on one day last year the same fisherman lost 100 lobster and crab pots &mdash; each pot costs between £40 and £45.</P>
    <P>The result is that the fishermen of Killala and Sligo Bays have not only to watch the weather, the tides and the times, they now have to try to calculate when the greatest hazard of all, the Killybegs based tank boats, will make their forays into their theoretically reserved territory.</P>
    <P>The overall result is that most of the Killala and Sligo fishermen now stop fishing in early September to avoid the new man generated hazard.  When a few years ago there would have been about 100 fishermen out at their lobster and crab pots, there are only five or six out there now.</P>
    <P>The Killybegs based boats come so close to the shore that they have been photographed, names and all.  Videos have been made of them.  The local fishermen have been promised that the Naval Service would patrol the area.  However, as far as I know, no action has been taken against the tank boats.</P>
    <P>I know the Department of the Marine have met with both sides in this dispute but I have to report that the Sligo and Killala fishermen have lost patience and, I am afraid, confidence in the Department. The law is clear.  There are clearly defined limits of operations.  There are specified conditions in the licences of the tank boats.</P>
    <P>No one wants to curtail the Killybegs fishermen in their legitimate pursuit of <Col N="2064" /> what they can catch; but, obviously, they cannot continue while fishing illegally to do wanton damage to the lobster and crab pots in Killala and Sligo Bays and to the livelihoods of those men who fish them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Marine is fully aware of the problems which have arisen in the areas mentioned by the Deputy and emphatically rejects the suggestion by the Deputy that there has been a failure by his Department to deal with these problems.  On the contrary the Department of the Marine, on his personal instructions have devoted considerable time and effort in trying to resolve what is a very difficult issue which is essentially a conflict between different uses and users of the marine areas concerned. In this regard I should mention that a significant proportion of the tank boats in question have legal rights to be within the limits referred to.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say, however, that, due to the initiative taken by the Department of the Marine progress is being made.  In particular, at a meeting on 20 September last, attended by representatives of the Killala and Killybegs fishermen and chaired by the Department of the Marine a code of practice designed to address the problems associated with this matter was agreed by both groups.</P>
      <P>Agreement was reached on the placing and marking of static gear at sea and on the procedures to be followed to minimise the possibility of such gear being damaged by trawlers.  In addition, the code of practice provides for a mechanism through which claims for gear lost can be processed.  Within this mechanism a local committee was to be established in Killala to vet claims on behalf of Killala Co-op members who had lost gear.  I understand that a meeting of the committee is planned for Monday next, 9 December, to consider a recent claim in respect of lost gear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would like to stress that the Minister for the Marine intends to monitor developments in this matter very <Col N="2065" /> closely in the coming months and is prepared to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that both trawlermen and static gear fishermen work together to resolve any further problems that may arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will be to the point and reasonable.  I wish to protest at the refusal of the Department of the Marine to grant a licence to fish for herring and mackerel to Mr. Richard Power of Dunmore East, County Waterford in respect of his 66 foot boat, the <i>Star of Nazareth.</i> I should point out that up to last year Mr. Power owned three fishing boats, the <i>Stelimar, the Exodus</i> and the <i>Jonara</i>.  He has sold the <i>Exodus</i> and the <i>Jonara,</i> both of which were 53 feet long.  The <i>Stelimar</i> was badly damaged by fire off Dún Laoghaire on 13 August.  One of the crewmen died as a result of the fire.</P>
      <P>Those three boats belonging to Mr. Power had a licence to fish for herring and mackerel in the Celtic Sea.  Mr. Power sold the two smaller boats and purchased the <i>Star of Nazareth</i>, which is 66 feet long, but he cannot now get a licence to fish for herring and mackerel for that boat although he surrendered the licences for the two other boats on the assumption that he would get a licence for the boat he purchased from Bord Iascaigh Mhara at a cost of £200,000, plus a grant of £153,000 from FEOGA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This man has to use two boats in fishing for herring, a process which is known as pair fishing.  When the <i>Stelimar</i> for which he has a licence is back at sea he will need a licence for the <i>Star of Nazareth</i> to help him earn a living from herring fishing.  It seems incomprehensible that a man who surrendered two licences cannot get one in return.  I ask the Minister of State to see to it that an Irish fisherman using a <Col N="2066" /> Irish built boat, which has been grant-aided by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, is given an entitlement to fish with the <i>Star of Nazareth</i> given that previously he had permission to fish with two boats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for the Marine, I should explain that this case involved the sale of an existing boat within the fleet and, as the boat is over 65 feet in length, the issue of a new fishing boat licence was necessary. In such cases, under current licensing policy, new licences to fish for herring and mackerel are only granted where the vessel in question had an entitlement to fish and an active history of fishing for these species.  The purpose of this policy is to restrict growth in the catching capacity of the pelagic sector of the fleet where there is already over capacity.</P>
      <P>The facts of this case are that the <i>mv Star of Nazareth</i> was purchased by Mr. Richard Power in November 1990.  In early December 1990, he applied for a sea fishing boat licence in respect of the boat.  In his application he included herring and mackerel as species which he proposed to fish.  At no stage prior to making this application or purchasing the boat did Mr. Power raise with the Department of the Marine the question of whether the boat should be licensed to fish for herring and mackerel.  While the boat had an entitlement to fish for herring and mackerel it had no history of fishing for either of these species.  Accordingly, when a sea fishing boat licence was issued to Mr. Power it included a condition precluding fishing for herring and mackerel. Subsequently, Mr. Power appealed the decision.  The original decision was confirmed in a letter to Mr. Power.  Current policy in the matter was explained also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to a proposal from Mr. Power, however, it was agreed as an interim measure that the entitlement to fish for herring contained in the licence of a second boat owned by him, the <i>mv Stelimar</i> should be transferred to the <i>Star of Nazareth</i>.  The <i>Stelimar</i> had recently been damaged and was expected to be <Col N="2067" /> out of service for about eight months. This arrangement which is regarded as a temporary measure is due to expire on 31 December 1991.  As a result of this measure, Mr. Power has been able to take part in the autumn herring fishing season in the Celtic Sea.  If, on the expiry of this arrangement, the <i>Stelimar</i> is still out of commission the Minister for the Marine will be prepared to consider an extension of this temporary measure for a further limited period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A pilot project on the development of a psychological service for primary schools was initiated by my Department in September 1990 in two designated areas.  The two areas are west <Col N="1804" /> Tallaght/Clondalkin in Dublin and south Tiperary.  There are 33 schools with just under 15,000 pupils in the west Dublin area of the project and 90 schools with just under 13,000 pupils in south Tipperary.</P>
    <P>Currently there are six psychologists working on the project and a further psychologist is to be appointed in the near future.</P>
    <P>As the project is for three years beginning in September 1990 it is not proposed to add to the number of participating schools in 1992.  An independent evaluator has been appointed to assess the project and I will consider the feasibility of extending the service in the light of experience of the project.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to comments attributed to a District Justice in the <i>Evening Herald</i> on 31 October 1991.</P>
      <P>The centre in question is Oberstown Boys Centre which was opened on 30 September 1991, and currently has authority to hold ten boys on remand and a further four boys on long term detention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This centre is not intended to operate as a secure facility in the sense in which, for example, Trinity House provides <Col N="1807" /> secure accommodation.  Rather, it offers a less restrictive regime for those young offenders for whom the more secure arrangements of Trinity House are not considered necessary.  It is important that this varied level of response be available to meet the particular needs of the boys involved.</P>
    <P>The incidents referred to were confined to the remand unit in Oberstown Boys Centre and thus only involved boys who were awaiting sentence by the courts.  It is unfortunately a recognised feature of the remand situation that such boys display a particular level of hostility towards the system.  However, once the remand period is completed and decisions on the boys' future have been taken, the experience is that earlier aggressive behaviour tends not to be repeated to the same extent.</P>
    <P>It is the view of management at the centre that the incidents referred to were not motivated by a desire to abscond but rather constituted a pre-meditated attempt to inflict maximum damage on the centre and to test the response of staff to this situation.  As the incidents mentioned were contained within the remand unit, the absence of a fence around the centre is not considered to be a relevant issue.</P>
    <P>While it is regrettable that such incidents take place, it must also be recognised that the nature of the problem being addressed by the centres is such that difficulties of this nature cannot be entirely removed.</P>
    <P>I will of course be keeping the operation of Oberstown Boys Centre under constant review to ensure that it is in a position to fully meet the demands being placed upon it.</P>
    <P>I would also like to take this opportunity to compliment the staff at the centre on their professionalism in dealing with these difficult situations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 39, 61, 67, 76 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>In July 1989, all second level schools were informed of the intention to introduce a new technology programme on a phased basis in a selected number of schools in the 1989-90 school year, and to extend the option progressively in subsequent years to other schools.  It was to be a developmental programme which would be amended or refined in the light of experience.  The number of schools at present approved by the Department to include technology in their programme is 148.</P>
      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment were requested to examine the position of the subjects materials technology &mdash; wood, technical graphics and metalwork particularly in their relation to the subject technology in the junior cycle.</P>
      <P>A position paper on this topic has been prepared for consideration by the council. The paper, which has not been formally submitted to me, deals also with the provision which might be made for technological education at senior cycle.</P>
      <P>I understand that the council have not yet considered the paper in any depth and I am awaiting the considered views of the council in the matter before coming to any definitive conclusions.</P>

      <P>There is no specific provision in existing EC law enabling member states to take Community action in the field of education.  However, Community action in the field of vocational training is provided for in Article 128 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
      <P>The new draft Treaty on political union, which will amend some of the provisions of existing treaties, contains a composite article replacing Article 128 and providing for Community action in both fields.  Among the areas proposed for joint action in the field of education are: the European dimension in education; mobility of students and teachers; co-operation between schools; and distance education.</P>
      <P>The draft article was considered and approved by the Ministers for Education meeting in Council in Brussels on 25 November.</P>

      <P>The Department of Education have co-operated over the years with many agencies such as the Department of Health, regional health boards, the National Youth Council, the Mater Dei Adolescent Counselling Centre as well as with parents and voluntary groups seeking to support schools in the introduction of programmes on substance abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to develop further initiatives in this area the Departments of Education and Health have initiated a pilot <Col N="1815" /> project in eight post-primary schools with the aim of developing educational resource materials for schools on substance abuse.  These materials will deal with the misuse of alcohol as well as solvents, tobacco and other substances. The project will include the development of associated in-service training for teachers.  It is planned to disseminate the materials and the results of the project to all post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the schools have been making every effort to develop programmes in the area of substance abuse and that the new project I have mentioned will up-date these efforts and ensure that support for schools is available on a countrywide basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1983 a site was offered by the school authorities for the proposed new national school at Shercock, County Cavan. Tender documents were prepared but it was not possible to proceed with the project as planned because of my Department's policy introduced in 1987 of concentrating the available capital <Col N="1822" /> resources on essential classroom accommodation and other basic facilities.  In 1989 it was agreed that the new school should proceed in accordance with the policy outlined and tender documents for this project are now virtually completed. The question of the invitation of tenders arises for consideration in the context of the 1992 budgetary situation.  Until the capital allocation for primary schools' building has been established, I will not be in a position to say when tenders will be invited or a contract placed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58, 92 and 261 together.</P>
      <P>The publication and sale of school books are in the hands of private companies and it is not open to me to influence their pricing policy.  However, I am very conscious of the financial demands made on parents of school pupils in providing school textbooks for their children.</P>
      <P>In an effort to alleviate this burden my Department already have in operation a scheme of aid towards the cost of school books for needy pupils.  This now amounts to £4 million annually.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with this scheme my Department have advised management authorities to implement a school policy, in co-operation with parents, which would ensure the efficient use of school books and minimise the cost for parents.</P>
      <P>My Department have, on a number of occasions, advised school authorities that selected textbooks should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary.</P>
      <P>The syllabus planners therefore, try to avoid over-frequent changes and are conscious that they should avoid any unnecessary increase in costs.  However, textbooks must be changed on occasion if teachers are to keep their work educationally stimulating and if content and methodology are to be kept reasonably up to date.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's question concerning a meeting with book publishers to discuss the cost of school textbooks, I wish to state that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment are in contact with the publishers on an on-going basis and this is one of the matters which is receiving consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme of aid towards the cost of school books for needy pupils in primary schools was extended in 1991 to <Col N="1825" /> encompass, for the first time, infant classes.  The 1991 provision also allowed for an increase of 10 per cent in the rate of grant for pupils in Standard I-IV.</P>
    <P>There was an overall increase in the provision for the scheme of £284,000 to provide for the changes referred to above.  The total allocation for 1991 for the free book scheme for primary schools was £1.447 million which represented an increase of more than 24 per cent over 1990.  My Department will continue to keep the scheme under review.</P>

      <P>The arrangement initiated by the Government with the universities under its 1990 budget whereby the universities will provide not less than an extra 3,600 undergraduate places over a three to four year period is currently running above the annual target of 1,200 additional places.</P>
      <P>The acquisition of Carysfort College by UCD will allow the UCD authorities to provide an extra 600 plus undergraduate places at their Belfield campus. About 200 of these extra students were enrolled this year.</P>
      <P>A programme for the utilisation of spare capacity in the colleges of education is well under way.  The amalgamation of Thomond College with the University of Limerick will provide an extra 600 places and the recently agreed institutional linkages between that university and Mary Immaculate college will provide a further 600 undergraduate places, as postgraduate places.</P>
      <P>In this context too, discussions are ongoing between the authorities of Dublin City University and St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra regarding similar institutional linkages between their two institutions, and I look forward to a fruitful outcome.</P>
      <P>The provision of the new regional technical college in Tallaght supported by EC Structural Funds, will provide 1,200 places and a new building to be provided at the University of Limerick with private sector financial participation will provide a further 1,000 places.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the well known research into class size which indicates that stress in teachers increases and pupil learning decreases when class numbers are above twenty, while smaller numbers would increase benefits; and if, in view of the fact that the 1990 survey showed that a very high proportion of primary teachers would rather be doing some other job, he will consider making regulations which would introduce greater flexibility into the system so that the greatest benefit can be obtained from actual time spent in the classroom.</Quest>

      <P>Any demanding job will give rise to a degree of stress and teaching is no exception. I am not certain to which particular piece of research the Deputy is referring but I would draw his attention to the report of the OECD examiners on Education Policy in Ireland which states:</P>
      <P>It is notoriously difficult to determine what is the ideal PTR and, in turn, class size.  There is certainly no corelation between the ratio and the performance of pupils.  Thus, Japanese pupils come out best in international comparisons of academic attainment and yet the ratio in Japan is higher than in many other OECD countries.</P>
      <P>I am assuming that the 1990 survey to which the Deputy refers is the one commissioned by the teachers' unions to identify the principal sources of stress among teachers, the effects of stress on their lives and possible remedies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to my information, a total of 2,759 teachers were surveyed and the response rate was 55.3 per cent.  If it is on this basis that the Deputy is inferring that a high proportion of primary <Col N="1829" /> teachers would rather be doing another job, he is doing a great disservice to the teaching profession.  Again, to quote the OECD report &ldquo;Most practising teachers have few reservations about their own professional competence and their good standing in society.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, improved staffing arrangements for national schools which took effect from the beginning of the current school year were aimed at reducing overly large classes as well as meeting the needs of the disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 90 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children with special needs who are attending mainsteam education are provided for in a number of ways.  The largest category of such pupils, those in need of remedial tuition, receive the support of <Col N="1833" /> 945 remedial teachers operating within the primary school sector.  These include the 80 additional remedial posts allocated in the current year under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  In all, more than 1,400 primary schools now have a remedial service either on a full-time or shared basis.</P>
    <P>In addition, 30 visiting teachers have to date been dedicated to providing additional tuition to children suffering from visual and hearing impairment.  An additional six posts are now being added to this service as part of a process of developing a generic service which will embrace other clinical groups.  As a first step in this process, arrangements are being finalised for the extension of the expanded visiting teacher service to cover Down's Syndrome children.  While information on the total number of Down's Syndrome children is not readily available, data provided by the Down's Syndrome Association of Ireland on the locations of Down's Syndrome children will enable this service to be focused for maximum effect.</P>
    <P>The existing visiting teacher service for travellers' children is also being expanded by the addition of three new visiting teachers in this area and also the appointment of a national education officer for travellers.  This officer will have a central role in promoting, facilitating and co-ordinating the education of traveller children on a national basis.</P>
    <P>As part of a further initiative, seven special resource teachers are being allocated to groups of ordinary primary schools in selected areas.  These schools have a significant number of children with special needs in an integrated setting. The role of the resource teacher will be to act in support of existing teaching staff to ensure that the needs of special pupils are properly addressed.</P>
    <P>The additional remedial teachers referred to have been in place since the commencement of the school year and I expect the additional visiting teachers and resource teachers to be appointed in the near future.</P>
    <P>I consider the above developments to constitute a very positive contribution to <Col N="1834" /> the education of children with special needs.</P>

      <P>In relation to my own Department, draft safety statements have been prepared and are being finalised at present for a number of areas including the Department at Leeson Lane; the Fisheries Research Centre at Abbotstown and Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  Draft safety statements for other areas where Roinn na Mara operate, including my Department's fishery harbour centres, are well advanced.</P>
      <P>As regards the State agencies under my control the position is as follows: The 25 scheduled harbour authorities under the aegis of my Department are solely responsible for the preparation of safety statements under the terms of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, due to the importance of this <Col N="1840" /> Act, my Department have written to each authority (on two occasions this year) to inform them of their responsibilities under the Act and request that they report on their progress in this matter.</P>
    <P>Eight of the harbour authorities do not have any employees and therefore are not subject to the terms of the Act.  The other authorities are at obvious stages in the preparation of their safety statements. It is hoped that the statements in question will be finalised shortly.</P>
    <P>The Central and Regional Fisheries Board have advised my Department that they have proposed and adopted a safety statement.</P>
    <P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara are in the process of preparing a safety statement and I am assured that it will be finalised by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Arramara Teoranta have prepared a safety statement and indeed have had a safety statement in place for 12 months.</P>
    <P>Foyle Fisheries Commission are actively pursuing the completion of a safety statement.  As a cross-Border body, the Commission are also required to comply with Northern Ireland legislation. The commission would hope to be in a position to adopt a safety statement as soon as agreement is reached with all concerned.</P>

    <P>Many of these visits were official visits, where costs are borne by the host country and troika visits, which involves Ministers representing two other member states of the European Community.  It is therefore not practicable to provide complete and individual costings for each of the above journeys.  On each occasion, I was accompanied by the Departmental official(s) relevant to the area of responsibility covered by the visit and, where necessary, by my wife who travelled in <Col N="1843" /> a representational capacity.  On the EC Troika related visits, I was also accompanied by Government representatives and officials from France and Italy, and representatives from the European Commission.  On all but five occasions, when logistical arrangements dictated otherwise, I travelled by Government plane.  The commercial airlines used were British Airways, Saudia Airlines, Air Zambia and South Africa Airlines.</P>

      <P>In the case of an applicant for a <i>certificat de coutume</i> who has been granted a foreign divorce before the coming into operation of the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986, my Department can entertain such an application only if both the applicant and her/his former spouse were domiciled abroad on the date of the institution of the divorce proceedings and had the intention on that date of continuing to reside abroad.  In such a case both spouses are required to provide affidavits <Col N="1844" /> regarding their domicile abroad on the date in question and their intention of continuing to reside abroad.  Such affidavits should normally set out relevant supporting information and be accompanied by proofs of identity and a certified true copy of the divorce decree.</P>

      <P>The only Structural Fund moneys disbursed under the aegis of this Department during the period in question related to the commissioning of the North-West Study.  The study was an economic development report which covered County Donegal and the district council areas of Strabane and Derry.  It was commissioned by the Irish and British Governments and carried out by consultants Coopers and Lybrand.  It was formally launched by the Taoiseach and by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in July 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1845" /> In the first instance, the cost of the study was borne in equal parts by the two Governments.  The Irish Government's contribution was IR£69,614.  The expenditure incurred in this study was reimbursed at a rate of 75 per cent by the European Regional Development Fund. The relevant payments were made to the consultants on an instalment basis between March 1989 and May 1990.</P>

      <P>The amount of unallocated tax awaiting identification and transfer to a specific tax head will fluctuate during the year.  The reasons for fluctuation relate to the ease of identification or otherwise of remittances at any one time.  While the amount of unallocated tax at any one time consists predominantly of income tax and VAT it is not possible to give an analysis of the increase as between November 1990 and November 1991. The change does not represent an increase in yield.</P>

      <Quest>the reason employees of the Irish Sugar Company, now Greencore, were not included in the transfer scheme for pensions; and if, in view of the few members involved and as the Irish Sugar Company is one of the few State companies not included, he will now correct this anomaly.</Quest>

      <P>Since 1980, my Department have operated a scheme whereby service may be transferred, for pension purposes, between participating organisations.  Any organisation, in the public or private sector, is free to join this scheme if it is prepared to accept the obligations of membership, including the liability to make financial contributions where necessary towards the ultimate cost of service transfers.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions since the introduction of the scheme, the Irish Sugar Company were invited to apply for membership, but decided not to do so. I understand that these decisions were based on concerns about the potential cost to the company of participation in the scheme.</P>
      <P>As mentioned previously, membership of the transfer scheme is open to both public and private sector organisations. Accordingly, the fact that Irish Sugar have, as Greencore, become a private company does not mean that they cannot participate in the scheme.  However, the question of applying for membership is a matter to be decided by Greencore themselves.</P>

These are the special Border areas programme, (phase II commenced in 1987), the textiles areas programme, (commenced in 1986) and the CSF technical assistance programme.  In addition they also co-ordinate the applications for European Regional Development Fund assistance in respect of pre-1989 projects which are still in the process of being completed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 to 130, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Due to the nature of the product, the diversity of specifications and the many suppliers, contracts for the provision of window blinds for Government Departments and offices are normally processed under restricted tendering procedures in accordance with the guidelines issued for Government contracts procedures.  In compliance with these procedures, selected firms are invited to tender.  Lists of such firms are reviewed and updated periodically by the furniture service.  The assessment of tenders received is carried out on the basis of price, compliance with specification including standards of workmanship, the quality of components and value for money.</P>

      <P>Woodpigeons breed several times a year from February to December.  During the <Col N="1865" /> summer months woodpigeons are considered both as a quarry and opportunistic or &ldquo;pest&rdquo; species.</P>
      <P>Article 9 of Directive 79/409/EEC permits member states to derogate from the provisions of Article 5, which prohibits deliberate disturbance during the breeding season, where there is no other satisfactory solution, for the following reasons: in the interest of public health and safety, in the interest of air safety, to prevent serious damage to crops, livestock, forests, fisheries and water, and for the protection of flora and fauna.</P>
      <P>Woodpigeons do cause serious damage to crops and hunting is a legitimate and accepted means of control.  The open season for woodpigeon, which is from 1 June to 31 January, is to be reviewed by the Committee for Adaptation to Technical and Scientific Progress set up under Directive 79/409/EEC.  Outside this open season, farmers and their agents may shoot woodpigeons where they are causing damage to crops under derogation in accordance with Article 9.</P>

Under EC rules the applicant is debarred from entering the scheme again for 12 months from the date of the decision.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the IDA that the number of firms attracted to Ireland in the last ten years was 631 and that these firms generated 32,835 new jobs.  Total payments to these companies amounted to £382.55 million.</P>
      <P>IDA calculates cost per job figures on the basis of the number of jobs created and sustained over a seven-year period. The figures for various industrial categories, both overseas and indigenous, are contained in IDA's latest annual report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1876" /> A total of 167 overseas companies closed during this period and payments to these companies totalled £67.143 million. Over the ten-year period 4,813 jobs were lost arising from these closures.</P>
    <P>There are now over 1,000 overseas firms operating in Ireland employing 90,000 people directly.  This is equivalent to 40 per cent of the industrial workforce and represents 50 per cent of manufactured output and three quarters of industrial exports.  Overseas industry also makes a substantial contribution to employment and prosperity in other sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the efforts of the IDA in the attraction of overseas industry to Ireland have been successful.</P>

    <P>The agencies which incurred this expenditure are IDA and SFADCo.</P>
    <P>Since 1989 Structural Funds from the European Commission have provided very important underpinning for the industrial development programmes which are implemented by agencies under my Department.  Significant new initiatives have taken place in the development of our science and technology infrastructure and in developing the marketing potential of indigenous firms.  The programmes in question are set out in the Programme for Industrial Development, 1989-1993.  The numerous individual projects undertaken under these programmes are in the main the responsibility of the agencies concerned.</P>

      <P>I believe that fair and open competition is one of the requirements to the success of an expanding forestry programme and that all parties should operate within these principles.</P>
      <P>Coillte Teoranta does not receive a subsidy for its day-to-day operations including forestry work carried out for other parties and I do not anticipate any change in that position.  I am satisfied that the necessary powers are in the Forestry Act, 1988, and the Competition Act, 1991, to ensure Coillte's compliance with the principles of fair competition.</P>

      <P>Discussions about the possibility of an interconnector with the UK have taken place between ESB and the National Grid Company in the UK at a technical level and a joint report on the matter was drawn up in May 1991.  While the report concluded that an undersea link was technically feasible, the options relating to the characteristics of interconnection and question of the most suitable route are matters which will have to be further considered by both sides.  As I have said on earlier occasions it is my intention subject to technical and economic feasibility and with due regard to timing that such interconnection be carried out.</P>
      <P>Regarding the re-establishment of the North-South interconnector, this matter is reviewed on a regular basis between the electricity utilities on both sides, the ESB and NIE.  However, the question of its re-connection is a security matter, rather than one of technical or economic feasibility; there are no immediate plans for re-connection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles and Deeds that the following is the information requested by the Deputy:</P>
      <P>(1)  The total arrears of cases outstanding at the end of each of the last six months for which records are available was: May, 50,038; June, 50,521; July, 51,057; August, 50,726; September, 50,946; and October, 50,414.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Mapping difficulties as such are not a major contributor to delays in effecting transfers.  The major delay factors include the procedures to be followed and queries to be made when effecting sub-division and the backlog of applications on hand.  Transfers not requiring <Col N="1896" /> sub-division and for which no queries arise are on average processed in four to five weeks.  Other cases where subdivision is involved and where the Land Registry have to issue queries before the application can be processed can take up to 10 months, on average.</P>
    <P>(3)  The total number of Land Commission vestings awaiting completion at the end of October 1991 was 11,384.  As the date of registration is determined by the date of vesting by the Land Commission prior to lodgment in the Land Registry, such cases are not required to be given the priority accorded to other dealings.  However, when urgent cases arise, these are expedited.</P>
    <P>(4)  The number of dealing lodged from 1989 to 1991 is as follows: 1989, 94,760; 1990, 96,249; and 1991, 76,177 (provisional to end of October).</P>
    <P>(5)  The number of applications made for file plans from 1989 to 1991 is as follows: 1989, 77,489; 1990, 82,211; and 1991, 71,110 (provisional to end of October).</P>
    <P>(6)  The number of staff employed in the registries at the end of each of the past five years is as follows: 1986, 500; 1987, 490; 1988, 449; 1989, 473½; and 1990, 503½.  At the end of November 1991 the figure was 519.  The above figures include &ldquo;job-sharers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(7)  Thirty-six heads of staff were assigned to the Land Registry in 1991.</P>
    <P>(8)  The cost of overtime in the registries for the years 1989, 1990 and 1991 was: 1989, £234,321; 1990, £298,894; and 1991, £313,000 (provisional to end of October).</P>
    <P>(9)  The following amounts of fees were received in the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds in the years 1989, 1990 and 1991: 1989, £10,128,908; 1990, £9,690,445; and 1991, £7,916,740 (provisional to end of October).</P>
    <P>(10)  The Land Registry commenced a programme of computerisation in 1982. To date, only the folios in the Dublin areas have been computerised and this has led to a considerable improvement in the speed of response to applications for copy folios and copy file plans.  Folios created in the western region are also <Col N="1897" /> being put on computer as dealings are processed.  A programme of computerising Registry of Deeds Abstracts of Memorials commenced in late 1990.</P>
    <P>A firm of management consultants was commissioned by the Registrar of Titles and Deeds in 1990 to produce a strategic plan to link the organisation structure and technology infrastructure to the business goals and objectives of the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds.  The consultants' recommendations were submitted to me in February 1991 and I have approved the implementation over a five year period of the information systems plan recommended by them.  The Land Registry is currently engaged in the implementation of a number of elements of the strategic plan.  External consultants have also been engaged to assist in the preparation of a data model of the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, as a prelude to further computer systems development.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 and 196 together.  I am informed by the Registrar of Titles and Deeds that the number of deeds registered in the Registry of Deeds from 1988 to 1991 was: 1988, 45,562; 1989, 47,857; 1990, 46,892; and 1991, 45,714 (to end of October).</P>
      <P>Records are not maintained in such a way as to make the other information sought by the Deputy readily available and to extract that information would require the expenditure of staff time to an extent which would be unjustified in view of the other more urgent and pressing work that has to be done in the registries.</P>

      <P>In accordance with established practice, the request in this case was made to the accounting officer of the Environment Vote.  The following is the information supplied to the Comptroller and Auditor General by the accounting officer on 23 October last.</P>
      <P>Returns from local authorities indicate that the expenditure on maintenance and management of local authority dwellings was £66.2 million in 1987, £65.6 million in 1988, £63.7 million in 1989 and £66.5 million in 1990.  While there is a small real reduction in the figures, a more substantial reduction did not arise because (i) most of the dwellings sold were those built in more recent years on which little maintenance arose, and (ii) most of the dwellings are being purchased by the annuity method which still involves management costs as the collection of annuities is in many cases on the same basis as rent collection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as 60 per cent of the proceeds of the sales must be used for capital purposes, it has been possible to use £30 million of the receipts from the 1988 <Col N="1906" /> scheme up to end 1990 for the construction of new local authority dwellings in 1990, thus saving the Exchequer £30 million.  Annuities will continue for many years and the annual saving from the 1988 scheme to the Exchequer is about £17 million.</P>
    <P>As regards the Environment Vote, no savings would arise as there was and is no direct provision for the maintenance and management of local authority dwellings for which responsibility rests entirely with local authorities.  The rate support grant in the Vote is a general discretionary grant to local authorities and its division over the eight local authority expenditure programme groups is a matter for each authority.</P>
    <P>Tenant purchase of dwellings in estates built by local authorities is an important factor in improving social stability and responsibility in these areas from which, in the long term, substantial beneficial effects will accrue in terms of reduced public expenditure in other areas.</P>
    <P>Returns from local authorities indicate that the sale of 27,200 dwellings was completed by 31 December 1990 under the 1988 tenant purchase scheme and the proceeds of the sales up to that date amounted to £53.85 million.  Information on sales/receipts during 1991 will not be available until 1992.</P>

      <P>Since 1 January 1991, 29 of the 30 local motor tax offices have been inspected and my Department are not aware of any current irregularities involving loss of public funds in these offices.</P>
      <P>A total of 250 driving licences issued to two licensing authorities were initially unaccounted for, according to local government auditors reports referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General's 1990 report.  Following inquiries made at local level, 100 licences issued to one licensing authority are now accounted for.  Inquiries are continuing into the 150 licences issued to a second authority and still unaccounted for.</P>

The Virus Reference Laboratory, UCD, compiles the statistics on behalf of the Department.  In view of the increasing numbers of persons with HIV, the Department, in conjunction with the Virus Reference Laboratory, are currently developing a system designed to provide such information on a regional basis.  I would point out, however, that in devising the system as a basis for the planning and implementation of services regionally and locally, it is necessary to ensure that it provides accurate information in relation to the prevalence and incidence of HIV in each regional health board area.  This is a complex task due to the confidential and sensitive nature of the data involved.  In general, however the current HIV surveillance system indicate that the majority of cases are reported from Dublin and Cork.</P>

    <P>Research on suicide here has tended to concentrate on suicide rates and on the accuracy of reporting systems but two recent Irish studies; <i>Suicide in Cork and Ireland</i> by Michael J. Kelleher and Maura Daly &mdash; British Journal of Psychiatry (1990) 157, 533-538 and <i>Suicide in Schizophrenia</i> by Mary Cannon, Peter Buckley and Conall Larkin &mdash; Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine (1991) 8, 19-21, have suggested that the following may be relevant as causitive factors: (1) an increase in &ldquo;anomie&rdquo; shown by a rise in the rates of crime, illegitimacy and admissions to hospital for alcoholism; (2) a decline in social cohesion shown by a fall in the marriage rate and a rise in the number of separated couples; (3) high levels of unemployment and (4) psychiatric illness.</P>
    <P>It is also generally recognised that worries about health or financial matters can be causitive factors in suicide.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 245,246 and 257 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my predecessor's reply on 30 November 1989 to Question No. 93, regarding the provision of a new national school at Allen, Kilmeague, Naas, County Kildare.  My Department have since reviewed the matter and the provision of a new block of four permanent classrooms has been approved for the site which has been made available by the school authorities. This new block will serve as a supplement to the three relatively new prefabricated classrooms and an older prefab will no longer be required.  This proposal has been the subject of correspondence from the school authorities.</P>
      <P>The preparation of a sketch plan for the project is in hands and this will be completed at the earliest possible date when it will be sent to the school authorities to enable them to apply for local authority planning permission.  Allowing for the time needed to (1) secure planning permission, (2) prepare tender documents and (3) invite and examine tenders it is unlikely that any grant expenditure would be incurred on this case in 1992.</P>

      <P>Physical education forms part of the primary <Col N="1928" /> school curriculum.  It is the responsibility of the principal teacher, in consultation with the school staff, to outline a plan of work for the school as a whole and to ensure that each area of the curriculum is adequately dealt with in all classes.</P>
      <P>The Primary Curriculum Review Body made certain recommendations in regard to physical education.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, which has been asked to advise in relation to curricular developments arising from the review body's report, will have regard to these recommendations.</P>
      <P>The Rules and Programmes for Secondary Schools state that physical education should form part of the curriculum and that the programme should be based on the approved syllabus.  In the approved syllabus in physical education it states that a basic minimum of two hours per week is required to implement the programme.</P>
      <P>Outdoor playing facilities have always been a feature of the general education provision in this country.</P>
      <P>With regard to indoor facilities, in recent years it has been necessary to devote the available resources to the construction of the most urgently needed classroom accommodation.  As a result, the building of general purpose rooms in primary schools has had to be deferred for the present.  At post primary level, however, the plans for new schools and major extensions continue to include physical education halls with the intention that their general provision would resume as soon as resources permit.  My Department encourage maximum co-operation between educational and community entities in the use of available resources, including sport and physical education facilities.</P>
      <P>Further specific provision for physical education will be considered within the limits of the available capital and having regard to other commitments and priorities.</P>

      <i>Notes</i>
    </P>
    <P>(1) Under the special Border area programme, a total of £8 million approximately was made available for tourism amenity projects over the period 1986 to 1990.  Apart from the amount of £0.156 million which was paid to Bord Fáilte in 1988 the funds are paid directly by the Department of Finance to the promoting agencies, mainly local authorities.  Over the period 1988 to 1991 a total of £547,396 was paid to Bord Fáilte for tourism promotional initiatives undertaken by local tourism interests.</P>
    <P>(2) Responsibility for the administration of the operational programme for Tourism, 1989-1993 rests with four agencies viz: The Office of Public Works, Bord Fáilte, SFADCo and CERT.  The Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications is the national authority in charge of programme management and co-ordinates all matters relating to the financial management, monitoring and control of the programme.</P>
    <P>As the programme was not launched until January, 1990 no actual expenditure was incurred during 1989.  The table above shows expenditure on European Regional Development Fund and ESF moneys in 1990 and forecast expenditure for 1991.</P>
    <P>Matching funds for this expenditure are provided by, among others, the Office of Public Works, local authorities and regional tourism organisations in the case of Sub-programme 1 (public sector projects) and by the private sector for Sub-Programme 2.  CERT provides matching funding in respect of Sub-Programme 3.  Matching funds are not provided by the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1945" />
      <Col N="1946" /> As the tourism agencies are responsible for appraising and approving grant applications under the programme, lists of project approvals are available from them.</P>
    <P>(3) Matching funds for the programme are provided essentially by the implementing agencies viz: Aer Rianta, Regional Airport authorities and CIE.  Matching funds are only provided by the Department in respect of certain studies undertaken under the Technical Assistance Programme of the Operational Programme on Peripherality e.g. Access Transport Study (£0.6 million in 1990) and the Dublin/Belfast Railway Line Study (£0.03 million forecast for 1991).</P>
    <P>A list of projects financed under the Operational Programme on Peripherality will be furnished to the Deputy shortly.</P>
    <P>(4) No matching funds are paid by the Department in respect of the STAR and non-STAR infrastructure and awareness/publicity telecommunications projects.</P>
