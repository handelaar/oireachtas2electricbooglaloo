      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that part-time workers who are normally expected to work for at least eight hours a week for an employer and have completed 13 weeks continuous service with the employer, will enjoy the same protection under labour legislation as full-time workers.  By &ldquo;labour legislation&rdquo; I mean the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1990, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 and 1984, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 and 1988, the <Col N="1997" /> Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, 1984 and 1990, and the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.  I am accordingly in this short Bill amending seven separate sets of enactments.</P>
    <P>It is as well for me to emphasise at the very outset that all workers including part-time workers are already covered by labour legislation which deals with occupational safety and health, employment equality and the payment of wages. Their exclusion from the Acts which I mention is the result of the weekly hours threshold of 18 hours contained in those Acts or in the case of the Holidays Act, a threshold of 120 hours a month or 1,400 hours a year.  By shifting the threshold from 18 to eight hours I achieved the dual goal of bringing the very great majority of the unprotected part-time workforce within the protection of the law and, at the same time, of moving the threshold to a point so low that there will be little incentive for employees to create new contracts below that threshold, as has happened in the past.</P>
    <P>This is the third occasion in about two years on which we are having a major discussion in this House on part-time workers.  It was quite clear to me on the last two occasions that there was considerable concern that such workers were treated differently from full-time workers, particularly under labour law. In the interim, I concluded my discussions with both sides of industry and with other interests and was able to put my proposals before this House on 18 December last.  I am pleased at the initial reception which they have received.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have welcomed the publication of the Bill and have accepted that it is broadly in line with the Congress demand for equal rights for part-time workers.  I look forward to a constructive debate on the proposals, and eventually their passage by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies who participated in the previous discussions on the protection of part-time workers emphasised the need <Col N="1998" /> to move beyond labour law and to comprehend also the treatment of part-time workers under social security.  It was never the intention of the Government to deal with both matters in the same Bill: that would be a recipe for confusion. The Minister for Social Welfare has, in recent days, abolished the 18 hours' threshold which hitherto applied and provided social security cover to all employees earning £40 or more per week. In this way many part-time workers, for the first time, will be entitled to claim weekly payments from the Department of Social Welfare because of illness, unemployment or maternity.</P>
    <P>By way of introduction I would like to focus on four main themes: the extent and the nature of the growth of part-time work; the characteristics of part-time workers including the important gender dimension; the present situation of part-time workers under labour legislation and the need to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the real needs of firms which require greater flexibility in the organisation of production and on the other, workers' needs for stability and society's concern that particular categories of workers should not be discriminated against.</P>
    <P>The labour force survey of 1975 provides the first set of data on part-time work in Ireland.  Between that year and 1989, the most recent year for which we have data, the number of part-time workers increased from 71,500 to 82,000. Although this represents an increase of 10,500 part-time jobs over 14 years, or 15 per cent over the 1975 level, the proportion of persons working part-time in Ireland has remained relatively unchanged.  In 1975 part-time workers represented about 6.7 per cent of those with an occupation and the share in 1989 was only slightly larger at 7.5 per cent.  It has not been a steady growth, moreover, but a fluctuating one with part-time workers accounting for 7.3 per cent of persons with an occupation in 1977, 5.1 per cent in 1979, regaining in 1983 the 1975 level of 6.7 per cent and peaking in 1988 at 7.8 per cent before declining slightly in 1989.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1999" /> There have, however been a number of important changes over that period. One of the most important is the distinction made in the labour force between &ldquo;regular&rdquo; and &ldquo;occasional&rdquo; part-time workers.  Regular part-time employment has increased very significantly since 1975 when it stood at 42,500.  In 1989 that figure was 70,000.  The lesson which we can draw from this is that part-time work is becoming a more permanent feature of the labour market.</P>
    <P>There are two further points of note concerning the composition of the part-time labour force.  One is the change over time in the sectoral composition.  In 1975 one in three part-time jobs was in agriculture, forestry and fishing.  That figure has now declined to one in seven.  Commerce &mdash; which includes retail distribution, banking and business services &mdash; and professional services both increased their share largely at the expense of agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is in the services sector that the most significant change in part-time work has taken place.  In 1975 part-time workers in the service sector made up half of the total part-time labour force.  By 1989 this figure had risen to about three quarters. This increase had been particularly rapid in the eighties and hence it has been in services that the real growth in part-time employment has occurred which has tended to be camouflaged by the static levels of part-time work in manufacturing industry or the falling levels in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The second point relates to the gender dimension of the part-time labour force. Relative to other EC countries, a higher proportion of men work part-time in Ireland.  While an examination of part-time work between 1975 and 1989 demonstrates that it is a predominantly female option there are still a substantial number of men working part-time, albeit for different reasons than women.  Men account for about 30 per cent of all part-time workers and are more likely to work part-time either upon entry to the labour force, possibly to facilitate study or multiple job holding or at an age close to or <Col N="2000" /> following retirement.  In contrast women account for more than three quarters of all part-time workers in the 25-44 age bands which are associated with child rearing.  Over 70 per cent of female part-time workers are married; about 60 per cent of the males are single; about one third of the part-time males were under 25, with a further third aged 25-44.  In the case of females, fewer than one sixth were under 25, more then half were aged 25-44 and about 30 per cent in the 45-64 age group.</P>
    <P>To sum up the scale and trends, part time work and particularly regular part-time work has increased in the last 15 years; while it is a predominantly female option, there are still a substantial number of men working part-time in Ireland, but for different reasons from those of women.  The classic part-time worker is female, aged 25-44 and married with dependent children.  Nearly three quarters of part-time workers are employed in the service sector.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the extent to which Ireland departs from the EC norm in regard to the gender of part-time workers.  That is not the only important difference.  In 1988 the percentage share of part-time employees in relation to all employees in the Community overall was 13.6 per cent.  This ranged from 4 per cent in Greece to 29.4 per cent in the Netherlands.  Other big users of part-time workers were Denmark, 25.5 per cent and the UK, 22.8 per cent.  Ireland, at 8.2 per cent ranked seventh among the EC member states, at slightly above half the European average.  In other words, we have a very low level of part-time work by international standards.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn briefly to what we know about the conditions of part-time workers.  While it would be very wrong to equate part-time with precarious or sub-standard jobs, there is some empirical evidence in Ireland that the hourly earnings of part-time workers tend to be below that of their full-time equivalents. Research by the ESRI disclosed that the low paid part-time workers are predominantly women.</P>
    <P>In general, existing data have not been <Col N="2001" /> able to answer key questions about the work history of part-time workers.  Limited evidence on these issues is provided by the reasons given for working part-time in answers to the labour force survey.  These show that most women work part-time because of family responsibilities or did not want a full-time job; most male part-timers reported that they could not find a full-time job.  But almost 25 per cent of part-time women workers cited inability to find a full-time job as the main reason they were working part-time. These figures do not imply that the negative connotations associated with part-time work do not exist; merely that they are not sufficient to overcome preferences and family responsibilities which at present result in women choosing to work part-time rather than full-time.</P>
    <P>If it is the case, as some researchers have speculated, that part-time workers tend to be limited to moving frequently between low status, low skilled jobs with few fringe benefits, the increased protection of part-time workers under the law and measures to assist them to break into the wider labour market need to be placed high on the agenda.  The major area of concern, as I have already noted from the contributions of Members in earlier debates, relates to part-time employees who are heavily dependent on this form of employment and who are employed permanently or semi-permanently on a part-time basis.  I am concerned that regular part-time workers who are employed on a long term basis are denied entitlement to the most basic protections which are afforded under labour law. This is the inequity which I am seeking to redress.</P>
    <P>The present position is that some labour legislation, for example in the areas of occupational safety and health, employment equality and payment of wages, makes no distinction between full-time and part-time employees.  However, a requirement that the individual must work at least 18 hours per week applies in a number of statutes.  This was originally designed to exclude persons whose employment was of a subsidiary nature or of inconsiderable extent.  This also was <Col N="2002" /> a requirement of social security legislation and will also be removed by my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, by regulations which will come into force on 6 April 1991.  The primary protective employment Acts which currently exclude workers who are not employed for a minimum of 18 hours per week are the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 and 1984, the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 and 1988, the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1990, and to some extent the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, 1984 and 1990.  Based on labour force survey figures, the 18 hours threshold has the effect of excluding approximately 20,000 employees, of whom at least three-quarters are women, from the benefits of the legislation which incorporates that threshold.</P>
    <P>The Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, does not apply an 18 hours eligibility threshold.  Instead it excludes from annual leave entitlement those who do not work at least 120 hours per month or 1,400 hours in the leave year; and in order for a part-timer to gain entitlement to a public holiday, he must work for at least 120 hours in the preceding five weeks. The higher hours thresholds which apply under the Holidays Act have the effect of excluding approximately 45,000 part-timers, of whom 76 per cent are women, from annual leave entitlement, and an estimated 38,000, 78 per cent women, from public holiday entitlement.</P>
    <P>During the detailed and prolonged consultations which preceded my proposals the FIE made clear their reasons that employers want more part-time work. Their reasons relate to changing market conditions and extended hours of opening, particularly in services which cannot be undertaken within the standard working day or week.  The major benefit of part-time work in businesses is that it provides flexibility, allowing the employer to respond to increased competition and the changing demands of customers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2003" /> Further information on the reasons which motivate Irish employers to use part-time work emerges from a survey in course of competition in the Dublin-based European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.  This survey indicates that in this country the introduction of part-time work is more a result of economic considerations &mdash; cost advantages to the employers &mdash; than a response to employees' wishes.  In this respect the position in Ireland is comparable to that in Britain where, of course, part-time work is much more widespread.</P>
    <P>I share with the Social Affairs Commissioner of the European Community the view that in no circumstances can the need for forms of employment relationships such as part-time work be brought into question.  It is quite clear that in this country, as in other Community member states, employment relationships are diversifying considerably in response to international competitiveness and to radical changes in the organisation of production, often stimulated by technological change.  Very often these changes on the demand side of the labour market are accompanied by supply side changes in the matter of workers' aspirations and individuals' needs.</P>
    <P>These developments, it has to be said, have helped to maintain competitiveness and to maintain and to create jobs.  Part-time work meets real needs of firms and seems to satisfy better the aspirations and individual and family needs of a number of workers.  Part-time work can offer a valid and useful entry point to the labour market for people who are excluded from it, although, so far in Ireland, there is little evidence to support that.  Part-time work will for some be a valid and long term employment form, providing them with the flexibility to fulfil the varied demands which they face.</P>
    <P>My objective, therefore, in approaching the thresholds which kept some 20,000 workers beyond the pale of labour legislation, was to ensure that safeguards such as exist for their full-time colleagues also exist to protect part-time workers, <Col N="2004" /> preventing insecurity and segmentation in the labour market and at the same time avoiding the danger of over-regulation which would jeopardise flexibility, hinder employment growth, and drive some of those jobs into the black economy.</P>
    <P>The simple strategy which I employed was to extend that legislation to those who worked eight hours or more a week and had completed 13 weeks with the same employer, that is to say, to regular part-time workers.  Regular part-time workers would be treated similarly to full-time workers in relation to all the various statutory rights and would have to fulfil the same service and other conditions as full-time workers to become eligible for those rights.</P>
    <P>I have decided to retain a threshold of eight hours.  There are arguments for the elimination of all thresholds.  In choosing to retain a threshold and to cast it at eight hours a week I was influenced by two considerations.  One was the argument by Vasso Papandreou, Social Affairs Commissioner, that her proposed directives on non-standard forms of employment, including part-time work, should not apply to wage and salary earners whose average weekly working hours were less than eight.  The Commissioner's reasoning for the retention of a threshold was perfectly sensible: to rule out any disproportionate administrative costs which could run counter to the objectives sought.  It is instructive that the Commissioner has made it clear that she intends to maintain the idea of a threshold and has, indeed, only in the last few days included an eight hour threshold in her proposals for a directive on a form of proof of an employment relationship. The other consideration which influenced my selection of an eight hour threshold was to limit the possibility of employers deliberately adjusting their working hours to bring them below the new hours threshold.</P>
    <P>Let me explain, now, the terms of the Bill in some detail.  As I have already said, this Bill, although relatively short, attempts the complicated task of amending seven separate sets of Acts.  Because of this, the Bill may seem relatively <Col N="2005" /> obscure and inaccessible to the casual reader.  However, I would like to assure the House that every attempt has been made to simplify the Bill while still ensuring that it achieves its objectives without having other unintended effects on the body of legislation which it seeks to amend.  In passing, I would mention that adequate explanatory literature will be prepared and disseminated when these proposals have been enacted.</P>
    <P>The Bill is structured so as to define &ldquo;regular part-time&rdquo; employees in section 1 and to then apply the various Acts to that group of employees in the subsequent sections.  The complexity which arose when attempting this task was that the specific provisions which currently exclude regular part-timers from each of the enactments vary.  The particular group of individuals who would be categorised as &ldquo;regular part-time&rdquo; employees under one Act would not be identical to the group currently excluded under another Act.  For example, employees are excluded from the Unfair Dismissals Act by virtue of an 18 hour per week requirement but are excluded from the Holidays Act by a 120 hour per month requirement.  Because of this fact, I set out in section 1 each of the &ldquo;excluding provisions&rdquo; which at present prevent &ldquo;regular part-time&rdquo; employees from coming within the scope of each particular Act or set of Acts which it is intended to amend.</P>
    <P>The concept of an &ldquo;excluding provision&rdquo; is the key to understanding the Bill and to avert any confusion I want to clarify it.  What I mean by an &ldquo;excluding provision&rdquo; in section 1 is the provision or provisions which exclude certain workers at present from the seven sets of Acts that I am going to amend.  If workers are excluded from those Acts by virtue of those provisions, and meet the minimum criteria in this Bill they are regular part-time employees.  &ldquo;Regular part-time&rdquo; employees, the target group of this Bill, are therefore defined as those who have at least 13 weeks' service, are normally expected to work at least eight hours per week and who are not at present covered by the relevant enactment because of an <Col N="2006" /> excluding provision.  As I have already argued, I felt that the minimum qualifications of eight hours per week and 13 weeks service were the appropriate thresholds to define the group of regular part-timers who could and should benefit from the protection of labour law.</P>
    <P>In introducing a 13 week threshold in the Bill it was the intention that this would ensure that students and other short term temporary part-time employees would not be covered by the Bill and that the Bill would not create a disincentive to such short-time periods of employment.  The 13 week period ensures on the one hand an element of commitment or permanence on the part of the regular part-time employee and, on the other hand, that casual or occasional workers will still be largely excluded from the provisions of the protective legislation involved.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the 13 week qualification period under the Bill could not be abused and used as an artificial barrier to exclude regular part-time employees by offering them employment for repeated periods of less than 13 weeks, I decided, as set out in section 2, to calculate the 13 weeks in accordance with the First Schedule to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  This is the mechanism used to calculate continuous service for full-time employees and since its inception in the early seventies, has proved to be an effective and satisfactory method of determining continuity.  Where any disputes arise in this respect the employees will be able to put the case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for determination.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention in passing that because of changes in the insurability of part-time workers which have been brought about by the Minister for Social Welfare it will be necessary for me to adjust and update accordingly the references in the definition of an excluding provision in section 1 and this I will do on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 2 specifies that where a service qualification of 13 weeks or longer already applies in an Act which this Bill seeks to extend to regular part-time <Col N="2007" /> employees, then the original 13 weeks which is required under this Bill, to qualify as a regular part-time employee, will count towards the longer service period. An example of this arises under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, where an employee must have one year's service to be fully covered by the Act.  Under this Bill the regular part-timers' first 13 weeks will count towards the one year requirement.  This provision in the Bill is justifiable on equity grounds but, in any event was considered necessary to avoid confusion and to reduce administrative difficulties which might arise if the 13 week qualifying period were not to be incorporated in the longer service requirement.</P>
    <P>While the first 13 weeks of employment will count towards longer service periods it will not confer any other benefits or rights under the various Acts.  Section 2 (3), for instance, ensures that no entitlement to holidays will be built up in the initial 13 week period.  If this were not provided for, a real cost barrier to employment beyond 13 weeks would be created, leading to a reduction in regular part-time employment opportunities. Some employers who would on the beginning of the fourteenth week of employment become liable for a back dated holiday entitlement might be tempted not to retain people beyond that time and section 2 (3) is intended to prevent this disincentive to regular part-time employment.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is a key provision.  This provides for the application of all the relevant Acts to regular part-time employees, with the exception of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.  In other words section 3 (1) extends to regular part-time employees the benefits of the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1990, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 and 1984, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 and 1988, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981 and the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Acts, 1984 and 1990. <Col N="2008" /> Because of the definition of regular part-time employee which has been used in section 1 of the Act it is possible for me to extend in this clear and simple provision all of these Acts to the target group on essentially the same basis as they are applied to full time employees.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 3 (2) was necessary because of the structure of the social insurance system but will require reconsideration in the light of the change in that structure as a consequence of the Social Welfare (Employment of Inconsiderable Extent) Regulations, 1991, signed by my colleague the Minister for Social Welfare on 14 February.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 3 are very important as they give regular part-time employees the protection of basic labour laws which have been built up in the State over the last 25 years and which are relied upon by most other workers to regulate and protect their employment.  Regular part-time employees have been very vulnerable to exploitation and when this has arisen they have not been able to call on the basic legal protection that exists for other workers.  For example, a regular part-time employee could be employed for ten or 15 years with the same employer, giving sterling service and could then be let go at the whim of the employer.  Those workers could not in the past rely on the Unfair Dismissals Act to protect them, they could not appeal their dismissal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and they had no entitlement to a redundancy payment after their 15 years service.  It is this type of vulnerability which the provisions of the Bill seek to redress.</P>
    <P>Another area of vulnerability arose in relation to female part-time employees who became pregnant.  Women constitute almost three-quarters of the part-time labour force and when these women became pregnant they were not protected from arbitrary dismissal due to their pregnancy as they were not covered by the Unfair Dismissals Act.  Neither were they covered by the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, and hence they had no entitlement to take maternity leave and have their job protected until <Col N="2009" /> their return.  These women either had to give up their job when their baby was born or else hope that the employer would hold the job open for a couple of weeks by which time they might be able to return to work.  This again was inequitable as the same period of maternity leave is clearly required by all women workers.  The provisions of section 3 will now provide that all women regular part-time employees will be entitled to that minimum period of 14 weeks maternity leave enjoyed by other female employees and they will be entitled to have their job held open for that period with full protection from dismissal during the period of maternity leave.  I am sure that the extension of these entitlements will be welcomed by all parties in the House and by the many thousands of women who are working part-time on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the extension of holiday entitlements to regular part-time employees.  Basically, the Bill provides for the application of the provisions of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, to regular part-time employees in the same way as they are applied to full-time employees, with the broad exception of the way in which annual leave entitlements are calculated.</P>
    <P>Under the 1973 Act, employees who work at least 120 hours per month or 1,400 hours per year are entitled to three weeks annual leave.  There is no obvious equivalent to the 120 hour requirement for regular part-time employees as defined in the Bill.  Therefore, the Bill attempts to provide an alternative mechanism which will give regular part-time employees an approximately equivalent level of entitlement to annual leave as full-time employees.  Section 4 (3) (a) provides that regular part-time employees, as defined in the Bill, will be entitled to annual leave at the rate of six hours for every 100 hours worked.</P>
    <P>Other important provisions of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, such as the public holiday entitlement and the method of determining times and pay for annual leave, are being extended under section 4 to all regular part-time <Col N="2010" /> employees.  I regard this section as one of great importance as, in the past, a regular part-time employee could be working year in, year out, without getting any annual holidays or any time off or compensation for public holidays.  This was an intolerable position and it was not correct that people who are permanent members of the labour force should be left open to this form of exploitation. Accordingly, the provisions in section 4 will also be welcomed by all in the House and will safeguard the rights of these employees to an annual holiday and to the public holidays which are at present enjoyed by the vast majority of the labour force.  Because the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973 is a relatively complex Act drafted primarily with the intention of providing entitlements to full-time employees, a number of the provisions of that Act have had to be amended to make them applicable to regular part-time employees.</P>
    <P>I would like to explain the purpose of some of these provisions as they may seem somewhat obscure to some Members.  Section 4 (2) is intended to ensure that provisions in the 1973 Act which are not appropriate to regular part-time employees are not applied to them. Section 4 (3) (b) provides that time spent by regular part-time employees on annual leave shall count as time worked for the purposes of earning annual leave entitlement.  The subsection replaces an equivalent section in the 1973 Act, part of the wording of which is not appropriate in the context of regular part-time employees.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (3) (c) modifies further provisions in the Act of 1973, the wording of which is not appropriate in relation to regular part-time employees.  Under the Act of 1973 a qualifying employee with eight months' service is generally entitled to an unbroken period of leave of two weeks.  Section 4 (3) (c) provides an equivalent entitlement for regular part-time employees.  Because the annual leave entitlement of regular part-time employees is to be reckoned in terms of hours rather than weeks, it is necessary to provide an alternative to the full-timer's <Col N="2011" /> two week entitlement.  The alternative provided in the Bill in section 4 (3) (c) is a choice between the leave entitlement earned over the eight months' period concerned or of two-thirds of the total leave entitlement earned in the year concerned. Either way regular part-time workers will be entitled to an unbroken period away from the workplace as their full-time colleagues are at present.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (3) (d) of the Bill also modifies a provision of the 1973 Act part of the wording of which is not appropriate in relation to regular part-time employees.  Section 5 (1) of the 1973 Act provides for payment of compensation for annual leave due on termination of employment.  However, the method of determining compensation in the 1973 Act is based on the concept of the employee having a &ldquo;qualifying month of service&rdquo;.  This is not applicable in relation to regular part-time employees as under this Bill they will receive entitlement on the basis of six hours for every 100 hours worked.  Accordingly section 4 (3) (d) provides for compensation on a basis which is proportionate to the normal weekly rate of pay.</P>
    <P>There is one further point in relation to section 4 (3) (d) on which I would like to alert the House.  This drafting is not clear as it stands and its meaning would be much clearer if the words &ldquo;in case the cesser occurs during the first half of that year&rdquo; were inserted after the comma in the middle of line 33 of page 6 of the Bill; I will be seeking to have these words inserted on Committee Stage in order to complete the sense of this provision.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (3) (e) modifies a further provision of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, the wording of which is not appropriate in relation to regular part-time employees.  Section 5 (3) of the 1973 Act provides that where employment ceases in the five week period ending before a public holiday and the employee has worked for the employer for at least 120 hours in the part of the <Col N="2012" /> period prior to the cessation of employment, the employer must pay any extra day's pay in respect of the public holiday. There is no obvious equivalent to the 120 hour requirement for regular part-time employees, so instead the Bill provides that they must have worked during at least four of the five weeks prior to the cessation of employment in order to qualify. I feel that this four week requirement for regular part-time employees imposes a similar obligation to the 120 hour requirement in the 1973 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (3) (f) also changes a provision in the 1973 Act, part of the wording of which is not appropriate in relation to regular part-time employees Section 6 (3) (b) of the 1973 Act provides that payment for annual leave should be &ldquo;at the normal weekly rate of remuneration&rdquo;. However, as regular part-time employees are to be granted annual leave at the rate of six hours per 100 hours worked, this Bill provides that they be remunerated &ldquo;at a rate which is proportionate to the normal weekly rate of remuneration&rdquo;.  The concept of the &ldquo;normal weekly rate of remuneration&rdquo; is well established in the 1973 Act and was, therefore, retained as the general basis on which payment will be determined for regular part-time employees in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (4) provides that nothing in this Bill shall have the effect of granting retrospective entitlement to annual leave or public holidays prior to the commencement date of the Bill in relation to the holidays provisions.  The reason for introducing this provision is to prevent part-time employees claiming on the commencement date a retrospective entitlement for holidays.  Such a retrospective entitlement would impose a severe cost burden on certain employers.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides for referral to the Employment Appeals Tribunal of any dispute relating to the 13 weeks continuous service required to qualify as a regular part-time employee.  This is something entirely separate from disputes relating to period of service required under, for example, the Unfair <Col N="2013" /> Dismissals Act or the Redundancy Payments Act, which as far as it concerns regular part-time workers, will continue to be resolved under the mechanisms which are already used to resolve these disputes for employees qualified under the individual Acts.  I believe that this is a fair and equitable way of dealing with disputes in relation to the service of part-timers and it will allow the Employment Appeals Tribunal to examine the specific circumstances of any particular dispute as to whether the employee was a regular part-time employee for the purposes of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 6 simply deals with the regulations which will control how these disputes are referred to and considered by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill are standard.  However, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that a reference to the Unfair Dismissals Act has been accidentally omitted from the collective citations in section 8 and I will be seeking to have it included on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I would simply like to reiterate that the Bill represents a major social advancement through the extension of the whole body of protective labour law and individual employment rights to a substantial category of employees who, heretofore, were vulnerable and increasingly subject to exploitation by unscrupulous employers. The good employer has nothing to fear from this legislation.  It simply extends the rights already enjoyed by the vast majority of employees to this rather marginalised group.  As a well balanced and progressive response to the needs of these employees, I commend the Bill to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael I welcome the fact that we are taking Second Stage of this Bill.  It is long overdue legislation.  It has been a matter of some concern for a considerable time that we have a large number of people in regular part-time employment who find themselves, in a sense, outside the legal <Col N="2014" /> mainstream of the employment protection legislation and labour law provisions that are designed to ensure that people are treated properly in the workplace. This Bill is a welcome measure in so far as it will extend to part-time workers the legal protections that exist under the various pieces of legislation the Minister has referred to.</P>
      <P>It is no exaggeration to say that approximately 20,000 people in the workforce who are known to be part-time workers have been in something of a legal twilight zone or legal limbo and have been left without the protection that is normally afforded to the full-time worker.  Indeed, I suspect that the numbers who will be affected by this legislation are a good deal more than the 20,000 to whom it is thought it will currently apply.</P>
      <P>There are a number of workers currently working part-time who, through employer pressures, do not disclose the fact that they are working part-time as they are working in the black economy or due to the inequities of our tax system, work part-time and receive an undeclared income.  Their existence is not known by Government Departments and they do not appear in the statistics.  That will remain a problem even after this legislation is enacted because while our tax rates remain unnecessarily high and the tax bands remain too close, many people who are working part-time will not declare themselves to be so working and will find themselves falling outside the ambit of this legislation because family pressures and an inequitable tax system will keep them in the black economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe we will solve all our problems in this area with this Bill.  Certainly the Bill is welcome in that it will extend protection to many of whose who are currently unprotected and who are acknowledged and declare themselves to be within the workforce.  The Minister correctly stated that the various surveys show there are currently an estimated 20,000 acknowledged part-time workers. It would not surprise me if the reality was more in the region of 40,000 part-time workers, if one took account of the black <Col N="2015" /> economy and people who do not truthfully respond to such surveys for reasons relating to taxation.  Out of the numbers of either declared part-time workers or those in the black economy, there is absolutely no doubt that a large proportion are female workers.  The statistics show that approximately 70 per cent of those working part-time are women workers.  Many who are working part-time for many years have been regular workers in the employment of small firms or in some instances in the employment of major supermarket chains or local shops in a country town.</P>
    <P>The reality is that many of the things this legislation provides in the context of holiday entitlements and maternity leave are already provided because the good employer has provided those voluntarily to the part-time worker in regular employment for many years.  The good employer with a good part-time employee has recognised that the person he is employing is entitled to holiday periods and maternity leave and is entitled to be treated in the same way as a full-time employee is treated.  This legislation will ensure that the bad employer is required to treat his part-time workforce properly.  In the context of our approach to ensuring that men and women are treated equally within the workforce, it has been my belief for some time that the absence of a provision for maternity leave for part-time workers, as part of our statutory mechanisms, was an issue that could have been raised under the equality provisions of the Rome Treaty.  There is a suggestion that we are in breach of equal treatment provisions both in directives and under the Treaty with regard to the manner in which women should be treated as part of the workforce.  It is quite extraordinary that in the Ireland of the nineties &mdash; until the enactment of this legislation which will take some weeks &mdash; a woman who has been working in a firm for ten or 15 years and who becomes pregnant not only is not entitled to maternity leave if she is a part-time worker, working less than 18 hours a week, but if she takes it, her <Col N="2016" /> employer could simply dismiss her and she would have no redress, no matter how many years she has been working for the employer, if she fell within the part-time workforce.  That is an extraordinary example of inequality and of the lack of social legislation that is very badly needed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this legislation will ensure that the large proportion of women who are part of our part-time workforce will be entitled to proper maternity leave and will not only get the statutory maternity leave but will find that they have all the protections that are extended to full-time workers under the Unfair Dismissals Act.  This type of reform should have been introduced many years ago.</P>
    <P>In the context of maternity leave there are moves in other European countries to provide paternity as well as maternity leave.  Whereas this is not something that is intrinsically relevant to this legislation, as 30 per cent of our part-time workers are also men it is quite justifiable to make the point that at a time when we recognise equality between men and women, when we recognise that husbands and wives as parents have a joint parenting role in relation to their children we should recognise in this House that there is a need for legislation to provide not merely for maternity leave but for paternity leave so that when a baby is born it is possible for both parents to take leave.  There may be circumstances &mdash; these would not arise in all cases &mdash; where a woman returning from a maternity hospital with a baby a few days old requires the support of her husband and his being at home to assist with other young children in the family for at least a number of days if not a number of weeks.  We are accustomed in this country to the extended family helping in such circumstances.  At a time of greater mobility within this country, for example, a young mother and her husband may be isolated in a suburban housing estate in Dublin, and the grandparents of the children may be living in Cork or Kerry with the result that the type of assistance and support she needs is not always available to the mother on <Col N="2017" /> the day she returns from hospital with her baby.  Indeed, it is not always available during the first three or four weeks following the birth of a baby.  Therefore, we would want to look very seriously at the question of paternity leave.  There is provision for such leave in other European countries.  It is something which in the long term will be imposed by Europe.  So much of our legislation in these areas has been imposed by Europe &mdash; the equal pay Act and the equal treatment Acts would not be there without EC Directives. Could we just for once thread a path in this area in the context of paternity leave in which we would take measures and introduce reforms that are not forced on us by the European Commission or our European Community obligations but which we take for their own sake and because they are worth taking?</P>
    <P>In the context of part-time workers I want to raise a hobby horse of mine, that is that maternity leave should apply not only to the young mother who has a baby in hospital and returns home with her baby but should extend also to the mother in circumstances where a child is adopted.  Where a baby or a young child has been adopted it should be acknowledged that the mother who adopts a child should be entitled under our statutory provisions to a period of adjustment with her newly adopted child of exactly the same nature as that extended to the mother who has a baby through pregnancy. That is all part of the necessary, civilising effects of legislation to deal with the total social perspective of family situations. We do not have that.  We have not yet extended our maternity leave provisions to adoptive parents.  The good employer has done this voluntarily in some instances but it should be part of the law.  Some of the 70 per cent of the part-time regular workforce that is female have in the past adopted children and no doubt some will do so in the future.  I would invite the Minister to consider that issue, and to address it in this legislation by way of amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The great importance of this legislation <Col N="2018" /> is in extending employment protection to part-time workers.  Under the unfair dismissals legislation no real protection is extended to a person who has been in regular employment for 15, 20 or 25 years as a part-time worker if they are working below the specific hours provided for in that legislation.  It is only right that someone who has longevity in employment should have extended to them the protections afforded under the Unfair Dismissals Act.</P>
    <P>Part-time work is going to increase. The Minister has very correctly shown that it has not increased to the levels we thought it would but that is due to the changing impacts on our industry in the last ten or 15 years &mdash; the changes in the manufacturing industry, the moving of part-time workers into the service sector. We are going to see a real growth of part-time working in the coming years because of new consumer demands, new flexibility required within the workforce and with people developing a different attitude to work.  We are going to see an increase in both employees and employers opting for part-time work.  It is very important in that context that the Unfair Dismissals Act protections are available to those who find themselves in regular part-time employment.</P>
    <P>Part-time work is a feature of a variety of different social backgrounds.  For example, there is the young mother who wants to work part-time in the mornings to be available in the afternoon with her children when they return from school. There is the person who takes early retirement and who wants to lead an active life by taking regular part-time work in a variety of different types of employment situations that are available at the moment.  There is the mature person who, having been part of the full time workforce, decides that they want to go back to study and who in order to complete a study course will undertake part-time work of a regular nature to maintain themselves and their families during the period of study.  Different types of part-time work are being undertaken and there is still a large amount of <Col N="2019" /> it within the black economy and underclared. It would be my hope that those people who are in the undeclared part-time workforce will become a declared part of it.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that when this legislation is enacted its provisions are given wide publicity in a simplistic form so that those who are in the part time workforce but who, perhaps, are also in the black economy will become aware that as a result of this legislation there are considerable advantages to be gained from coming out from under the covers and declaring themselves to be at work.  The part-time worker who has been working for 16 hours a week has had no particular reason at all to declare their existence until now. If a husband was in employment and his wife got part-time work, the tax system was such that if she declared her income such a large portion of it would have disappeared in tax as to make it completely uneconomical and nonsensical to even remain part of the part-time workforce. Not only were such persons inhibited by tax but they had no real protections in their employment.</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of this legislation there will be protections but that deals only with part of the problem.  The Minister for Finance has a particular role, which he failed to live up to in the budget, to tackle the problems of our tax system and the burdens it imposes on families in the context of the high demands it makes if both members of a family are part of a declared workforce.</P>
    <P>There are some technical difficulties in regard to the legislation.  I do not think it is appropriate on Second Stage to go into any great detail on the technical difficulties in the Bill.  It is very complicated legislation.  Unfortunately it has to be because of the issues to be addressed. One could argue with the Minister or the parliamentary draftsman that there are simpler ways of phrasing things but in this case the Minister had no choice but to introduce the Bill in this form.</P>
    <P>Our labour law legislation is becoming more and more complex.  This Bill now amends six different measures.  In fact it <Col N="2020" /> amends more than six if one takes into account the various pieces of legislation it is amending as well.  The problem is that as that happens, our legislation becomes increasingly incomprehensible to everybody and tends, to give rise to unnecessary disputes because of the obscurity of its provisions.</P>
    <P>There is amending legislation promised to cover unfair dismissals and other matters in the employment equality area.  We are reaching a stage in the labour law area generally where there is a need for consolidating Acts to cover each of the major areas that our labour law legislation addresses.  When it comes to the time to introduce legislation to amend the unfair dismissals legislation and the employment equality legislation I suggest to the Minister that rather than introducing an amending Bill it would be almost as easy to introduce an entirely new Bill incorporating all the provisions in the Unfair Dismissals Act at present and the amendments that are intended to be made to it.  We would then have one piece of legislation to which everyone would refer on unfair dismissals.  That would also include the provisions in the part-time worker Bill relating to unfair dismissals as well.  When drafting that type of legislation one has to look at the original statutes and when we are having a debate on Committee Stage in this House we are all looking at two or three pieces of legislation to come to terms with their provisions.  It would be just as easy to incorporate them in one comprehensive Bill.  I invite the Minister to look at the possibility of providing for consolidating legislation.  The need for that is selfexplanatory in the context of the legislation we have before us today.  One only has to look at the front page where there are references, for example, to the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 and 1979 and we will now have this legislation here.  There is reference to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 and 1984, and now that is affected by this legislation.  There is a need now to consolidate our labour law legislation.</P>
    <P>Having said that I will not go into the detail of particular sections.  The Minister <Col N="2021" /> did make some reference to the various sections.  I would like to raise some issues with the Minister that I hope he will be in a position to respond to in reply to the debate on Second Stage or, if not, to give him advance warning of them so that they can be addressed on Committee Stage.  I refer the Minister to the observations on this Bill from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions dated January 1990.  Some of the points made by Congress have been passed by events.  In particular Congress objected to the suggestion of the eight hour threshold and suggested that could be in breach of European Community law.  It seems clear that, in so far as there will be a harmonisation of this area within the European Communities, the Commission is currently talking about an eight hour threshold.  If that is the case it seems that we will not be in breach of European Community law but will be, for once, doing something in advance of being directed to do so by the European Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That eight hours is the opening negotiation point by the Commission.  I do not think they have much chance of achieving eight.  It will be 11 or 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to address that and say that when one looks at the eight hour threshold the Federation of Irish Employers had some considerable objection to that and they are suggesting a 12 hour threshold.  I can anticipate a battle within the Council of Ministers in Europe when the Commissioner finalises the proposal on that very issue.  It seems what we are doing here will certainly insure that we comply with whatever comes out of Europe.  Indeed it may be that we will provide greater protection in this country than exists in some other member states for part-time workers. The point also has to be made that if the threshold falls below eight hours, a particular difficulty could arise in regard to employers taking on for just two or three hours someone that they feel they require for three or four months in the year.  It could work against temporary <Col N="2022" /> part-time employment as opposed to regular long-time part-time employment which this legislation is designed to deal with.</P>
      <P>There is a problem in relation to maternity leave which I would like the Minister to address.  At present maternity leave entitles one to 14 weeks leave.  If an employer employs a substitute for a person on maternity leave for over eight hours a week for 14 weeks how will the legislation interact in the context of maintaining the job open for the person on maternity leave and who wants to return to employment?  Because of the one year requirement under the unfair dismissals legislation, if he recruits someone for 12 weeks out of 14 weeks that legislation would normally come into play.  How will this legislation impact in regard to someone who is employed during a period of maternity leave?  As I understand it if I employ someone for 14 weeks &mdash; it is a 14-week contract &mdash; it should not of necessity create any problem.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify that aspect.  If someone is employed on a 14-week contract no particular problem should arise in the interaction with maternity entitlements in regard to the person returning from maternity leave and the person who took on the part-time work for 14 weeks.</P>
      <P>Another area has been of great concern in labour law generally for some considerable time and Congress have rightly raised it in the context of this Bill though it has a wider application.  The Bill fails to recognise one of the most important features of part-time employment, the prevalence of contract and agency work.  Congress recommend that the Bill be amended to incorporate their own definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; and &ldquo;employee&rdquo;.  Congress suggest that such an amendment should provide that an &ldquo;employer&rdquo; means the person by whom the employee is employed under a contract of employment or the person who secures the services of an employee through a contract with an employment agency or otherwise and that an &ldquo;employee&rdquo; should be defined as a person insurable for occupational injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2023" /> I am not sure that the amendments suggested by Congress would fully and properly address this problem.  A problem has existed for a long time where an employer takes on someone as a contract worker as if they are not fully an employee of the firm.  Can someone who is taken on part-time be treated as other than an employee by the person, who in reality is employing them, but is describing the person being employed as something other than an employee?  In other words, can a legal mechanism be used to put a part-time worker outside the ambit of this legislation?  Perhaps the Minister will respond to the suggested amendment from Congress and deal with that issue which has arisen in the past and has been addressed in some legislation.</P>
    <P>In relation to continuity of service Congress make the point that the definition of &ldquo;continuity of service&rdquo; laid down in the First Schedule of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act does not take account of the insecure nature of part-time employment.  They believe that the definition contained in the redundancy Acts is more appropriate. Will the Minister respond to that point?  Congress also raise with regard to the redundancy payments Acts a query as to whether exempting employers from making a contribution to the redundancy fund, on behalf of regular part-time workers, would interfere with the employee's statutory requirements.  That is another matter to which the Minister should respond.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his contribution made reference to the fact that if there is a dispute about continuity of service the Employment Appeals Tribunal will have a role under this legislation to determine that dispute.  He went on to say that in the context of applying the statutory provisions in our labour laws to regular part-time workers the other mechanisms that exist under those Acts for resolving disputes will now apply to regular part-time workers.  That will mean that the Employment Appeals Tribunal will have a number of roles other than simply in the context of determining continuity of <Col N="2024" /> service.  For example, the Employment Appeals Tribunal may have a role in determining a dispute between a part-time employee who comes under this legislation and an employer where there has been an unfair dismissal.</P>
    <P>There is a specific issue I want to raise with the Minister in this regard about which I tabled a Dáil question yesterday. I was disappointed with the Minister's reply.  The original intention in having an Employment Appeals Tribunal was to provide a less formal forum than the courts for determining disputes in relation to unfair dismissals.  The idea was that not only would there be less formality, as both employers and unions were represented in the composition of the tribunal, but the people who would go before them would feel that those on the tribunal were attuned to each of their sides when it came to dispute determination. That did not mean that the employer representative would necessarily favour an employer but there would be a global understanding of the nature of disputes from different prospectives in determining them in relation to unfair dismissals.  There was also the hope that it would diminish the expense involved in determining unfair dismissals cases. Prior to the existence of the Employment Appeals Tribunal very often the only remedy available was to head into the courts.  The expense of instructing solicitors and barristers, although that was necessary, was a major inhibiting factor, in particular to an employee who lacked resources to pursue their rights and to protect their job position.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties with the Employment Appeals Tribunal as it has evolved is that in most instances an employer is legally represented when a case is brought before it.  My experience, and I am sure the Minister has statistics on this which he might give to the House, in the vast majority of cases is that the employer who comes before the Employment Appeals Tribunal is legally represented by a solicitor and frequently by a solicitor and a barrister.  In many instances an employee would be represented by a trade union representative, <Col N="2025" /> who may be an official of the trade union or a lawyer appointed by the trade union. Many employees are not members of unions and within the part-time workforce I suspect a large proportion are not members of unions.</P>
    <P>It is essential to ensure that the protections we are extending to the part-time workforce in this legislation are real and not illusory.  Far too often we pass legislation which creates a perception that extra rights or extra protections have been extended to a group of people within our community but when one cuts through the legislation one discovers that the rights are not real because the people to whom they are being extended lack the resources to assert those rights.  Many employees are in a difficult situation when they are dismissed from their employment.  For example, they may not receive a particularly large wage, and have to struggle weekly to support themselves and their families, they do not have large resources available to them and they are not members of trade unions.</P>
    <P>If there is a dispute and an employee is dismissed after eight or nine years service, it will end up in the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  At the tribunal the employer will be accompanied by a solicitor and a barrister while the employee, who has no expertise in that area will be alone.  An employee who ends up in those circumstances, not represented by a union official or a lawyer, is at a major and serious disadvantage.  In many instances the protections extended under unfair dismissals legislation are illusory; they are not perceived as real to such an employee.  That employee will not understand the technicalities of unfair dismissals legislation and will not be familiar with how matters are dealt with before the tribunal.  If witnesses are to be called, she will not know who should be called. She will lack the skills to cross examine an employer who sets out his or her case against the employee.  Because the employee is upset and involved in what is happening she will not be able to present her case in a temperate way and very often as a result her case will not be successful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2026" /> Many employees now realise that if they do not have union backing they have to be legally represented before a tribunal.  Many employers now know that if they go in with a legal team and are dealing with a vulnerable employee who is not backed up by a union, by keeping the case running before the tribunal and building up the expenses, they can create a situation where the amount of money an employee may recoup by way of compensation for loss of their job will be less than the legal costs incurred in being represented before the tribunal.  That should not happen.  Employers should not be able to use their financial resources to diminish the rights to which employees are entitled before a tribunal by exacerbating the expenses involved in the context of the legal armoury they use.</P>
    <P>There is a real need to tackle this problem. I want to refer to why this is happening at present.  Even in the most gross and serious case &mdash; it may run for four, five or six days &mdash; and no matter how well an employee succeeded or how badly the employer has behaved the Employment Appeals Tribunal cannot require an employer to pay the legal costs, justifiably, bona fide and properly incurred by the employee in seeking to ensure that his or her name is not blackened and to reassert their position not only in the interests of getting compensation for the loss of their job but to ensure that they will be employable by another employer following the completion of the process. Employees cannot get legal help through a Government law centre to back up their cases.</P>
    <P>I believe a large number of employees and large segments of our workforce are not unionised.  Indeed, in recent years there has been a fall off rather than a growth in union membership.  A large number of employees will not be truly protected under this legislation because an employer who behaves badly and has the resources to employ lawyers can make it uneconomical or financially impossible for employees to take their cases before a tribunal not only to secure compensation but to protect their name <Col N="2027" /> and reputation and ensure they are in a position in the labour market where, if they are not reinstated in their former employment &mdash; in many instances an employee will not seek to be reinstated if there has been a major dispute &mdash; they can get employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This issue has to be addressed.  I am not suggesting that we should create within the Employment Appeals Tribunal a vast panoply of lawyers running in and out daily.  However, I am suggesting that where employees are represented by lawyers and there is a finding that they have behaved properly and the employer has not, and the employee is awarded compensation for the loss of his job, the Employment Appeals Tribunal should have discretion to require an employer to meet the legal costs incurred by the employee.  Perhaps that discretion could be circumscribed where the employer is represented by lawyers.  In one or two cases solicitors' firms have been the employers brought before the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the employee has been a secretary in that firm.  Even if those employers are not legally represented, clearly they will plead their case in a way which will place their employees at a disadvantage.  We need to look at this issue.  To simply dismiss this as not a particularly serious issue, as unfortunately the Minister did in his reply to my parliamentary question yesterday, is not addressing the problem.</P>
    <P>Some of what I have said might be interpreted by Deputy Rabbitte as implicitly saying that all employees should join trade unions.  Indeed, in the context of unfair dismissals legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not what the Deputy is saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and other legislation, many employees are in a better position if they are members of trade unions than if they are not.  However, if one is talking about employment equality legislation the attitude some of the unions have taken in relation to women workers and <Col N="2028" /> part-time workers would indicate that one would want to be a million miles from certain named trade unions, some of whom have found themselves in difficulties with the equality officer for being in breach of equal pay legislation. Members of the public must have a choice &mdash; employees are entitled to be members of a union or not.  This House is not entitled to pass legislation which means that if you are a member of a union the legislation has teeth but if you are not a member of a union it does not.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about the unfair dismissals aspects of this legislation. Seventy per cent of part-time workers are women while 30 per cent are male and I expect the majority are not unionised.  Some of them are employed by major companies and businesses.  If, in the case of disputes which end up in the Employment Appeals Tribunal, part-time and full-time workers do not have some protection in the context of being able to get legal backup against their employer who employs a legal team to plead his case, then the legislation will not have the effect I believe the Minister would like it to have.</P>
      <P>There is much more I could say about the Bill.  I have dwelt on some of the issues which are of concern to me.  In doing this I do not want to take away from the fact that I very much welcome the Bill and I am glad the Minister has brought it before the House.  I have no doubt that it is the Minister's sincere wish that this Bill will be effective.  The Fine Gael Party will facilitate the Minister in the early and speedy passage of this Bill within the limit of ensuring that on Committee Stage we tease out some of the problems which need to be teased out.  I hope the Minister will take on board some of the comments I have made, which are designed to be constructive.  I hope the Minister will look at any constructive amendments we on this side of the House put down on Committee Stage with a view to taking them on board.  I welcome the Bill and hope we will have a speedy Committee Stage so that it can be brought before the Seanad before the Easter recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision made by the Minister for Labour to finally introduce this legislation to protect the rights of part-time workers is to be welcomed. The Bill does not take into account all the changes that have occurred in the Irish labour market resulting from an increase in the number of part-time workers in receipt of low pay.  This Bill could have been courageous and relevant legislation if the Minister for Labour had accepted full responsibility for his portfolio and the desperate need for comprehensive legislation to protect a great number of people who are vulnerable and without rights in the workplace.  Deputy Shatter referred at length to some of these people and I share his concern.</P>
      <P>The labour market has changed.  Part-time work is on the increase and it is primarily associated with low pay.  The Minister must be aware that the crisis in low paid employment affects thousands of individuals and families throughout Ireland.  To date, the Government responses have been totally inadequate. The rights of workers and their living standards have been eroded over the years by falling rates of pay in the part-time work sector.  The position of these people in the workplace has been made increasingly unstable by the growth of unemployment and the emergence of part-time work as a rule rather than an exception.  It is interesting to see how the Minister deals with what he calls regular and casual part-time workers.  What he has done is effectively institutionalised part-time work.  He has accepted that there are within the area of part-time work two categories of workers.  That is a recognition that we have now abandoned the idea of providing full-time employment for our people, and this is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One instance has received much publicity in the last number of days, and indeed this was highlighted very effectively last night by Deputy De Rossa.  I refer to the circumstances involving a small factory in Finglas which up to recently employed women on a part-time <Col N="2030" /> basis at the rate of £2.75 per hour.  These people have now been dismissed and have been replaced by boys earning £1.50 an hour.  What is regrettable is that these boys were recruited through FÁS, a State institution representing the Minister. This institution are guilty of collusion in trying to undermine the workers by employing workers at a cheaper rate of pay and making redundant the people who were employed at a higher rate.  This is, indeed, regrettable and is an indictment of the State.  This has been done without any contact with third parties and without taking into account the rights of full-time workers in relation to unfair dismissal, redundancy and so on.  The employer involved has refused an invitation by the Industrial Relations Committee who offered their help in sorting out the dispute.  This dispute underlines the necessity for a statutory minimum wage, which would ensure that employees are not faced with this type of problem.</P>
    <P>Minimum wage legislation would also protect the legitimate employer paying PAYE and PRSI and would help stamp out the black economy.  The Minister had a perfect opportunity to combine a minimum wage measure with this Bill but it is regrettable he failed to do so.  I have given only one instance, but I am sure every Deputy can think of similar instances in his or her constituency. Against this background it is easy to see that the Bill is inadequate in dealing with regulations relating to disputes.  It appears to shift the burden of responsibility for redressing grievances primarily on part-time employees.  The provisions dealing with procedures relating to disputes are unfair and weak because under this Bill it is up to the employee to ensure that the provisions are implemented by the employer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter highlighted the cost involved to an individual and the ability of the individual to process his or her claim.  Many young people have no previous experience of negotiating on their own behalf.  Now they are to be faced <Col N="2031" /> with an impressive array of lawyers representing the employer and they are ill-equipped to represent themselves.  There is a need for an amendment in this area and I would ask the Minister to accept such an amendment.  For example, in the case of a dispute the Bill provides for access to a tribunal.  Does the Minister really believe that shop assistants in a large supermarket chain will have effective access to justice if there is a disparity in their income?  The Labour Party believe this is the weakest section of the Bill and will be calling for a mechanism whereby employers and the Department of Labour will play a more responsible role in ensuring that the rights of part-time employees are fully met.</P>
    <P>Low pay remains the single biggest cause of poverty among women and young people.  Two-thirds of those on low pay are women.  A Minister who introduces a part-time workers Bill without providing a national minimum weekly and hourly rate of pay is left open to a charge of cynicism.  The Labour Party and others have been campaigning for a minimum wage for many years.  It is the only realistic way of ensuring that the problem of low pay is addressed properly. We reject the argument that such an approach to minimum wage legislation would be detrimental to employment creation.  If that argument were true why has it not applied, for example, in the United States of America where there is minimum wage legislation and where the growth in jobs in the last few years has been among the fastest in the world?</P>
    <P>However, the Minister's decision to exclude this crucial matter should come as no surprise when one recalls his objections at the Council of Ministers meeting in December 1989 to clauses of the European Social Charter dealing with the concept of a basic wage.  As a result, this basic social right was deleted from the final draft of the Social Charter.  I will quote from a document, <i>Cheap Labour &mdash; Britain's False Economy,</i> by Peter Brosnan and Frank Wilkinson which states: &ldquo;The Council of Europe, in assessing compliance with the terms of the <Col N="2032" /> European Social Charter, has singled out the UK, together with Ireland, for the extent of its failure to maintain a decent minimum level of wages.&rdquo;  That is what the Council of Europe thinks of Ireland and its legislation dealing with levels of pay.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not provide for protection for workers in contract or service employment.  The Minister's failure to cover contract workers must be seen as a major flaw in this legislation.  Contract work has become increasingly popular with employers as in many cases it relieves them of legal obligations.  Many of the workers in the Goodman enterprise, for instance, discovered to their cost that contract employment is attractive only on a very superficial basis, ensuring, as it does, a virtually complete absence of any rights or job security.</P>
    <P>In short, we welcome the Bill, but we will be putting forward amendments on Committee Stage, and I sincerely ask the Minister to give them consideration.  I would like to refer to one omission from the Bill.  In March 1990 when we discussed Deputy Rabbitte's Bill on part-time workers the Minister said the National Pensions Board were to examine the question of pension entitlements of part-time workers and that the board would report on the issue.  I would like to ask the Minister what precisely has been done about this.  Has any action been taken or has the report of the National Pensions Board been taken into account?  Perhaps on Committee Stage the Minister would put down an amendment in this regard.  He certainly gave the House an assurance on that occasion that the matter would be under examination, and I would like to know what he has done in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the provision with regard to equal rights is broadly in line with the recommendation of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Does &ldquo;broadly in line&rdquo; mean that Congress accept the main thrust of the provision but disagree on the detail?  If Congress allow themselves to be used as a stalking horse for the Minister their future will be in danger.  There are many holes in this <Col N="2033" /> legislation.  It is certainly not very comprehensive.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the growth of part-time work and the characteristics of part-time workers including the important gender dimension. It has been proved beyond doubt that women are the lowest paid section of the community.  Stifling equality in the workplace will do nothing to redress the problem of part-time workers.  What is needed is a minimum wages policy.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the Minister's comments on the FIE.  He said they believe part-time work leads to more efficiency and greater competition in the marketplace, but that is not true.  The employers are the only people who profit from the growth in part-time work.  It is regrettable that from 1975-89 there was an increase of 10,500 part-time workers in the workplace.  There are now 82,000 people in part-time employment.  Maybe there are cases in which it can be justified that people should be employed on a part-time basis such as where there are peaks during certain hours of the day or where it may not be necessary to maintain full-time staff round the clock.  Some service industries have pressure periods which warrant the recruitment of part-time staff but it is now being used as a device to avoid employing full-time staff. At present relays of part-time staff cover the whole working day, which is the unacceptable side of part-time work.  It is highly organised by employers to avoid paying workers their full entitlements. This means that taxpayers bear the burden of social welfare payments which arise from people being employed on a part-time basis.  The Minister has not addressed this and everything should be done to discourage further growth in part-time employment.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's explanation for having an eight hour threshold or that he is bound by a directive from Europe.  If there is a threshold it means that the floodgates are still open.  The Minister should have grasped the nettle and got rid of the eight hour threshold.  I do not deny that he has gone a considerable distance down that road but he <Col N="2034" /> did not convince all the social partners &mdash; particularly the FIE &mdash; that there was a need to abolish this injustice in the workplace.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the classic part-time worker is a female aged 25-44.  It is a misuse of language to refer to &ldquo;a classic part-time worker&rdquo;.  What does he mean? Have we identified women between the ages of 25-44 as the exploited section of the community?  Is that what the Minister means by &ldquo;classic&rdquo;?  I do not see anything classical about being in part-time work with little or no protection.  I know the Minister is trying to do something about the problem but he has not done enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that the major benefit of part-time work in business is that it provides flexibility, allowing the employer to respond to the increased competition and the changing demand of customers.  Many employers treat their employees fairly according to the rules but they have to compete with the shysters who exploit part-time workers to the full.  The Minister said that, in this respect, Ireland's position is comparable with that of Britain where, of course, part-time work is much more widespread. Why not compare us with Germany or Holland, with the developed economies of Europe?  Why pick Britain?</P>

      <P>We will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage.  We welcome the Bill, with all its faults, as a step in the right direction.  It is a feeble Bill and I hope that, between now and Committee Stage, the Minister will also table amendments. If he does not, I sincerely hope he will accept amendments from this side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party have campaigned for many years for legislation to protect part-time workers because we recognise that this is an area of widespread exploitation and abuse of good employment practices.</P>
      <P>We used our first opportunity, as Deputy O'Sullivan remarked, of Private Members' Business, to introduce the Protection of Part-Time Workers (Employment No. 2) Bill, 1989, which was designed to tackle the exploitation of low paid workers who happen to be predominantly women.  Unfortunately, the Bill was voted down at the end of Second Stage by the Government and the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, undertook to bring forward Government legislation.  I take the opportunity to acknowledge that the Minister has been as good as his word and brought forward a Bill which I am happy to welcome.  This Bill is a major step in the right direction, it does not go as far as The Workers' Party Bill but it should, when enacted, prevent all but the more ruthless employers from exploiting low paid workers with the same ease and impunity as heretofore.</P>
      <P>The Bill will see the extension to a great many &mdash; but not all &mdash; part-time workers of the important protective legislation &mdash; seven Acts in all &mdash; to which the Minister referred.  These are the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, the Holidays (Employees) Act, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Maternity Protection of Employees Act and the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2036" /> The Bill introduces the untried legal concept of regular part-time, defined as a worker who has been in continuous service of the employer for at least 13 weeks and who works a minimum of eight hours per week.  On the face of it this must be seen as substantial progress on the present threshold of 18 hours which is so widely abused by employers.  This concept of regular part-time work is central to the legislation and in principle, warrants our support.  However, I am concerned about the definition in the Bill which essentially requires two things.  The definition section refers to &ldquo;regular part-time&rdquo;, in relation to an employee under a relevant enactment as meaning an employee who works for an employer and who (a) has been in the continuous service of the employer for not less than 13 weeks, and (b) is normally expected to work not less than eight hours a week for that employer.  Fifteen years of dealing with employers have taught me that there are no limits to the ingenuity of a minority of employers when it comes to ripping off the system or avoiding their responsibilities under the law.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I must conclude that the continous service requirement will be abused by the worst employers; in other words, legal advisers will be working overtime to introduce new contracts which will automatically expire before the 13 weeks' continuous service as defined in relation to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973 is exhausted.  Indeed, this abuse crept in widely in the Thatcher-Reagan culture of the eighties, where workers were increasingly employed on fixed contracts deliberately designed to avoid legal objections.  In other words, if the 12 months' continuous service confers rights on a worker under, say, the Unfair Dismissals Act, then the fixed contract runs for a period of, say, 11 months and is often renewable.  This insidious practice has been imported into the State service itself.  In the health services there are from time to time not hundreds but thousands of fixed contract workers.</P>
    <P>The current threshold of 18 hours is being widely abused.  For example, on <Col N="2037" /> last night's Adjournment debate Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the Leader of The Workers' Party, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, raising the strike at River Valley Products in his constituency and highlighting the disgraceful replacement of regular part-time women workers by lowly paid male workers recruited through FÁS.  However, the relevant point is that the part-time workers concerned were employed for 17.5 hours per week, thus missing out on their proper entitlements under the legislation we have referred to in this debate.  Unfortunately, this ruse by employers is widespread in certain types of employment and there can be no question but that the new threshold of eight hours will make the exploitative employer's task more difficult. However, it is a combination of the hours threshold and the requirement of continuous service that will provide the bad employer with the escape hatch.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party will argue on Committee Stage that it is necessary to import the concept of cumulative service from our social welfare legislation into this Bill.  For example, if an employee was required to have cumulative service of not less than 13 weeks in any half year, then the employer bent on avoiding his obligations under the law would be further constrained.  Deputy Shatter's contribution reminded me to quote the remarks by Congress on this point:</P>
    <P>The definition of continuity of service laid down in the First Schedule of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, does not take account of the insecure nature of part-time employment.  Congress believes that the definition contained in the Redundancy Acts is more appropriate and should be adopted in this Bill.  This would provide that employment could be taken to be continuous if an employee is dismissed before attaining the qualifying period of service (in this case 13 weeks) but resumes employment with the same employer within 26 weeks.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and welcome this legislation, but this requirement is <Col N="2038" /> central.  The Minister says the definition in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act has worked very well. That is true but, as Congress says, to apply that in the case of part-time workers does not allow for the insecurity and the practices that are rife in the area of part-time work.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister is referring to the First Schedule of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973; section 1 of that First Schedule provides that, the service of an employee in his employment shall be deemed to be continuous unless that service is terminated by (a) the dismissal of the employee by his employer, or (b) the employee voluntarily leaving his employment.  Section 6 of that Schedule provides that, the continuous service of an employee in his employment shall not be broken by the dismissal of the employee by his employer followed by the immediate reemployment of that employee.  I presume that is a central point on which the Minister is hanging his case.  I think I understand it, but I am not so sure it will work well in the area we are talking about.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister in his reply to address the question whether it governs fixed contract employment.  What is preventing an employer, knowing now that the law has been changed and that there is new legislation which confers certain rights on any worker who has 13 weeks' continuous employment, from designing a system of contracts where a worker is taken on on the basis of a 12 week or three month fixed contract and then reemploying that worker after a reasonable period?  There seems to be nothing to prevent that.</P>
    <P>We know this is a fairly wide practice under the Unfair Dismissals Act.  That Act requires service of one year &mdash; 12 months &mdash; and it is regularly the case that employers now employ workers on a fixed contract of 11 months.  This practice is prevalent even in the health services. One of the last major involvements I had in the health services was the attempt to renegotiate this question of temporary staff in the health services, to confer certain rights on temporary workers who <Col N="2039" /> had been in the health services over a prolonged period.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the more ruthless employers &mdash; they are in the minority &mdash; who are always seeking to exploit this kind of loophole will take advantage of it.  However, there is a topical example. There has been a trade dispute in Finglas for two months and the union, the Labour Relations Commission and the Minister have largely confessed their helplessness to resolve it.  That is a classic example that highlights how the employer went out of his way to employ workers for 17.5 hours per week because, had he employed them for 18 hours per week they would have been entitled to certain rights, benefits and entitlements under various labour legislation.  That is a common practice and I fear that under the new legislation the worst employers will get around this question of a continuous service requirement.</P>
    <P>We ought to take on board the input from Congress who suggest that the Redundancy Payments Acts, for example, may be a better yardstick to apply or, as I recommended on behalf of The Workers' Party, we import into this legislation the notion of cumulative service that exists in social welfare legislation where somebody over a period of, say, half a year would have to have 13 weeks' service in order to qualify.  This area is central to the Bill and deserves to be looked at.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned by section 1 (3) (b) of the Bill which gives the Minister power by order to amend the definition of &ldquo;regular part-time&rdquo; by altering either or both the minimum number of weeks of continuous service and the minimum number of hours required to be worked. I do not question the bona fides of the Minister's intentions in this regard, and I am sure that in reply he will say his purpose is to leave it open to him to improve this situation in the years ahead, but I am concerned at the prospect of a lobby being whipped up by employers and their representatives in this House &mdash; although unless Deputy Wyse takes on that mantle <Col N="2040" /> nobody so far has professed to be speaking on behalf of the employers; I am not ashamed to speak on behalf of the workers &mdash; to have the threshold altered to the detriment of workers.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that that subsection allows inordinate pressure to be brought to bear on the Minister of the day to cause it to be changed for any one of a number of reasons I can readily envisage. The Workers' Party would have preferred, as expressed in our own Bill, the complete abolition of the minimum threshold of hours worked for protection by labour legislation, and to extend <i>pro rata</i> to all part-time workers the protection of all such legislation.  In this regard we note the support of the Employment Equality Agency for complete abolition, as expressed in the publication by the Employment Equality Agency of its major report on part-time working entitled <i>Who Needs Flexibility</i> by Dr. Eileen Drew of Trinity College.  At the launch of that valuable comprehensive report the chairperson of the Employment Equality Agency, Ms. Catherine McGuinness said:</P>
    <P>Employers' demand for part-time working is related to factors like skill and labour shortages and the need to meet peaks in demand for labour particularly in the service sector.  There is little or no evidence to support the argument that the inclusion of these workers in labour legislation protection would lessen this demand or cut off the supply.</P>
    <P>I agree with that conclusion.  The demands of the marketplace bear it out. Managers in banks and supermarkets who were surveyed for the employment equality study confirmed that the principal factor affecting future demand for part-time workers is customer demand for extended hours of opening and the need to meet peaks in demand for services. As Ms. McGuinness said:</P>
    <P>This report highlights the fact that it is women who are principally affected by trends in part-time working; making up as they do 69% (60,000 out of <Col N="2041" /> 87,000 workers) of part-time workers, and this makes the issue of protection of part-time workers an equality issue.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency report also showed that working mothers with three or more children made up over 30 per cent of all women working part-time in 1988.  In the same year 50 per cent of all women part-time workers as against 9 per cent of married men part-time workers cited family responsibilities as the main reason for working part-time. There is no doubt that the protection of part-time workers is indeed an equality issue.  The Minister's figures bear this out. Indeed the authoritative study for the Minister's Department and the IPC, by John Blackwell, concluded that in respect of 1987, for example, 72 per cent of all regular part-time workers were female. The number of part-time workers in the labour force has almost doubled in the last ten years and the current ICTU estimate is that there are about 100,000 regular and occasional part-time workers in the workforce at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the question of the working conditions of part-time workers and said that it would be wrong to equate part-time with precarious or substandard jobs.  He said that there is some empirical evidence nonetheless in Ireland that the hourly earnings of part-time workers tend to be below those of their full-time equivalents.  That is the understatement of the debate so far.  I agree that it would be wrong to equate all part-time work with substandard or precarious jobs.  I know that a number of employments provide good part-time employment but there is a lot of empirical evidence to show that the hourly earnings of part-time workers tend to be a great deal less than their full-time equivalents.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the research by the ESRI which showed that the people affected were predominantly women.  It is women who are exploited most seriously, women in the main, who are forced to go out to work because of long term endemic unemployment in the home.  But for the opportunity for part-time work that exists in my constituency, <Col N="2042" /> the poverty that is endemic in certain pockets of my constituency would be far worse.</P>
    <P>To underline my point, I would refer to a paper delivered to a Combat Poverty Agency conference by my SIPTU colleague, economist Rosheen Callendar. She said, as quoted by me at column 1284, volume 397, of the Official Report of 27 March 1990:</P>
    <P>One of the main effects of the continuing exclusion of part-time workers from the scope of most existing protective legislation ... as well as from most social insurance cover, is to dramatically reduce the total value of their work.  In the vast majority of cases, the rewards for part-time working are grossly disproportionate to the rewards for full-time working and the discrepancy can in no way be accounted for solely by the difference in hours worked.</P>
    <P>Usually, even when hourly rates of pay are the same for full-time and part-time workers, the latter's conditions of employment are inferior: they tend to be excluded from pensions cover, various kinds of paid and unpaid leave, valuable fringe benefits, access to training and promotion and so on.  Add to these factors the less immediate, long term effects of their exclusion from PRSI and most employment legislation and you get a &ldquo;total job package&rdquo; which is considerably less valuable than their actual working hours would tend to imply.</P>
    <P>The Minister would probably agree with that.  It is a fairly savage indictment of the difference in the <i>pro rata</i> payment of part-time workers as compared to full-time workers.  It leads to the most desperate consequences.  Purely because it is topical, I will take the case of the strike which is under way.  Workers like that have no rights.  They work because they must, to put bread on the table, and not for pin money which might be a feature in some of the better off areas of the city. Once they become unemployed, as they can become at the drop of a hat, they <Col N="2043" /> have no entitlements and when they are no longer able to perform the duties in question, they have no benefits.  I accept that this legislation goes a long way in tackling that phenomenon but I am concerned and I will be seeking to address in the form of amendments some of the points I have made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter raised the question of the responsibility of the trade union movement in this area, and said that having regard to the performance of some trade union members he would advise women workers affected in this way to stay one million miles away from named trade union leaders who were involved, in a fashion that did not reflect any credit on them, in a couple of equality issues.  That is to exaggerate the circumstances of one or two isolated cases. I do not think one can draw any general conclusion from the particularly backward decisions of one or two trade union leaders in the past in terms of their management of their industrial relations affairs.  It is not fair to the trade union movement.  The trade union movement has attempted to tackle this problem. Anybody who has an appreciation of how difficult it is to tackle problems in the industrial relations context will understand what I am saying.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to keep referring to the dispute Deputy O'Sullivan brought up but what, for example, is the trade union movement supposed to do in the context of the River Valley Products dispute, where the employer concerned has no regard for the Labour Relations Commission and will not meet the trade union involved?  Unfortunately, the use of &ldquo;scab labour&rdquo;, which is probably unfair, although it is the traditional trade union word &mdash; they are probably in the main people who are desperate for employment in present conditions &mdash; enabling that factory to work.  In that circumstance it is very difficult for the trade union movement to do anything effective to tackle the conditions of the part-time workers concerned.  That is a phenomenon the trade union movement comes up against time and time again.  In the <Col N="2044" /> industries or trades where this problem is most concentrated it is extremely and exceptionally difficult for the trade union movement effectively to tackle it without inflicting greater hardship in the process on the people who are affected.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that it is a growing phenomenon, in the sense that it is a growing section of the workforce, and predictions would seem to suggest that it is going to become more so in the future, the trade union movement will have to consider how well geared it is to confront this problem.  It is true that the incidence of trade union organisation amongst low paid part-time workers is very low.  Perhaps the trade union movement needs to gear itself for a different approach in terms of trying to offer protection to workers who are amongst the most exploited and vulnerable in the workforce.</P>
    <P>The report prepared for the National Pensions Board by Donal Dinneen entitled <i>Changing Employment Patterns in Ireland</i> states:</P>
    <P>Employment has been declining, unemployment rising and aggregate output increasing in recent years. Hence fewer people are required to provide the needs of the market place. The spectre of jobless growth for the next few years, especially in manufacturing, looms large.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>...if employment grows more rapidly the recent UK experience may be replicated, where most of the increased employment was part-time.  Based on international comparisons this is the one typical employment form which has most potential to grow rapidly in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I can readily understand why that is the case, because from a commercial and economic point of view it makes perfect sense for employers to employ part-time staff as it gives them far greater flexibility. If that is the situation, it is fair to make the point that the trade union movement, having regard to the very serious equality dimension of this issue, should gear itself <Col N="2045" /> to deal with the matter more aggressively.</P>
    <P>The traditional stance of the Federation of Irish Employers on this has always puzzled me.  I welcome the fact that their response to this Bill has been relatively muted.  I have never been able to understand why the FIE should feel it incumbent on themselves to defend the appalling practices of worst employers in this regard, even in terms of their own family and employers.  It is only putting good employers at a competitive disadvantage to be upholding the disgraceful practices applied by worst employers.  If their relative silence on this conveys that they have recently realised this dimension of it, that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Like the other spokespersons, I will be anxious to see that the progress of this Bill through the remaining Stages is expedited and that it becomes law as quickly as possible.  It is an important progressive measure.  I have reservations about some aspects of it, as I have outlined. I hope the Minister on Committee Stage will look at the merits of amendments put forward in a serious way.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House in putting on the record again several instances I recalled when introducing The Workers' Party Bill on the same issue some months ago.  It is only by demonstrating to the House in anecdotal fashion that the horror of the problem confronting many workers is brought home.  I took the opportunity at that time to put on the record of the House a great many examples of cases that were brought to me.  These cases bear rereading to show the dilemma that confronts a great many workers, especially in present market conditions.  I will refer briefly to one case that I regard as typical.  It is from a 19 year old woman worker which was handed to me on the night the Bill was introduced.  It states:</P>
    <P>I am 19 years old and I am a low paid part-time worker.  I started my career as a part-time worker at 15 years of age in a restaurant in one of Dublin's leading stores south of the Liffey.  I worked a nine hour day on Saturdays <Col N="2046" /> and on holidays from school for which I was paid a pittance.  I had no control over the work which was expected of me and I don't know what I was employed as.  Was I a waitress?  Was I a cleaner?  Was I a porter?  Was I a cashier?  Was I a cook's help or was I all these things for just £15 a week? After a year and a half's work the restaurant closed down.  I was given absolutely no notice, just my day's pay. When I left the store that evening I had no social welfare cover, no job prospects and no come back, nothing.</P>
    <P>I have since worked in two major establishments, one a leading bakery with a chain of restaurants and the other a restaurant in another big department store north of the Liffey. These jobs were no different to the one that gave me my first taste of part-time work in catering, no job security, no social security, no job description and low pay.</P>
    <P>That about sums up the circumstances that confront a great number of young workers, especially young women workers.</P>
    <P>Then there is the contract area where this problem proliferates.  The contract cleaning industry is notorious for it.  I worry that the Minister feels it necessary to introduce thresholds.  I am reminded of what happened in the contract cleaning industry following the implementation of the employment equality directive.  At that time a cushion payment of £50 a week was introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare.  In other words a woman could earn £50 a week before her husband, who was unemployed, took a commensurate reduction in whatever benefit he was receiving.  If she earned more than £50 a week he would lose a great deal more, making it a catch 22 situation for his wife.  I was dealing with the contract cleaning industry at the time and throughout that industry they contrived a situation where, notwithstanding the fact that there was a JLC increase, the workers concerned did not go beyond the £50 level.  The unfortunate women caught in that trap could not accept £52 or £53 <Col N="2047" /> because if they did, their husbands in receipt of unemployment assistance would lose ten times as much.  Speaking from memory, I think there would have been approximately a £26 reduction in the husband's unemployment assistance payment.  That is an example of the type of problems you have when you introduce thresholds, employers seek to evade their responsibilities by fiddling around with the figures.</P>
    <P>Finally, the major omission of the Bill is the question of pay.  It is all very well and proper, and indeed welcome, that we should confer on what are now described as regular part-time workers meeting these minimum requirements, the same rights in terms of protective labour legislation as apply to other workers, but we are not tackling the poverty question to which Deputy O'Sullivan referred.  While it is welcome that part-time workers have the same protection as other workers, they will still be working for a pittance, as a young worker described it, in a great many cases because the JLCs to which I referred already in a different instance, are not sufficiently efficacious in producing a minimum reasonable standard of living.  By the very process in which they are negotiated, the level is set at very much the bare minimum employers can get away with.  There is the necessity for the Minister to confront the question of minimum pay.  The introduction of a statutory minimum hourly rate would at least tackle some of the worst cases, even if it was pitched at a very reasonable level.  It is instructive, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, to have a look at the practice in other countries where such minimum pay legislation exists.  The entire system has not come crashing down.  The system seems to be able to absorb it and it has certainly meant an improvement in the living conditions of the workers caught in a low pay trap.</P>
    <P>I am happy to welcome this Bill.  It is a major step forward and I hope it is enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in welcoming this <Col N="2048" /> progressive legislation.  It is an entirely adequate response to changing needs and the changes in participation in the labour force.  It is now clear that 20,000 regular part-time workers will for the first time have a range of statutory entitlements that are now enjoyed by full-timers.  The threshold of 18 hours, the minimum up to now, will be reduced to eight hours. As the Minister indicated earlier, this is ahead of the thinking and practice in a number of European countries.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as we know, will benefit women in particular.  Three-quarters of the 70,000 regular part-time workers in the economy at present are women and those women are mostly married.  At present 20,000 part-time workers work fewer than 18 hours per week thus 20,000 of the 70,000 will now be entitled to protection, terms of redundancy, minimum notice, worker participation, unfair dismissals, maternity leave and employer insolvency, together with holidays.</P>
      <P>It is worth looking briefly at the scale of the part-time work issue.  Ireland, in common with other European countries, has an increasing proportion of part-time workers.  The regular part-time worker population in this country doubled to its present level of 70,000 from 1977 to 1989. A positive point should be made here and that is that the growth of part-time work is actually providing job opportunities for women.  That is the positive development and is an interesting way of looking at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in introducing legislation has the overall responsibility of striking a balance &mdash; the balance in this instance between providing a range of entitlements and statutory protections for part-time workers while at the same time not discouraging the development of part-time work which is an important outlet for female participation in jobs.  Part-time work obviously suits many, especially women with their family and domestic roles.  One might argue that it is because of the uneven distribution of the work in the home that many women cannot work full-time.  A further point was made that while there are some women who engage in part-time work for pin money &mdash; they are a tiny minority &mdash;<Col N="2049" /> typically women go to work to help with the family budget and to meet basic needs.  They are literally keeping the bread on the table.  The Bill gives flexibility, with statutory entitlements for women who want to work fewer than 18 hours a week.  In future they will have to work only eight hours upwards to qualify for these benefits, side by side with providing the competitive edge for employers who need flexibility particularly in working hours to meet customer demand.  It has been said already that there is a shift in employment from manufacturing industry to the services industry which lends itself to part-time work.  Part-time work seems to be essential for the growth of services and this in turn opens up opportunities for women on a part-time basis.  Much of this is, of course, a recent development.  The eighties were characterised by intensive international and domestic competition, recession, charging technology and so forth.  That has brought a focus on costs unparalleled in the past and, in particular, on labour costs which are now getting a high priority in the costs of production of the goods or services.  The employment pattern is that there is still quite a number although we would like to see more, of full-time conventional jobs but a growing part-time component.  Survival and growth are necessary for jobs, be they full-time or part-time.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes a long way towards meeting the requirements of part-time workers and employer needs for flexibility at this point.  Part-time work is here to stay.  It is the pattern for the future.  Today, we are addressing the social implications for and needs of part-time workers and in that sense this Bill is particularly progressive.  There has been exploitation of part-time workers and the Bill is designed to go a long way towards meeting this exploitation particularly in relation to holiday entitlements.</P>
    <P>We can criticise any Minister introducing legislation but in this instance the Minister has to be careful in not overregulating the labour market to the point where he might introduce disincentives which in turn might reduce part-time job <Col N="2050" /> opportunities and, therefore, jobs for women.  There are many employments &mdash; supermarkets spring to mind &mdash; where the demand for their products is concentrated in the last three days of the week.  I know, for example, of a supermarket chain where 5 per cent of their sales occur on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and 95 per cent of the sales are on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  It goes without saying that that labour force has to be made up of a core of full-time workers and a sizeable number of part-time workers, many women, to meet the peak demand of the last three days of the week.  The Minister has struck an equitable balance between employer needs and employee needs in the part-time area.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling &mdash; and it is again an indication of the change that has taken place &mdash; that there was a logical basis for the 18 hour minimum when it was introduced.  The idea then was to exclude incidental or subsidiary working.  The nub of the matter now is that there are 20,000 part-time workers who have not got the range of entitlements I mentioned and who will get them under this Bill. The eight hours is in line with the best practice in other European countries and ahead of a number of them within the Community.  I suppose it is a measure, given the support the Bill has got here in this House this morning, of the care the Minister has taken and the exhaustive discussions in which he and his officials engaged with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federation of Irish Employers, the peak organisations, in striving to reach a consensus, to frame a workable piece of legislation as we now have before us.  I would like to compliment the Minister, therefore, for the patience and skill he has shown in this area and in other areas in his search for consensus backed up by the expertise of his officials.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the complementary action taken in respect of part-time workers by the Minister for Social Welfare.  The Minister for Social Welfare, in a major development of the PRSI system has now brought 21,000 part-time <Col N="2051" /> workers into the social welfare system, 17,000 of whom are women, many of them, again, in low paid jobs.  They will be able to claim weekly payments for illness, for maternity and for unemployment and, eventually, they will be entitled to pensions, the type of protection that is obviously needed under a variety of headings.  While the 18 hour minimum applied in the case of the social welfare system as well, the actual alteration there is not to the number of hours but to the income levels, so those earning £40 a week or upwards will be entitled to these social welfare benefits in future.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us and the PRSI changes will be of particular benefit to women who work in my constituency.  My constituency of Dún Laoghaire is characterised by a wide range of services, supermarkets, hairdressing establishments, shops, a lot of retail activity and a lot of part-time workers who are mostly women who will now benefit from both measures.</P>
    <P>There is quite a bit of debate internationally on the dual workforce idea, this idea of having a core of permanent highly skilled workers with an attractive range of fringe benefits and side by side with them what some writers describe as a peripheral workforce, low status, low income and so on.  We do not necessarily have to accept that conceptual distinction, but what we do know is that these people in low status, low paid jobs need protection, and the Bill faces up to those needs today.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by the previous speaker to the research work done by both John Blackwell of UCD and Eileen Drew of Trinity College.  I would like to compliment both researchers for the valuable basic research they have done and which obviously leads to the better formulation of policies.  It is a valuable factor in policy formulation and is an example of the research conducted by universities into the policy making area. Eileen Drew, drawing on the literature and practice elsewhere, refers to the fact that it is not only women, although mainly women, who are part-time <Col N="2052" /> workers.  There are people who are nearing retirement or who have retired and who can very constructively avoid the shock of sudden retirement and ease their way with part-time work.  Indeed the 1988 figure for males over 65 shows that 12 per cent of them were part-time workers in 1988.</P>
    <P>There is also the important benefit for those who work part-time of commuting to work.  They avoid peak hours and, in that sense, it is like flexi-time.  There is lower pay for part-time workers as compared with full-time workers and that can be a disadvantage for individual part-time people.  A further concern is that there is a very small number of part-time workers in high quality jobs in the professions, for example, although I am glad to note in this instance that there are people like solicitors and doctors, female solicitors and doctors in particular, who now have an opportunity to work part-time during the week.  I think this is a very welcome trend.  First of all, it provides an outlet for people with this high level of expertise to participate in the workforce and, furthermore, it means that the State investment, that is, the tax investment in their education when they were pursuing their professional courses, is returned to the economy to some extent.</P>
    <P>As far as employers are concerned, the flexibility arguments holds a lot of substance. There is increased competition which means extending hours, and with customer demand that is important; companies typically have to respond to customer needs.  One could argue from the employer viewpoint that part-time work reduces costs.  At a minimum it means they do not have to pay overtime to their full-time employees.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the European experience.  I barely touched on it already.  It is a fact that part-time working is growing in all European countries.  As a percentage of the labour force it ranges from a minimum of 2.5 per cent in Spain right up to 29.4 per cent in the Netherlands. In the UK it is 22.8 per cent of the labour force and in Ireland we are still well down the league, although about halfway up the European average nonetheless, at 8.5 per cent.  The majority of <Col N="2053" /> part-time workers are obviously women. In West Germany, for example, 93 per cent of part-time workers are women, while the figure for Ireland is 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>How do women in particular feel about this?  The research shows that most women in part-time work have a decided preference for part-time work.  There is, however, an important minority of women who would wish to have full-time work but cannot actually secure it.  I mentioned already that one reason that women are not available for full-time work is that there is an uneven burden of household duties, especially in the 25 to 44 age bracket, the child rearing age.  It is impractical for them to fulfil both roles, the full-time job at home and the full-time job in the conventional labour force.</P>
    <P>Manufacturing industries which have been characterised by full-time jobs, and this is true here as well as in Europe, are diminishing in numbers.  Services are growing and there is a demand there for part-time work.  The impact of part-time work means that employers have numerical flexibility and that they are able to manage their workforce most effectively to meet their needs.  The European Commission is clearly concerned about abuses and exploitation in the part-time work area.  It is a fact that where legislation does not exist there is the opportunity, if one wants to put it that way, for abuse by employers.  It is easier to recruit and dismiss part-time employees if they are not covered by employment legislation. Deputy Rabbitte fairly made the point that many employers who employ part-time workers are in fact fair but there are of course a number, a minority, who offend in this respect.</P>
    <P>Part-time work, then, is here to stay. It is a question of facing up to that reality in the labour force.  We, as Members of the Oireachtas, in the course of this debate and in enacting this legislation, will be making an important contribution to meeting the social implications of part-time work.  As legislators, we have an obligation to protect part-time workers who are mainly women in lower paid jobs.  This is our contribution in this regard.  Furthermore, we will have an <Col N="2054" /> opportunity of debating very shortly legislation in the context of social insurance for part-time workers.  Indeed the Minister for Social Welfare has already signed the regulations in this respect.</P>
    <P>Again I want to say that the Minister has struck a fair balance.  He avoids over-regulation of the labour market and thereby avoids the risk of reducing part-time job opportunities so obviously needed by women.  Furthermore it provides the flexibility for employers to meet their labour costs and their financial needs and to run their business properly, which, in turn means jobs are more secure, be they full-time or part-time.</P>
    <P>The Bill obviously should act as a stimulus to more part-time work with the necessary safeguards built in.  It is worth making the point, of course, that the statutory protection for part-time workers in most European countries where it has been introduced has not adversely affected the labour market.  I feel the Bill is an appropriate response to the rapid growth of part-time work.  It is an enlightened step forward and I wish it a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it proposes the extension to part-time workers of the benefits of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 and 1984, the Holidays (Employers) Act, 1973, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 and 1988, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, and the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981.  I welcome the main thrust of the Bill in that it gives equal rights to part-time workers.  The Bill is urgently needed because part-time workers are the most abused and exploited section of our workforce.  For too long part-time workers have been vulnerable to exploitation.  However sterling or honourable their service, they were open at all times to dismissal, they had no basic legal protection, they had no appeals mechanisms in the case of dismissal and they had no redundancy payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2055" /> The Bill, thankfully, will ultimately provide protection and equality to our part-time workers.  The Bill cannot be considered in isolation from developments at European Community level.  In June 1990 the European Commission issued three draft directives on part-time, temporary, seasonal and agency workers who work at least eight hours per week. It is essential therefore that our Irish legislation incorporates the clearly defined obligations arising under EC legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines a regular part-time worker as one who has been in the continuous service of an employer for at least 13 weeks and is working for at least eight hours per week.  This reduction in the weekly threshold from 18 hours to eight hours represents a substantial improvement in the conditions of employees who work for at least 18 hours per week.  It can, however, be argued that the general eight hour threshold does present a slight anomaly.  I will point out the manner in which I feel this arises.  In a 40-hour week eight hours represents 20 per cent of the total.  Take, for example, a teacher who works 22 class hours per week, eight hours for that teacher represents 36 per cent of the total hours required in order to become eligible under this legislation. This is a slight contradiction and it should be examined more closely on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that 68 per cent of all male part-time employees and 72 per cent of all female part-time employees work less than the current 18 hour threshold. These figures clearly demonstrate the importance of this Bill.  The implementation of the eight hour threshold per week may be subject to abuse by employers who may now wish to employ people for less than eight hours per week in order to avoid being caught by this legislation.  Steps must be taken by the Minister and his Department to minimise the occasions of this abuse.  The Department of Labour must carry out careful monitoring of part-time workers and so be in a position to judge if their hours of work are reduced when this legislation is <Col N="2056" /> implemented.  Employees who, after the legislation is implemented, are abused in that their hours are reduced below the eight hour threshold must have recourse to an employment appeals tribunal or to some other agency where their case can be examined.  This is one means whereby abuse and manipulation of this legislation can be minimised.  It must be minimised if this Bill is to be effective and, therefore, such a tribunal should be made available.</P>
    <P>Employers criticise the Bill because the legislation comes into effect after 13 weeks of continuous employment.  They feel that 13 weeks cannot be considered regular and that the period should be extended.  I believe 13 weeks is a reasonable time in which to become recognised as a regular part-time worker.  It enables a person to qualify under this legislation and it is the statutory requirement in all European countries in order to be termed a regular part-time worker.</P>
    <P>My main criticism of the Bill is that it fails to recognise one very important feature of part-time employment today, the prevalence of contract and agency work.  The Bill must be amended to provide that an employer means the person by whom the employee is employed under a contract of employment, or the person who secures the services of an employee, through a contract with an employment agency or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Regarding contract employment I am both amazed and disturbed at the amount of contract employment being offered today by our universities, regional technical colleges and State bodies &mdash; Trinity College, UCD, UCC and the regional colleges.  More recently I have been amazed that An Bord Glas are offering marketing and development executive positions on a contract basis.  The future of An Bord Glas does not look bright if they do not see fit to provide permanent employment in this badly needed area of horticultural development.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the reason our universities and our colleges are going down the road of contract work.  They, above all, should be setting the lead by providing permanent employment.  The provisions of this Bill must provide for <Col N="2057" /> employment offered on a contract basis because the disadvantages for one employed on a contract basis are many. They have no security of tenure, no hope of promotion, no pension rights and no hope of making any long term personal decisions.  It is totally unfair to offer highly qualified people an opportunity only of contract work.  They are in no position to buy a house or make any financial commitments because the work is for a period of only two to three years. The area of contract work will have to be examined closely because it is increasing rapidly and we must remember the disadvantages for the person involved.</P>
    <P>The Bill will mean that employers of regular part-time workers will have increased financial costs, particularly those related to holiday pay.  They will also have a significant element of organisational cost associated with the inclusion of all part-time employees under the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981.  Employers may consider these to be impractical and inefficient but I believe such benefits as holiday pay, annual leave and maternity benefit must be extended to part-time workers.  After all, women constitute 70 per cent of the acknowledged workforce but in reality that percentage is much higher.  For too long women who became pregnant were not protected from dismissal, neither were they entitled to any maternity leave nor did they have their job secured and open for them when they were available to return to work.  This was totally undesirable, it screams with inequity.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that all regular part-time workers will be entitled to the minimum 14 weeks maternity leave enjoyed by all other female workers in employment. I welcome also the fact that their jobs will remain open for them on their return to work.  This provision is welcome not only by me but by the entire female workforce.</P>
    <P>As we move down the road of trying to end inequities in one area we should take this opportunity to end other inequities. In this regard I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the lack of <Col N="2058" /> maternity leave for adoptive parents. This is an area of gross discrimination and legislation must be introduced to provide equality for adoptive parents.  Adoptive parents need time to build up a bonding relationship with the child.  They need to establish a sound, secure relationship and they should be entitled to the same maternity leave as the natural mother.  I plead with the Minister to look sympathetically and realistically at this matter because the majority of mothers work today.  The adoptive mother who, perhaps, has gone through enormous trauma and stress of waiting to be considered eligible for a child can be placed in the position where she almost feels forced to leave work so that she can give secure and loving care to her adopted child.  Adoptive mothers are the same as natural mothers and our legislation must recognise them as such by providing that they are entitled to 14 weeks maternity leave.  I plead with the Minister to be sympathetic in his approach to adoptive mothers and to extend a maternity leave entitlement to them as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is the time when we should also look at the issue of paternity leave. Generally speaking, most mothers spend two or three days in hospital before they return home to look after their newly born child.  When they come home they have to cope with the demands of their new born child while, at the same time, they are recovering from a nine month's pregnancy.  They need the support of their partners at this time.  If fathers were allowed to take three or four weeks paternity leave it would help to eliminate much of the strain and stress endured by mothers in coping with their newly born children without the support of their partners. In order to ensure harmonious and stable family relationships at this crucial period fathers should be entitled to avail of paternity leave.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Bill gives employers flexibility in a changing industrial, commercial and economic climate. As the demands of customers change rapidly this legislation should not hinder &mdash; I do not believe it will &mdash; firms which <Col N="2059" /> wish to employ more staff to meet peak seasonal requirements.  I hope one of the positive aspects of this Bill is that employers, rather than taking on employees on a regular part-time basis, will see the benefits of long term employment instead.  This would be a welcome outcome of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the Bill does not provide for amendments to the Social Welfare Acts.  I believe it is intended to extend full social welfare insurance cover to part-time workers generally from 6 April 1991.  There will be significant costs involved in this for both the employer and employee.  There will be a significant difference between class J which applies to part-time workers of less than 18 hours and class A which applies to full-time employees, whether temporary or permanent. The extension of this cover would mean an increase of 11.7 per cent for employers in pay roll costs for each employee.  This would place a considerable burden on firms which employ many part-time staff.  It would also mean a reduction of between 3 per cent and 5.5 per cent in the take home pay of employees.  Most part-time employees work to supplement their incomes and we must accept that their take home pay is the most important factor to them.  I am worried that the Bill, as presented, may force many part-time workers into the black economy.  This could happen in two ways &mdash; employers may employ people for fewer than eight hours per week and employees who believe that their take home pay is being squeezed by taxation may resort to the black economy.</P>
    <P>I also have some reservations about the section dealing with annual leave.  As the calculation for annual leave allows for entitlement to proportions of six hours per 100 hours worked, the Bill must include a provision for the rounding off of figures; otherwise, annual leave for periods of minutes will be earned.  This would be difficult for both employers and employees and may lead to a total breakdown in worker-employer relationships, resulting in disputes, strikes, walk-outs, <Col N="2060" /> etc.  The bill must ensure at all times that there is a good healthy relationship between employers and employees based on fair, clear and direct guidelines.  It is important that this issue is dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in general terms.  I have already referred to my reservations about it.  I am concerned at the massive potential for major abuse of the legislation which would make the lot of part-time workers worse and reduce the potential for part-time employment. Nevertheless, I believe improvements can be made in the Bill to minimise the opportunities of such abuse.  This Bill is a positive step forward in improving the conditions of part-time workers.  I welcome any legislation which will ensure security, protection and, above all, equal rights for part-time workers.  We must recognise that the Bill will place additional costs, both in financial and organisational terms, on employers.  I hope the reservations expressed by the Federation of Irish Employers will be considered by the Minister between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill is, above all, about equality and will ultimately lead to an improvement in the conditions of part-time workers.  I welcome the Bill.  I hope its introduction will lead to a more regulated part-time workforce and will give them the security and rights which they not only deserve but to which they are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which will enhance the working conditions of part-time employees and gives them the protection which they did not have heretofore. It confers on them a flow of legal rights which were previously available to permanent employees only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interpretation and definition of a regular part-time employee is one who has been in the continuous service of the employer for at least 13 weeks and is normally expected to work at least eight hours a week.  This is a far reaching definition and will cover the vast majority of current part-time employees, of which 80 per cent are women and 30 per cent <Col N="2061" /> are under the age of 25.  Under EC law, the completion of the Internal Market must lead to an improvement in living and working conditions in the European Community.  This process must result from an approximation of conditions, particularly the conditions in regard to part-time work, temporary work and seasonal work.  This Bill will go some way towards meeting our obligations under EC law.  It will also provide a charter and a flow of fundamental social rights for workers, particularly part-time workers.</P>
    <P>Part-time work, temporary work and seasonal work are here to stay.  The growing importance of these forms of employment is explained by the fact that they meet the real needs of firms which require greater flexibility in the organisation and operation of their companies.  They are more flexible in the utilisation of manpower in order to respond more efficiently to stronger international competition. In addition, these different forms of employment relationships seem to satisfy better the aspirations of individual and family needs of a number of workers.  In other words, these employment relationships constitute a means for utilising production capacities to the full while in many cases they can provide (a) an alternative to unemployment and (b) an appropriate response to different family situations.</P>
    <P>The stance adopted by the Irish labour market to working parents essentially translates into a demand that family life should be flexible enough to deal with the demands of paid work and never <i>vice versa</i>.  It is noted surprisingly, therefore, that a large number of workers leave the labour market because of family responsibilities. It is not surprising, in the context of the traditional society roles of men and women, that the overwhelming majority of those leavers are women. Part-time work, on the other hand, offers a degree of flexibility, which means that the combination of work and family responsibilities is more versatile and, consequently, the majority of part-time workers are women.  The sex based imbalance in the profile of part-time working in Ireland, therefore, makes the <Col N="2062" /> issue of part-time working an equality issue.</P>
    <P>For too long, part-time workers have been ignored by labour legislation and have effectively been treated as a shaded sector of the Irish labour market.  Trends towards increasing levels of part-time employment throughout the EC have been observed for some time and the Employment Equality Agency are committed to focusing attention on that sector so that full-time protection and provision is afforded to workers engaged in such employment.  I believe this Bill will go a long way in meeting the Employment Equality Agency's objectives.  This, together with the recent provisions announced by the Minister for Social Welfare in extending limited welfare cover to part-time workers, is also to be welcomed as a step in the right direction in offering protection to part-time workers.</P>
    <P>I feel it is now important to sound a few words of caution, not in relation to the specific provisions of this Bill but to the general debate that has gone on and will continue in the future in relation to part-time employment.  I am worried about the financial and organisational costs on employers with social welfare cover being extended to part-time employees under the 1991 budget provisions. There may be considerable cost implications for employers and similarly the cost implications for part-time employees of the extension of social welfare cover may be an incentive to drive part-time work further into the black economy.  Thirdly, extending certain provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, to part-time workers may place an additional burden on our industrial relations machinery, and I think we have a duty and an obligation to discuss these issues to ensure that a gain on one side will not become a minus on the other.</P>
    <P>Part-time work is making a considerable impact on the labour markets of most industrialised economies.  Its growth is associated with the expansion of the service sector and the increasing participation of women in the workforce. <Col N="2063" /> This is occurring at a time when unemployment levels remain high and full-time employment is rising only very slowly. The indications for all European countries, including Ireland, are that part-time employment will continue to increase and account for a large proportion of total employment.</P>
    <P>The shift towards part-time and other flexible patterns of work, must be seen in the overall context of a reduction in working hours.  The current average full-time hours of 35-40 hours per week represents less than half of the working week during the 19th century.  As recently as 1963, the International Labour Organisation was advocating that the working week be reduced to five days and recognised the positive role of part-time working in achieving this objective.  The apparently sacrosant 40 hour week has already been undercut in most white collar jobs and a 35 hour working week is sought in some branches of manufacturing.</P>
    <P>Technological change has been and will continue to be a prime factor in influencing work and its place in society. Technological change has also asserted a massive influence on the manufacturing sector, so that despite greater gains in productivity and output, the sector supports the diminishing share of total employment.  Ireland has also experienced this effect and the consequent shift to increased demand for labour and service industries and service occupations. At present this service sector is still relatively labour intensive, but unlike the manufacturing sector, it requires a different form of work schedule and use of labour to meet regular demands and retailing financial and personal services. Hence it is particularly in the services sector that the demands for a different arrangement of labour inputs have occurred and this has led to the search for flexibility and recourse to temporary, casual and part-time forms of work.</P>
    <P>Part-time working has universally been associated with women workers.  It has also been associated with poor pay, poor career opportunities and poor working conditions.  In most countries it is sought <Col N="2064" /> and worked by a substantial and growing number of female workers who do not leave the home for any fancy career, but do so out of sheer economic necessity.  It is difficult to rear families in Ireland today.  The financial strain can be enormous. With so many of our people unemployed, women are forced, through economic necessity, to find alternative ways of improving their living standards or, in most cases, staying above the poverty trap.  These workers are very often exploited by unscrupulous employers who employ them purely to increase profit margins.  The time has come when we will seriously have to look at a minimum wage for all.  That is something that I and my party will have to address in the very near future.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this Bill is to be welcomed and I recommend its passage through this House.  I believe it is important that the workings of the legislation will be monitored and adjusted where necessary to ensure that both part-time workers and employers enjoy the benefits of it.  I compliment the Minister for producing a well researched piece of legislation and I have no doubt it will have the co-operation and agreement of all parties in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming this Bill.  It is part of a charter of rights for part-time working women and is long overdue. Everyone in this House must rejoice at last in its coming before us today.  Full credit is due to the Minister, Deputy Ahern, who has shown himself forceful in so many areas of his brief.  I expect this Bill will actually make him the pin-up of the part-time working brigade because it proposes a very fundamental change.</P>
      <P>We know this Bill will affect a lot of workers.  At present, the part-time workforce is 82,000 and rising.  There is a commitment on the part of many employers to recruiting part-time staff. The number of regular part-time workers has increased dramatically in the past 25 years &mdash; from 42,500 to 70,000 workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2065" /> The Minister gave important and interesting facts in his speech on the composition of that workforce.  I will speak mostly about the women in the workforce. They account for more than three-quarters of all part-time workers in the 25-44 age bracket.  Over 70 per cent of female part-time workers are married women.</P>
    <P>Part-time work is a comparatively new phenomenon, but one that is here to stay and one that will play a growing part in the total labour force in every country. Generally there are many reasons for this, such as the scarcity of jobs and the willingness of people, if they cannot get a full-time permanent job, to take any kind of job; it is influenced by the woman's role in the labour market; the fact that more women stay working after they are married and have children &mdash; they need a lower workload while their children are young; the need to acquire work experience or work skills and, of course, there are other seasonal factors involved.</P>
    <P>In this country part-time workers are regarded as cheap labour by employers whether they are supermarkets, public houses, hospitals or contract cleaners, they are exploiting the most vulnerable people who desperately need jobs, so much so that they concede their options to legal and social welfare rights.  This grievous abuse of the workforce has been ignored by successive Governments in the past.</P>
    <P>We should have proper data on key areas of work patterns for part-time workers.  We know very little about them; we know that there is an army of them, but we do not have enough facts.  We know that most women work part-time because of family responsibilities, the need to be with their children most of the day and to work only when the children are at school or in bed.  We can guess that most of these women who are working part-time are widows, separated or deserted wives, people who would not have had skills in their earlier years and who could not turn their hand to a professional or training area.  They have to <Col N="2066" /> go into the part-time work miliéu and cope with it as best they can.</P>
    <P>More money should be allocated to research into part-time work as we need to know more about that very large workforce. I am happy that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights recently commissioned research on women in atypical jobs, not directly, but partially related.  When we have the final report, within a year, it should give us valuable insights to the attitudes and thinking of such workers.  As far as I know, the researchers are very much dwelling on the atypical work of women in the financial institutions.  It should also give us &mdash; this is terribly important &mdash; greater information about the long term results of atypical work and we should find out the long term results of part-time work.</P>
    <P>Now let me put some flesh on some of the statistics.  About whom are we talking in this workforce?  This Bill is about the army of women we all see every morning at 9 a.m. scurrying on to buses, going home to do a day's work in their home having done another day's work cleaning an office, hospital or public building before 9 a.m.  We are just beginning our work at this time but these women have been up at dawn or before it.  They are like an outlawed race, disappearing from sight at normal work hours.  They do an important service job without which working life could not function in any city.  I know that many young men do part-time work but women are seen as cheap labour and far more of them are in the category of the 23 year old who does waitressing work in a big hospital. She comes in at anti-social hours, often staying longer than others, is paid £60 per week and is not paid for holidays, sickness or even for Christmas Day.  She has no maternity or other rights.  This cries out for change.  In this context I am reminded of an employer who telephoned a contact in the legal area to ask if he had to pay his workers for Christmas Day and St. Stephen's Day because his shop would be closed on those days.  One must wonder about the awareness level of people who think like that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2067" /> Of course employers will continue to employ young women like the woman I quoted who works in a hospital because it saves them a packet of money. However, I should like to know why the State is colluding in such exploitation. There is very little altruism in the tough competitive world of business.  Increasing profit is the driving force and, on the way, it does not really matter what workers are disposed of or how badly they are treated.  That young girl, I am glad to say, will benefit from this Bill.  We look forward to seeing an end to cute practices such as those which take place in many service industries where computers are triggered to activate when 17½ hours have been completed.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted the figure of 7.5 per cent as representing the total part-time workers of the labour force.  This is the official figure but we know that many companies go well beyond this with the figure for one multiple store standing at 11 per cent in relation to part-time workers out of the total workforce.  While the Bill goes a long way to relieve existing difficulties for the majority of part-time workers, it will leave specific groups still out in the cold.  One group comprises student labourers, who work during summer vacations, to earn much needed money for college fees.  If the students work for less than 13 weeks they will not benefit from this legislation and will not have rights, which is regrettable.  I know that everyone cannot be catered for in the Bill.  A very good headstart was made but I am still concerned about young people who do this work because, for many, the money is an absolute necessity. It may have been a luxury in the past but that is certainly not the case now.  This Bill will continue to allow many hamburger joints and public houses to employ workers at 60p per hour with no strings or rights attached.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely happy about the total exclusion of family members from the provisions of the Bill.  I know instances of abuse where family members were treated very badly and did not have redress.  Perhaps the Minister will explain <Col N="2068" /> why family members have been excluded in the Bill?  I am sure that the months and years of intense consultation and negotiation in the preparation of this Bill analysed the broad effects of its measures in financial terms and I am sure that the cost of giving these workers rights now will have only an infinitesimal effect on overall costs.  the extra £3 million per annum which is now going into the pocket of some supermarket millionaire will go towards the cost of implementing the Bill.  It will not have an enormous or dramatic effect on the cost of living or overall costs.</P>
    <P>Let me focus for a moment on the participation ratio of Irish women in the workforce.  What is the picture in relation to other countries in the EC?  The answer is pretty awful in that we have the lowest participation rate of all EC countries, even lower than Greece and Spain, which we would perhaps perceive to be at a lower stage of development than Ireland. The 1980 figure, which shows a rate of 29.7 per cent of all women in the workforce, is appalling when compared to the United Kingdom at 62.3 per cent.  The participation rate of married women in the workforce looks even worse when one considers that we do not now have a marriage bar.  They are very poorly represented in the labour force figures.  The figures I have in relation to married women are for 1987.  In the labour force survey, then there were 31.9 per cent married women in the labour force.</P>
    <P>I will quote some facts from an article by John Walshe in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 22 February 1991 under the heading, &ldquo;More Married Women now Working&rdquo;.  He examines the reasons why, while there are more married women working, we are still very far behind the European figures.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The lack of a detailed study of the labour supply decisions of married women has been identified as a major gap in Irish labour market research, but now this has been filled by a study carried out by Tim Callan and Brian Farrell of the Economic and Social <Col N="2069" /> Research Institute, which was prepared for the National Economic and Social Council.</P>
    <P>It addresses the question why Irish married women are still much less likely than their foreign counterparts to be in the paid labour market.  This cannot be explained simply in terms of Irish fertility rates being higher than elsewhere: participation rates for women with given numbers of children are also lower in Ireland than in most other countries.</P>
    <P>The researchers draw heavily on the work already done by John Blackwell on women in the labour force, but also conducted their own in-depth analysis of the ESRI Survey of Income Distribution &mdash; Poverty and State Services in 1987, which aimed, <i>inter alia,</i> to gather information that would permit such microlevel studies of labour supply issues.</P>
    <P>Their findings are based on a sample of 2,000 married women who had taken part in the ESRI study.</P>
    <P>If we look at the total picture of women in the labour force we see this great imbalance of substantially more women than men in part-time work at the very bottom in low paid jobs and still a very big fall-off of married women out of their permanent jobs when they have two children; the steep decline comes after they have two children.  Therefore, we have a distorted picture of women as workers in no matter what area we look at them.  It would be hard not to accept that this has to do with women as mothers, as parents, in that the pressures mount on them when they have small children and they are caught then between the two forces of lack of child care and lack of support at home and the general sense that they have to feel guilty. Being a mother equates with being at home wearing an apron, baking scones and looking after your children.  It is difficult to withstand that.  Many young women like being at work but they feel guilty because they are not with their children; they cannot withstand all these forces that come at them and then they <Col N="2070" /> decide to leave a job, take a career break or go on part-time work.</P>
    <P>Matters are not helped by husbands who do not take equal participation in what is called home duties, caring for children, shopping and so on.  Until husbands see themselves as very necessary partners in the rearing of the children, shopping, cooking and looking after the home to enable the wife who sincerely wants to keep on her job to do so, we will not progress very far.  I must admit many younger men have an admirable approach to it.  They see themselves in the light that they must take 50 per cent responsibility for the home and the children, thus enabling the women to continue their working life, and the effect on these women is obvious.</P>
    <P>Probably part-time work has to be a role option.  Attitudes to it differ among women's organisations and trade unions. On one hand it is seen as a trap.  If women take part-time work because of pressures when their children are small or perhaps elderly relatives become dependent on them, once they break their career they are going to lose out on important years when promotion or training is being decided and they will never make up those years.  They will continue on and off part-time work or at a low level.  Their colleagues, in many instances men, will have passed them out.  Therefore, part-time work is seen in a negative sense.  On the other hand, one could see it as a necessary escape valve.  When women are under pressure which can be quite awful, they do not have to give up their jobs completely and go entirely out of the workforce. We all realise how difficult it is for such people to get back into the workforce but they can cut back, take some time off, work half a day and still have an income, keep their foot in the door and still do whatever they feel they need to do at home for their children.  Whenever I talk to women or to young school leavers I tend to tell them not to go out of the workforce, to do whatever they can to remain in their jobs because, while it may seem attractive to stay at home and be a mother full-time, at a certain time the woman is conceding something <Col N="2071" /> very important, her ability to earn and her possibilities as an income earner for life.</P>
    <P>The ESRI study has further thoughts on this and I will quote again from the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 22 February:</P>
    <P>The major point that emerges from the analysis is that female participation in the labour market is very responsive to potential earnings.  Thus, married women who could command relatively high wages in the labour market (because of educational qualifications or extensive past work experience) were much more likely to become employed.</P>
    <P>The authors conclude that, other things being equal, a 10 per cent increase in wages would lead to an increase in participation by married women of between 13 and 26 per cent.</P>
    <P>The study also suggests ways in which the objective of supporting married women caring for children could be achieved more efficiently.  It says the existing forms of income support for children are exceedingly complex, including child dependant support under social welfare schemes, family income support for low paid workers, and the universal child benefit (formerly children's allowances).</P>
    <P>The resources used in these schemes could, together with those currently used to provide indirect support to children through the tax treatment of married couples, become consolidated into a single child-benefit type payment.</P>
    <P>Proposals have been made and will continue to be made which can help us to boost the percentage of married women working and Irish women generally in the workforce.  As I said, we need a greater analysis of what is happening out there in the labour force because we have seen dramatic and fundamental changes in the whole structure of work in the last ten or 15 years.  Many of the changes are negative, but we could learn a great deal <Col N="2072" /> about them and perhaps build on what is positive and what makes it possible for the two income family to continue doing what they want to do and be able to look after their home duties as well.</P>
    <P>Once again I welcome this important Bill.  I am very happy that it goes as far as it does.  There are some exceptions I would like to have seen included but the Bill goes a long way to improving the lifestyle of that army of workers, particularly women, who have been neglected for so long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Along with other speakers I welcome the introduction of this Bill and in particular I pay tribute to the Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern, for the most progressive social legislation. It is in line with his performance in office since 1987.  He has achieved a level of understanding with the social partners that has been instrumental in producing the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and agreements which have been of enormous benefit to the economy.  He was responsible for the introduction of the Youthreach programme which helped to cater for socially disadvantaged young people and early school leavers.  By and large, he has been a very caring Minister with a very strong social conscience.  This gives the lie to allegations often thrown at this side of the House from Members of the Opposition, particularly Members of the Left, that Fianna Fáil are a Right wing party.  The performance of the Ministers, Deputy Ahern, Deputy Woods and Deputy O'Rourke, has indicated that Fianna Fáil have a strong social philosophy, a strong social conscience dating back to their origins. This legislation is further testimony to that.  We are far from being a Right wing party.  We are in a left of centre mould.  This legislation is welcome in that respect.</P>
      <P>I regret that there is not any members from the Labour Party or The Workers' Party in the House.  That shows disrespect for this legislation.  I regret it because for many years they have been agitating for this type of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2073" /> I am glad the Minister for Social Welfare has moved in tandem with this legislation in affording to part-time workers the benefits of social security.  Any part-time worker earning over £40 will now be able to apply for social welfare payments. It is important that we have coordination between Ministers.  In the preparation of this legislation the Minister tried to achieve consensus between employers and trade unions and the Bill represents a fairly satisfactory balance in that regard.  To a large extent the Minister has met the needs of the part-time workers while endeavouring to maintain a high degree of flexibility on the employers' side to cater for the growing phenomenon of part-time work.  The Minister outlined the extraordinary growth in part-time work in the last decade.  Ten years ago part-time workers were predominant in agriculture and in manufacturing, but now over three-quarters of part-time workers are in the services sector.  That mirrors the changes that have taken place in the economy over those ten years.  We should ask why we now have such a large percentage of part-time workers in the services industries and if this is affecting the quality of the product of those industries.  This Bill will go a long way towards raising the morale of staff in the services sector.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> place great stress on the tourism industry and the hotel and catering services in terms of employment growth and in terms of achieving higher earnings from abroad.  However, because of the shortage of skilled personnel in this sector we are not in a position to develop these areas as much as we should.  I am worried that such a high percentage of unskilled part-time workers are engaged in the industry without protection or benefits to date.  This lack has resulted in a high turnover of staff in those industries. The poor conditions of employment and the lack of access to proper training and so on, has meant that people became turned off very quickly In 1989 there was a shortage of 1,000 skilled people in this industry, as we know from CERT and <Col N="2074" /> other bodies dealing with that sector.  Pay in this area is low and conditions are poor and this has a detrimental impact on our performance and on the quality of what we produce to attract visitors here.  This point is worth considering.  The Bill will help in that it might result in a great continuity in employment.  Because part-time workers will now be entitled to annual leave, maternity leave and legislative protection, they will have a greater incentive to stay on in various hotels, restaurants and so on, and their morale will be better.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister should do everything possible to appraise the various bodies in the arts sector of the opportunities which this Bill might afford them.  Arts institutions often work on a seasonal basis and can only afford workers on a part-time basis and artists combine a degree of administrative work with their artistic endeavours in artistic institutions.  This Bill could be of particular use in this area.  It is important that as many people as possible know of the contents of the Bill and its implications. Many people do not see the arts as an economic sector, but recent research in Britain shows that the arts have a strong economic dimension.  In large cities in Britain the development of the arts as an economic sector has resulted in the restoration of inner city areas, improved old buildings and so on, which have brought people back to live in city centres near arts centres or opera houses.  The whole services sector needs to be addressed in a far wider fashion than just bringing in protection for part-time workers.  If it is to be the lynchpin for economic growth in the next ten years, we have to be sure that the quality of the product is up to modern standards.</P>
    <P>This progressive legislation will improve the position of a large number of women.  About 70 per cent of part-time workers are women who have been largely discriminated against by employers, and they have had little protection. I am delighted that the seven Acts which are subsumed into this Bill in terms of protecting part-time workers will be applied.  Maternity leave, for <Col N="2075" /> instance, will be a very useful addition in the protection of part-time women workers from now on.  Indeed, I do not object to Deputy Ahearn's wish that male part-time workers should enjoy paternity leave as well.  That is something that might benefit me in later years.  There is a strong argument for paternity leave in the States at the moment.  It is an issue that is gaining greater currency and it was interesting to hear Deputy Ahearn introduce it in the context of this debate today.</P>
    <P>Deputies Shatter and Rabbitte were correct to address the issue of implementation. They argued that workers who are not represented by unions might not be skilled enough to represent themselves before an unfair dismissals tribunal, whereas the employer might have legal representation and so on, and the employee would be at a disadvantage. The Minister should consider that argument, although in his speech he outlined safeguards he introduced to try to guard against abuse and to prevent employers from evading the legislation.</P>
    <P>Just because one is a member of a union in the part-time context does not necessarily mean one will enjoy better rates of pay or rights than people who are not in the union.  Indeed, it has been brought to my attention that many nonunion houses in the catering sector often earn greater amounts of money than those in union houses.  Deputy Rabbitte made the point that the trade union movement must come to terms with the issue of part-time workers and must deal in a more forceful and enlightened way with the issue.  Employers in this area to whom I spoke said that they often pay over the rate of the joint labour councils, but that they feel they have greater flexibility with their staff when they are non-unionised. Unions tend to be concerned with demarcation and petty issues as opposed to the fundamental issue of pay and conditions.  The minimum wage which is agreed by joint labour councils is not necessarily what these employees are paid.  One should not be under the <Col N="2076" /> impression that those who are in non-unionised employment are working for lower wages and in poor working conditions. That is not the case, as has been demonstrated in my own city.</P>
    <P>The employer's perspective is important. The concept of flexibility and a dual workforce is also very important.  Part-time work meets the real needs of employers in the modern world, enabling longer opening hours and so on.  Over-regulation could hinder employment growth and act as a disincentive.  We must also be concerned not to drive part-time workers into the black economy.  It is extremely important to prevent such an exodus.  The Minister has achieved the right balance in that respect.</P>
    <P>While this Bill will mainly affect women, it would also benefit many young people.  During election campaigns I have met many parents who have complained about their sons and daughters working part-time and being unable to obtain annual leave or bank holiday leave.  This legislation will be particularly helpful and will be greeted with delight by many young people in the retail, hotel and catering sectors.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of safeguards to protect against abuse.  I refer to the provisions regarding 13 weeks and the eight hour threshold.  Any dispute in relation to the 13 weeks will be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. This tribunal has worked relatively satisfactorily to date.  By shifting the threshold from 18 hours to eight hours the Minister has achieved the dual goal of bringing the great majority of unprotected part-time workers within the protection of the law, while at the same time the threshold is so low as to give little incentive to employers to create new contracts below that threshold. Some Opposition Members indicated their concern in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the question of a minimum wage and felt this was a major omission from the Bill.  I do not necessarily agree.  While the Bill looks simple and is relatively short, it is nevertheless complex.  Seven Acts are involved.  These are the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, the Minimum Notice <Col N="2077" /> and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 and 1984, the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981, the Worker Participation Acts, 1977 and 1988, the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1990, the Protection of Employees Acts, 1984 and 1990, and the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.  The Minister had to bring all those Acts to bear in this legislation in order to afford part-time workers the protection they afford to full-time workers.  The introduction of the question of the minimum wage would have complicated matters and it should be dealt with separately in due course. We are conscious of the difficulties the European Commission have had in trying to forge a common policy on the minimum wage.  This is due to the different stages of development of the various economies.</P>
    <P>Several speakers have expressed concern about contract workers.  A new breed of worker has emerged who is neither part-time nor full-time but is engaged under contract by an employer. This arrangement is widely used in the building industry.  This would have to be covered by other legislation, if it needs to be covered at all.  People who engage in contract work generally enjoy greater pay and benefits and they enter freely into these contracts.  Part-time workers are not in the same position and cannot call the shots in relation to pay and conditions. The question of contract workers is a separate issue.</P>
    <P>We have been blessed in many respects by the fact that considerable research has been carried out by the universities in regard to the growth of the labour force and the increase in part-time working. Deputy Hillery complimented third level researchers on the role they have played and suggested that there should be a very strong relationship between university research and the formulation of legislation. Solid research can inform legislation and enable Government to meet the needs of the day.</P>
    <P>We must consider how the part-time worker can enter the full-time labour market.  While many part-time workers are satisfied with their status, we have <Col N="2078" /> many younger people with few skills who are destined to be in the part-time workforce for a long time.  It is important that the Department of Labour, with their associated bodies such as FÁS and CERT, the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Education, should combine to introduce programmes which would assist part-time workers to enter the full-time market at some stage.  It is quite unacceptable that a young person entering the employment market as a part-timer should be assigned to a five-year stint as such.  We should target that area and adopt measures which would enable part-time workers to obtain full-time employment.  We must consider training schemes and incentives to employers.  The Minister raised the matter in his speech and said it would be high on his agenda.</P>
    <P>I join in the general welcome accorded to this Bill and I am pleased at the degree of consensus in the House.  I note the lack of representation of the Labour Party and The Workers' Party for the duration of the debate.  That is to be regretted, in view of the importance of this social legislation. They should have been here for the whole debate.</P>

      <P>I welcome the brevity of the Minister's reply and I welcome the establishment of a National Energy Conservation and Efficiency Advisory Group.  Is the Minister aware, however, that the EC sectoral energy objectives for 1995 ask each country to undertake conservation measures affecting 20 per cent of our energy use?

If I was to outline to the Deputy all the many ongoing measures in this area, I would be giving her a long reply, which she does not want, today anyway.  The Deputy should look at the latter part of my response where I refer to the work of the advisory group, and state that the projects which they have recommended are under active consideration in the Department.  I am actively involved and am anxious to achieve major progress in this area.  Today I am merely listing some of the initiatives that have been taken during my time in the Department, but that does not mean that there are not many other projects that are planned at present and which I am not in a position to give details of as yet, and many others already under way under previous programmes.</P>

      <P>The level of funding for conservation activities has had to be curtailed in recent years due to severe difficulties in the State's finances.  Since 1981, State expenditure for this programme has amounted to approximately £6 million.  Funding for conservation peaked in 1981 at £2.132 million.  It should be mentioned that the benefits of any expenditure undertaken in the past will, of course, continue into the future and the budget this year of £570,000 is three to four times the level of the annual expenditure during the seventies and about double the average expenditure for the years 1984 to 1989.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The company announced on 21 February 1991 that it had reached agreement with an Australian-Dutch consortium on the terms under which the consortium would participate in the licence.  That farm-out agreement, as required by our licensing terms, has been submitted to me for my consent to the proposed change in licence interests.  The agreement envisages the carrying out of an early assessment of the feasibility of a commercial development scheme which would involve oil production from Block 49/9. Once the results of this assessment are to <Col N="2082" /> hand it will be for the companies involved to make their own judgments and to decide whether to take the process further. In so far as the farm-out agreement entered into by Atlantic and its partners is a step along a road which could result in Irish oil being brought ashore for the first time in commercial quantities I regard it as a welcome development.</P>
    <P>If it is eventually proposed to produce oil from Block 49/9, then the 1975 terms, as amended, most notably in 1987, will apply.  Those involved will need to apply for a petroleum lease when a commercial discovery of petroleum has been established. Within 30 days of the application for a lease, the initial plans for the development of the discovery must be submitted to me for approval under section 21 of the terms.  I can therefore assure the Deputy that my approval will be required at each critical point leading to any oil production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 13, 17, 19, 20, 23, 30 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The upgrading of the Whitegate Oil Refinery and the reactivation of the Whiddy Terminal have been at the centre of oil supply planning for some time. Opportunities are being sought which might lead to an oil producer or an international oil company participating in the proposed development of the refinery and the terminal.  Discussions have been taking place over the last year with a number of parties who had expressed a firm interest in the facilities.  The Government are willing to consider proposals involving both facilities or one of the facilities, and discussions have been carried out on that basis.  Apart from the upgrading of Whitegate, I have no plans for a refinery at any other location.</P>
      <P>Discussions with a consortium which included Nigerian interests were terminated. This decision was taken in the light of all the information available and analyses made including independent advice available to the Government in this matter.</P>
      <P>There has been no direct proposal received from the Ecuadoran Government for either a crude supply deal or for the upgrading of the Whitegate Refinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force established by the Government to identify all realistic investment options for the facilities at Whiddy and Whitegate evaluated the technical, economic and financial aspects of the options identified.  For reasons of commercial confidentiality, I am not in a position to give details of these options. While more than one option for an upgrade of Whitegate was identified by the task force the preferred option is for <Col N="2086" /> a project which would enable Whitegate to handle a wide range of crudes and to have cracking facilities to increase yields of white products (petrol and gas oil) to the expected higher future standards.  No valid project, even if it differed somewhat from the ideal, would be ignored; it would be fully examined.</P>
    <P>The decision to store over 200,000 tonnes of crude oil at Whiddy was a crucial element in our response to the Gulf crisis.  It does not have any impact on our long term plans for Whiddy and Whitegate, other than emphasising the strategic importance of the INPC and of our oil storage and refining facilities.</P>

      <P>Do I gather from the Minister's reply that, despite all the speculation of recent weeks, what he is effectively reporting to this House is no progress, no live interest at the moment and Whitegate continuing to remain at 60 per cent of its capacity?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very reassured by the Minister's statements in that these discussions seem to be endlessly ongoing. In relation to the Ecuadoran interest in the project, there seems to have been at least a breakdown in communication. Does the Minister feel that he has any role in reopening that line of inquiry?  Has the Minister looked at all the options in the context of international expertise to make sure that he has access to all possible interested parties?  Are there any extra resources which he could put into the area of marketing this internationally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>I would like to inform the House that the discussions we have entered into with different parties will only end when a satisfactory deal can be completed from the point of view of the national interest here.  Whatever time it takes to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion will be taken.  I will not rush this just to arrive at a decision.  It is a very important facility, as has been highlighted during the past seven months, and it is my intention to act in the best interest of the economy and the people in the matter. The Government have decided that they will only deal with principals in regard to proposals for upgrading or investment in the Whitegate and Whiddy facilities.  There has been no approach from principals in relation to the Ecuadoran Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the recently announced price increase is due to an increase in the rate of VAT, this question relates primarily to budgetary matters which are the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Falling costs had, exceptionally, enabled the ESB to absorb the two previous increases in VAT but because of the board's changed financial situation, a further discount of 2.5 per cent is just not possible.</P>
      <P>My policy in relation to gas and electricity charges is that the BGE and ESB should strive for the lowest possible price achievable consistent with a satisfactory long term financial position.  In particular Irish prices should be competitive within the EC.</P>

Was the Minister aware of the proposal by the Minister for Finance and has he spoken to either the ESB or Bord Gáis Éireann in the meantime to see if they could absorb this increase?  In other words, is he satisfied that neither the ESB nor Bord Gáis Éireann can absorb the 2.5 per cent increase, particularly Bord Gáis Éireann, who are very secretive about their financial affairs?

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>I have received the Earthwatch report referred to, and it has been examined in my Department.  Its recommendations will be borne in mind in the context of further potential developments in the area of renewable energy and conservation.</P>
      <P>With regard to my Department's policy on the development of renewable energy resources, I would refer the Deputies to my reply to a similar question from Deputy Pearse Wyse on 30 January 1991. My Department's policy is to monitor developments in the new and renewables field, both in Ireland and abroad, and to support their introduction in Ireland where technically and economically feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two alternative sources of energy which are generally recognised as having the greatest potential are hydro and wind. With regard to hydroelectricity, most of the technical potential for this has already been developed in Ireland, and development of the remaining potential will depend largely on changing economic and environmental conditions.  With regard to wind power, I invited proposals for Ireland's first wind farm development to be submitted to me late last year.  The proposals received are currently being <Col N="2090" /> examined by an assessment team in my Department, and I expect to have their recommendation shortly.  Up to £3.9 million will be available for this project under the EC's Valoren programme.</P>
    <P>The potential for commercial development of other forms of renewable energy is at this stage less certain than in the case of hydro and wind energy.  Considerable further research is needed to improve technical reliability and reduce costs. Research continues to be carried out in Ireland, mostly under EC programmes, by State sector companies and by the private sector.  My Department monitor this activity and similar activities which are carried out in other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that we have just seen a six week war over oil and that a growing body of opinion favours energy conservation and the development of renewable sources of energy as an alternative to oil, can the Minister explain how it is that the provision for energy conservation in 1991 is being reduced by 28 per cent and that in fact there is no provision for the development of renewable energy?  Does this not indicate that the Government are not serious about developing the renewable energy option?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy has been listening to my reply.  I have initiated a programme which I hope will result in the establishment of Ireland's first wind farm at a site in County Mayo. The arrangements in relation to that have been well publicised.  The invitation for tenders was by way of public advertisement in which a huge number of people showed an interest.  A large number of actual proposals were received and the assessment team in my Department are working on them and will shortly be making a recommendation to me.  Rather than look at the sum of money provided in the Estimates for conservation the Deputy should take a broader look at things I can do as Minister for Energy which will have a major impact in establishing alternative sources of renewable energies here.  Wind offers <Col N="2091" /> a very good prospect for this country.  I am hopeful that the result of the public advertisement will enable a contract to be entered into and work to commence for the building of this major wind farm.  This is a very significant development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in an earlier reply indicated that there is a huge problem nationally in getting people either to appreciate the need for conservation or the allied question of finding other sources of energy, particularly renewable ones.  Does the Minister not accept, therefore, that an enormous responsibility rests with his Department, if there is to be any movement or any drive in this area?  It is clear that he is pointing to a single project but that is only a drop in the ocean compared with what is required.  What targets has he set? Does he plan to reach the EC objective of 5 per cent of our national energy to be supplied from this sector by 1995?  What are the Minister's plans for the wind farm and will it be the first of many?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking initiatives where in the past nobody took an initiative and still the Deputy seeks to deride the steps and the measures that are being undertaken, so I presume that I will never satisfy what the Deputy wishes me to achieve.  I am explaining every possible option available to us to establish alternatives to using fossil fuels in this country. The progress made is reasonably satisfactory, and I am hopeful of further improvements being made.  I do not have any fixed targets as such.  I have to establish the potential for alternatives and how I can achieve them.  Some years ago an investigation was carried out into hydroelectricity but other obstacles came in the way so that little progress was made in that area.  There are environmental considerations which have to be taken into account which were not a factor some years ago.  That is something that has interfered with the programme to expand the hydro-electrical network in Ireland. The cost factor in relation to many of the renewable energy sources that have been <Col N="2092" /> identified makes them uneconomic at present.  The report which has been referred to here does not deal, to any great extent, with the cost or economic aspect of some of the proposals but merely identifies possible sources of energy through this form.  That aspect has to be taken into account in determining national policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While commending the Minister for what he is now doing in regard to the development and encouragement of wind farms, I think it is true that we have done little or nothing in this country despite our dependence on imported energy sources.  While we may not have any great potential for energy from the sun, we certainly have more than enough from both wind and wave not to mention biomass.  I should like to ask the Minister whether there is any intention in his Department to initiate experimental or pilot projects or to continue the research which was operating in Cork University on wave development?  Biomass is not being followed up.  The third, which I think has the greatest potential of all from a renewable energy point of view, is the Elsbett engine which is being flogged around this country without very much notice being taken of it.  It is perhaps the most farreaching&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In relation to wave energy, solar energy or biomass, research and demonstrations have taken place in these areas and often with European Community support.  The potential for commercial development appears to be less certain than in the case of hydro or wind energy.  Considerable further research is needed to improve technical reliability and to reduce costs.  Research in these areas is carried out under schemes that are supported by the Community. I am anxious to harness any of these sources if it can be done within reasonable cost levels, but unfortunately with many of the alternative energy sources the cost of the technology is such that they are not economically viable. Worldwide research is taking place and the results are available to us.  When the opportunity presents itself I will be very anxious to avail of it here.</P>

      <P>The world economic system has not succeeded in averting volatility in the movement of the price of oil and related products.  Ireland, like all net consumers of oil products, and this category, includes most of the worlds major economies, including the US, Germany and Japan, is a price taker when it comes to oil.  Sustained efforts by both oil producers, and notably OPEC, and oil consuming countries have failed in their efforts to avert the volatility in prices so disruptive in terms of world economic order.  There is little Ireland can do to cushion itself against rises in the oil price nor is there a valid case for not allowing price changes to flow through to the market.</P>

      <P>A similar question was tabled when prices were high.  However, when prices are low other concerns arise. Am I correct in saying that there is a growing view at EC level that larger strategic stocks should be maintained in various countries?  Can the Minister say if this is so in our case?  Can he also say <Col N="2096" /> if we are making plans to maintain in strategic locations larger stocks of oil than are currently required?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be some tentative suggestions in regard to changes in the requirement to maintain certain levels of strategic stocks but I do not think it has advanced to the stage suggested by the Deputy.  It is important to remember that even in meeting the 90 day requirement which exists a very large cost has to be borne by the consumer.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no concerted effort to ensure energy reduction.  There is a concerted effort to reduce the consumption of oil here.  This has been going on for the past ten years with some success, as was evident from the figures published when the trouble arose in the Middle East.  Happily we are not now as dependent on oil as we were at the time of the last oil crisis.  It will continue to be Government policy to seek to utilise alternative sources of energy to oil.  Of course, the discovery of gas has greatly helped in this regard.  The Government's proposed inter-connector between the Irish and British gas systems will be a major step in reducing our dependence on oil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the Government have to achieve a delicate balance in regard to this issue?  While high oil prices are disastrous for western economies, too low <Col N="2097" /> oil prices encourage the increased usage of oil, leading to increased vulnerability in the future.  As Sheikh Yamani said, prices could go as low as $12 a barrel after the Gulf War.  What is the Minister's view of the attempts being made by the EC and the International Energy Agency to stabilise prices at a level which will not encourage a rapid return to the use of oil, which would undermine all the work done in that area in the past decade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Sheikh Yamani might have other ideas about the price of $12 per barrel.  I do not think he will be too happy about this and he probably has other means available to him, through OPEC and other agencies, to look after his interests and those of his friends.  A problem exists that when the price of oil is low people see no necessity for conservation policies and do not respond to the urgings by the Minister for Energy and others to be more efficient in the way they use oil.  I have been through all this because when I came into the Department the price of oil was low and there was no danger on the horizon.  We have to try to find a balance and continue to educate the public about the need to use oil efficiently.  Our biggest hope of making progress would be to reduce our dependency on oil.  I will continue to vigorously promote energy conservation and focus on the need to reduce our use of oil and CO2 fuels.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The radioactive generators to which the Deputy refers are used in hospitals in <Col N="2099" /> the diagnosis of a wide range of health conditions and provide physicians with important information in relation to the treatment of patients.  The cores are kept in the hospitals after use in safe and secure storage and their activity drops to very low levels after six months.</P>
    <P>Whilst the Nuclear Energy Board are satisfied that the cores are being safely stored it is not considered to be ideal for each hospital to store its own waste in the long term.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the NEB are carrying out a survey of the quantities being held in hospitals to quantify the amount currently in storage.  This information will be of value in my consideration of the question of the establishment of a waste storage facility in Ireland in which I will be facilitated by a visit of the International Atomic Energy Agency's waste disposal advisory service to Ireland in July of this year.</P>

      <P>It is not so much that there is an absence of a policy but the absence of a radioactive waste disposal site in this country, which has been well documented and is referred to in the Nuclear Energy Board reports.  That board carried out a survey of radioactive waste disposal in Ireland and issued a report in December 1988.  I have indicated to this House on more than one occasion, as I did again yesterday during the discussion on the Radiological Protection Bill, that International Atomic Energy Agency experts are coming here to carry out a survey and assist the Department in their work in seeking to identify a suitable site and make the necessary arrangements. The invitation to the International Atomic Energy Agency was made last year but they were not able to come here instantly; we had to wait our turn.  As I told the House yesterday, those people are coming in July.</P>
      <P>As regards a policy for the disposal of radioactive waste, we should make it clear that what we are talking about here are very low levels.  The storage on site arrangement has been certified as safe by Nuclear Energy Board inspectors, but this is not the ideal way to store the waste. By way of implementing a policy in this matter I am anxious to establish a site where all these matters can be stored in the one location under the most optimum conditions.  High level radiation is imported here under a licence and has to be re-exported to the supplier.  Therefore that is not stored here.  What we are talking about is radioactive waste with very low levels of radiation which is of no danger.  It is important we do not create scares.  The Deputy said yesterday he has some experience in this area.  We are not anxious to alarm people.  The Nuclear Energy Board are satisfied with the storage of this low level waste at present.  We are anxious to establish a national storage site for it, but there is no need for anybody to be alarmed.</P>

    <P>As of 1 January 1991, Marathon have drilled four exploration wells and a further well is scheduled to be commenced shortly.  My Department are in discussion with the company concerning the completion of the full programme.

The well was flooded on 16 January 1990 and was temporarily plugged and abandoned on 30 April 1990. Four intervals were tested and the well produced oil at a flow of about 1,620 barrels per day on a half inch choke and produced an accumulative amount of gas of about 5.4 million cubic feet per day.

      <P>I and other members of the Government have used and will continue to use every opportunity to press for the establishment of an independent nuclear inspectorate.  At the recent conference on the review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in August 1990 my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, reiterated our concerns about nuclear safety and our wish to see an <Col N="2104" /> independent inspection force to verify safety standards.</P>
      <P>During the Irish Presidency the issue of nuclear safety was given priority.  I was successful in instigating discussions on nuclear energy and environment issues &mdash; the first time the Energy Council committed themselves to such discussions.  I am hopeful that progress on safety issues will arise from these discussions and the decision of the council to pursue these matters.</P>
      <P>As a result of repeated representations for a Community inspection force the EC Commission decided to resume inspections of radioactivity monitoring facilities for nuclear installations.  Although this does not satisfy our demand for an inspection force to monitor the operation of nuclear installations, it is an important step forward in that it involves the Community in a limited inspection role.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department have met EC Commission representatives to discuss the Commission proposals in this regard.  My Department expressed Ireland's support and willingness to assist the Commission in every way possible and indicated concern that adequate staff and other resources should be devoted by the Commission to a vigorous programme of inspection.

Will the Minister agree that nuclear reprocessing stations are even more in need of inspection than nuclear <Col N="2105" /> power stations?  Can I be assured that the Minister is pursuing this in the international arena?</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy, and the House, that I have been pursuing this issue at every forum available to me since I was appointed Minister.  Some Deputies, in response to parliamentary questions, received a letter from me indicating the various opportunities of which I had availed to raise this matter and it is quite an extensive list.  I will continue to bring this matter to the notice of the other member states in particular and, as a member of the Energy Council, I have been able to do so.  It has been difficult to get some of the member countries to accept the Irish argument because they see it as an attack on their own integrity and standards.  However, in time we will win this argument although it has taken a lot of effort and, I am afraid, it will take a lot more before we see positive results.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that it is one of the EC sectoral energy objectives that nuclear power will be increased as an element of the sources of power in the Community?  In that context, the question of an inspectorate is even more important.  Will he clarify, in the context of the limited progress made, whether it is still a question of voluntary agreement regarding inspection?  Is that option still there for each country?  Must they agree to the inspection which, obviously, has been a problem for us in relation to Sellafield?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the Deputy's question in relation to voluntary inspections.  We are seeking an EC inspectorate which would have the right to enter these plants, carry out a full inspection and make the results known to all member states.  The Community has, of course, many member countries which utilise nuclear energy and they see a role for nuclear power in their energy policy. We are different but our difference is recognised.  Our concerns have not been fully recognised but the other member <Col N="2106" /> states are beginning to take a more sympathetic approach to the concern which people in Ireland as a whole are expressing.  Indeed, other countries are also voicing concerns because there is opposition to nuclear energy stations within the nuclear power countries.</P>

      <P>A visit to Sellafield by me <Col N="2107" />&mdash; or indeed by any other Minister &mdash; would serve no useful purpose and might be misinterpreted as an endorsement of the plant.  I have repeatedly conveyed to the British Government Ireland's opposition to Sellafield and I am kept fully informed by the Nuclear Energy Board of the facts in relation to it.  The Nuclear Energy Board keep me informed of the facts in relation to Sellafield by way of visits which officials of the board make to Sellafield, the most recent of which was in October 1990.  They make the visits in order to update their technical knowledge of the plant, which is adequate and sufficient.  I am not technically qualified to offer an opinion on installations which I might see there and it is more appropriate to send qualified people to report to me.  I should like to record the fact that British Nuclear Fuels have facilitated these visits and have been very forthcoming but, obviously, they are trying to sell their point of view, which I do not accept.</P>

It has been suggested in the past &mdash; but not in recent times &mdash; that Ireland could bring a legal case and that Greenpeace had produced documents to the Department of Energy which showed it was possible. In fact, the Greenpeace documents do not show that a case can be brought; I offered Greenpeace an opportunity to meet officials from the office of the Attorney General to discuss the legal case which they felt Ireland could take. Greenpeace asked for the meeting to be postponed to after Christmas and I understand it will take place shortly.

      <P>My Department have not conducted any survey on the calorific value of smokeless fuels.  However, EOLAS, on behalf of the Department of the Environment, have prepared a comprehensive report for consumers on the characteristics in use of low smoke solid fuels.  This report covers such issues as ignition behaviour, burning behaviour, heating performance and the safe use of solid fuels.  It is available on request from EOLAS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I have that report which, although very important, is not much use to householders.  I am sure the Minister is aware it indicates the differences in the size of bags for something like 30 different smokeless fuels, 50 kilos, 40 kilos and 35 kilos.  I am sure the Minister is also aware that the report indicates the difference in price for the same fuels.  For example, CDL charge £8.20 for coalite and Bord na Móna charge £7.20 for the same fuel.  The report indicates the length of burning time of fuel in 12 hours but it does not give a comprehensive report to consumers on the best fuel for use in their grates, indicating calorific value, the amount of fuel they get to a bag and the price.</P>

      <P>I should emphasise that my Department have responsibility for <Col N="2110" /> the supplies of fuels, including coal, and we have been making every effort to ensure that stocks are adequate and that supplies continue.  Questions as to the cost of these fuels and their safety will have to be resolved with the Department of Industry and Commerce.  We must bear in mind that this year has been a baptism of fire for the smokeless fuel industry and has involved much trial and error on the part of consumers and the coal industry alike.  When the current heating season draws to an end I expect my Department, together with the Department of the Environment and the Department of Industry and Commerce, will meet further to discuss many of the issues which have been raised in this House and by people outside it.  We have gone through the first year with a major change in the consumption of solid fuel in Dublin City.  We expected and anticipated some difficulties, but every effort will be made to eliminate those difficulties by the advent of the next winter fuel season.</P>

      <P>I will, yes.  The three Ministers are closely in touch with each other in regard to this matter.  By coincidence we all happen to be members of the same <Col N="2111" /> party.

      <P>The Minister referred to a baptism of fire.  If it had been a baptism of fire for Dubliners they would have been happy with it but these fuels provided inadequate heat, there was great difficulty in getting them to light and much additional expense for the consumer. It is estimated that what it costs to keep a fire burning for four hours with these how fuels would have kept a fire burning for a full day last year.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the EOLAS leaflet.  It is extremely helpful but it was not sent to householders.  It gives information as to ignition qualities, spitting qualities, calorific qualities and so on of these fuels.  The Minister should ensure that the leaflet is supplied to householders instead of issuing a general blurb on cleaning up Dublin's air, something everyone is willing to contribute to anyway.  The people pitched in but they were let sink by the Government and have to find their way through vast lists of fuels with which they were totally unfamiliar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan may not have been here a few minutes ago when Deputy Allen was here and brief reference was made to this.  For the sake of the record I had better say, in case there is a misunderstanding about the <Col N="2114" /> nature of the advice provided by Greenpeace to my Department, that Greenpeace gave my predecessors two documents concerning court action. Neither document gave grounds for optimism as they agreed with the advice available to me which is that there is little effective scope for court action.  As I informed the House, I have made arrangements for discussions to take place involving my Department, the Attorney General's Office and Greenpeace to consider possible other courses of action.  I did that at a meeting I had with Greenpeace about a year ago and that meeting has not taken place yet.  I offered Greenpeace the opportunity of coming in and explaining the case they felt they had to the Attorney General, and he has looked at their documents. They agreed the documents they submitted did not provide the basis for an effective court action.  I do not see what more I can do to nail this down.  I have continuously said that if it can be shown that effective court action can be taken I will be very pleased to make a recommendation in the matter to the Government, but I cannot do so on the basis of not having a case.</P>

If that is what the Deputy is suggesting, what is the case?  Deputy McCartan is a senior lawyer, and if he is continuously raising this issue here he must believe that there is a case.  The highest legal advice available to me is that there is not a case.  I would be happy to have somebody present a case to me and I will take it.</P>

If nothing is to happen with regard to Sellafield as it stands, will the Minister accept that when the THORP Plant opens, the traffic of nuclear waste to and from the plant on the Irish Sea will dramatically increase?  Will the Minister give an undertaking to the House that at least that matter will be raised with our nearest partner with regard to what safeguards will be introduced and secured and in the event of failure to negotiate, there is a basis open to the Minister to take legal action internationally?</P>

In time, that opinion will win out and will sway Government action in the Community states where, as we know, we have very strong pro-nuclear countries.

      <P>The Working Group on Combined Heat and Power (CHP) submitted its report to me in July of last year. The working group focused its attention on two main areas, namely, the then existing ESB tariff for CHP operators and the question of ESB buying surplus power which is supplied to the national grid by CHP operators.  The group found that the ESB tariff arrangements were not unfair as they relate to CHP operators and that the ESB should publish a tariff for buying power from CHP operators.</P>
      <P>Following completion of the report, the ESB announced changes in the tariff which will benefit CHP operators and undertook to purchase surplus electricity at the same rates as those applicable to hydro-producers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Garland and I have had many discussions about the tragedy that is besetting sea trout.  It has baffled scientists as well as Deputy Garland and me, but to imply that the ESB activities are directly related to what is happening to sea trout would be wide of the mark, because the area where the sea trout are suffering is off Counties Mayo and Galway mostly, and the ESB do not have any fish farms in those areas.  Their fish farms are located in the north-west and south-west and there has not yet been any evidence of any ill effects on the sea trout in those areas.  There has been devastation among the sea trout off the coast in my constituency in Galway and in the Mayo rivers.  The Stag report does not claim to come to a scientific conclusion in regard to the matter.  It sought to arrive at some conclusion, but it is not claiming that the conclusion is based on scientific facts.</P>

They are not certain as to the cause but they claim there is a major correlation between affected sea trout and fisheries and adjacent salmon farms, with the sea lice population explosion resulting from the presence of the farms and this has been identified as in all probability a major factor in the decline in the sea trout population.

      <P>In what is a short Bill one could be deceived into thinking that it related to short measures or a small number of items.  On the contrary, <Col N="2138" /> however, if ever the adage of good goods in small parcels was appropriate it is appropriate to this Bill.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we possibly have the most significant labour legislation for some time in terms of its impact across so many facets of the employment contract.  Its impact on minimum notice, unfair dismissals, redundancy payments, worker directorships, holiday entitlements, maternity protection and the protection of employees in insolvent companies is so significant for so many thousands of workers that it justifiably deserves all the accolades that can be bestowed upon it.</P>
      <P>The Bill emphasises the commitment of the Government and the Minister to the protection of workers and the security of their work environment.  In this regard, we in Ireland have a record of which we can be very proud.  This legislation follows close on the heels of the enactment of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act and even the Companies Act, recently enacted, which gives directors of a company obligations in regard to their employees.  Piece by piece we have put a structured and responsible framework around the relationship between employer and employee, one which builds integrity and respect into that relationship.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that the economic response to difficult times has led to rationalisation within companies and industries, and because of creative employment policies, many companies have been driven towards lesser numbers of full-time employees and larger numbers of part-time workers.  In many instances these responses were justified in the interests of maintaining viable employment.  In many other cases we are aware that they have resulted from a policy of exploitation of those least able to defend themselves and in many cases also those most in need.  This matter of exploitation needed to be addressed.  It is an evil, a malaise that can creep in almost inadvertently.  Employers in certain areas, particularly in the service sector, may not set out to exploit those people whom they employ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The influences which have guided or <Col N="2139" /> steered modern work practice towards part-time rather than full-time employment have evolved a situation in which exploitation becomes an integral part of things.  Several warnings have been issued in recent times regarding this matter. People of the calibre of Mr. Jim Nugent, Chairman of CERT, our catering training agency, have come out strongly in recent times to warn us of the dangers and hazards involved in bestowing on workers and employees less than meritorious levels of pay and conditions and general treatment.  Responsible employers, mindful of the needs for their workers and of the necessity that mutual trust and respect should obtain at all times, will welcome this legislation.  Those responsible employers will ensure that this legislation will in no way act as a deterrent against the recruitment of workers to operate on a part-time basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, took a giant step in this important area recently when he signed regulations which brought 21,000 part-time workers within the scope of the social welfare scheme.  This action ensured that henceforth thousands of women in part-time positions will now enjoy more security, will be entitled to social welfare benefits and, ultimately, to pensions.  It is a welcome innovation indeed.</P>
    <P>In this Bill I see the responsible approach of a Legislature which acts to intercede on behalf of those people.  It is a measure which lifts the veil of exploitation from around thousands of part-time workers, gives to them a basis of a new self-respect and a more concrete foundation to their employment contract. More than any other category of workers, it affects women workers who work short but regular hours each week to support families or add to the household income.</P>
    <P>The existing legislative framework allowed or provided for a situation in which a dual workforce could develop. On the one hand, we had those whose hours of work merited the safeguards of the many Acts referred to and, on the <Col N="2140" /> other hand, those on short hours who, only by that fact alone, were deprived of access to the many protections which we have striven to introduce over the past 20 years in particular.  Those Acts were drafted and enacted to build around the employment relationship a set of values based upon a mutual respect and freedom to enter into contracts of employment. They were not enacted to cut across the values of commercial enterprise, to restrict unnecessarily or constrain employers or to impose upon them unjustifiable burdens.  They were a necessary and just enshrining in law of society's values of respect for each working person and respect for the contract between employer and employee.</P>
    <P>Equally the adoption or application of those values cannot be limited to the extent that they are calculable in terms of the number of hours worked.  We must continue to reassess their impact in the light of experience and respond appropriately to that experience.  It is from this accumulated knowledge that this Bill derives and I wholeheartedly welcome it.</P>
    <P>As in all Bills or proposals, we must decide on a threshold, as we did in the past, and in reducing the number of reckonable hours to eight the Minister has taken a very bold step which I am sure will be appreciated by all.  I understand that the 18 hour threshold excluded approximately 20,000 workers from the benefits of the majority of the legislation being amended by this Bill.  Approximately 45,000 workers were excluded from the benefits of the Holidays (Employees) Act.  About 38,000 workers were excluded from public holiday entitlements, and most of those excluded were women.  The great expansion in the number of part-time workers in recent years led to a concern about the adequacy of existing employment legislation and the status of part-time workers was identified as an issue in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The proposals in this Bill give great credence to the concept of social partnership underlying such national agreements, the concept of working together for the betterment of <Col N="2141" /> society in general and the less priviliged in particular.</P>
    <P>I know there are still some people or organisations who may decry this Bill. They may claim it lays additional burdens on the commercial viability of some businesses.  I believe these concerns or objections are unsustainable.  A regular part-time employee will have worked for a continuous period of 13 weeks, for a minimum of eight hours per week as specified in Part I of the Bill. Can it be that that person is not entitled to be treated fairly on dismissal, entitled to a minimum period of notice or proper conditions of employment?  Should he or she not have redress to a tribunal to hear his or her case where there are disputes warranting a hearing?  Is he or she not entitled to protection in proportionate fashion in insolvency to appropriate and proportionate holiday entitlements, maternity leave, etc.?  No one could adduce an argument which could justify such deprivation.</P>
    <P>Equally it must be remembered that the Acts carry mutual responsibilities for both employer and employee and all the safeguards and procedures to ensure fair treatment for both sides continue to apply in equal measure.  I am sure we can all remember the concerns expressed before those Acts were enacted and I think we all now agree that they have been shown to be unjustified.  The Acts and, in particular, the procedures and bodies established to oversee them, have survived very well and have come to gain the respect of all sides.  This legislation provides for the umbrella of security and safeguards to be extended over many part-time workers, and in particular women, and I would like particularly to compliment the Employment Equality Agency for their work in assisting employees and employers to appreciate the value and respect owing to all workers, irrespective of sex.  I believe we have made tremendous strides in this area.  I know the agency will see in this Bill a much welcome addition to the <Col N="2142" /> achievement of even greater progress on that front.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill and its straightforward and simply put message, and I welcome it very much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>As the situation is obviously different from what I anticipated, I will take this opportunity to say that I welcome very much this legislation which deals with the entitlements of part-time workers.  The patterns of employment in this country and throughout Western Europe have changed radically in the past ten or 15 years.  The traditional picture of a firm, factory or enterprise of any sort has been radically transformed. Traditionally the firm or company was made up of a large body of full-time workers, with perhaps a small number of part-time employees and an occasional contract worker.  That picture has been transformed completely and now there is a small corps of full-time permanent employees &mdash; the hub of the wheel, and the spokes and the rim would be the contract and part-time workers.  Because of the volatility of world markets and the constantly changing pace of technological improvements which can make viable enterprise outdated overnight, companies have been choosing contract and part-time work as a means of making themselves more viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are sound financial decisions but, in the midst of this, there are human beings whose traditional expectations in relation to employment had to change because they were exposed to much more vulnerable working environments.  The group most affected, as all speakers here today have identified, have tended to be women because women who are not well established within the workforce have found that as a consequence of these radical changes in the nature and structure of work, places of work and the organisation of work, they are more and more marginalised and end up on the wrong side of the track.  This legislation, which has come as part of an EC move &mdash; I am glad to say we have adopted not the minimum levels but generous levels <Col N="2143" />&mdash; is a recognition of this reality and the very great change in the workplace, and is welcome.  I am glad that we have responded as we have done in much of our labour and social legislation &mdash; we cannot pat ourselves on the back about our social legislation but our labour legislation is more advanced than other countries.</P>
    <P>This side of the House welcomes this measure.  In the seventies, as part of a radical coalition we introduced some major measures which gave protection to those in permanent employment &mdash; the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Employment Equality Acts and the Maternity in Employment Acts.  This Bill is effectively giving the protection of many of these measures to part-time employees.  This side of the House, and I as a woman particularly welcome this legislation.  I also hope that what I think is the beginning of a stage will mean that we are adopting a new aspiration for work.  We have gone for the expensive option, or what on the surface appears to be the expensive option.  Like the previous speaker said &mdash; and I found myself in agreement with a lot of what he said &mdash; we must change our attitude.  We must invest in our employees, in their dignity, status and rights.  There are choices to be made, particularly with 1992 coming, choices that are exercising the minds of EC countries, whether countries on the periphery, like Ireland, will adopt what they describe as a dumping approach to employment and go for low wage, low protection employment.  I would be very concerned that this should not be the direction we will go.</P>
    <P>While people are cautions about taking on certain issues such as minimum wages because they believe they may hinder employment and the level of employment, I suggest that this is not so.  When the equality legislation came into force the scaremongers suggested that if we gave women equal pay for equal work we would lose jobs wholesale.  This has not <Col N="2144" /> happened.  Since women got equal pay they have participated more and more in the workforce.  I believe we can afford to go not necessarily for a high wage but for a fair and reasonable wage and maximum protection in employment.  The positive side is that higher productivity, higher morale and a more effective industrial environment lead to higher profits and a happier workforce.  I am encouraged by the bravery of this legislation which has adopted not the minimum standards that we often try to settle for but a level somewhat above them.  We have said our workers are worthy of protection, are worthy of investment, and I hope further developments in policy in the future will be on the lines I indicated.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to its speedy implementation.</P>

It reflects a thoughtful and critical assessment of an area that has been growing in recent years and seeks to redress the twilight zone in which so many part-time workers have found themselves without the protection or benefits of most of the labour legislation or, indeed, the social welfare legislation.</P>
      <P>There has been a huge growth in the employment or part-time workers, particularly over the last few years, and we will see it more and more as we move towards the Single Market and European integration.  There has been a noticeable increase on both the level and growth rate of what is usually referred to as atypical work in the most OECD countries. Today this accounts for over 10 per cent of the EC workforce the most important form of which is regular part-time work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1982 it was recognised by the British Manpower Services Commission as Britain's major employment area, and with this in mind that commission proposed a long look at four different areas such as the practicality and desirability of such employment within structures that <Col N="2145" /> were designed for full-time work.  The Bill is again looking at this; its implications for permanent work practices; entitlements for worker compensation across a whole range of workers and social welfare benefits normally thought to apply exclusively to full-time workers, and the increasing trend to associate part-time work with women.</P>
    <P>We are starting into an era today with this legislation as traditionally legislation was thought of in terms of the full-time permanent employee.  I am delighted to see that the nettle of this difficult area where there are a huge number of people working part-time has been grasped by the Minister and the Government through this legislation.  It has not been easy and, perhaps, this is why unions and, perhaps, previous Ministers have been slow to move into this area.  There are such huge numbers involved and people are employed in such diverse ways that it is not an easy area to regulate.  I am glad the legislation is before us and that the Minister has tackled this.</P>
    <P>The need to address these four areas is present in all EC countries, all the more so because part-time workers are often perceived as a source of cheap labour. This is perhaps the underlying difficulty in this.  Accordingly, it has been a sensitive area to reform, as well as legally complicated, given its origins, development and variety.</P>
    <P>Such work has developed for a variety of reasons, the growth of technology, economic redirection, organisational transformation, the tendency to subcontract in particular areas, and the demanded and accepted return of women to jobs where previously when they got married they left permanently.  This is indicated in the figures which show that 50,000, or approximately 75 per cent of part-time workers are women.  Therefore for both employers and many part-time employees, part time work, with the tacit agreement of both parties, suited the employer because of the flexibility and it suited the part-time worker who was glad <Col N="2146" /> to have access to this type of work.  It grew without the regulations which perhaps should have been in place and there was even a relaxation of existing conditions. Because of the convergence of the aspirations of the part-timer and the expectations of the employer, trade unions and Governments found it difficult to address this until now.  The Bill addresses the problem and sets a good balance between employer and employee far in advance of what exists in other EC countries.</P>
    <P>Aside from this there has been a second difficulty in approaching the question of part-time work.  For a long time it has been seen in a very traditional and old fashioned way.  Part-time work is as old as the industrial revolution, as is its association with lack of skill and poor, if any, upward mobility.  Traditionally, it has been convenient if not easy to forget the part-time worker in terms of the accrual of benefits, for example, in relation to holidays or pensions given to full-time employees.  Given the reality of part-time work we need in the nineties to accept that part-time work is here to stay and give it greater legitimacy.  We must recognise that greater flexibility in the workforce is not just a convenience but is part and parcel of labour trends.  We must legislate for it in terms of the modern workplace, of the expectations of the modern workforce and not exclusively in terms of the full time worker. Part-time work suits those involved in it but it also suits employers because of the flexibility it allows.</P>
    <P>The Bill is important in a second way. Over and above the detailed reforms it proposes, it reveals a new attitude to work in general and recognises the role and dignity of the part-time worker.  This is vital in approaching the whole question of women and work because it is only with such recognition of worker dignity, whether that worker is male or female, that progress can be made on pay and conditions.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, no less than in other EC <Col N="2147" /> countries, there has been a percentage increase in part-time work.  Although it is slightly less than in other countries it still constitutes a significant part of the workforce, up from 42,000 in 1975 to about 72,000 in 1989 according to the most recent labour force survey. However, of those 72,000, some 50,000 are women.  I am glad that many of the contributors to the debate have been women Members because this legislation is specifically helpful to women and will directly help 50,000 women in a very positive way.  Of the 50,000 women, 60 per cent are married.  This gives an importance to the figures for part-time workers far and above the statistical.</P>
    <P>Reform is demanded if, in addition to the general problems which women face in the workplace, we are to avoid making the problems of part-time work the problems of women.  There is nothing new about part-time work.  What is new is the extent to which it has manifested itself in a wide range of occupations, particularly in the sales and services sectors.  It has grown especially among women whether these are involved in more formal arrangements such as job sharing or informal arrangements such as seasonal or casual work, such as part-time work in the local supermarket, the bank or the local hotel.  Broadly speaking it is women who are affected by this legislation which seeks to improve the situation for part-time workers.  Of the estimated 14 million part-time workers in the EC, constituting about 10 per cent of the total workforce, 85 per cent are women, especially in the middle and older age groups.  Some EC countries tend to pat themselves on the back in that they take these figures as representing the advance of women in the workplace.</P>
    <P>However, such statistics often reveal something that is quantitative rather than qualitative.  We have all heard stories about part-time women workers being trapped in circumstances of low wages and poor conditions, some in order to <Col N="2148" /> supplement their family income, others because they simply want to work.  In any case, given that there are usually not enough part-time jobs to go around and that such employees are outside the scope of labour agreements, such female workers are left in a kind of limbo.  Again it is a courageous move to give such workers their entitlements and I do not say this in a congratulatory way.  Workers who are covered by this legislation are entitled to those benefits and it is the role of Government to ensure that part-time workers receive them.  I am particularly pleased that of the 72,000 people who will benefit from the legislation 50,000 are women part-time workers.</P>
    <P>It is even more important, as we move to 1992, to have this legislation in place. During the seventies and eighties most employers argued that their competitiveness could be recovered and consequently more jobs created only if working hours and working conditions were made what was usually called more flexible.  As we approach the Single Market the implications of such views for part-time workers are even more immediate. Therefore, as businesses become increasingly centralised &mdash; which, by the way, is often a by-word for increased competitiveness in the larger internal market &mdash; and dominated by a more impersonal regime of labour relations, I see the Bill as ensuring that part-time workers will not be the special victims of the march to 1992.  This is all the more important in that most economists see the incidence of part-time work extending outside its traditional areas in the service and retail sectors.  Economists predict that as we move closer to 1992 part-time workers will be spread throughout the whole of industry and not only be in the traditional areas.  The Government are exercising their leadership in this area and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>In a sense the haphazard origin of part-time work is reflected in the existing legislation, with different criteria applying to different areas which are concerned only <Col N="2149" /> with the traditional types of employment, that is, permanent, full-time employment. Even for the trade union movement, as I said earlier, it has been a difficult issue to handle because of the problem of including part-timers in any kind of collective bargaining negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House today goes a long way to redressing these imbalances. As somebody who is particularly interested in the status of female workers, I welcome any attempt not only to secure and enhance employment opportunities for women but also, as this Bill proposes, to ensure that when and where women are employed they will not be exploited or deprived of the benefits of social welfare protection; in other words, that the inequalities that exist for women are not aggravated.  This was referred to by the Minister at a seminar entitled &ldquo;Women in 1992&rdquo; held in Dublin Castle in conjunction with the Irish Presidency. I congratulate the Minister for organising that seminar and for his foresight in doing so.  In that context it was agreed that with the changing demographic structure, falling birth rates and an increasing ageing population, women would become a greater feature of the labour market.  This is evident from the statistics.</P>
    <P>Some progress has already been made dealing with employment equality, wages and safety and health in the workplace. Last month, the Minister for Social Welfare announced certain initiatives in relation to the social welfare side of part-time work.  These, too, were very welcome in the 1991 budget.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to extend benefits in respect of various pieces of labour law, to those who up to now, because of the insistence of the 18-hour threshold were precluded from a wide range of benefits such as holidays &mdash; which is dealt with in section 4 &mdash; and maternity and various provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 &mdash; dealt with in section 3.  Instead, as section 2 of the Bill outlines, the criterion of eight hours per week over a 13 <Col N="2150" /> week period is employed, as a result of which all regular part-time workers will be admitted to the various rights as detailed in the named seven separate labour legislative measures.</P>
    <P>As section 3 recognises, if a part-time worker becomes pregnant she will no longer have to rely on the benevolence or arbitrary decision of the employer to keep her job open for her because she will now be covered by the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, and the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, in the same way and under the same terms as if she were a full-time worker, and have the right to a minimum period of 14 weeks maternity leave.</P>
    <P>Moreover, I believe this legislation will suggest something to partners in both the EC and the ILO, where the status of a typical worker is far from certainly defined.  Part of the reason for such uncertainty at both EC and ILO level is the laziness of national level to either propose or apply effective standards.  Under each of these headings, the present Bill is suggestive and creative in an EC context.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the debate today, the Minister reported that women accounted for nearly 75 per cent of all part-time workers in the 25-44 age bracket, in other words, women with dependent children.  I have long believed there is a direct correlation between part-time work and inadequate child care facilities, family leave and inadequate parental leave.  While the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights have been pushing these issues, they are not an adjunct to the workplace either here in Dáil Éireann or elsewhere; they should not be seen as part of the so-called grace and favour of employment policy but an intrinsic and core part of such policy, if full protection is to be achieved.  As the Minister continues to look to the future and at labour law, I hope he will take this into consideration. I realise that as with some of the issues covered in the Bill, Government can push employers only so far, but even accepting <Col N="2151" /> that, where the old fashioned view continues to exist that créche facilities are just that &mdash; facilities &mdash; and not an integral part of the working conditions of workers, there will be continued problems for women in the employment area.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, the evolution of part-time work has been such that a kind of limbo has been created.  However, there have been competing pressures on Government in this area, to allow Government address the question of balancing the expectations of the employer, on one hand, and the aspirations of the worker, on the other.  Moreover, at a time when we are talking about greater integration of all types of EC systems, and the redress of various imbalances, we cannot move on labour law in an EC context in such a segregated way.  Neither should we be making distinctions between related benefits awarded to part-timers and full-timers or between men and women.  The Bill addresses itself to both the reality and the spirit of the EC Social Charter, the central import of which is the stress on equality of treatment and access for men and women across a wide range of objectives and benefits.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's hope that if and when this Bill is accepted, he will publish &mdash; as he said this morning &mdash; explanatory literature and disseminate it to the interested parties.  This is a Bill that has already been widely welcomed with good reason.  It is pioneering not only in detail but also for the novel and timely thinking it brings to an area of work that has, for far too long, been ignored and regarded in the past, perhaps, by unions, the Government or whoever, as an area that was too troublesome to tackle or virtually impossible to regulate. This Bill has brought all the seven pieces of legislation together to cover part-time workers.  It will be of benefit to the 72,000 people, and many more, as more part-time work becomes available over the coming years.  I am delighted <Col N="2152" /> that the Minister has recognised the need for this legislation.  He has been very forward-thinking in presenting this progressive legislation at this time.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Generally the past month or six weeks has been a good time for part-time workers because, first, the Minister for Social Welfare announced the new protection legislation for 21,000 part-time workers.  Thousands of women who participate in traditionally low-paid and often insecure employment will now have access to social welfare benefits and pensions.  They will also be entitled to claim weekly payments from the Department of Social Welfare when they are out of work because of illness, maternity leave or unemployment and will be entitled to pensions on their retirement. For far too long part-time workers, particularly women part-time workers, have been excluded from benefits. Employers and, to a certain extent the State, have abused these workers.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Programme for National Recovery</i> identified the status of part-time workers as an issue which needed to be addressed. In September 1988 the Minister reviewed all aspects of part-time work and sought the views of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federation of Irish employers and others.  I am glad that one of the priorities stitched into the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is the position of part-time workers. It states:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour will seek to have the Worker Protection Part-Time Employees) Bill, 1990 enacted as early as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister acted as early as he could and has done a very good job bringing forward this Bill today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of part-time workers was discussed during Private Members Time on two or three occasions.  The Minister said then that he was preparing legislation and would take into account the views of <Col N="2153" /> Deputies.  Today, the Minister recognised the role Deputies on all sides have played in bringing forward this Bill. Sometimes we criticise politicians and regard Private Members' Time as cumbersome, awkward and a little embarrassing for the Government, but very often Members from all sides put forward very good ideas.  It is good to see a Minister take some of those suggestions on board and include them in a Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill is welcomed by Members on all sides of the House.  I have had an interest in the issue of part-time workers even before I became a Member of Dáil Éireann.  I believed for quite some time that part-time workers got a very raw deal.  The Minister has done a good job in striking a balance between ensuring that the rights of employers are protected and that part-time workers are protected.  Unfortunately, many employers, particularly supermarkets, have taken advantage of part-time workers, Supermarkets in my county &mdash; I am sure this is the case in every other county &mdash; use part-time workers to their own advantage.  In some cases they hire them for only 17½ hours because if they hire them for 18 hours they will have to pay their entitlements. In other cases part-time workers start work at 8 a.m. and are told at 10 a.m. by the supermarket manager that they are not needed any more for that day.  There is blatant abuse of part-time workers by supermarkets and other employers.  The Minister has gone a reasonable way towards tackling this problem.  I hope employers will not be able to get around this legislation and make massive profits. Up to now they always seemed to find a way around legislation and took advantage of the thousands of young people who are seeking employment.</P>
    <P>The majority of part-time workers are women.  Many of them take up part-time work because they cannot get full-time jobs they need the money to supplement their husbands' earnings or social welfare payments, or they want to be able to buy <Col N="2154" /> the extra clothing and school books when their children return to school.  Part-time work is very important to these women.</P>
    <P>I read recently that supermarkets in England are now taking on what are known as &ldquo;granny&rdquo; part-time workers. Supermarkets regard these people as very dedicated and believe they are more reliable.  Their families are reared and they can work four to eight hours a day, whenever they are needed.  Shopping trends are changing.  The experts tell us that 85-90 per cent of shopping is done late on Thursday and Friday nights and on Saturdays.  Many employers only need to hire people at those peak times and as a result only part-time work is available.</P>
    <P>I want to deviate for a moment and refer to the minimum wage.  Part-time shop workers are paid as little as £1 an hour.  A supermarket in my constituency pay £1.27 an hour, but most small shops pay £1 an hour.  One young girl who works from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., with perhaps ten minutes for a lunch break, receives £8 a day, less than £1 an hour.  There is a great deal of exploitation in the context of a minimum wage.  This issue must be addressed by the Minister.  Recently a woman who is looking for a loan from Wexford County Council visited my clinic.  I asked her to produce her P60. This woman works 45 hours a week as a hotel receptionist and received £2,984 for 52 weeks work.  She had trained in CERT and had all the necessary qualifications. I am not surprised that most of the young people trained by CERT go to London, Boston or New York where they can get decent wages in hotels, etc.  I ask the Minister to deal with the issue of a minimum wage at some stage in the near future.</P>
    <P>As I have said, at present people who work fewer than 18 hours a week do not have any entitlement to annual leave, public holidays, redundancy payments, maternity leave etc. &mdash; I could spend the next ten minutes listing the rights those people do not have.  The Minister is reducing that threshold to eight hours.  As <Col N="2155" /> he said, this will achieve a dual purpose &mdash; it will bring the great majority of the unprotected part-time workforce withing the protection of the law and at the same time will move the threshold to a point so low that there will be little incentive for employers to create new contracts below the threshold.  I hope the Minister will insist that this provision is adhered to so that employers will have no way of getting around it and abusing the system.</P>
    <P>There is unanimous agreement on all sides that this Bill is long overdue and that these workers need to be protected. The 1975 labour force survey was the first survey on part-time work in this country. Between 1975 and 1989, the most recent year for which we have data, the number of part-time workers increased from 71,500 to 82,000, an increase of 10,500 or over 15 per cent in 14 years.  As a person with no back-up Civil Service information, I think the increase in the number of part-time workers is much greater.  In every area of industry there appears to be part-time workers.  The Minister pointed out the steady growth in this area but it is still well below &mdash; about half &mdash; the European average.</P>
    <P>There has been a distinct change in the type of part-time work available.  A lot of part-time work is regular.  Five or ten years ago a person in part-time work would eventually be employed on a permanent basis &mdash; the part-time job was a step towards becoming permanent. Unfortunately, that situation no longer prevails.  There has been a very significant increase in what is called regular part-time employment, and there are in the region of 70,000 people in that category. That is probably due to the boom in the supermarket area and different shopping trends.  This is a cause of concern because employers continue to avail of part-time workers rather than employing them full-time. Some employers say it costs too much to employ a person on a full-time basis because of the PRSI payments.  The Minister should look at that.  The last <Col N="2156" /> Government, and this Government, introduced PRSI and other exemptions for employers employing persons on a full-time basis, and that was very welcome. More people would be employed full-time if employers were given an incentive to do so.  The Minister should consider this matter.</P>
    <P>Most part-time workers are women.  I welcome the introduction by the Minister for Social Welfare of measures to protect these people and to ensure they get the benefits to which they are entitled.  Heretofore people working as caretakers in schools, or giving out lunches in primary schools, were usually employed by the local urban councils, and received £40 to £45 per week.  They were let go in the summer, at Christmas and Easter, during which time they had no income.  That was very unfair.  I am not singling out the primary school area; this happened in all areas where women worked in part-time jobs.  From next year these people will be entitled to benefits and this is welcome.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern on this Bill.  He gave a commitment in March 1989, and again in the <i>Programme for Social and Economic Progress,</i> to bring in this legislation, and he has honoured that commitment today. I like to see Ministers honouring their commitments to deliver on legislation, particularly where it is badly needed.  I hope this legislation passes through the House as quickly as possible and without further delay because part-time workers should have the rights to which they are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been welcomed by virtually everybody who is interested in justice in the workplace.  I know it has the support of the major parties and of the trade union movement. Ms. Patricia Donovan, assistant general secretary of the ICTU, earlier this year spoke for many trade unionists when she said this is the most significant legislation since the early seventies, and I certainly endorse that.  Ms. Sylvia Meehan of the <Col N="2157" /> EEA said the Minister's achievement in introducing the legislation is &ldquo;a significant step in the direction of equality for women workers&rdquo;.  She noted that 20,000 part-time workers would be directly affected by this legislation and that 80 per cent of those would be women.  The only voice that demurred on this legislation in public was the FIE who indicated they had some problems with the proposed eight hour threshold.  It is understood they favour a phased reduction.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons this legislation is important and timely.  First, there is no good reason to discriminate in the matter of protection from arbitrary dismissal, to take one example, between a person working regularly on a full-time basis and a person working on a part-time basis.  The question is not so much why should statutory protection be extended to the part-time worker but rather why not.  The same should be the case with social welfare benefits and all the other rights relating to work.  The time for extending benefits and protection to part-time workers is long overdue.</P>
      <P>The second reason this legislation is important and timely is that much part-time work in Ireland is carried out by female workers.  As Deputy Browne has said, female workers dominate disproportionately the incidence of part-time work within the services sector.  They are typically paid at a very low level and the skilled development of such workers is also very low.  They have very poor pay prospects and a very low likelihood of union protection.  The trade union movement has made efforts to move in that direction, but we all have to admit that much ground has to be made up.  It is difficult to imagine any group in society more likely to be exploited, and for that reason more deserving of State support in terms of statutory standards, than part-time workers, particularly women who operate in the services sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy John Browne mentioned a couple of areas where there are abuses <Col N="2158" /> and where the pay is low.  The use of part-time workers on a very wide scale, particularly by some of the larger supermarket operators, and the use of female workers in these workplaces, with very low pay and none of the dignity which one would expect in the latter part of the 20th century to be associated with work, is a scandal and it is long past time that we statutorily introduced measures to overcome the abuse in this area.  That is achieved in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The third reason is that, with the exception of our nearest neighbour, most states in the European Community, and many states outside it, have adopted action to promote part-time work and to protect those workers' rights.  It does us no credit that we are so far behind in this regard.  In many European states basic terms and conditions apply equally to full-time and part-time workers with both categories enjoying the same state rights as well as the same employment rights. That is what the Minister, Deputy Ahern, is seeking to achieve in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The fourth reason for endorsing and supporting the Bill and wishing it a speedy passage is that experience suggests that companies should adopt progressive policies in their own enlightened self interest but, where they have not done so, the State will have to encourage them to be a little more progressive.</P>
    <P>The fifth and final reason for endorsing the Bill, apart from congratulating the Minister for introducing it, is that we should all have an interest in justice, not just justice for the part-time worker but justice in a general sense.  The Bill is relatively simple.  The first section includes the definition of &ldquo;regular part-time&rdquo; as someone who has been in contiunous service for at least 13 weeks, who is normally expected to work at least eight hours per week and who does not, at present, come within the scope of the legislation which it is proposed to amend.</P>
    <P>It does us no credit as a nation that <Col N="2159" /> people have to flit about seeking employment at very low rates with all the marginal costs that full-time employment carries and none of the benefits.  It is disappointing, therefore, that one or two employers put forward suggestions that the introduction of the measures should perhaps be on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>Section 2 relates to continuous service and provides that the 13 weeks must be calculated in accordance with widely used mechanisms.  That is a reasonable approach to it; in fact, throughout the Bill, one is struck by the fact that the Minister has sought to adopt a non-technical, user-friendly approach in the way the Bill is framed, which sets out the rights of the workforce in a self-explanatory manner, easily assimilable by them.</P>
    <P>Section 3 simply extends the benefits of various Acts to regular part-time workers.  It also provides that the contribution requirement under the Redundancy Payments Acts should not apply in respect of certain types of part-time work.  On the face of it, this is a very simple Bill; however, it represents a major step forward for part-time workers.</P>
    <P>As has been apparent for some time, a growing proportion of the workforce have been employed in some alternative form to the traditional full-time job.  This has called into question the adequacy of current protective legislation which is, to a large extent, aimed at the traditional worker in full-time employment.  The Minister for Labour is right to have been concerned, in particular about the position of regular part-time employees. As the law stands, workers can have many years of service with the same employer, yet they may have no entitlement to holidays, maternity leave or other rights such as minimum notice, redundancy payments.  In other words, they do not have the right to be treated in a decent and civilised manner.  In this Bill, the Minister is moving to bridge that gap.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2160" /> There is, of course, nothing easy or straightforward about part-time work. Just as there is no single type of part-time work, there is no single remedy which will apply across the board.  While this legislation will certainly address some problems, undoubtedly it will be skirted around in the not too distant future and other problems may materialise.  The conflicts and issues which part-time work throws up are very diverse; it would clearly be better if we could look forward to an Ireland which had full-time work or the availability of full-time employment but, sadly, in the foreseeable future it is obvious that the existing trend towards part-time work, which I do not welcome, will continue.</P>
    <P>It is also true that, because the problems thrown up by part-time work are diverse and complex, they must be approached in a reasoned and informed manner.  The Minister has been presented with divergent views over the last two years.  He has discussed the matter at some length with employers and employees' representatives, and has, of course, discussed the matter in this House in previous debates sponsored, I acknowledge, by other parties.  A considerable amount of the thought process incorporated in this Bill has been teased out and some of the complexities of the issue have been debated.  Therefore, it has been easier in a sense to frame the legislation.  I should like to acknowledge that other parties in this House contributed to this issue.  One of the attributes of the Minister for Labour is that he has a singular capacity to build consensus within the trade union movement and between trade unions and employers' representatives.  In a sense, this Bill is a very real and lasting tribute to that consensus-building capacity.</P>
    <P>Employers generally take the view that part-time work is an important element in labour market flexibility, and I can understand that.  This is considered essential to ensure competitiveness and to <Col N="2161" /> maintain employment.  That is the positive side of the employers' view: employers argue that the extension of positive protection in legislation to part-time workers could reduce the attractiveness of this type of labour.  The trade union view, on the other hand, is that part-time workers are vulnerable to exploitation where they are not protected under the law: the trade unions &mdash; I concur with them &mdash; consider that, in equity, part-time workers should have the same entitlements, on at least a <i>pro rata</i> basis, as their full-time counterparts.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the suggestion made by some employers that as you extend rights to certain workers, in some way you make the job of running an enterprise more difficult.  That is a very negative, Victorian view of enterprise which cannot continue in the modern world. The Minister for Labour has, in this Bill, achieved something approaching an ideal balance between the two diverse views in relation to part-time workers.  The Bill will certainly improve the lot of part-time workers, particularly those who work on a regular, almost permanent, basis and it does not impede the development of the sector.  It simply channels developments in a way in which we would all wish. An unbalanced approach would have had disadvantages for employers and employees.  Over-regulation in the workforce can, of course, lead to a variety of problems, not least to the reduction of job opportunities.  We must ask ourselves, when we talk about employment creation, whether we have over-regulated in a general sense, leading to a situation where employers prefer, for safety reasons, to expand their working hours by overtime instead of bringing in new workers.</P>
    <P>Over-regulation can impact on job creation in addition to having an impact on employers.  We must look for a balance which I do not think we have struck in that regard.  Conversely, if there is no legislation or protection for part-time workers, the situation will deteriorate <Col N="2162" /> and the problem outlined earlier by Deputy Browne will become more frequent. It would also facilitate the undesirable emergence of the dual labour market with two different classes of employee.  This analysis is contained in John Blackwell's excellent paper.</P>

      <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of matters arising from statements made by Mr. Justice Barron in the Marsh case in the Central Criminal Court yesterday. Deputy Mitchell has five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday in the Central Criminal Court Mr. Justice Henry Barron had some very disturbing things to say in the case of the murder of Mr. Kieran Farmer on O'Connell Bridge on 17 March last year.</P>
      <P>It is only right that at the outset of this short debate we should recall that a man is dead and I am sure the House will want to extend its sympathy to his relatives. It is also clear that someone is guilty of the murder or manslaughter of Kieran Farmer, but it was not Damien Marsh. In the Central Criminal Court yesterday Mr. Justice Barron went to great lengths not just to allow the case to be dropped by the Director of Public Prosecutions but to clear Damien Marsh of all the charges that were laid against him.  Mr. Justice Barron said, and I quote from yesterday's issue of the <i>The Irish Times:</i>&ldquo;You are clearly innocent of these charges&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past 11 months, since the arrival of the gardaí at his door on 5 April, Damien Marsh and his family have lived under a great cloud.  They have suffered great stress.  His parents have been <Col N="2163" /> under consistent medical supervision since then.  Damien Marsh has lost his job and has suffered enormously.  Today on Radio 1 at lunch time Damien Marsh's father, Frank, whom I have known for many years, was interviewed.  He was not recriminating, so relieved is he and his family that his son has been cleared.</P>
    <P>It should be recalled that from the outset, and on every occasion possible Damien Marsh completely denied all the charges against him.  During the process and reporting of this case not only was the good name of the Marsh family sullied but so was the good name of the area, Ballyfermot, from which they come and which I have had the honour of representing in this House for the past 14 years. I know Ballyfermot inside out and I am very proud to represent it.  It is an area of great vitality and great people, and it is awful to hear day in and day out reports that sully the good name of that area and make it embarrassing not only for families like the Marsh family but for all its citizens.</P>
    <P>In the court yesterday Mr. Justice Barron said, and I quote from today's <i>The Irish Times:</i></P>
    <P>Counsel for the accused made serious allegations of serious misconduct against several Garda officers. In this case, since the entire evidence has not been adduced I am not in a position to determine if the allegations are justified.  I am not in a position to indicate officers who may have been to blame or the rank of such officers.  I am concerned about some of the evidence.</P>
    <P>I sought this debate tonight to seek assurances immediately from the Minister for Justice that he will institute an immediate inquiry to establish the full facts of the case, whether there was any wrong doing by the gardaí and if so who is to blame, and what steps are to be taken to penalise those involved; more important, what steps he proposes to take <Col N="2164" /> to ensure this can never happen to any other family again.</P>

      <P>This motion, and the trial judge's comments to which it refers, raise issues which concern the functions of the Garda Síochána and also the functions of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The comments of the judge are receiving the most serious consideration and all aspects of the case are being thoroughly investigated.  The Attorney General has informed me that yesterday he requested a full report on the matter from the Director of Public Prosecutions, who had already commenced his own inquiries.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to say anything further about the case at this stage because no useful purpose would be served by doing so, and indeed it would not be in the public interest, until all the facts have been established.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Under-Age Car Drivers.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a growing problem in this city of under-age persons driving cars with no tax or insurance with consequent difficulties posed for the Garda Síochána in coming to grips with this menace.  I am highlighting this issue this evening because I am aware of the concerns of residents in an inner city area flat complex who know that a car which killed a nine year old child had been stopped by the Garda Síochána earlier that day but that both the car and its occupants were allowed to proceed.  On making inquiries to the Garda Síochána it was confirmed for me that the vehicle had been stopped, possibly twice, on that fateful day and only then I discovered to my amazement and horror the difficult legal procedures facing our gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that old bangers of cars can be purchased for as little as £50 to £100 from various sources, including travellers trading in cars in car parks and various locations throughout the city, and these cars, or others acquired from other <Col N="2165" /> sources, are often test driven on the open road before purchase.  Very often under-age youngsters are acquiring these cars and driving them around city streets, housing estates and flat complexes.  I put it to the Minister that it requires no imagination at all to picture the potential power to ruin the life of not just the drivers of these cars but of any innocent family whose child is killed or injured by these cars.</P>
    <P>It appears that under the various road traffic Acts a driver of one of these cars who is stopped by a garda and who looks as young as 14 years of age or even younger can only be asked to produce within ten days tax and insurance certificates at a Garda station of his or her choice.  Even if the driver is clearly under-age the garda cannot assume there is no insurance and has no option but to allow the car to proceed.  After ten days the driver might then be subject to prosecution, but the point I am making is that failure to produce tax and insurance certificates is, quite rightly, not an arrestable offence.</P>
    <P>There must be some way the Minister can fill the gap which is in the law.  Gardaí, because of the inadequate state of the law, have to allow untaxed, uninsured cars to be driven by under-age youths. The Minister must address this anomaly. There is at present no legal framework and I will be happy to hear how the Minister proposes to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>Although this is a growing problem in certain inner city areas, and other districts, it is not an exclusive problem of the poor or the inner city.  In middle class areas the sons and daughters of the well to do, equally under-age, often take their parents' car.  This leaves innocent people in those communities equally vulnerable to death or injury.  I ask the Minister to address this growing problem as quickly as possible before there are further deaths or injuries from such vehicles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the many problems created by <Col N="2166" /> under-age drivers.  One of these is the scourge of the so-called &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo;.  To associate the word &ldquo;joy&rdquo; with a practice which can lead to the maiming and death of people is, to say the least, a complete misuse of the term.  We all know that lives can be lost in these situations and, naturally, our hearts go out to the parents and relatives of the deceased.</P>
      <P>Sympathy, of course, is not enough. The public must be protected from this totally unacceptable criminal behaviour and I want to assure the House that I am doing everything in my power, and in full consultation with the Garda authorities, to ensure that the problem is fully and effectively tackled.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the unauthorised taking of cars by young children is not a new phenomenen.  When this problem peaked in 1981 a number of significant measures were taken to deal with it.  Legislative changes were introduced which had the effect of considerably increasing the penalties for this type of offence.  The gardaí introduced a system of intensive patrolling of areas in which the problem occurred and this resulted in a high level of arrests.  The courts imposed hefty sentences and prison accommodation was increased to ensure that, as far as possible, offenders served their full sentences.  These measures have proved to be successful and the level of unauthorised taking has dramatically decreased as a result.</P>
      <P>Measures to stop joy-riders in their tracks are continuously under review by the Garda authorities.  I can assure the House that the commissioner has my full support in any preventative measures which he may introduce in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent practice which is also of concern to me is the fact that young people are allegedly, as the Deputy said, buying old, used, cars from disreputable dealers for nominal amounts of money and are driving them recklessly on our streets. Because of the young ages of the persons concerned, these cars cannot be taxed or insured.  My colleague, the Minister for <Col N="2167" /> the Environment, has informed me that he is very much aware of this problem and that he proposes to introduce legislation which will enable the gardaí to impound vehicles in such circumstances.  I look forward to the introduction of this legislation and the House will agree that it will be of considerable benefit in strengthening the position of the gardaí and allowing them to deal more effectively with the problem.</P>
    <P>We must do everything in our power to prevent tragedies of the kind to which I referred earlier and whatever further action may be warranted from time to time will be taken by me and by the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>There is very widespread disappointment and disillusionment in County Leitrim that a totally new, fully equipped meat factory at Jamestown has not gone into production.  The total IDA <Col N="2168" /> grant approved for the project was £1.125 million of which £271,000 was handed over up to the end of 1989.  Total FEOGA aid allocated to the project was £2.289 million.  We do not know what was handed over up to this time.  About 100 jobs were promised in the first year of production, but so far there has not been any production.  There has been an empty factory for years.  This would be a major disappointment for any place in the country, but for an area as badly in need of jobs as County Leitrim it is a tragedy. Will the Minister let me know the intentions of the firm involved &mdash; first Pechanga, and now Erax &mdash; and does the Minister intend holding an inquiry into the project which has involved such major State and EC funding?</P>

    <P>Finally, under the rural development programme, proposals for a grant scheme to aid recreational forests, again encouraging broadleaf species, is being prepared.</P>
    <P>I am confident that there will be a significant response to these initiatives and that the proportion of broadleaves planted can be substantially increased from its current level.</P>

The opinion concluded that it would be inappropriate for the Community to become involved in new accession negotiations at this stage and that the political and economic situation in Turkey was such that it would not be useful to open accession negotiations with Turkey straight away.  The Commission's opinion acknowledged the pace of political and economic development in Turkey and proposed that Community relations with Turkey be intensified within the framework of the Association Agreement through &mdash; completion of the Customs Union, revival and intensification of <Col N="2124" /> financial cooperation, promotion of industrial and technological co-operation and strengthening of political and cultural links.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the supplementary welfare allowances scheme, the payment of assistance towards rent is a matter for determination by the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>It is understood from the Eastern Health Board that payment has been suspended on the grounds that the person concerned has failed to supply certain information concerning her means.</P>
      <P>In addition, the question of whether the person concerned is in full-time education is under investigation at present.  In this event she would be precluded from qualifying for a rent supplement.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the situation in relation to St. Kevin's Boys' national school, St. Kevin's Girls' national school and the associated infants school.</P>
      <P>Agreement was reached between my Department and the schools' authorities for a scheme of improvement works to facilitate the amalgamation of the schools.  However, when the architectural planning for the works was put in hands it emerged that additional works would be necessary.  The preparation of the detailed working drawings is now well advanced and these will be completed at the earliest possible date.  They will then be sent to the school authorities to enable them to seek by-law approval.  Because there are a number of factors outside the control of my Department in the case of projects like this, I am unable to say precisely, at this point, when works will be commenced or completed.</P>
