      <P>In respect of promised legislation, may I ask the Taoiseach to personally intervene to sort out the delays and disagreements between his Attorney General and his Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to the competition legislation which is so manifestly urgent when we see a statutory monopoly in the form of the ESB increasing prices when the Taoiseach gave an assurance here in this House that there would be no increases in ESB prices at the time the value added tax was imposed on electricity?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to totally reject any suggestion of disagreement of the type referred to by Deputy Bruton. There is no disagreement.  It is a complex piece of legislation with European ramifications and with constitutional implications. It is a Bill that requires very careful, detailed drafting and consultation between a lot of Departments but particularly between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Attorney General.  It is proceeding as rapidly as possible because the Government, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in particular, are anxious to get it into this House as quickly as possible.</P>

In view of the statement made yesterday by the ESB, will the Taoiseach inform us if the Minister for Energy or the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be coming to this House to make a statement in relation to the proposed increase?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take your advice, a Cheann Comhairle, but I should say that three very important things have happened in the past week, none of which happened in this House, regarding An Post, social housing and other matters. This House is being ignored.</P>

      <P>The matter which I wish to raise concerns the decision of this House on 19 January with regard to the war in the Middle East.  May I ask the Taoiseach if, in view of recent developments, he intends to make a statement to the House or to enable the House to debate the issue again in the light of recent decisions and if he would indicate his view on whether it is a matter for the United Nations to accept or reject the initiative and not for the United States or the United Kingdom&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Programme for Economic and Social Progress: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Taoiseach on Tuesday, 19 February 1991:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Notes that the Government have concluded an agreement with the social partners on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> Notes the Fine Gael proposal of January 1989 for a national forum for 1992 involving all the Oireachtas political parties together with the social partners in long term economic and social planning.</P>
    <P>Affirms its support for the concept of social partnership as a means of promoting long term economic and social development.</P>
    <P>Congratulates the social partners on reaching agreement on pay levels over the next three years.</P>
    <P>Regrets that the current programme was drafted without any involvement of Oireachtas Éireann or of elected representatives generally, apart from some members of the Cabinet, and that many interests in society, notably young people, dependent spouses, the homeless, the unemployed and the non-agricultural self-employed, were not represented in direct discussions on the programme.</P>
    <P>Regrets that the provisions in the programme in regard to the health service will have the effect of increasing the pressure on hospital beds and of lengthening queues for services.</P>
    <P>Regrets the fact that the Government's 1991 budget is not consistent with the achievement of the fiscal targets set in the programme, and that the programme omits essential information as to how the spending and tax commitments contained in it are to be reconciled with the target of broad balance on the current budget.</P>
    <P>Stresses its alarm that the economic projections in the programme, and the policies of the Government as expressed in the programme, will not lead to any reduction in the level of unemployment or emigration, and may well increase both, and that the industrial policies in the programme are not the ones best suited to establishing research-intensive autonomous industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Regrets that the particular income <Col N="852" /> tax proposals in the programme make no provision at all to widen the tax bands and thereby to reduce the excessively high marginal tax rates facing low and middle income workers.</P>
    <P>Regrets that the programme contains no commitment to long term structural reform, with a view to creating employment, in areas such as tax policy, food and agricultural policy, the public service, education and social welfare,</P>
    <P>and in view of the foregoing, directs the Government to establish an Economic and Social Committee of Oireachtas Éireann, involving members of all recognised groups, which would:</P>
    <P>1.  review the content of the programme;</P>
    <P>2.  put forward remedies for its deficiencies;</P>
    <P>3.  nominate representatives of Oireachtas Éireann to sit on the National Economic and Social Council;</P>
    <P>4.  discuss how the programme ought to be adjusted in the event of the assumptions for growth and tax revenue underlying it not being reached;</P>
    <P>5.  participate, on behalf of Oireachtas Éireann, in the consultations leading to the drafting of any future programmes for economic and social progress.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important in this debate that the House take careful note of and salute the flexibility and courage of all those involved in putting this programme together.</P>
      <P>We only have to cast our minds back a decade to recall the strikes, man days lost, the 25 per cent rate of inflation, the scrambling to ensure that pay increases matched the rate of inflation and the general lack of order in managing what is a very small economy.  It is very important that this House notes that this is the second programme under which we have managed to get together a consensus on the way we should move our economy in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The most important thing about this programme is not so much what is in it, although that is obviously critical, but that it exists at all and that it succeeds a programme that made a mark in a few short years.  The progress of the last programme has been recited many times in this debate, and this one, I trust, will make similar progress.  The unique nature of both programmes in the whole context of how we manage our affairs is really what is exciting about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned yesterday on the tourism side that I saw 1991 as a difficult year, a year when we expect that the American market in terms of visitors will be substantially down for reasons to do with the Gulf and the recession in the USA. However I expect that we can more than hold our own in the UK and continental marketplaces.  As I said yesterday, we have allocated an extra £1 million to Bord Fáilte to conduct this year a very targeted and special campaign in the UK market and on the Continent, to try to make up for the difficulties which we expect in the American market.  I know from Bord <Col N="854" /> Fáilte that they have already commenced that exercise.</P>
    <P>I have told the House on many occasions that I am actively engaged in trying to attract to Ireland as many airlines as will listen to me.  I have pointed out in reply to many parliamentary questions that it is a very difficult time in the aviation business and that I do not expect the airlines to respond to my invitations as quickly as they might have done in the past.  I am anxious to get onto their lists so that when the situation improves internationally they will be able to put Ireland higher on their agenda.  This is an island nation and without airlines of international quality and standards agreeing to service this nation we will be cut off from a tourist point of view.  I want to reiterate that I have visited and talked with a substantial number of these airlines. They have undertaken to consider my invitation to assess the economics of putting routes in place to Ireland and have undertaken to come back to me on that matter in a very short period.</P>
    <P>This programme is unique.  It outlines an important role for tourism.  Tourism has been growing at about 15 per cent per annum for the past couple of years, but regretfully I do not expect we will reach that target this year.  I would like to be able to report that we would &mdash; we have not given up yet &mdash; but it will be very difficult in the current climate.  I have told the House on many occasions of my policy to try to keep airline fares down for our business travellers and our tourists because of the central importance of tourism, but I have to find a balance between the solvency of our airlines and the tourism dimension.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates asked me about this matter in a parliamentary question this week and I responded that I did not think it would be wise at this stage to deregulate air fares.  Philosophically that would be my wish but in practical terms, given the small number of airlines servicing Ireland and given the temptation for them to retreat to the old high fare regime, I pointed out to the Deputy that that might not be a very wise move.  I will of course keep an eye on the position, but in the <Col N="855" /> ideal competitive marketplace there would be a lot of airlines freely competing and one would rely on that for a reduction in air fares.  I have to try something different, which is to manage the competition sensibly and at the same time hold fares at a reasonable level.  Regretfully, in the past ten months I have had to sanction increases in fares in the order of 15 to 16 per cent, even more in some cases.  That is substantially above the inflation rate but the option was to push the airlines into further financial difficulties or to increase the fares.  That in itself will unfortunately damage our tourism prospects but I hope we can as soon as possible return to reducing those air fares.</P>

I have read it carefully and it is full of all the right jargon and buzz words.  There is not a single idea in it, there is no meat in it.

What does it mean for An Post, CIE, Bus <Col N="856" /> Éireann or Iarnród Éireann?  The Minister said nothing about that; &ldquo;Irish tourism has come of age&rdquo;&mdash; that is a wonderful phrase which conjures up magnificient visions &mdash;&ldquo;and has adopted a more sophisticated market-led approach&rdquo;, whatever that means.  The Minister tells us we will not have as many tourists this year as we had last year but it does not matter, &ldquo;we have come of age and we have a sophisticated market-led approach&rdquo;.  The Government are also going &ldquo;to market our tourism products skilfully, vigorously and selectively&rdquo;&mdash; not just skilfully, but also vigorously and selectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Those may be familiar words to the Minister.  They are not original words of mine.  I am not the one who invented them.  They are words which were used on 10 October 1987 by a member of the present Government to describe this programme's predecessor, the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The person who used those words is Deputy Desmond O'Malley, the leader of the Progressive Democrats and now the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Let me give him due credit and say that, like others among us, he was right in October 1987.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> failed to live up to the grandiose predictions made by the Government at the time; employment creation fell far short of the targets set out at the time and yet the Minister for Industry and Commerce is now prepared to put his name to another set of phoney targets and to ask this House to accept &mdash; and support &mdash; very much the same kind of mishmash which he so eloquently criticised just over three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, who was so strongly criticised by the Progressive Democrats in October 1987 is now, of course, their <Col N="858" /> boss and their parliamentary denunciations of him are now limited &mdash; when we hear them at all &mdash; to rather polite admonitions at the end of speeches of support in this House.  God alone knows how complacent and compliant they are in Government.  Their real denunciations, apparently, are the sole preserve of their chairman in exile who rages away outside this House without seeming to be able to influence the actions of their members in here.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to that whole sham.  Members of this House know that, around the country, you will find a handful of tame Progressive Democrats Deputies, bought Progressive Democrats Senators and apostate councillors who go to public meetings of different kinds. They run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.  They try to pretend they are not really a part of the Government and that they have no hand, act or part in anything the Government might do of which people might disapprove.  They imply that they will be in there rooting for the people.  I wonder if it was to set up that kind of neo-sleeveenism they broke all the famous moulds in 1985 or were they always like that, neither fish, flesh nor good red herring?</P>
    <P>This programme does not represent a social consensus despite the claims the Government make for it; it did not emerge from a process that could, in any way, be described as a true consultation, even among those who are designated rather arbitrarily as social partners.  At heart this document is a series of special deals on separate &mdash; and largely unlinked &mdash; issues hammered out between the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  My words do not imply a criticism of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Congress negotiators carried out their job skilfully and, to the best of their ability, they did it as they saw it. There are, to my knowledge, a number of questions as to whether the Congress negotiators actually stuck to the brief given to them by their members, or whether they stuck to the brief which their members thought they had given them.  However, this House is not the <Col N="859" /> place to pursue those questions.  The truth is that the other social partners, the representatives of industry, employers and the farming community, were induced, with the active connivance of the Government, to accept a whole series of unrelated proposals with most of which they disagreed, in return for getting agreement on a pay deal.</P>
    <P>There is no grand design behind this programme; there is no economic design nor is there any design for a consensus among the social partners.  In that connection, it is interesting to note that the Taoiseach admitted while speaking to the House about this year's budget that &ldquo;the fact that we can agree is more important than the precise details of what we agree about&rdquo;.  A similar sentiment came from the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications this morning.  In other words, the Government were prepared to pay almost any price; to get an agreement on pay.  In that way they clearly abdicated their responsibility and have given up even the slightest pretence of making conscious and direct decisions for the benefit of our people.</P>
    <P>We may ask how much members of the Government knew about this process and negotiation.  How many of them had any real involvement in what was going on and in deciding on the extent of the Government's capitulation?  I suspect that the answer is very few.  Thus, a Government which are supposed to act on the basis of collective responsibility simply acquiesced in things which they had not decided but which were worked out in a series of side deals in the talks between Government representatives and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. These side deals were subsequently put to the other social partners as position papers and, while the social partners were being given their regulatory hour to read the position papers, they were being approached by representatives from the Government side telling them that they knew they did not like it but not to rock the boat because the Government thought they were getting the unions in line in regard to a pay deal.  That is where <Col N="860" /> all the other provisions in this programme come from about housing, education and all the nonsense about the promise the Government made in regard to expenditure of all kinds.  They all came out of those side deals from a Government which, as I said, stated very clearly that they were prepared to pay almost any price to get a pay deal.  That is no way to plan public expenditure, a health service, education or anything else.</P>
    <P>Since the programme was agreed a succession of Ministers have come before the House &mdash; but more often somewhere else &mdash; claiming credit for something in which they had simply acquiesced and which they did not decide; nor has there been any input to this programme by the elected representatives.  Opposition Deputies were not involved, the Government cannot even pretend that the sham debate which took place here to take note of the 1991 Estimates could have had any effect on the Government's approach to this programme since most of the negotiation had already taken place before the debate was conducted in this House.  Yet, Sir, this House has the duty of voting to allocate expenditure across the whole range of public policy.</P>
    <P>This programme has clearly been drawn up in a way that cuts across the duties and the prerogatives of this House. Substantial parts of budget decisions and expenditure decisions for this year are affected and even determined in some cases by this programme.  As I pointed out earlier this month in the budget debate, even the explanatory memorandum in regard to the current budget issued to us on Budget Day by the Minister for Finance has a specific heading entitled &ldquo;PESP Related Expenditure&rdquo;.  In this connection I am not impressed by the amendment to the Government motion put forward by the Labour Party. It is idle &mdash; and indeed disingenuous &mdash; to describe the provisions of this programme as &ldquo;specific, legislative and administrative commitments given by the Government on behalf of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas was not involved in any way in specifying these legislative and <Col N="861" /> administrative commitments.  I am disappointed that the Labour Party should seek &mdash; for reasons which I cannot understand &mdash; to give the Government a retrospective figleaf for a sham programme. Neither am I impressed with The Workers' Party amendment which starts by supporting a very wide concept of central bargaining &mdash; I see shades of the old Stalinist position there &mdash; and handing over the responsibilities of the Legislature to &ldquo;the principal economic and social interest in the country&rdquo;.  However, the amendment concludes in total contradiction to its beginning by calling for a review mechanism in this House.  There is neither sense nor logic in that amendment.</P>
    <P>Curiously, the two parties of the Left seem to take very different views about the content of the programme.  The Labour Party, apparently, regard the programme as containing specific legislative and administrative commitments. The Workers' Party, on the other hand, believe that &ldquo;many of the commitments given by the Government are vague, conditional, imprecise and, in some instances, merely aspirational&rdquo;.  Can the Left not agree on a view of this programme or is it simply the case that the two parties are getting different instructions from different unions?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has claimed that the programme &ldquo;envisages a continuation of the process already begun of harmonisation of indirect taxation with our Community partners&rdquo;.  I wish that it were so but it is not.  When I read the section of the programme dealing with this issue I find a lot of words and elegant prose but no proposals.  On budget night I pointed out to the House that a move to a single VAT rate of 17 per cent would cost the Exchequer £150 million in a full year and that is before taking account of any of the dynamic effects of such a move.  The programme says nothing about that.  On excise duties, the programme points out some of the difficulties but, again, makes no proposals. I see no evidence therefore that any process has been started to bring about harmonisation of indirect taxation.  We know <Col N="862" /> perfectly well &mdash; indeed many Members of this House know it in their constituencies to their pain &mdash; that unless and until we have that process of harmonisation we will continue to face major difficulties in our Border areas and in several important industrial sectors.</P>
    <P>Some of the specific provisions in the programme are absolutely nonsensical and bear no relationship to the kind of priorities which we should set today for public expenditure in the light of obvious needs in our society.  I do not believe, for example, that our health service is in a condition to say to me that, if I wish, I can have my hospital consultant's fees paid for by the taxpayer nor do I see any improvement in equity in our health service by telling me that I will now have paid for me by the taxpayer something that I can afford to pay for myself and by that very fact make somebody who cannot afford to pay wait even longer than they have to wait now.  That is no way to improve equity in our health service.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one brief point on the health service.  The programme says nothing about the removal of the income limit for health contributions, but we got that news in a footnote to the budget.  On its own that measure is going to mean that a great many people, for whom the unions negotiated pay increases over the next three years and minimal meagre tax changes, are going to find that all the benefits of those tax changes will be offset at one stroke by that simple abolition of the income limit for health contributions.  I wonder what the social partners think about that and what Members of this House, who should see that clearly, are now doing in supporting the programme before us.</P>

      <P>I would of course disagree with Deputy Dukes on the importance of the programme in the first instance.  Having seen a number of programmes in the past I believe that this is the most detailed, professional and sophisticated programme ever put before the people at any time in our history.  It also gives an <Col N="863" /> indication of how skilled and professional the trade unions and the representatives of the employers and farmers have become in their negotiations and in their approach to the development of the country.  This is a very good plan.  Deputy Dukes was critical of the fact that the Taoiseach places so much importance on the need for people to agree.  Yes, people did agree and were prepared to merge their interests in the overall national interest.  I would remind the Deputy of the saying that if you do not know where you are going, any road will take you there but you could waste a lot of time, whereas if there is an agreed plan, even though adjustments may be necessary, that plan will achieve the objectives.</P>
      <P>The social welfare commitments in the programme are far-reaching and comprehensive. They set out the agenda for the next decade and represent a realistic strategy for the reform of our social welfare system so as to make it more responsive to changing needs and better equipped to tackle the problems of poverty in our society today.  With this programme, the elderly, the lone parent family, the unemployed, the sick and disabled can rest assured that they will share in, and benefit from, the prosperity which this programme is designed to create.  In the short period since the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was launched we have already taken the first important steps to get the new programme under way.</P>
      <P>The improvement in the public finances achieved under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, which has just come to an end, made possible substantial income tax reductions and increases in social welfare payments.  These increases were ahead of the rate of inflation each year.  In addition, many special increases were granted.  As a result those at work and those who depend on social welfare and their families gained in real terms during the last three years.  This contrasted very sharply with the period prior to 1987 when most people lost out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new programme for progress will <Col N="864" /> deliver jobs, keep prices down and protect and improve the position of the least well off in the decade ahead.  This will be achieved through the consensus which the Government have developed with the employers, trade unions and farmers. The new programme will transform our society and raise our standards of living during the next ten years.  Everyone will share in this prosperity.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal briefly with some of the social welfare commitments in the new programme.  Over the term of the programme the Government are committed to improving the level of payments to the tune of £400 million in 1990 terms.  The priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare will be achieved this year in the case of all the long term unemployed.  The new minimum long term personal rate of £55 means that all long term rates of social welfare payments now reach or exceed the commission's priority rate of £54.60 in 1991 terms.  We are committed to the achievement of the commission's priority rate for all by 1993.  As I said, we have already taken a major step in the budget and shown our good faith that we can and will surpass the priority rates recommended by 1993.  Thereafter, social welfare rates will be increased in accordance with the commission's recommendations as the resources of the economy grow. The extra cost of achieving the commission's main rates is £327 million in 1990 terms.</P>
    <P>A number of people have said that this does not represent a commitment as it is related to growth and development achieved under the programme.  It is a very important commitment for the Department of Social Welfare.  In today's edition of the <i>Irish Press</i> a spokesperson for the National Campaign for Welfare Reform is quoted as saying: &ldquo;While the Government pays lip service to implementing the Commission on Social Welfare's recommendations it does not commit itself to introducing them within the lifetime of the programme&rdquo;.  I want to make it very clear today that we have given a commitment in the programme to achieve the main rates recommended <Col N="865" /> by the commission during the period of the programme.  I hope that in respect of many of these rates we will manage to do this even before the end of the ten year period but accept fully, as would any reasonable person, that this can only happen as the country's resources grow and improve in the period of the programme. I believe those resources will grow and improve, but here we have for the first time a firm commitment to a share in that growth and to that share reaching the levels proposed by the commission, the main rates.</P>
    <P>The 4 per cent general increase in weekly payments for those who depend on social welfare is above the rate of inflation, with increases of up to 11 per cent being given to those on supplementary welfare allowance and short term unemployment assistance, bringing their personal rates to £50 a week &mdash; a major step towards achieving the commission's priority rates for these groups by 1993.  We are going to continue closing the gap for those who are below the rates and to continue to improve matters for those who are above the priority rate.</P>
    <P>Let us see the effect of those increases during the past four years.  In 1986 the personal rate of long term unemployment assistance was £36.70 per week.  From next July it will be £55, an increase of £18.30 or just under 50 per cent.  A married man with four children has received an increase of £38.85, or 40 per cent, in the same period.  A couple on old age pension received £91.50 in 1986.  Now they will get £110, an increase of £18.50 or just over 20 per cent.  These are examples of the practical application of maintaining and improving the position of those dependent on social welfare.  In regard to long term unemployment assistance, the single rate has gone up consistently each year and in 1991 it will pass the priority rate.  The married rate has also gone consistently upwards and has now reached £87.40 which is ahead of the priority rate.  For a married couple with five children there has been a consistent rise from 1987 to pass the priority rate in 1991 terms at £147.40 with the main rate, <Col N="866" /> the main recommendation of the commission, at £157.30.  In those charts real progress towards the main rates can be seen and that progress is going to continue.</P>
    <P>This year's budget saw further improvements in child dependant allowances and in child benefit in line with the commitment to devote an extra £69 million in 1990 terms to child income support over the term of the programme. The new minimum rate of child dependant allowance from July next will be £12. The higher rate of child benefit will from October next be paid to the fourth child. Those on long term payments will receive child dependant allowances for school-going children up to 21 years.  The number of rates is now down to three; four years ago we had 36 different rates, and they were all lower rates, for a child dependant.  Therefore, these represent real, clear cut, practical improvements and standardisation that is improving all the time.</P>
    <P>The new programme recognises the important role the family income supplement scheme plays in directing resources to lower paid workers with children while preserving the incentive to work.  The £16.5 million improvement in the FIS and the new child-related tax exemptions announced in the budget mean families at work on low pay can now be substantially better off than if they were claiming social welfare payments. The new FIS eligibility limits mean families with eight children can qualify for FIS if their weekly income is less that £276.  School-going children up to the age of 21 can now be included and the restriction on the amount of FIS payment based on the family size is gone.  The combined effects of the Government's package involving the FIS and the child tax exemptions will ensure families are better off at work than claiming social welfare. A family with four children on £160 a week will now be 36 per cent better off working than if they were receiving unemployment benefit with pay-related benefit.  The child-related tax measure will benefit some 98,000 workers with 154,000 children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> Last week I signed regulations bringing almost 21,000 part-time workers into the protection of the social welfare system from 6 April next in line with the commitment in the programme.  A publicity campaign to advise employers of the new arrangements will be launched shortly.  I will set out the details of entitlements for part-time workers in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.  Benefits will be earnings-related to ensure that very low paid workers are better off at work than drawing social welfare.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the self-employed in social insurance in 1988 was a milestone in the development of our social welfare system.  It has proved to be very successful. Bringing in part-time workers is a further major expansion and I am glad to be able to implement it at such an early stage in the new programme.</P>
    <P>The mixed insurance problem where some people, such as CIE workers, lost out on social welfare pension because they had a mixture of full rate and modified rate contributions is a major anomaly in the social welfare insurance system. This long-standing difficulty is now being resolved.  From November this year <i>pro rata</i> pensions will be paid to people with mixed insurance records.  Details will be contained in the Social Welfare Bill which I will shortly bring before the House.</P>
    <P>We have been setting the headlines in the past year by introducing the most comprehensive and up-to-date legislation on occupational pension schemes since the foundation of the State.  One of my priorities is to ensure that people do not lose out on their pension entitlements when they reach retirement age.  Tragically, some workers found that the funds were not there to pay their pensions when their employer's business collapsed. Others lost their pension rights when they transferred to another job.  The new Pensons Act provides for the protection of pension rights for employees who change or lose their jobs, full disclosure of information to members of pension schemes, equal treatment for men and women and minimum funding standards for schemes. The Pensions Board I set up recently will <Col N="868" /> oversee the new legislation and ensure that employees, trustees, and pension fund managers comply with it.</P>
    <P>In delivering our social welfare services, we are committed to providing a personal, localised, caring service which will meet our clients' needs in both a caring and dignified way.  We plan to achieve this by developing the one stop shop concept which will provide a broad range of services at local level, improving and modernising our buildings and offices around the country, giving greater autonomy to regional and local managements, improving liaison with FAS to ensure the best possible mix of training and employment opportunities for the long term unemployed, and improving local information services.  We want a service of which all of us can be proud.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we are unique in the extent of voluntary social service work carried out by people in their own communities. In Social Welfare we have become increasingly involved with the voluntary social services sector in the broader welfare area.  The new charter for voluntary social services proposed in the programme will set out a clear framework for partnership between the State and voluntary activity.  A White Paper outlining the Government's proposals will be prepared.</P>
    <P>The proposed area-based strategy is an important commitment in the programme for the long term unemployed. Designed to implement a community response in particular areas to long term unemployment it will promote local communities as the prime movers in a new partnership with employers and State agencies to tackle unemployment. The strategy will ensure that the long term unemployed have the opportunity of training, work experience and second chance education leading to qualifications and, therefore, a greater chance of a job.  The necessary arrangements will be put in place immediately on ratification of the programme.  A sum of £0.5 million has been allocated in the budget for the managerial cost and the scheme will be monitored by the Central Review Committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> Small farmers are facing particular difficulties at present.  The new programme recognises this by identifying farming families on low incomes among those who require special attention.  This problem will be addressed in consultation with the farming organisations and having regard to relevant developments at EC level. Last month's budget provided an allocation of £1 million to fund a scheme to help very low income farming families. That scheme will be subsumed in due course into the anticipated EC scheme. All aspects of means test arrangements will be reviewed to ensure that all sectors, including the farm sector, are treated equitably and consistently.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to the elimination of fraud and abuse in the social welfare system and to reducing the effect of the black economy.  For example, £20 million will be saved in a major new crackdown on PRSI-related fraud.  Unscrupulous employers and subcontractors who attempt to cheat taxpayers, competitors, employers and their families will face stiff penalties.  Highly successful anti-fraud measures which I introduced in the past two years will now be extended to other sectors as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>From 6 April next my Department will take over from the Revenue Commissioners responsibility for the allocation of RSI numbers in respect of which all the preliminary work has now been completed leading to a more co-ordinated approach to the registration of the entitlements based on the RSI number.</P>
    <P>At the outset I said that this new programme has set the agenda for social welfare during the nineties.  It is an agenda which is comprehensive, balanced and designed to lead to real progress. It sets out to achieve a level of social welfare services which will meet the needs identified by the Commission on Social Welfare.  <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides the consensus and foundations on which those who depend on social welfare can rely for a fair share of the benefits of increased national prosperity.  There is, in this programme, a social guarantee for <Col N="870" /> those who depend on social welfare that they will achieve the full rates proposed by the Commission on Social Welfare as our economy grows over the period of the programme.  This must be welcomed by all who genuinely care for the less well off.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we can look forward to the nineties with renewed confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who listened to the contribution of the Minister for Social Welfare to this debate would indeed be dismayed because the main emphasis of his remarks was placed on social welfare entitlements which are indeed welcome by their beneficiaries but gave very little hope to those people hoping to be back in gainful employment in the near future, something I very much regret.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to some of the remarks directed at this side of the House by Deputy Dukes.  I was somewhat surprised at that attack emanating from that quarter bearing in mind that, were it not for Deputy Dukes and the Tallaght strategists, we would not now find ourselves in circumstances in which there are many people unemployed in the health services which are in complete disarray, circumstances in which people have not been adequately housed or can hold out any hope of being housed in the near future.</P>
      <P>Likewise I should have thought that the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications would have availed of the opportunity of this debate to allay the fears of people employed by An Post. We read in this morning's newspapers that there is now a plan to shelve the proposals the Minister floated in this House last week, that it now boils down to the 1,500 people likely to lose their jobs, full-time permanent staff of An Post.  I welcome any decision which would postpone or abolish any proposal to close sub-post offices throughout the country; likewise the introduction of roadside boxes and the one postal delivery per day in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implications of the one delivery <Col N="871" /> per day in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford appear to have gone unnoticed.  Let us examine those implications.  If one should post a letter in this House on a Thursday evening after the last collection by An Post that letter will not be collected until the Friday morning and will not be delivered until the following Monday morning, leading to further job losses in An Post.  To date over 100 jobs have been absorbed by An Post brought about by the growth of the national lottery which called for 65 extra jobs and, in addition, 48 jobs which had to be created in the GPO due to growth in business there.  I regret very much that the Minister ignored this aspect in his contribution this morning because it is a major cause of concern to many people who have given loyal service to this State over the years.</P>
    <P>While it is not yet on the agenda it has been suggested that there are likely to be similar job losses in Telecom Éireann. Yet no Minister or chief executive has stated publicly that there will be job losses in this area.  How can we justify the shedding of a further 2,000 jobs in Telecom Éireann, a semi-State company destined to make a profit of approximately £100 million in the current year? I understand it is also the intention of Telecom Éireann to curtail the duration of local telephone calls to three minutes at a cost of 11.7p.  This would be a retrograde step affecting many people nationwide, especially those living in isolated rural areas.  Many people who are incapacitated in some way &mdash; whether living in a city or in a rural area &mdash; can establish contact with their families only by way of telephone communication.  They are not in a position to go to their local post office and post a letter.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that there will be massive profits enjoyed by this semi-State company there are prospects of additional cutbacks for which there is no justification. After all, our people funded the establishment of Telecom Éireann, paid for the requisite very expensive technology, and should now reap the benefits by way of an efficient telephone service. <Col N="872" /> I was watching television from Moscow last evening.  While Russia are encountering huge economic problems at present, nonetheless in Moscow it is possible to make a free telephone call in any part of that city.  While we are told in this latest programme that we have an economy that is booming and has been for the past two years, we are also informed that it is proposed to curtail the duration of local telephone calls.  This proposal will have to be resisted.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, by securing a national agreement for extremely moderate pay increases, made a major contribution to our economy over the period 1987 to 1990, but there were costs in terms of the health and social welfare services.  I can say without hesitation that the price paid by the people dependent on these services was much too high and continues to be unacceptable.</P>
    <P>While the Government point to the 40,000 net increase in employment we must be mindful of the fact that we do not yet know the extent to which this increase in jobs is accounted for by part-time or casual employment.  But we do know that the 20,000 public service jobs shed were full-time jobs in the legitimate economy.  Some of the jobs created have been of a part-time nature.  I am glad that the Minister for Labour has finally had a Bill drafted which will be introduced this week for the protection of part-time employees.  In the past this was an area wide open to exploitation when some people became extremely rich while others, young people and housewives in particular were exploited.</P>
    <P>The aspirations outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>&mdash; in section 1 under the heading Strategy for the Nineties; Key Objectives for the Strategy &mdash; fit easily the objectives the Labour Party want adopted.  Where we differ from the Government parties is simply that we believe that the same urgency and single-mindedness applied to reducing the ratio of debt to gross national product should be applied to another ratio, that is essentially, the index of human misery, the ratio of those <Col N="873" /> unemployed to those in gainful employment. Until a similar improvement has been wrought in this area we cannot contend that we are doing our job well.  In the same way that the financial performance of Government is measured by reductions in the Exchequer borrowing requirement and the current budget deficit &mdash; with a target of reducing the debt GNP ratio towards 100 per cent of GNP by 1993 &mdash; surely we should have a minimum target for reducing unemployment, particularly long term unemployment, by the year 1993 also.</P>
    <P>In addition we should have explicit targets for raising the real incomes of the bottom one-third of families in our society.  I acknowledge that the programme at least commits an extra £65 million to move toward the achievement of priority level of social welfare rates as recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>While the text of the Labour Party motion acknowledges the potential for the social partnership to achieve the objectives outlined in the programme, what can we make of the commitment to a major assault on long term unemployment? The means by which to achieve this are outlined in section 7 of the programme.  I would not be negative about any measure which can get the unemployed back to work and the Government can be assured that we will respond constructively to any policies which will assist the unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed, but have the Government any idea of the desperation felt by the unemployed when, after two years during which the economy has had a boom, the outcome after months of consultation is that the Government will establish two pilot schemes?</P>
    <P>The programme mentions the EC resolution of 1990 under which these schemes will no doubt be assisted.  Why did the Government not introduce a pilot scheme to cover every unemployment blackspot in every county?  The section of the programme that will be of any interest to the long term unemployed is <Col N="874" /> the section VII, subsection 7.  F &mdash; Employment &mdash; which covers additional places for the long term unemployed with the benefit of employment incentives.  Anyone who happened to be listening to the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme this morning could not be in any doubt about the extent of the problem.  People from Cork and Mayo who were interviewed spelt out the fear of the people that there would not be any movement on jobs in the foreseeable future.  This is regrettable.</P>
    <P>We made a proposal which would have increased the subsidy to employers from £60 to £125 per week if they took part in a negotiated programme between Government, employers and trade unions to reserve a quota of vacancies for the long term unemployed.  I am glad that the programme acknowledges that this is the kind of radical approach which is necessary.  Unfortunately I detect a reluctance by the Government to take on board major initiatives along these lines without the blessing of and funding from the European Social Fund.  Our proposal envisaged an integrated approach combining training with job placement and this fits well with the latest thinking in the European Community.</P>
    <P>Why do the Government believe that convergence between European and Irish rates of unemployment should depend solely on the speed with which Brussels is prepared to move?  In their policy analysis on special employment measures which NESC recognise as being essential in tackling long term unemployment, they examined three policy measures &mdash; labour subsidies, direct job creation schemes and enterprise schemes.  On pages 17 and 18 of the NESC report entitled &ldquo;A Strategy for the Nineties&rdquo; it stated:</P>
    <P>What is needed now is policies which target labour demand on areas of high long term unemployment.  Special employment measures &mdash; particularly subsidised job creation and temporary direct hiring &mdash; are the policies which have achieved this.</P>
    <P>The report noted that the effectiveness <Col N="875" /> of these measures will be enhanced if they are carried out as part of a comprehensive area based package of international and social intervention.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister for Labour and his Department please tell the House what they have been up to since the publication of the NESC analysis and policy recommendations for dealing with long term unemployment?  I regret that there has been a deafening silence from that quarter in recent times.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party put forward proposals on an employment subsidy linked to job placement in our 1989 election campaign policy statement.  We recognised that the unemployed need policies to assist them directly as distinct from general job creation policies.</P>
    <P>If the social partnership is to mean anything, it will be measured at the end of this programme not by its progress on the debt-GNP ratio or even on taxation but by what it has achieved in relation to unemployment.  If the programme does not reduce unemployment, particularly long term unemployment, the unemployed will feel that whatever the social partnership is about, it does not concern them.  At best it will be seen as an additional crutch but it will not deliver the words which they wish to hear, that they have been accepted for a position and should report to work on the following Monday.</P>
    <P>The Government and the other social partners should take our suggestion on board and begin the process of reintegrating the long term unemployed into the workforce.  I know that employers will want to retain some control over selection.  Let them choose from an interview panel drawn up by FÁS of candidates who have been out of work for 12 months or more.</P>
    <P>Trade unions will have reservations, as I do, about any scheme to reintegrate the long term unemployed so that it should not be a form of cheap labour.  To combat that we should insist on two things &mdash; that trade unions fight for similar pay and conditions for people taken from this pool and that there should be pressure <Col N="876" /> for a legal national minimum hourly wage which will effectively eliminate the abuses now taking place.</P>
    <P>I regret that the ICTU were unable to secure any firm commitment on a national minimum wage.  I do not know what employers have to fear in this regard.  It should be embraced as an essential part of any policy to deal with the black economy.  A minimum adult wage of £3.50 per hour and a junior rate of £2.33 per hour would not cost jobs.  It would simply put a stop to competition based on the exploitation of the uneducated, the under-skilled, the vulnerable.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party urge the Government to stop looking at European integration, particularly convergence in the economic and social areas, as something that lies solely with Brussels or with the larger European economies.  Are the Government seriously hoping to attract the sweatshops of South-East Asia and the Pacific rim to relocate to Ireland and avoid more socially advanced regions, by not having a minimum wage?  Will the Minister for Labour say where the 40,000 job losses would occur if minimum wage proposals such as those I have outlined are currently in force?</P>
    <P>The second policy instrument which NESC recommended was direct job creation schemes.  The Minister for Finance gave us the standard line from the new right's recently discredited lexicon of ideas &mdash; the Government do not create jobs, they create the environment.  So be it.  The Minister for Finance says that jobs will not be created in the public sector. Will the Government spell this out for us?  Will the Government at least give a guarantee that they will not foul up the enviroment for employment in the public sector?  It would be welcome if the Minister could give an assurance on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>A consistent and steadfast application of appropriate and disciplined economic and social policies is essential to the attainment of our long term objectives of sustained economic and employment growth with improved living standards for all.  Let it be clear, <Col N="877" /> the fundamental aim is to ensure more jobs and higher incomes in Ireland in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Discipline and reform are not sought for their own sake, but for the employment and other gains they make possible. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> put in place the pillars of these policies: a progressive reduction in the debt-GNP ratio; a commitment to the maintenance of the value of our currency within the EMS; a pay accord which improved our competitiveness and promoted industrial peace; tax reforms which contributed to improvements in work incentives and workers' living standards; and improvements in benefits to those on social welfare.</P>
      <P>Policies over the last three years delivered on all the commitments of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, and vastly exceeded some.  More importantly, they set us on a virtuous path of sustainable growth, low inflation and a declining debt-GNP ratio.  The new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is designed to keep us on that path and, indeed over the medium-term, to speed us along it.  It is not an accident that we are sticking with the broad thrust of the policies which served us so well over the past few years.</P>
      <P>The Government are committed in the new programme to the progressive further reduction of the national debt-GNP ratio with the medium-term aim of reducing it towards 100 per cent by 1993.  All the social partners are in agreement with this goal.  Our longer term aim is to bring the debt-GNP ratio more into line with that of our EC partners.  This key statistic measures the extent to which the State needs to supplement its own revenues by raising money that must be repaid.  As such, it is not to be dismissed as a dry bookkeeping figure which has little to do with the real world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accumulation of very high borrowings in the past &mdash; as recently as 1986 the EBR was £2,145 million or almost 13 per cent of GNP &mdash; led to an overhang of debt that costs the Exchequer almost £2,500 million in debt servicing costs each year.  Were it not for this colossal burden, <Col N="878" /> we would now enjoy an Exchequer surplus of some £2 billion each year.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve these debt/GNP targets it will be necessary to accept the basebroadening which can facilitate tax reform, and to keep tight control on public expenditure.  The need to keep a tight rein on expenditure has been endorsed by the NESC.  There must also be acceptance all round that, in order to implement the specific priority undertakings in the programme, we must rely on reallocation of existing resources rather than additions to real expenditure.</P>
    <P>The objectives of monetary policy remain unchanged.  It will operate to maintain interest rates at the lowest level consistent with international developments and the stable exchange rate policy that will be maintained within the EMS. Our exchange rate policy has been and will continue to be the anchor of our low inflation rate and of the convergence of our interest rates towards the average levels of other low inflation EC economies. Just as our monetary and exchange rate policy is essential for low inflation and interest rate convergence, our fiscal stance is essential to the credibility of our monetary and exchange rate policy.  Both fiscal and monetary policy are working together and in the same direction towards the achievement of our overall goals.</P>
    <P>This consistency, coherence and continuity of our fiscal and monetary policies is giving the right signals to investors both at home and abroad.  The resulting credibility of Government economic policies is, in turn, central to the maintenance of a climate of confidence in the economy. A climate that encourages and sustains investment is the engine of growth and employment creation.  It is most gratifying to us that the high degree of credibility which was established during the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is being reinforced by the policy objectives and measures in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>Without the correct monetary and fiscal policies &mdash; and ours are the correct policies &mdash; no lasting progress can be made <Col N="879" /> towards meeting our national objectives for sustained growth and improved living standards.  While these policies are necessary, they may not be sufficient in themselves.</P>
    <P>We also need an evolution of wages rates that is consistent with the competitiveness needs of the economy.  Competitive labour costs are not an end in themselves, rather they are a means to an end.  That end is sufficient new jobs to meet the needs of our rapidly growing labour force.  Again, as in so many other areas, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> gave us the template.  Its pay terms gave us the opportunity to gain a competitive edge over our trading partners, an opportunity which, to the credit of all concerned, was taken to the benefit of workers, employers, school leavers and the unemployed alike.</P>
    <P>Pay policy is again central to the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  To the credit of all who sweated it out over the negotiating table, we now have a draft pay agreement which strikes a realistic balance between the employment needs of the economy, workers' legitimate aspirations to improve living standards and the state of the public finances.</P>
    <P>The pay terms of the new programme are more generous than in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, but if we can continue to match the productivity growth of our competitors, and I am confident that we can, we should maintain our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Those on low pay are being catered for specially with floor increases of up to £15 per week over the three years of the programme.  In addition, those on low pay with families will benefit from significant changes in the family income supplement together with the changes in tax exemption limits announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>The programme has also made provision for local bargaining on pay, which will apply in exceptional cases and which will be capped at 3 per cent of basic pay cost over the period of the programme. This will lend a degree of flexibility to pay bargaining at firm or industry level <Col N="880" /> within an overall discipline on pay costs to which those of both sides of the negotiating table in all sectors of the economy are fully committed.</P>
    <P>Too often have we seen ill-informed comments in the past on the manner in which public service pay costs are escalating without adequate inquiry into the reasons therefor.  Many commentators forget that the heavy incidence of pay costs arising this year are directly attributable to the past willingness of public servants to forego in the national interest immediate implementation of pay awards due to them.</P>
    <P>The voluntary deferral of payment to future dates made a major contribution to the correction of the public finances during the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  However, the reality is that meeting our side of the bargain means that the bill must be picked up at some stage.  The resultant rise in public service pay costs is a matter of considerable concern.  However, we must not lose sight of its origins and of the major contribution which that policy has made to the process of economic recovery.</P>
    <P>I am particularly glad to see that arrangements under the new programme for local bargaining in the public service allow for some real negotiations aimed at improving efficiency and effectiveness in the public service, thus helping to contain pay costs or at least to ensure greater value for money.</P>
    <P>In the context of the programme, and the tight situation in regard to the public finances over the next few years, it is essential that the public service, in common with other sectors of the economy, should avail of every opportunity to improve efficiency so that increases in money incomes are matched by greater productivity.  This involves devising new and more efficient ways of delivering services and a willingness to change from existing &mdash; often out-moded &mdash; practices.</P>
    <P>The new system of administrative budgets, to be implemented in all Civil Service departments next month, provides an example of changing a long-established regime so as to facilitate more flexible use of resources in the interest of <Col N="881" /> delivering quality service to the public. The new system will give line managers significant discretion, within agreed budgets, to allocate resources in the light of what they, as managers, see as the priority needs of the services they are called on to deliver.  I hope that arrangements on similar lines will be considered by other parts of the public service, thereby tapping the valuable reservoir of managerial talent which is there.</P>
    <P>The traditional way of resolving differences over pay levels in the public service has been to rely &mdash; some would say unduly &mdash; on the results of independent adjudication.  While this system has served us well over the years, it has provided limited opportunity for realistic linking of the process of pay determination with the imperatives of securing efficiency improvements which may be essential for the continued improvement of management of our public services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be.  I am surprised it has not been distributed.</P>
      <P>One of the principal criticisms levelled at the manner in which the system has tended to work in the past has been the tendency to leave to a third party the effective final say in one of the most important elements of our costs, namely the fixing of rates of pay and conditions.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that the new innovative arrangements proposed under the new programme will aim to reconcile requirements for the new dynamic approaches to public service management with the realistic aspirations of staff for more fulfilling work, career development and of course the fixing of fair levels of pay and other conditions.  We would hope to achieve this by direct negotiation and mutual agreement with minimal resort to the adjudication processes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can now look forward with confidence to a new era when management and staff alike will see the benefits of utilising this new approach to the full in the best interests of both improving <Col N="882" /> management of services to the public and of optimising motivation of the staff who provide them.</P>
    <P>Of course, there will inevitably be areas of the public service where this new approach may not be feasible.  In such cases, the programme will permit the processing of not more than one costincreasing claim in the traditional manner over the next three years.</P>
    <P>I need hardly remind the House that negotiations of this type will be constrained by the cap of 3 per cent of weekly-monthly pay costs provided for in the programme.  The cap will be of general application across the economy under the terms of the new programme and, in deference to the projected state of the public finances in 1991 and 1992, will not apply in the public service until its third year.</P>
    <P>Workers in general will also benefit from reforms in taxation promised in the programme.  Against a background of an annual inflation rate of about 3 per cent, the pay accord and other provisions of the programme gives workers a very fair deal which should give them real increases in take home pay for a further three years following on the real increases of the past three years.</P>
    <P>While pay is a very important element of competitiveness, the industrial relations climate is also important.  The terms of the new programme will continue the climate of industrial peace and harmony which served us so well over the past three years.  Investors can be as sure as is possible in an uncertain world of the evolution of their pay costs and of inflation over the next three years.  This is a major bonus to anybody contemplating investment in uncertain times.  We are now better equipped than we have been for a long time, and certainly better equipped than some of our main competitors, to grasp investment and trading opportunities that will arise when world economies emerge from their current period of sluggish growth or recession.  In these times of world uncertainty, it is vital to maintain discipline.  This year's budget has done just that.  It ensures that we can face into this difficult year with a great <Col N="883" /> deal more confidence than could have been envisaged two or three years ago.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the public finances has made important tax reforms possible. The relentless rise in the burden of taxation has been halted.  Over the past few years, notwithstanding the constraints, we have made valuable progress in redirecting the tax system to underpin the improvement in employment and growth.</P>
    <P>We have maintained this momentum in spite of the difficulties that faced us in our budgetary preparations this year.  We are building on the progress made in previous budgets, which restructured company and capital taxation and improved collection efficiency in all sectors, while at the same time reducing the so-called &ldquo;personal tax wedge&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Back in 1987, tax pressure on the ordinary worker had become very severe. The three tax rates of 35 per cent, 48 per cent and 58 per cent were applied to taxable income in very rapid progression &mdash; a single worker on the average industrial wage faced the top marginal income tax rate of 58 per cent and was also fully exposed to social insurance contributions totalling up to 7.75 per cent of his or her gross income.  Thus every additional £1 of that employee's gross earnings, whether secured through pay increases or over-time, suffered statutory deductions of just under 66 per cent.  The net benefit of that additional £1 was thus as little as 34p to the employee.</P>
    <P>Since then, of course, we have reduced the standard rate of income tax from 35 per cent to 29 per cent and the top tax rate from 58 per cent to 52 per cent &mdash; a decrease of six percentage points in each case.  In addition, we increased personal tax allowances and rate bands.  As I mentioned earlier, we increased tax exemption limits too, and introduced a special child addition which, taken together with improvements in the family income supplement scheme, has made a real impact on the incentive to work for those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>These measures, together with our low inflation rates, assisted in the negotiation <Col N="884" /> of relatively low nominal wage increases in both the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> setting the scene for improvements in the competitiveness of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The budget has also continued the process of adjusting indirect taxation to prepare for 1992.  We have brought the standard rate from 25 per cent to 21 per cent in the last two budgets.  However, I would make one point: approximation of taxes in preparation for 1992 is not an <i>a la carte</i> menu.  One cannot take what one wants.  Bringing the top rates to 21 per cent meant a reduction in 4,000 items of household and consumer goods and also a reduction in the cost of professional services.  We must also increase the lower rates to bring up those we are sure will end up in the standard rate bracket.  That is exactly what happened this year.</P>

      <P>The only good thing one can say about this <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is that it is full of genuine aspirations.  That is about as far as one could go in praise of it.  The aspirations and platitudes are everywhere and the one good thing about them is that they are quite acceptable to everybody and offend nobody.  There is everything in this that any group in the country would want to hear and nothing that anybody could disagree with.</P>
      <P>It is stated that the long term strategies are &ldquo;sustained economic growth and the generation of greater income to produce a narrowing of the gap in living standards between Ireland and the rest of the European Community based on increased enterprise, efficiency and competitiveness and maintaining a low inflation economy.&rdquo;  I can only agree fully with that aspiration, but how achievable are the objectives when one considers carefully what else is set out in the document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one thing one should remember about the last programme is that a few short months after its agreement the cracks in the ice began to emerge and the various groups who helped to negotiate it found themselves disadvantaged in one way or another.  We had an education crisis, a health crisis, a crisis in agriculture, <Col N="886" /> all following very quickly on the signing of that agreement.  This happened because the signatories to the agreement found themselves trapped by the small print, the implications of which had not recognised initially.</P>
    <P>That was a serious situation and I feel there is a grave danger that it will happen again.  The reason I think that is that no offence has been given to any single group in the country because the programme is full of pious platitudes and lovely aspirations.  However it falls down in its ability to meet targets.  I sincerely hope that we will not have various groups coming along later this summer and asking to be released from this agreement &mdash; and when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean us here on the Opposition benches &mdash; because that is what happened the last time such an agreement was signed.  In all sincerity I ask the Government not to allow that to happen for the genuine reason that when various groups sign such an agreement the great danger is to have hidden within that agreement time bombs which are likely to explode on an ongoing basis during the course of the agreement which will, in turn, seriously undermine the confidence of those groups in collective bargaining. I have no objection to collective bargaining provided that all the cards are put on the table and that all the objectives are attainable as far as possible.  I hope we have learned a lesson from the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency to talk about social and economic recovery as beginning in 1987.  I do not want to bore everybody in the House by going back over all the things that happened in the previous ten years and how our difficulties came about.  I hope that by now every man, woman and child in this land knows the reason this country's economy almost went to the wall was that politicians were not prepared to take decisions which would hurt the electorate and in turn hurt them at the ballot boxes.  If we have not learned that lesson at this stage, then our salvation will be postponed for a long time.</P>
    <P>Let us quickly look at one or two of the areas dealt with in this programme. <Col N="887" /> Health is one.  I have read the programme carefully and there is nothing in it with which I disagree.  As a member of a health board, I have to say that the objectives are aspirational and vague to say the least.  There is no chance of achieving anything like the flowery objectives set out in that part of the programme unless there is a major review of the delivery of health services.  I know that every year at this time a great deal of discussion is generated about access to services. Obviously it is more difficult to provide health services in winter.  However, if we ever intend to deliver services reasonably quickly to all sectors of the community, the private and the public sectors will have to bear an equal part of the burden.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why a patient should be on a waiting list to gain access to hospital services for two or three years if they happen to be on the public hospital waiting list when they could probably be accommodated very quickly within the private hospital service, and very often by the same consultant they are dealing with in the public sector.  Until such time as public and private patients have equal access regardless of income levels we will never be able to deal with the kind of backlogs we have had, particularly in acute hospital treatment, over the last couple of years.  Many people will say that cannot be done, but I would disagree.  It can be done and it will have huge benefits in clearing the great backlogs we have.  It is not unusual to find a public patient waiting two years for a hip replacement operation and I do not see why people should be condemned to that kind of suffering over a long period.  My feeling, and I wish to state it is purely a personal view, is that something can be done if a decision is made and the structures built around it that people who require immediate treatment, or treatment within a reasonable period, can be treated in the private sector if there is not a bed available in the public sector.  The cost is no greater one way or the other.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention another point which has been totally forgotten about in <Col N="888" /> the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, that is, the huge negative impact of the GATT proposals, particularly the European attitude to GATT, and our Government's attitude to the European attitude to the GATT talks.  If the Uruguay Round proceeds as already indicated, then any objectives, as set out in this programme, are likely to become null and void.  They then become immediately unattainable and the knock on effect will be huge.  If one wants proof of that one can gauge from the anything but measuring sounds emanating from the Minister for Agriculture and Food, week after week that payments are being made to farmers not to farm the land, not to produce anything. It is a most peculiar attitude in a country that is dependent on agriculture that we should arrive at the decision that we can diversify into farm tourism and other areas.  We can to a certain extent, but not to the extent that will be required if we intend to generate downstream improvement in the economy as well.  We have to consider also the areas that will be affected, negatively or positively, by what happens to agriculture.  Towns and villages in rural Ireland will receive a sudden jolt if the present trend in the Uruguay Round continues, and if Europes attitude to the Uruguay Round continues.  If we allow ourselves to be subsumed into the system, I am afraid that in a couple of years time, the electorate will have something very harsh to say about the way they were let down.  I have said it before in this House &mdash; and I repeat it &mdash; that I believe we have been let down in Europe and we have done nothing about it, which is even more serious.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier what was bland and acceptable in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> but what about all things that are not covered in the programme, for example, the proposed increase in ESB charges, the proposed changes in telephone charges, the proposed rent increases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>We got the sweeteners in the budget which had to be balanced against items that will emerge as the year progresses.  The joy of the householder will be somewhat tempered by what is likely to happen over the year.  The plan says we will have a low rate of inflation. While I am on the subject of low inflation, let me say that people regularly tell politicians that while they know inflation is very low, and the figures indicate inflation is very low, which is a good thing, how come their shopping bill seems to rise every weekend and that their household expenses are increasing at a rate which is not reflected by the inflation rate?  They ask also, and these are not my words &ldquo;why do our wages or salaries not go as far as they did this time last year?  Why are we not getting more for our money if inflation is almost nil?&rdquo;  I am at a loss to answer that question but I have become very suspicious as to how this figure is arrived at and a great many people are equally suspicious.  I am sure Members of this House would agree that every household in the country finds it appreciably harder to meet their household budget than they did a year ago, despite the allegedly low inflation rate.</P>
      <P>I do not have time to refer to the likely impact of the so called rationalisation of services by An Post on the rural economy and some of the larger villages and towns. It will have a huge negative impact which will consign the people of rural Ireland to the status of second class citizens.  That impression will be reinforced as subpost offices are closed down and post boxes are erected at the end of the road or avenue in isolated places.  Old people who live in rural areas will suddenly realise for the first time that this is what is called rationalisation, that this is what the <i>Programme for Social and Economic Progress</i> encompasses and that this is what progress is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak today on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  As has been said many times by other speakers, <Col N="890" /> this programme is about people.  The purpose of the programme is to improve the quality of life for all our citizens.  In the case of the provisions of the programme for education the focus on people is aptly captured in the simple statement of overall strategy: &ldquo;to provide the opportunity for all to develop their educational potential to the full&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The programme itself is a product of people coming together and working in a co-operative endeavour in the interests of all and not individual sectional interests.  It is an impressive indication of the level of maturity we have reached in the way we conduct our business.  Following the success of the partnership procedure first introduced in the preparation and monitoring of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> consultation and consensus and not confrontation is now firmly established as the way forward and the basis of development.</P>
      <P>I want to register my view that the education system has contributed in no small way to this new maturity.  The advances in education over the last three decades in particular have resulted in a more highly educated, articulate and discerning population who will not easily tolerate the dissipation of energies in futile and damaging confrontational approaches to the resolution of economic and social issues.  Society's well being and affluence depends on our knowledge of the physical and social world which is expanding at an ever accelerating rate. To keep abreast of expansion, to run the economy and society, means that people have to know more than ever before and to be far more flexible, adaptable and resilient.</P>
      <P>In this regard the challenge facing our education system is enormous.  In a way schools could be perceived as traditionally facing backwards towards a passing economic and social system rather than forwards towards an emerging society.  In the past the task of schools was to prepare a child or a young person with skills which were at risk of becoming outdated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools, as we know them, largely took <Col N="891" /> their shape in and from the industrial era.  The technology of that era required workers to operate at endless repetitive tasks.  The technology of today and tomorrow leaves to the workers functions involving judgment, interpersonal skills and imagination.</P>
    <P>This change in the role of the worker is dramatically demonstrated by the change in attitude of management to workers in successful companies as described in management literature.</P>
    <P>Pupils in schools can be seen as caught in a fixed organisation frame with little or no experience of other forms of organisation. Values transmitted by seating arrangements, the school hall, age-sex segregation, social class distinctions, the authority of the teacher, the fact that students are in school and not in the community all shape attitudes and outlooks that have more to do with the past than the future.</P>
    <P>The education system needs to fix firmly on a future focus.  If this is to be done effectively we have to be able to generate successive alternative images of the future kinds of jobs, family forms, human relationships and ethical and moral problems.  We have to generate, define and deduce the nature of cognitive and effective skills the people of tomorrow will need.</P>
    <P>It is sobering to think that a child entering primary school this year will probably not finish third level education until the year 2010.  Look back 20 years to 1970 and contemplate the many changes in society driven by the engines of advancement. The rate of change over the next two decades will be accelerating every year.  The education system has to prepare people to cope with the pressure and demands that such rapid change entails for individuals and society at large.</P>
    <P>There is a parallel obligation on society to ensure that the experience of the education system is meaningful, stimulating and satisfying.  However, the role of the school as a basic unit of the system is becoming increasingly challenging.</P>
    <P>Society's expectations for schools have <Col N="892" /> grown more extensive while, at the same time, there is criticism that schools have not delivered the goods in the past.  As the influence of the family and churches declines for growing numbers of people further responsibilities are being placed on schools.  The image of schools suffers because of their quite understandable failure to meet completely unrealistic expectations for them.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the pursuit of political power for power's sake alone. Since I became Minister I have had a major purpose and it is to bring about the fundamental reform of the educational system.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have suggested that reforms of education currently taking place in many countries including Ireland are mainly motivated by utilitarian and functional thinking.  It is indisputable that the need for greater accountability for public expenditure has required a rigorous examination and evaluation of all aspects of educational provision.  Furthermore, it is clear that an imbalance in favour of a <i>laissez faire</i> approach to the management and planning of education needed to be corrected. However, education cannot and must not be ever subordinated to training, to indoctrination in both the perspectives and techniques of the immediately functional.</P>
    <P>Education systems are notoriously large and complex.  It is widely accepted that education systems are conservative and harbour inertia.</P>
    <P>The path of reform, therefore, can be predicted to be rocky and precarious. Reform will not take place spontaneously. Neither is it anywhere near adequate to rely on the individual and unco-ordinated efforts of the more committed agents and institutions in the system.</P>
    <P>Sustained attention is needed for a strategy for reform.  Great gaps have occurred in the past between educational change on paper and its implementation. As a pre-requisite to reform, the people concerned, and in education they amount to a huge proportion of the population, need to be convinced that reform is <Col N="893" /> necessary.  Furthermore, for reform to be relevant the main agents and providers in the system need to have a meaningful say in the direction and the detail of such reforms.  To hasten the reform process initiatives of short, medium and long term nature need to be planned and grafted on to the system where they will flourish.</P>
    <P>The various reviews and initiatives I am pursuing have increased awareness of the issues that need to be faced and have prepared the ground for extensive and further fundamental reform.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said last December:</P>
    <P>Education is the key to success in our modern world.  It is ultimately more important than economic strength or military might.  On it depends the future of our young people, and the quality of our society.  I see the steady improvement in our whole system of education, including vocational and technological training, as a major preoccupation of this decade.</P>
    <P>To achieve my objective I needed to win widespread acceptance and commitment to reform at all levels and with the support of Government and the social partners to win the necessary resources for reform.  Education must be seen as an integral part of the wider political, social, economic and cultural framework of society's development.  Planning for educational reform has now been firmly established as an inter-sectoral social strategy through the programme which we are now debating.</P>
    <P>A particularly significant provision in the programme from the point of view of the reform of the education system is the Government's commitment to issue a Green Paper on education by summer 1991, a White Paper in early 1992 setting out the Government's policy on education to be followed by an education Act.</P>
    <P>This provision is testimony to the sincerity of the Government's commitment to education and, indeed, to reform in education.  The process planned affords the opportunity to delineate basic educational philosophy, goals, policies and <Col N="894" /> strategies and their underlying democratic rationale.  It will allow the rights of pupils, parents, community, teachers and managers to be clarified and will spell out the respective roles of the State, other authorities and institutions.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper will be comprehensive in its coverage.  It will relate to all aspects of education and will afford the opportunity to all parties to offer views before the Government's policy is set out in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to note that the provisions for education in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> have attracted favourable comment.  The only person whom I heard saying he did not agree with the proposals for education was Deputy Jim Higgins.  One can have the opinion that they should be more far reaching and that they do not immediately ease burdens but he expressly said he did not agree with anything in the education section in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  I suggest that is a very odd statement.</P>
    <P>One would be forgiven for describing the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as the green bible of hope compared to the grey book of despondency and despair that was <i>Building on Reality</i> produced by a previous Government.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the programme in relation to education have received widespread publicity and I do not intend to dwell further on that.  However, I do want to draw the attention of the House to a very important consideration underlying the provisions.  Socio-economic status both independently and in conjunction with other factors significantly influence an individual's opportunity to derive benefit from the education system.  This fact in itself calls for a systematic approach to tackling the question of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The programme sets out in broad terms the policy and strategy of the education system for the future well being of the country.</P>
    <P>The strong theme of the programme is catering for the disadvantaged.  There is a two-pronged approach to this strategy. First, we must identify those pupils in the system who are disadvantaged or who are <Col N="895" /> under achieving.  Then we must invest resources so as to overcome those difficulties. In some ways this is a long term strategy, one that will ensure that, despite disadvantage, children will still, within what I might call the mainstream education system, be helped to achieve their full educational and social potential.</P>
    <P>The second strand of my policy relates to those who have already left the school system without reaching their full potential and who, literally, must be given another chance.  Thus the emphasis in the programme on what is termed second chance education.  Within these two broad strands of education policy the programme sets out systematically to provide initiatives geared towards making the policy work.</P>
    <P>At the level of class size and pupil-teacher ratio improvements will be brought about to increase the number of teachers in the system by improving the ratios and thus reducing class size.  In the primary schools this process is stated to be aimed directly at reducing overly large classes and meeting the needs of the disadvantaged. At second-level, the same objective will be pursued.</P>
    <P>In the area of identifying a problem and dealing with it, there is provision in the programme to increase the availability of guidance in second level schools.  I envisage that guidance used properly would not simply be a matter of advising students on job opportunities but would also identify young people who need counselling.  The guidance teacher is an integral part of the overall school staff.</P>
    <P>The programme provides for the allocation of moneys above the level currently committed for the disadvantaged.  There will also be an increase in the rates of free book grants for primary and second level students.  For the first time this scheme will be extended to four to six year olds in the junior clases in primary schools.  This extension has been long sought by many of the Deputies on the opposite side of the House.  I am having a study carried out on the operation of the free books scheme and the pupils who <Col N="896" /> should be able to avail of it.  I hope to receive the results of this study very soon.</P>
    <P>I am also developing the home-school liaison links to a greater extent.  These links are a very important part of the programme for the disadvantaged.  We are lucky in that Irish parents are for the most part, interested in education.  They want to do their best for their children and support the schools in their localities. The development of the home-school liaison links will help children who for one reason or another may not benefit fully from the educational system.</P>
    <P>I have not finished my script but there is nothing I can do about it in view of the time constraints.  However, I should like to strongly recommend the adoption of the provisions in the programme, in particular, the education provisions, to all parties in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped the Minister would be able to complete her speech as most of the provisions in the programme in regard to education are aspirational and do not deal with the specifics.  With regard to the appointment of an additional 150 teachers in the primary and post-primary sector, it is not at all clear when these teachers will be appointed, what schools they will be appointed to, whether the children requiring remedial teaching will get priority, whether there will be guidance teachers, etc.  I had hoped the Minister would avail of this opportunity to make a specific statement in the House about the appointment of these teachers and the areas to which they will go but, unfortunately she has not done so.</P>
      <P>I feel compelled to refer to the health services.  There are some wonderful aspirational statements in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> about the provision of resources and the intentions of the Government in this regard.  Pargraph 36 of the programme states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Support services for people with mental handicap and their carers in the community will also be strengthened. Special attention will be paid to the <Col N="897" /> needs of young adults with mental handicap, and the adult mentally handicapped currently being cared for by ageing parents.</P>
    <P>However, there is no evidence to suggest that these provisions will be put into effect by the Government.  At present health boards are advising hospitals that they will have to cut back on services and facilities.  This does not tally with the aspirational statements in the programme. For example, people are being offered public beds at the expense of the taxpayers.  It is absolutely ridiculous that people who are in a position to pay for their medical treatment should be given that facility.  It will put an extra strain on the demand for public beds and will put those people who cannot pay for their medical treatment on longer waiting lists.</P>
    <P>No provision is made in the programme for an increase in the number of public beds.  In fact, on the contrary, health boards are being put in the position where they will have to further restrict the level of service they give.  Instead of a commitment to increase the total number of beds available, the programme states that there will be a gradual phasing-in of a system under which private patients availing of public hospitals for elective treatment will be accommodated only in private or semi-private beds.  This will do nothing to reduce the number of public patients on the waiting lists in the short term and I have not met anyone in the health service who believes it will have any substantial effect in the longer term.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has told us that this proposal will not have any effect on patients who have no option but to rely on public hospitals.  He said he expects very few people to opt out of the VHI and join the new system which he is proposing.  If he believes this will be the case, why does he need to introduce a new system?  The Minister cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>The programme makes a long statement on the patients rights as a consumer &mdash; the right of access to services in accordance with needs; the right to considerate and respectful care; the right to privacy; <Col N="898" /> the right to information; the right to confidentiality of all medical records; the right to refuse to participate in research projects; the right to respect for religious and philosophical beliefs and the right to make a complaint.  How does this statement tally with the case of an 84-year old man who was brought into Ennis General Hospital last Thursday night and who said to a nurse he was delighted he had made it to the hospital because he thought his heart would stop before he got there but who an hour later was dead and left on a stretcher in the casualty ward without so much as a curtain around him?  Standing beside that man was a young mother with her 13-month old baby who had extensive burns across her chest.  Was that a dignified way for that man to die?  Yet, the Government have had the audacity to present a glossy piece of paper with a whole list of aspirations which bear no resemblance to the reality of what is happening throughout the country.  The Government must be condemned for this hypocrisy, which, in effect, is all it is.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said he will provide extra resources for every sector of the health service, and the programme lists a litany of aspirations but, at the same time, health boards are being asked to cut back on the services they provide.  At present the hospitals in the Mid-Western Health Board are being asked not to take on additional staff for holiday duty.  They have been told that this is to be compensated for by a reduction in elective and day care surgery.  At present there is overcrowding in the hospitals in the Mid-Western Health Board area, particularly in Ennis General Hospital, and elective and day care surgery has had to be abandoned so that medical beds can be provided for people who need them.  There are severe restrictions on the amount of surgery carried out in Ennis General Hospital. Yet the Minister and the health boards are suggesting that additional cutbacks in surgery should be made during the summer when staff are on holidays.</P>
    <P>What is the relationship between the programmes which have been submitted to the health boards for approval and the <Col N="899" /> aspirations set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress?</i>  I suggest they bear no relationship to each other and that it is an absolute fraud on the part of the Government to present such a programme to this House for approval. It is an insult to the people to tell them this is the greatest thing that has happened and that it guarantees economic peace for the next three years.  Maybe it guarantees peace between the unions but as far as the deprived people of this country are concerned they have been further sold down the drain by this programme.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the question of remedial teachers.  It is unfortunate the Minister did not avail of the opportunity to inform the House exactly where she intends to direct the additional resources proposed.</P>
    <P>There is a section on housing in the programme which contains a very interesting and indeed cunning statement. One of the objectives of the housing policy will be &ldquo;maintaining the local authority housing programme at a level appropriate to the increasing need, having due regard to resources&rdquo;.  This is quite hilarious.  The Minister for the Environment has been constantly ducking the questions put to him on local authority housing.  There has been a major cutback in local authority housing and there has been a lot of manipulation in this area.  There are people who are badly in need of houses but under this Government they have no hope of acquiring them whether they be new houses or local authority houses that are put up for sale.  What we have here is a very nice presentation with no substance.  It contains no targets, estimates or aspirations about the numbers of people who are in need of houses.  Nowhere in the programme is there reference to local authority housing lists, private house construction or the provision of housing for the homeless.  It is a deceptively written document that does not relate to the problem on the ground.</P>
    <P>There are many aspirations on agriculture in the programme but it relates in <Col N="900" /> no way to the medium and small farmers whose incomes have dropped from 20 to 30 per cent in the past year and who are finding it increasingly difficult to survive. In the past six months farmers have come to me seeking smallholders' assistance. These are people of pride and independence who would never ask for assistance and who were always proud to be able to provide for themselves, but because of the present position they are forced to seek Government assistance. It is extremely unfortunate that, despite their best efforts good, decent people who are willing to work hard cannot make a living in agriculture.  That is mostly due to the bad negotiations conducted by the Government, particularly in Europe and indeed to the appalling presentation by the Fianna Fáil Commissioner in Brussels, Mr. Ray MacSharry, in the GATT negotiations.  While this document contains pious platitudes, the bottom line is that tens of thousands of men and women will leave the agricultural sector in the next ten years because of what has happened in the past six months under this Government.</P>
    <P>There are many areas that one would like to deal with in relation to the programme but I would like to refer to one area in particular.  No mention has been made of equality of recruitment in the Department of Defence, in fact there is no reference whatever to defence matters. The Minister for Foreign Affairs last week met the German Prime Minister and I believe he understood very clearly our position in relation to a Common Defence Policy.  The Minister has not clearly outlined to this House the Government's position in relation to a common European security and defence policy.  I would warn the Government that because of their lack of vision and decisiveness on this matter they could be in difficulty and may pay a very high economic price in the long term as a result of their attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, which lays a sound <Col N="901" /> foundation for the future economic and social development of the State.  In the time available to me I intend to confine my remarks to those areas of the programme for which I, as Minister for Justice, have specific responsibility.</P>
      <P>There can be no social or economic progress without civil order and without an effective police force to maintain that civil order.  As Minister for Justice, I have the responsibility to ensure that the citizen is provided with the necessary protection and security to go about his or her daily business in peace.  To this end, I am taking all necessary steps to maximise the number of gardaí on our streets and roads, to release gardaí as far as possible from indoor desk jobs by providing the force with much enhanced clerical backup and to ensure that adequate resources of equipment are available to the Garda Síochána to discharge the responsibilities society places on them.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that these measures have proven to be effective.  Recorded crime figures have stabilised in recent years, and the incidence of serious crime continues to decrease significantly.  Of course, there are still a number of problems which need to be addressed.  In saying this, I am conscious of the recent increase in rural crime.  Needless to say, we must continue to work tirelessly to reduce even further the level of crime in our society.  The community can and should play their part in crime prevention and in this connection I must commend the very valuable work which is being done under schemes like neighbourhood watch, community alert and pharmacy watch.  These schemes have been particularly successful by involving the community in crime prevention, and by enhancing relations between the Garda and the community they serve and by promoting a greater sense of security especially among the more vulnerable members of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the various reports on crime that land on my desk and indeed seeing the results of crime in various areas of this city and other parts of Ireland, I cannot help but be struck by the extent to which young people can be caught up <Col N="902" /> in crime, particularly petty crime.  Aside from the obvious detriment to society, there is a greater tragedy in the waste of the talent and potential of the unfortunate young people themselves.  I am also aware that crimes and acts of vandalism committed by young people can be minor when looked at individually, but in the aggregate can have a devastating effect on the quality of life especially in certain urban areas that suffer unduly in this regard.</P>
    <P>This led me to look at what could be done to enhance the Garda juvenile liaison officer scheme, which is designed to divert young offenders from the criminal justice system and wean them away from crime, and to devise new strategies to deal with young offenders, or indeed to &ldquo;intercept&rdquo; young people before they ever become involved in crime or vandalism. In so far as the Garda juvenile liaison officer scheme is concerned, I have already announced the implementation of a number of reforms: first, a national juvenile liaison office is being established to oversee the operation of this service throughout the State; secondly the reporting and supervision arrangements for juvenile liaison officers are being improved; thirdly, the variable period of supervision by juvenile liaison officers of their young charges is being introduced; fourthly, weekend and evening working by juvenile liaison officers is being reintroduced; and finally, there is to be a new system of training of juvenile liaison officers.  Members of the Garda who carry out this special work all receive a degree of preparation by way of training courses which cover the main elements of social work.  A new draft training curriculum for these officers is being prepared for the commissioner's approval by the director of the Garda college.  The aptitude of the members of the force who seek to fill juvenile liaison posts is very much taken into account when they are selected.  The intention is to have the new course for juvenile liaison officers in place before the end of 1991.</P>
    <P>In my law enforcement package, estimates, announcement for 1991, I also said that under the juvenile liaison officer <Col N="903" /> scheme the caution rather than prosecution option will increasingly be pursued to the fullest extent possible from now on by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Another initiative aimed at young people is the Garda schools project.  This was set up in January 1990 in two schools in Tallaght and later extended to 12 schools in Coolock and two in Portmarnock. It has enormous potential to influence youngsters for good before they ever become involved in criminal activity.  The purpose of the Garda involvement in the schools is to develop positive attitudes towards law enforcement and the gardaí.</P>
    <P>Community gardaí based in the areas involved have been specially trained in a programme developed jointly by the Garda college, Templemore and St. Patrick's Teacher Training College, Drumcondra, to take part in school room meetings and discussions with ten to 12 year olds living in the area they serve. The schools involved have regular visits from the gardaí involved in the project.</P>
    <P>Some of the work of the project takes place outside the classroom in school playgrounds and on trips organised by the gardaí.  Two specially fitted minibuses from the Garda fleet have been made available for the project and for other Garda-community relation purposes. Plans are at an advanced stage to extend the schools project further and I will be making announcements in this regard before too long.</P>
    <P>The probation and welfare service, with local Garda support, are actively involved in the implementation of community-based programmes designed to effectively direct youngsters away from reoffending.  Already, two specialised remedial projects have commenced at Cherry Orchard, Dublin and Southill, Limerick, which aim to tackle head-on the delinquent lifestyle of the participants. The gardaí and local voluntary organisations are represented on the management committees and they have concentrated their efforts on helping target groups of persistent juvenile offenders.</P>
    <P>A pilot project was also organised recently in the Coolock-Darndale area by <Col N="904" /> two probation and welfare officers with the enthusiastic co-operation of local gardaí who work as juvenile liaison officers.</P>
    <P>In December 1990, I announced my intention to introduce some further measures through the probation and welfare service which will materially assist in safeguarding private and public property, and in making urban areas in particular safer places in which to live and work, to play and to shop.  First, where the incidence of crime is high, extra probation and welfare officers will be assigned to channel those most involved into the existing programmes, with the aim of reducing and, if possible, eliminating their offending.  Secondly, where such anti-crime programmes do not exist, they will be established, utilising the resources of statutory and voluntary social agencies so that people's pride in their neighbourhood can be rekindled. Thirdly, in city centre areas with a high incidence of juvenile crime, a community-based programme of intensive supervision for young people caught up in an offender culture will be put into effect by assigning additional probation and welfare officers to the areas concerned, specifically for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Turning to the problem of dealing with juvenile offenders, I made regulations last August which provide for the detention of certain 15 year old boys in the place of detention at Wheatfield instead of in Mountjoy, Cork or Limerick Prison. The regulations made it possible to transfer to Wheatfield boys who had been sentenced to prison by the courts.  The reason for making the regulations was that I considered that Wheatfield provides a much more suitable environment than Mountjoy, or the other prisons, for boys under 16 years of age who have been sentenced to imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The age structure of the population in Wheatfield means that the 15 year olds can be accommodated in close proximity to other youths in their mid and late teens.  There is also the point that the regime in Wheatfield places greater emphasis on education and work training for young offenders than the regimes in prisons such as Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> Apart from the specific developments that I have just mentioned I should also refer to ongoing talks between officials of my Department and officials of the Departments of Education and Health, all of whom deal with the various aspects of the juvenile justice system.  The purpose of the meetings is to improve the interaction and ensure co-ordination between services provided for young persons by the three Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>I now wish to address the important subject of penal reform.  The Government are committed to an ongoing programme of reform in line with the recommendations made in the Whitaker Report on the Penal System.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the Whitaker report I should say that there has been a fair amount of criticism in recent years about what is seen as the non-implementation of the recommendations in the report.  It is a fair comment to say that many of those who criticise what they see as non-implementation of its recommendations do not appear to have read the report.</P>
    <P>Many of the things recommended in the report are not the usual cut and dry type of recommendation in relation to a specific topic but expressions of broad principle.  An example of a broad principle in the report is the following:</P>
    <P>The fundamental human rights of a person in prison must be respected and not interfered with or encroached upon except to the extent inevitably associated with the loss of liberty.</P>
    <P>The validity of principles of this kind have been recognised for decades and formed part of Irish penological policy long before the Whitaker committee came into being.  Indeed, I should say that the Whitaker report never denied this.  To the extent that these principles are recognised and implemented and act as a constant guide to emerging policy, it can be said that the Whitaker report is being implemented.</P>
    <P>Apart from the general-principle type of recommendation that I have just referred to, there are, of course, more specific recommendations in the report. It is clear that the committee regarded these recommendations as being of great <Col N="906" /> importance as the means of giving more effective expression to the recommendations related to general principles.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to these specific recommendations is that many of them have been implemented.  I will deal with a few of the more important ones. One of the key recommendations of the report was that greater use should be made of alternatives to custody.  At the time the report was written there were, of course, many alternatives to custody already in use.  Fines and probation orders are examples of the type of alternatives then in vogue.  Another type of alternative was community service orders and the latter alternative has grown enormously in use in recent years.</P>
    <P>The key group in the implementation of these types of alternatives to custody is the probation and welfare service.  Their work is rapidly expanding and I intend to further expand the potential for alternatives to custody during this year.  This will be achieved by the recruitment of 31 extra probation and welfare staff.  An innovation in the supervision area will be the establishment of two &ldquo;drop-in&rdquo; centres for those under supervision.  One of these will be located in Dublin and the other in Cork.  Counselling and other services will be available in the centres for those on supervision.  Across the board, from the appointment of a medical officer to a sentence review group, I assure the House that I am very conscious of the need for alternatives to prison and to the upgrading of the prison system.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the family mediation service which commenced in Dublin on a pilot basis in July 1986.  Their purpose is to assist a husband and wife whose marriage has broken down to reach a voluntary agreement about arrangements in regard to children and property without the need for court intervention. The pilot scheme ended in 1989, at which stage I received a report from the steering committee on the workings of the scheme.  Following examination of that report, I decided that it would be best to set up an independent committee to thoroughly review the mediation service and to make recommendations as to their future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> The Government approved my proposal and I am now in the process of establishing the review committee with wide terms of reference.  I intend to set a time limit for the committee to complete their work so that final decisions may be made as to the future of the service without undue delay.  As the programme suggests, the social partners have a decided interest in this question and I intend to make arrangements for them to be consulted in connection with the committee's study.</P>
    <P>In the limited time available to me, I want to talk about the scheme of civil legal aid and advice.  I have taken a very keen interest in this service, I have extended the funding available and, this year, it is at its highest level, at almost £2.5 million, which is a 60 per cent increase on the amount allocated at the beginning of 1989.  We have taken on extra solicitors and there is provision for opening three new law centres this year, there will be a further announcement in this regard in the near future.  I am also considering the extension of the service and I will be speaking about that at a later stage.  Work is well in hand in the Department on the preparation of legislation to put the legal aid scheme on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>I have tried to outline the work done in my Department in relation to the improvement of the quality of life generally which fits into the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  I strongly recommend the programme to the House.</P>

      <P>The House is debating the motion in the name of the Taoiseach: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann approves the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress&rdquo;</i>. In speaking to that motion, I should like to refer to the amendment in <Col N="908" /> the name of The Workers' Party Deputies which I should like to read into the record of the House:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>(a)  &ldquo;supports the concept of central bargaining between the Government and the principal economic and social interests in the country, since it is only through collective bargaining at national level that the &lsquo;social wage&rsquo;, including pay, tax and social welfare reform, health and education policies, etc., can be addressed,</P>
      <P>(b)  notes however that the recently published <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is an inadequate document since many of the commitments given by the Government are vague, conditional, imprecise, and in some instances, merely aspirational,</P>
      <P>(c)  regrets the absence of specific commitments to real tax reform, a statutory minimum wage and the exclusion of employees of the commercial State-sponsored bodies from the &lsquo;no compulsory retirement&rsquo; provision in the public service generally,</P>
      <P>(d)  notes the necessity in particular for regular public review of progress concerning the job creation targets,</P>
      <P>(e)  believes that it is in the public interest that there is regular public scrutiny of the important political, social and economic commitments entered into in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(f)  instructs the Government, therefore, to establish a Dáil Review mechanism representative of each of the groups as defined in Standing Order 89 for the purpose of regular public scrutiny of progress concerning implementation of the political, economic and social objectives contained in the <i>Programme for <Col N="909" /> Economic and Social Progress,</i> including the provision of sufficient resources by the Government to implement these commitments especially in respect of the Health Services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think I know better than most Deputies in this House that negotiations on a programme such as this are concerned very much with the art of the possible.  I have listened to a number of eulogies about the merits of the programme which has been agreed which can only lead me to question whether some of the speakers understand the programme, or indeed in some instances, have read it.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, The Workers' Party have supported the concept of central bargaining.  However it is the actual content of the bargain that matters and when the contents of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are subjected to close scrutiny they are clearly seen to be inadequate to met the challenges of the nineties.  The document is characterised by extremely clever draftsmanship. Our traditional commitment to the concept of central bargaining should not blind any of us to the fact that, so clever is the draftsmanship of many sections of the programme that its principal author, Mr. Pádraig Ó hUiginn, deserves a nomination for the Booker Prize for fiction.  Time and again throughout the 96 pages we discover that a particularly critical section of the programme is not what it seems.  The pay terms are conditional on &ldquo;economic and commercial circumstances&rdquo;, and the floating 3 per cent will prove illusory for tens of thousands of workers.</P>
    <P>The supposed bias in favour of the lower paid is almost negligible and it is precisely in employments where the lower paid are concentrated that the securing of this floating 3 per cent will prove most unattainable.  There is no commitment to a statutory minimum wage but merely to a report &ldquo;on the issues involved&rdquo; by 1994.  Despite international events, under way before the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was <Col N="910" /> concluded, there is no escalation clause included, while the no compulsory redundancy pledge that was enshrined during the currency of the 1987 <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has been withdrawn in respect of the commercial State-sponsored bodies; hence the threat to the employees of An Post and the B &amp; I, and I am sure there will be more to come after the local elections.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> gives the green light to privatisation wherever &ldquo;it is desirable on policy grounds&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Given our experience during the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the proposals on tax reform do not even merit the description.  The yardstick used is one of tax reductions and not tax reform.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> using the same mistaken yardstick, promised &ldquo;tax reductions to the cumulative value over the three years of the programme of £225 million&rdquo;.  However, because of spiralling profits and economic growth which, in the context of the economic conditions prevailing in 1986-87, the trade unions could not have reasonably anticipated, the Government were able to deliver &ldquo;income tax reliefs worth more than £800 million&rdquo;, leaving the trade union negotiators looking somewhat foolish.  To fall again in 1991 for the Government's identical blandishments is carelessness.</P>
    <P>The Government have consistently confused tax reductions with tax reform. I should say that it greatly saddens me to see the Progressive Democrats approach to tax reform, that is, a basic rate of 25 per cent, enshrined in the programme and that the trade unions negotiators have apparently given this their approval. Tax reform is not about whether someone is paying at the rate of 25 per cent or 28 per cent; it is about who is paying tax, how broad the base is, how quickly one gets into that 25 per cent tax band and for how long one stays in that band before one becomes subject to the next tax rate. These questions are not addressed in the programme.</P>
    <P>Once again, we have accepted the yardstick of tax reductions &mdash; £400 million in a full year &mdash; when in fact the <Col N="911" /> normal process will probably produce tax reductions of that order.  We have the precedent of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> when the negotiators accepted tax reductions of the order of £225 million over the three years of the programme. However, because of buoyancy in profits and the rate of economic growth, a reduction of £800 million was realised.  If I were at the negotiating table and had that precedent, I would think again about what the yardstick I would use in calculating meaningful tax reform.  Establishing a rate of 25 per cent, with no significant specific commitment to broadening the tax base, does not constitute tax reform.</P>
    <P>On the question of company taxation, for example, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> records &ldquo;that the scope for a further widening of the base of taxation while preserving its developmental thrust will continue to be actively reviewed.  That is one of the clever phrases which characterises the document, and it means absolutely nothing.  What it means is that there are no new commitments to reform corporate or capital taxation.  With regard to tax enforcement, the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> for example, acknowledged the need for adequate staffing with an implicit commitment to do something about it, but the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> apparently, believes that there is no staffing problem in the area of enforcement.</P>
    <P>On job creation, the 1987 programme promised, and I quote Government spokespersons at the time, 20,000 extra &mdash; I emphasise extra &mdash; jobs per annum in manufacturing.  This was quickly changed to 20,000 new &mdash; and I emphasise for the record new &mdash; jobs per annum in manufacturing.  Initially we were told 20,000 extra jobs, quickly it became 20,000 new jobs in manufacturing, and when this target ran adrift and twice provoked the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, to lambaste what he called leading private employers for not contributing sufficiently to job creation, the <Col N="912" /> Central Review Committee were persuaded to allow international services to be included with manufacturing to make up the job targets.  That is a historical fact.  I know about it.  He started off promising 20,000 extra jobs, we got 20,000 new jobs, not in manufacturing but in manufacturing and international services.  Now the new programme, the Government side having learned lessons, gives a commitment to the creation of 20,000 new jobs per annum in &ldquo;manufacturing and international services&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Gone are the specific targets enshrined in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> for the food industry and they are replaced by a three line paragraph typical of this agreement.  I quote from page 47 of the programme:</P>
    <P>The restructuring of Irish food companies will continue with a view to achieving the greater scale needed to sustain innovative product development and strong market positions in international distribution demands.</P>
    <P>I do not know what that means but it does not mean any hope for the 241,000 people who are unemployed.  It does not mean there will be any new jobs in the food sector.  Remember, only a short few years ago this Government put all their eggs in the basket of one major company in the food industry, the Goodman operation, and promised we would have fantastic and significant job potential if that sector of the economy was developed. Now the entire commitment to the food sector is devoted to the paragraph I have read out.  That is how the climate has changed.  That is how much the Government negotiators have learned about the &ldquo;cleverality&rdquo; of the drafting required and that is how transparent the end product is to any of us who know a little about it.</P>
    <P>In the crucial area of health, the abolition of category 3 is being bruited about as a major reform.  However, given the underspending, the public are about to discover that access to free services is not the same as free access to services.  Two issues are being confused here.  The first is who pays the consultant when a patient is admitted &mdash; and this is addressed in <Col N="913" /> the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  The second, and arguably more serious, question is how speedily one can gain access to hospital services.  That is the real issue for the people in the queues. Linked to this is a consideration of social equity, that is, whether those who can afford private health care can gain access faster than those who cannot afford it. We know the answer to that.  This is a much bigger issue and it is not resolved by the abolition of category 3.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health is quoted in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 18 February 1991 as favouring private and public practice in the same hospital campus.  The paper says this implies that public hospital facilities will continue to be available to consultants although perhaps on a more restricted and more costly basis.  The plain fact is that if there is one private patient in a public bed it is one bed fewer for public patients, regardless of what the consultant is being charged for that bed. Only a combined waiting list for all patients can overcome this perpetuation of a two-tier system.  The expectation that the abolition of category 3 will lead to a significant change is not borne out by a look at the existing level of those covered by the VHI.  As the Commission on Health Funding noted, only 15 per cent of the population is not covered for consultant services, while twice this number and members of the VHI.  Clearly their experience of free consultant services did not convince that extra 15 per cent of its attractions and they voted with their feet by taking action to jump the queue by buying private insurance.</P>
    <P>While it is always possible for negotiators to deal with weaknesses and omissions in the programme by saying not every item could have been dealt with, it is they who bring this problem on themselves by embarking on such a project in the first place, where inconsistency dealt with or omitted indicates a lack of judgment about priorities, there is a more serious criticism of the negotiators.  For example, while the teacher unions managed to get a commitment that all existing posts would be maintained in 1991 and <Col N="914" /> 1992, no such commitment was forthcoming in the health services, despite all the brouhaha about the health services in this House.  Indeed, before the ink was dry on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> health workers were learning that the bad old days of 1987 where set to return.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health assumes a level of economic illiteracy on the part of the electorate if he thinks additional expenditure which falls below the level needed to maintain services is an increase in expenditure in real terms.  We have had cuts or shortfalls in the health boards in real terms rhymed off in this House over the last couple of weeks &mdash; a £4 million shortfall in the Southern Health Board, £6 million in the Eastern Health Board, £3.27 million in the Western Health Board, £2 million in the Mid-Western Health Board and £1.4 million in the Midland Health Board.  Interestingly, the Midland Health Board have proposed dealing with the shortfall by shedding 100 jobs.  If one were to extrapolate that figure nationally one could be looking at a threat to almost 2,000 jobs in the health services.</P>
    <P>While much attention has been focused on consultants in recent days, it is far more likely to be the front line staff, such as nurses, who will be targeted, especially as other options for so-called economies were exhausted in the last major offensive on the health services by this Government or to be precise, this Governments predecessor in 1987 &mdash; that correction was in deference to the presence of the Minister for the Environment who does not like references to a Coalition Government. The proposed increase in current health spending of £90 million &ldquo;by the final year of the seven year programme&rdquo; which, incidentally, is confined to community services, must be seen in the context of the level of the cuts I have referred to being simultaneously implemented.</P>
    <P>The section on education is interesting, and quite unique in as much as it indicates that parents and teachers have taught Fianna Fáil a lesson.  The programme will have some effect on class size, the first positive change in class size since 1982. <Col N="915" /> Physical conditions in schools should improve and the promise of an eventual six year cycle at second level is to be welcomed.  However, even here all is not as it seems, and I am sorry the Minister for Education has left the House.  At the end of the term of the programme the average class size as distinct from the pupil-teacher ratio which is a very misleading figure since it is arrived at by dividing the total number of pupils in the country by the total number of teachers &mdash; the latter figure including administrative principals, teachers of the handicapped and so on who have smaller classes &mdash; will still mean that there will be many classes of 38 pupils in national schools.</P>
    <P>On the pupil-teacher ratio there are promised improvements for 1991 and 1992 &mdash; which I welcome &mdash; to bring the ratio to 25:1 in the case of primary and 19:1 in the case of post-primary but there are no proposals for improvement in 1993.  We still have the highest ratio in the EC.  The pupil-teacher ratio yardstick conceals the real position concerning class size.  Our average class size is 31 pupils at primary level compared with an EC average of 20, and two-thrids of our children are in classes of over 30.  Therefore, a ratio of 25:1 does not mean classes of 25.</P>
    <P>On ex-quota vice principals and guidance teachers improvements are delayed until September 1992, at earliest, and there is no provision for ex-quota remedial posts at second-level.  At present three in every four fee-charging schools have a sanctioned six-year cycle but only one in five of all &ldquo;free scheme&rdquo; schools have such a facility.  The PESP proposals will become effective for new students from 1991 which means that all current students at second level will not benefit.</P>
    <P>The extra capitation grants to employ secretaries and caretakers at both primary and second-level are welcome but will involve large scale extra funds to help maintain buildings which are for the most part in private ownership.  School trustees should be required to repay an additional <Col N="916" /> amount of public funds on sale of school buildings to recoup such costs.  There is no additional grant for schools for heating, cleaning, painting and so on under the heading of &ldquo;capitation&rdquo;.  Consequently, the &ldquo;roll tax&rdquo; of parental fundraising will continue.</P>
    <P>The extra grants for &ldquo;disadvantage&rdquo; show increases over three years which are very small indeed, for example, £1 million in 1991.  Free books are part of many other free education systems.  But this programme increase is in part only to provide for enhancement of the free books scheme for necessitous children. In fact, at today's prices, it would require £1.5 million to give a grant of half the usual book costs to just the most needy one-fifth of our students.  There is no extra funding for adult education, all promises are vague and are to be fulfilled within available resources.</P>
    <P>Under the section entitled Arts and Culture I contend that linking the arts and tourism will not assist development of the arts which should be funded on their merits.  Linkage can only compromise the arts.  The commitment to moving towards the Arts Council's funding target of £12 million to £13 million is heavily qualified by the phrase:</P>
    <P>...our aim is to reach this reasonably rapidly and as circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of phrase that is repeated time and again.</P>
    <P>Negotiating a proposed agreement like the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is very much the art of the possible. However, the programme should not be made out to be something it is not. At the same time The Workers' Party do not believe that a reversion to fragmented local bargaining is in the best interests of the mass of trade unionists. If we are seriously concerned about addressing the question of the social wage we must seek national bargaining rights with those who can deliver on the elements making up that concept. However, the concept of the social wage is undermined by the refusal to address tax reform.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> There are no new innovative proposals for job creation.  Rather we are asked to settle for a target that accepts a standstill in the present horrific unemployment levels.  The traditional union veto on the privatisation of our leading commercial State companies &mdash; which extracted an unequivocal commitment from the 1987 Fianna Fáil Government that no such companies would be privatised &mdash; is now effectively withdrawn.  As recently as 1987 the Taoiseach gave an unequivocal commitment to Congress that Fianna Fáil would not lay a finger on our leading State commercial companies.  That traditional veto is now effectively withdrawn.  For short term cosmetic effect we are mortgaging the future of our children.  Why is not some of the capital which the Irish Sugar Company undoubtedly badly needs for expansion and diversification not provided by the Government by diverting some of the hundreds of millions of £s doled out in grants to private industries?  Always there is capital available for good investment.  The Irish Sugar Company should be developed as a national food champion.</P>
    <P>How can a Government seriously claim &mdash; as the Government have done &mdash; following the recent publication of the second triennial report on industrial performance that they have finally taken on board the lessons of Telesis ten years ago to encourage the development of a significant strong indigenous sector in this economy?  How can they make that claim and at the same time be prepared to sell of one of our most successful indigenous companies which will mean that, in all probability control will pass outside of this country?  Of course the Irish Sugar Company are not the only company lined up for privatisation.</P>
    <P>This programme is more than a pay agreement.  It is also a political proposal. In so far as the programme purports to deal with important political economic and social issues surely it is appropriate that this House should express its independent assessment of those issues?</P>
    <P>As a trade unionist I have had the opportunity to express my view on the pay terms which generally may just about <Col N="918" /> protect living standards but show little positive discrimination in favour of the lower paid.  I can readily envisage the quagmire that faces trade union negotiators on clause 3 when they begin to negotiate the floating 3 per cent, a clause which begins extraordinarily with the word &ldquo;exceptionally&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The performance of the public service group of unions in the pay context warrants admiration.  Unfortunately, it is not similarly apparent that those looking after the interests of the lower paid were as committed, well informed or prepared. I do not blame the trade unions for not securing a national minimum wage.  But I can blame the Government for not, at a minimum, including a more serious commitment to tackling poverty in our society by enshrining even a long term commitment to a statutory minimum wage.  This is a political matter.  The House should not endorse the Government's refusal to legislate against some of the more outrageous exploitation of low-paid workers, especially women. Neither should the House endorse the worsening of the early retirement/ redeployment proposals negotiated during the term of the 1987 <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Serving postal workers are now in the front line.  From a trade union viewpoint the proposals on early retirement/redeployment had a good deal of merit not least the prohibition on compulsory redundancy.  That appears to have been withdrawn as far as State commercial companies are concerned.</P>
    <P>This is a deceptive document, cleverly drafted, highly conditional, occasionally evasive, often vague and misleading.  The House is asked to make an independent assessment of the merits of the political programme it sets out which my party cannot support for the reasons I have stated.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>I am circulating in the form of a statement information on the number of inquiries of various kinds undertaken by tourists and others in the Genealogical Office in 1990 and the income arising from them.</P>
      <P>Arising from the work of the Task Force on Genealogy and Tourism which I established in 1988, the Irish Genealogical Project is progressing satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>The project draws together all those with a legitimate interest in Genealogy in Ireland and, in particular, the work of some 35 local centres operating on an all-island basis across the 32 countries.</P>
      <P>Supporting funds have been provided by the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund and the International Fund for Ireland which has contributed £1.5 million for computers.</P>
      <P>The Irish Genealogical Project provides the vehicle for all concerned to contribute to developing genealogy coherently both in its own right and in its value for tourism.  These centres will, also, provide a new valuable service to the professional and commercial genealogical interests who will supplement the work of the centres by their expert genealogical knowledge.</P>
      <P>In the local centres, genealogical records will be computerised.  There will be marketing campaigns both to attract people of Irish descent around the world to visit Ireland to find out about their family origins from these records and to attract Irish people at home to use the centres.</P>
      <P>The computers are already in place in 22 county centres and will be in place in all 35 centres by the end of March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the time is now right publicly to launch the Irish Genealogical Project <Col N="923" /> on a formal basis and I propose to do this in the week before Saint Patrick's Day.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the project is now well organised to make a significant contribution to our national life and to tourism development.  It is particularly gratifying that it is organised on an all-Ireland basis since our genealogical records and roots extend over the whole island.</P>

    <P>The remaining number of tickets were issued as day tickets, three days max., and of this number (3,738) a total of 1,518 were issued for genealogical research purposes.  As expected the summer months produced the highest number of genealogical researchers.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I am very pleased that the matter is being met in a very positive way.  Would the Taoiseach agree that this is a unique service in the sense that it is the only authenticated office of the sort in European terms and that it could be of tremendous value for tourism here if it was developed, particularly in the American market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree with the Deputy.  That is the whole purpose of the project.  I am glad that it is coming along very well.  It will fulfil the purposes which we have in mind for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will fund the day-to-day expenses of the centres?  When will the information contained in the registry of births and deaths, available on gravestones and in records of land-holdings be finally entered into the computerised records which are now being established?  What will be the relationship between those who are already providing a service of this kind on a commercial <Col N="926" /> basis, and the new centres which presumably are to be supported by the State? Will there be clear areas of demarcation so that there will not be unfair competition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's latter point has been satisfactorily resolved. There will be co-operation.  This project is a vehicle for all concerned to contribute to developing genealogy coherently in its own right, and for tourism.  That involves those who are professionally involved in the genealogical service.  With regard to the other aspect of Deputy Bruton's question, the funding of these centres will be a matter for my Department.  We accept of course that we can secure other funds for that purpose and I am not in a position to give the Deputy a date in relation to the other aspect of his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the establishment of a centre would not solve the problem of providing the necessary information to a particular inquirer unless and until that centre had on computer the actual information which must be entered into the computer, having been drawn from gravestones, registries of land holding, births, marriages, deaths and so forth?  Would the Taoiseach further agree that irrespective of opening the centres with a lot of fanfare, if the information is not available on computer at the time of opening it could lead to potential disappointment rather than the undoubted satisfaction which I have no doubt the Taoiseach wishes to achieve?  I am asking this question simply to elicit information.  I compliment the Taoiseach on his initiative in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The computers are already in place in 22 county centres and will soon be in place in all 35.  Then it is necessary to keep adding to the value of the information available on the computers. I will convey Deputy Bruton's concern to the project authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important <Col N="927" /> matter.  On the occassion of the Australian bicentennial celebrations, the Taoiseach made a very comprehensive gift to the Australian people in terms of information about emigrants and deportees from this country.  In the context of the development of tourism in the American market, is it proposed to expand that in the context of those who had to emigrate to America?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There will be a major international dimension to this operation.  We will have an international marketing campaign to draw the services of these centres to the attention of the Irish community around the world, especially in the United States.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the point might soon be reached in respect of the situation in the Gulf where face to face discussion should occur at short notice between President Gorbachev and President Bush to remove any misunderstandings in respect of the proposals now being made to achieve peace and also to facilitate the building of a post-war structure of peace in the Middle East?  Would the Taoiseach further agree that Shannon Airport is a particularly good, secure location for such discussion, being equidistant between the two capitals, Washington and Moscow?  In view of Ireland's concern to achieve peace in the Gulf, would he consider repeating his invitation to both Presidents with a view to facilitating the peace process in any way he can?</P>

    <Col N="928" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy knows that the summit proposed was postponed for a number of reasons but it is still on the cards.  We are certainly in the market for holding that postponed summit between President Gorbachev and President Bush.  Our interest in hosting such a meeting is well known and is kept alive in both capitals.  In view of what the Deputy says, I will be glad to reactivate interest in it in any way I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is aware of the difficulties of communication that exist between the parties in this war.  I refer to logistical difficulties, in the sense that people have to fly from one country to another to convey information about a recent modification of a proposal and so forth.  Would the Taoiseach agree that the solution of misunderstandings which might arise in these rather complicated lines of communication might well lie in a face to face discussion between the two leaders? Would he agree, therefore, to upgrade his efforts to have such a summit take place and give those efforts an added urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am firmly convinced of the value of face to face discussions at all levels, particularly at the highest level of international affairs.  During the Irish Presidency of the EC I was particularly struck and impressed by the value of meeting one's opposite number face to face and having a good personal discussion. It is extraordinary how many difficulties can be ironed out in that way and how frequently problems are permitted to arise at lower echelons which very often the heads of State and Government are completely unaware of.  I am a total advocate of meetings between heads of State and Government as often as possible. I will certainly keep that in mind in our efforts to offer Shannon as a host centre for any meetings between President Bush and President Gorbachev or any other meetings of that nature that might be on offer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The best answer to the problem of involuntary emigration is the creation of employment in this country: as indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> this is a primary policy objective of Government.</P>
      <P>The activities of the relevant Departments, according to the expertise and resources available to them, are focused on the problem of emigration.  At my initiative, an Inter-Departmental Committee on Emigration was established some time ago.  The committee is under the chairmanship of the Department of Foreign Affairs, with representatives of the Departments of Labour, Finance, Education, Health, Social Welfare and the Environment.</P>
      <P>Further, a range of advisory and information services for intending emigrants and those already abroad is provided by the Department of Labour through FÁS and by the Department of Education through their funding of youth organisations offering emigration advice.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware of results of the action of the Government in the United States to achieve legislative reform and in bringing together the various organisations working there so as to provide a network of advice and welfare services for our citizens in New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco.  In the United Kingdom funding for emigrant welfare services has been co-ordinated for many years through the DÍON Committee.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I do not believe that the appointment of a Minister of State in this area is required.</P>

      <P>In view of the great number of emigrants during the past ten years, would the Taoiseach not agree that they deserve to have somebody who has special responsibility for them?  Although we have an interdepartmental committee it would not seem to be adequate, judging <Col N="930" /> from the responses I am getting from emigrants, especially in London, regarding our country's response to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to be complacent about the problem, but the Deputy will have to agree that we have been making major efforts on behalf of emigrants, particularly in Britain and the United States.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has very specific responsibilities through our diplomatic service both in the United States and Great Britain and the Minister for Labour also has a very specific responsibility.  Between those two Ministers I believe the best possible efforts are being made.  Perhaps to appoint a junior Minister would be to downgrade the problem.  It is a problem that is dealt with constantly at ministerial and even Government level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of a director for the marine emergency service is a matter for the Civil Service Commissioners.  I understand from their Office that they hope to advertise the post next week.</P>
      <P>I am happy to inform the House that the Government have approved the acceptance of a tender for the provision of a search and rescue helicopter service at Shannon.  Subject to agreement on the detail of the contract, regulatory clearance and the provision of necessary support facilities, I hope that the helicopter service can commence as soon as the necessary regulatory approvals are in place.  I expect that to be in the course of summer 1991.  While the invitation to tender requested plans for a January 1991 commencement, it was clear that none of the tenderers could meet that deadline if prudent requirements for airport facilities, training and familiarisation of crew are to be observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that the Air Corps have an excellent record of service in helicopter operations.  The Government intend to extend the Air Corps search and rescue service by <Col N="932" /> deploying Dauphin helicopters to Finner, Co. Donegal, and Cork.  The mediumrange contract helicopter service will supplement, not supplant, the Air Corps service by providing a service beyond the range of the Dauphin helicopter.  In my view, therefore, it is wrong to characterise the contract arrangement as privatisation. The Review Group on Air/Sea Rescue Services recommended as an interim measure that a contract helicopter be hired because of the delay inherent in purchase and delivery of an aircraft for Air Corps use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister share the disappointment of all Members of this House that the Civil Service Commission are only about to embark on advertising for the appointment of a director of the Irish Marine Emergency Services which was promised on 2 August 1990?  In view of the positive response with which that announcement was greeted by people involved in the fishing industry particularly and in view of the fact that a very strong case has been made in regard to the urgent and continuous need for a helicopter base in the western fishing ports, and also in the light of recent tragedies where safety or lack of safety was pivotal to the said tragedies, is it not a matter of grave seriousness to all of us that we will still have not commenced the implementation of these two provisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's disappointment with regard to the delay. However, I want to assure the House that the Department have proceeded with all possible speed.  We invited the tenders which we then had to examine.  We found that we were somewhat optimistic with regard to time but the appointment for the contract helicopter will be in place when that contract has been placed.</P>

      <P>In the light of the record of 537 lives saved in 1,493 rescue missions, would the Minister not agree that the Air Corps should be the unit to carry on search and rescue operations in this area?  Would the Minister not agree that funding given to the Air Corps would be far more beneficial than putting the service out to private tender as the Minister has indicated he is doing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to repeat what I said to the Deputy.  The service is being supplemented rather than supplanted. The whole purpose of inviting tenders for the medium range helicopters was speed. My Department are quite satisfied that this is the only way and it is the way recommended by the Doherty Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The saving of human life is the responsibility of the Government and giving the service to a private company to operate is shedding our responsibility.  I suggest that the Minister is downgrading the Air Corps by having them as a supplementary service rather than the main service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the suggestion that there is any question of downgrading. The full strength of the Air Corps' rescue service was assessed and appreciated and they will play a big role in search and rescue in the future.</P>

For instance, there is damage estimated at £700,000 to a farm at Killybegs and losses of £1.1 million worth of fish and equipment in Connemara.  It was suggested by certain of the fishing organisations that have been in touch with me and with the Minister that money might be available from the European Community to aid Community populations who are victims of a catastrophe.  In the context of job potential and environmental protection we could classify this storm damage as a catastrophe. Has the Minister approached the European Community along those lines?</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if he has had further discussions with the EC Fisheries Commissioner since the quota negotiations at the beginning of December 1990; if there is any possibility of securing additional tonnage in the traditional species, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas for 1991 were agreed following a series of lengthy and difficult negotiations at the Council of Fisheries Ministers, which was held in Brussels on 19 and 20 December 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At these negotiations, I secured actual increases for 1991 in quotas for a number of traditional species, i.e. mackerel, hake and sole.  In many other cases quotas were maintained at 1990 levels.  Where, on the basis of the scientific advice available, substantial reductions in TACs proved necessary for other important stocks, I successfully invoked the Hague Compromise which ensured that Ireland received preferential treatment when the <Col N="936" /> reduced TAC was being distributed. When viewed in the context of the large scale reductions in TAC proposed for the various fish stocks in the Community generally, Ireland's achievements at the December Council were commendable.</P>
    <P>The TACs and quotas for 1991 have been agreed, and, except where, on the basis of new scientific advice, a revision seems warranted, there is no provision for these to be changed.  I will of course, be pursuing with the Commission and the Council any opportunity for increases in such quotas which may arise from any new scientific advice which becomes available.  However, in relation to one aspect of the agreed TACs and quotas for 1991, the so-called eight day rule, whereby cod and haddock boats were compelled to tie up for eight consecutive days every month, I am pleased to inform the House that I have secured a derogation from this rule for Irish fishermen.</P>
    <P>As regards the future for Irish fishermen, my Department are always working to secure a maximum allocation of resources for the Irish industry. Officials of my Department, along with industry representatives, met with the Fisheries Director-General, Mr. Almeida-Serra, when he visited Ireland recently.  Mr. Van de Poele, the Head of the Commission Task Force on the Review of the Common Fisheries Policy is currently in Ireland, for discussions with officials and industry representatives. On both occasions, the opportunity has been taken to make the case for the allocation of additional resources for Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not urgent and essential that the Minister renew his efforts to increase our quota when considered in the context of fishermen's livelihoods and the difficulties they are experiencing in meeting repayments on their boats? There is a general feeling among those in the fishing industry that Ireland has not got a fair share of the quota considering that the fishing waters of Ireland represent 25 per cent of the European Community waters and we have only 4 per cent quota.  What hope can the Minister <Col N="937" /> offer for increased job creation in this area of vast potential if these constraints are allowed to continue not alone without being challenged but being overwhelmed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the existing system of allocation of quotas derives from the Common Fisheries Policy which was worked out in 1983.  There are two words in the regulations which are basic to the whole fisheries policy, they are &ldquo;relative stability&rdquo;.  They are quoted by the Commission at me and everybody else in this context regularly at Council meetings.  As I have indicated, if scientific evidence becomes available mid year, it is possible to get an increase in the quota.  If such scientific evidence becomes available to me I will be applying for an increase in the quotas in 1991.  The scientific evidence is essential and, as I indicated, we succeeded in raising the herring quota in the Celtic Sea by reason of research done by our own scientific fisheries officers.  We succeeded in raising the quota available because the scientific evidence we had was somewhat more recent than that which the Commission had.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that if scientific evidence becomes available to me on any of the species whether pelagic or demersal I will be trying for increased quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if all efforts are being made to extract that scientific evidence particularly in view of the review of fisheries policy and the further settlements that will be taking place in Europe regarding the future of fisheries? Is it not urgent that the scientific evidence is not only received as quickly as possible but used at European level? Not only do we raise the issue of quotas at the Council of Fisheries Ministers but there is a review of the fishing industry taking place and Ireland has a chance, perhaps the last chance in an integrated European market, to get a fairer share of the allocations?</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that the recent prohibition order signed by him preventing the removal of sand from Ballybunion beach, County Kerry is adequate; and whether such order is enforceable given the existence of an agreement between the Minister and local farmers, signed in 1977, which allows said farmers to remove sand from the Ballybunion beach.</Quest>

      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am empowered under section 6 of the Foreshore Act, 1933 to introduce prohibitory orders in respect of a particular area of foreshore, after which beach material may not be removed other than in accordance with a licence issued by my Department under the Act.  A prohibitory order is usually introduced in response to a request from the relevant local authority, although that is not a statutory requirement.</P>
      <P>In November last, in response to a request from Kerry County Council, and having considered the matter, I introduced the Foreshore (Prohibition of Removal of Beach Material) (No. 2 Order), 1990 in respect of Ballybunion beach.  This order was designed to be more effective than the 1975 Ballybunion Beach Order, which it replaced, by virtue of the more extensive area it covered, and due to its remaining in force throughout the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> In accordance with the terms of the Act, the 1990 order could not invalidate the foreshore licence granted in 1977 to the trustees of a committee of the farmers of six parishes in north Kerry.  This licence authorises the removal of beach material from Ballybunion, subject to certain conditions, and is due to expire on 31 December 1995.  I am at present reviewing the operation of that licence in which connection there have been discussions between my Department and local representatives.</P>
    <P>I am concerned by reports that those acting under the 1977 licence may be causing serious damage to this fine amenity, and am therefore having its utilisation and impact investigated to determine if its provisions have been breached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me thank the Minister for his very comprehensive reply and can I assure him that I share the concern he expressed in the latter part of his response at the destruction that is taking place on Ballybunion beach.  May I clarify with the Minister whether at the time of signing the most recent order, No. 2 of 1990, in response to the request from Kerry County Council, the Minister and his officials were aware of the 1975 licence?  Was the intention at that time to place a complete prohibition on the removal of sand from Ballybunion beach?  If that was not the case may I ask the Minister how soon he expects to be able to make a decision, which is necessary to protect this very fine amenity in north Kerry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department were aware of the licence mentioned in my reply.  There were discussions about it in 1974 and 1975 and, finally, the licence issued in 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to say is &mdash; and this was made quite clear to the local representatives when we spoke to them &mdash; that if I receive concrete evidence that the conditions of the licence have been breached, I will have no hesitation whatsoever in taking effective action.  It is <Col N="940" /> important that I have that information and that evidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister appreciates the gravity and serious concern that is expressed at local level. Nevertheless, will the Minister confirm that a deputation of local people sought meetings with him on a number of occasions which have not been granted? Will the Minister meet a deputation of local people as soon as possible?  May I ask the Minister if in his capacity as Minister for the Marine he has taken steps or made any inquiries about the abuse of the licence which is taking place in the locality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I have made such inquiries and that a deputation of local people has been received in my Department.  It is not as if we have been ignoring them.  The type of evidence I want is strong evidence, such as affidavits, sworn statements, and so on from anyone who witnessed a breach of the conditions of the licence which was issued in 1977.  If I get that I will be able to take effective action and take it quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister in his own Department is well aware of the difficulties in small villages in this country in relation to similar matters.

I should also like to say to the local representatives here that nationally we view the removal of sand as a breach of every environmental protection rule.  The area in question is one of great beauty and is precious to all of us, even those of us who do not reside in Kerry but who at times have had the pleasure of viewing Ballybunion beach and availing of it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. Everybody, it seems, has visited Ballybunion. It is not merely the damage to the beach I am concerned about but the down-the-road damage that results to an important tourist town where there is a magnificent golf course.  The original idea in granting a licence was to enable people with horse carts to take away some small amount of sand for their own agricultural purposes but now JCBs and so on are removing huge amounts of sand.  This simply will have to stop but we have to put in place the proper legal base for stopping it.</P>

Also, when the Minister signed the order revoking the 1975 prohibition order why did he not take this licence into consideration?

      <P>I will read out my note here in which I have confidence.  The objective of the 1977 foreshore licence issued by the Department of Tourism and Transport was to give effect to an agreement reached in 1974 between representatives of the local farming community, Ballybunion Development Company and Ballybunion Golf Club.  There is no question of the Minister of the day or his officials engaging in secret deals as has been suggested.</P>

      <P>My Department do not have an estimate of the cost of repairs arising from coastal erosion in each coastal county for the years 1985 to 1991.</P>
      <P>The expenditure from the Vote for the Office of Public Works in the period 1985 to 1989 and by my Department, from 1990 to 14 February 1991, on coast protection, was as stated in the tabular statement I am circulating in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>In the years 1985 to 1989, the cost of coast protection maintenance works, undertaken by the Office of Public Works, was recoverable, in accordance with the provisions of the Coast Protection Act, 1963, from the relevant local authorities.</P>
      <P>Local authorities may include provision for coast protection in their estimates prepared in the context of their rate support grant funding from the Department of the Environment.  However, neither the Department of the Environment nor my Department have details of the amounts spent by the local authorities on coast protection.</P>
      <P>My Department's policy is to facilitate the implementation of permanent coast protection schemes, where warranted.  In particular, studies are continuing into the erosion problems at Bray and at Rosslare Strand with a view to advancing proposals for undertaking worthwhile protection schemes at both locations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with the scientific evidence indicating that coastal erosion is becoming an increasing problem because of the rise in the level of waters in the world's seas and oceans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is evidence to suggest that there is a rise in water levels. This is supposed to be due to the melting of ice in the polar regions.  The weather we have had since Christmas would not lead me to believe that such water was created in that way in the locality recently.  It is a scientific fact that water levels have risen and this will, of course, add to the problems of erosion and flooding in sea areas.</P>

      <P>We do not have the benefit of the tabular statement to which the Minister referred.  Would he accept that the total amount spent in coastal protection over the past five or ten years has been very small, that the Coast Protection Act, 1963, has been virtually unworkable and that there are proposals for coast protection schemes under that Act which cannot be advanced because of a lack of finance for example, the proposal made by Dublin County Council in 1979 for a coast protection scheme for the south County Dublin coastline which cannot be advanced because of a lack of funds?  Would he agree that it is necessary to amend the 1963 Coast Protection Act to provide additional resources to support it?</P>

I received a communication from Kerry County Council and I think there is a scheme for the Magharees which is regarded as satisfactory to prevent that peninsula from splitting in two.  The question has been answered already in the larger context: it is a matter for the local authorities and my Department have a certain role, which they intend to play.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that since their establishment in January 1989 the Free Port Advisory Committee have met on eight occasions.  The costs involved in marketing and promoting the Free Port are met by the IDA, Cork Harbour Commissioners and local interests.</P>
      <P>Ringaskiddy Free Port is being vigorously promoted and marketed &mdash; this is evidenced by the fact that in 1989/90 site visits to Ringaskiddy were undertaken by a total of 65 companies.  Regrettably, to date, there are only four companies and one subsidiary company operating in the Free Port.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>At the request of the Free Port authority we have been encouraging the Industrial Development Authority, whose duty it is to promote the Free Port area as a location for industry.  As I have indicated, there have been plenty of inquiries and people have been shown the facilities both by IDA and the Free Port authority but as yet no industry has applied to my Department for a licence under section 5 of the Free Port Act, 1986.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was made clear when the Free Ports Act was going though the House that it would not necessarily resolve all the problems of the area and that many of the free ports which were established in Britain and the <Col N="949" /> United States did not result in any great improvements in Industrial development at that time.  It is a question of selling the port strongly.  The facilities are magnificent in that area and I have been assured by the Industrial Development Authority that they are pushing that site as competently and as industriously as they can.</P>

      <Quest>the number of marine search or rescue missions carried out by helicopters of the Air Corps during November and December 1990 and to date in 1991; the number of occasions on which the RAF had to be called in because of the Air Corps inability to respond; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>During the period in question Air Corps helicopters responded to 17 call-outs for marine search and rescue. On one of these occasions the Air Corps Dauphin helicopter was unable to complete the mission within the endurance of the helicopter due to severe swell, and had to abandon the rescue attempt.  The mission was subsequently completed by an RAF Seaking.</P>
      <P>On three other occasions the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre, MRCC, asked the RAF to carry out marine search and rescue missions in Irish waters because the missions were beyond the range of the Air Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One one other occasion, the MRCC asked an RAF helicopter to carry out a mission off the Wexford coast which, although within the range of the Air <Col N="951" /> Corps Dauphin helicopter, was geographically much closer to the RAF base.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I make that five occasions on which the RAF service was sought.  In reply to an earlier question the Minister said that the new arrangements for search and rescue would commence during the summer of 1991.  May I ask him if those arrangements will be sufficient in future to deal with the range which was required to invite in the RAF, so that we will not have to depend on their services?  Second, when will the 24 hour service be introduced?  I understand that the service to be introduced in the summer is only the day time service. When does the Minister intend to introduce&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be the case from the summer of 1991, but there is a possibility, as I outlined in my reply, that, for example, a rescue would have to be effected quite near the Royal Air Force and co-operation between our Air Corps and the Royal Air Force is so good that it is quite possible that the Royal Air Force might be employed for a rescue <Col N="953" /> operation that is nearer to them, and <i>vice versa</i>.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is in existence, under the aegis of my Department, a marine emergency response team (MERT).  The team which is chaired and vice-chaired by an assistant secretary and chief or deputy chief surveyor of my Department, respectively, has overall responsibility for the planning, co-ordination and monitoring of the national response to a marine emergency.  The key tasks of the team are to give advice to the Minister on the appropriate response to a particular emergency and to ensure the availability of the expertise and resources necessary to respond to changing circumstances.</P>
      <P>There is also a pollution operations group which is activated by MERT if there is a major spillage or threat of spillage of oil or other polluting substance which could cause damage to the marine environment.  That group have overall responsibility for the direction and control of operations at the scene of an incident. Their key objectives are to prevent any escape of oil or to contain any oil already escaped and to minimise the environmental damage.  The chairman of the group acts as on-scene commander at the location of the incident and is also a member of MERT.  All members of the group have either a maritime background with pollution combating experience or appropriate planning experience.  The pollution operations group were activated last February and successfully directed operations when the bulk carrier <i>Tribulus</i> with 122,000 tonnes of iron ore on board limped into Bantry Bay taking water and leaking oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> The national emergency plan for dealing with pollution incidents around our coasts includes a list of the anti-pollution equipment which is available within Ireland.  This list includes oil-booms, skimmers and other means of recovering oil from the surface of the sea, sorbent materials, beach cleaning equipment, etc.  This equipment is held in stock by maritime local authorities and harbour authorities.  The current status and condition of our stocks of equipment is being reviewed and plans to purchase new equipment are in train in order to improve our pollution combating capability. In accordance with normal EC practice, Ireland would have recourse to any oil pollution combating equipment held by our EC neighbours in the case of an emergency.</P>

      <P>I accept the information the Minister has given regarding the committee who respond to oil spills and advise on the expertise and resources necessary.  I am glad to hear that a review is being carried out at present along the whole coast line.  Do the Department and the Minister know exactly what expertise and resources are available at each maritime port, or will they have to await the results of the review?  Could we find ourselves in an emergency without the necessary resources?  How soon does the Minister expect this review to be completed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the information and we know exactly what is available. Of course such things as skimmers, booms and so on, are mobile and can be switched when there is an emergency. That is what happened in the case of the <i>Tribulus</i> when there was the added danger to mussel farming in Bantry Bay. Everybody concerned in that case, including the company who own the ship, deserve congratulations for the success of that venture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>In answer to a similar question raised on the Adjournment on 6 February I indicated that senior officials of my Department had been in continuous contact with Dublin Port and Sealink since the Sealink announcement.  Further discussions have taken place between representatives of Sealink, who provide the container handling facilities, Railfreight distribution, who provide the actual service, Dublin Port and officials of my Department.  I expect that these contacts will continue to take place with the relevant interested parties until the issues raised by the Sealink announcement have been satisfactorily resolved. The Deputies will, of course, appreciate that I cannot divulge the exact contents of these discussions involving as they do negotiations between competing commercial concerns.</P>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for access transport as far as ports are concerned, I am very concerned at the possibility that a lo-lo facility capable of handling 500,000 tonnes of unitised cargo annually would cease operations.  I would like to repeat the assurance given by me to this House already that I will do my utmost to facilitate a continuation of lo-lo operations at the Sealink terminal in Dublin Port, whether they are carried on by Sealink, or by another operator.  In this regard I have made my concern known to Sealink who have indicated a willingness to facilitate this objective and are in active discussions with Dublin Port concerning their lease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that this is the only load on-load off facility between Dublin and Britain, which is of vital strategic importance to Irish importers and exporters?  As the Minister said, it involves 500,000 tonnes of cargo per year and £1 million in revenue to Dublin Port; 50 jobs are involved. Is the Minister aware that, when the information became available that this business would transfer to Belfast, Mr. John Needham, the Minister of State for Trade in the North, expressed great <Col N="957" /> pleasure at this amount of business coming to Belfast?  He took a personal interest in it and visited the terminal there.  Will the Minister give us an assurance that he will show an equal interest and perhaps visit the facility in Dublin Port?  Will he take a personal role in the issue and bring it to a satisfactory conclusion because, I am sure if he does&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I also accept the importance of the preservation of the 50 jobs.  I do not know anything about the activities of Mr. Needham &mdash; past or present &mdash; but I have no doubt that I will be able to match them, whatever they may be.

      <P>Will the Minister accept the longer a decison is put off, that more traffic will drift to Belfast?  Will he also agree that this arbitrary decision taken by Sealink has serious repercussions for Irish trade?  This happened without prior consultation with the Minister's Department or with Dublin Port.  This is unacceptable in view of the fact that the Government provide Sealink with terminal facilities on an ongoing basis for their freight and passenger service at Dún Laoghaire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there was not any consultation because I got the press release on 24 January, the day the announcement was made.  The problem was between Sealink and Railfreight Distribution, a subsidiary of British Rail. Railfreight Distribution told them they were not continuing the business with <Col N="958" /> Sealink.

    <Title>Programme for Economic and Social Progress: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Taoiseach on Tuesday, 19 February 1991:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approved the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Notes that the Government has concluded an agreement with the social partners on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.</P>
    <P>Notes the Fine Gael proposal of January 1989 for a National Forum for 1992 involving all the Oireachtas political parties together with the social partners in the long term economic and social planning.</P>
    <P>Affirms its support for the concept of social partnership as a means of promoting long term economic and social development.</P>
    <P>Congratulates the social partners on reaching agreement on pay levels over the next three years.</P>
    <P>Regrets that the current Programme was drafted without any involvement of Oireachtas Éireann or of elected representatives generally, apart from some members of the Cabinet, and that many interests in society, notably young people, dependent spouses, the homeless, the unemployed and the non-agricultural self-employed, were not represented in direct discussions on the Programme.</P>
    <P>Regrets that the provisions in the Programme in regard to the health service will have the effect of increasing <Col N="1060" /> the pressure on hospital beds and of lengthening queues for services.</P>
    <P>Regrets the fact that the Government's 1991 Budget is not consistent with the achievement of the fiscal targets set in the Programme, and that the Programme omits essential information as to how the spending and tax commitments contained in it are to be reconciled with the target of broad balance on the current Budget.</P>
    <P>Stresses its alarm that the economic projections in the Programme, and the policies of the Government as expressed in the Programme, will not lead to any reduction in the level of unemployment or emigration, and may well increase both, and that the industrial policies in the Programme are not the ones best suited to establishing research-intensive autonomous industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Regrets that the particular income tax proposals in the Programme make no provision at all to widen the tax bands and thereby to reduce the excessively high marginal tax rates facing low and middle income workers.</P>
    <P>Regrets that the Programme contains no commitment to long term structural reform, with a view to creating employment, in areas such as tax policy, food and agricultural policy, the public service, education and social welfare.</P>
    <P>and in view of the foregoing, directs the Government to establish an Economic and Social Committee of Oireachtas Éireann, involving members of all recognised groups, which would:</P>
    <P>1.  review the content of the Programme;</P>
    <P>2.  put forward remedies for its deficiencies;</P>
    <P>3.  nominate representatives of Oireachtas Éireann to sit on the National Economic and Social Council;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> 4.  discuss how the Programme ought to be adjusted in the event of the assumptions for growth and tax revenue underlying it not being reached;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The last four years have seen a dramatic turnabout in the economic situation of this country.  This did not just happen.  It was due, for the most part, to the success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which brought about a unique national consensus on the management of our economic affairs and provided substantial benefits in all areas of the economy.</P>
      <P>We are now entering a further stage in the economic and social development of this country.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, which is set in a ten year framework, will help consolidate the good work begun in 1987 and will continue the national consensus approach to the implementation of economic and social policies.  It will gear us to take full advantage of the opportunities of the nineties and leave us with a strong and vibrant economy ready to face into the 21st century with confidence and real hope in the future of our nation.</P>
      <P>I cannot over-emphasise the importance of maintaining this consensus approach throughout the decade.  We can make progress only if we have a situation in which all interests operate in harmony and work towards common goals.  I believe that this is now fully appreciated by the social partners and that they will play their full part in making this programme as successful as its predecessor. It is only with the co-operation of all that we will achieve the growth necessary to sustain the major initiatives envisaged in the social policy area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For their part, the Government will not be found wanting in implementing <Col N="1062" /> their obligations under the programme. The recent budget provides early evidence of this.  It underpins the Government's commitment to the economic and social principles charted in the programme by providing additional funds this year for much needed infrastructural facilities and for health, social welfare, housing and education, while at the same time maintaining progress on tax reform.</P>
    <P>Time constaints do not allow me to elaborate on these general remarks. Instead, I will concentrate on some major areas covered in the programme which come within my remit as Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Only last week I published the &ldquo;Plan for Social Housing&rdquo; which contains details of a wide range of new housing measures of benefit to households from the lowest income groups to those on the margins of home ownership.  The fundamental principles underlying the plan are to improve access to housing, to widen housing options, to encourage self-help and voluntary and community efforts, to conserve and utilise the existing housing stock and to enhance tenants' rights whether in the private or local authority sector.  These new measures represent a shift away from our traditional reliance on local authority housing as the principal means of meeting social housing needs.</P>
    <P>The new measures include a new system of shared ownership, with the occupant owning half the equity from the start and with the other half being rented from the local authority until it too can be acquired; a new rental subsidy scheme in respect of the occupants of voluntary housing and substantial improvements to the existing scheme; a scheme for the improvement of existing housing as an alternative to the provision of new local authority housing; a &ldquo;low start&rdquo; mortgage allowance for tenants and tenant purchasers leaving local authority dwellings and buying their own by way of a mortgage loan; improved terms for local authority house purchase and improvement loans; provision of sites by local authorities on nominal terms; incentives for the provision of private rented accommodation; and more tenant involvement <Col N="1063" /> in the local authority sector and greater tenants' rights in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Home ownership &mdash; now at 80 per cent &mdash; has been the key to the success of housing policy in this country.  The new system of shared ownership will build on that by allowing marginal households to acquire full ownership of their homes in stages.  It is aimed at households with an income under £12,000, and in order to ensure affordability a rent subsidy will be available to those earning less than £10,000 a year.</P>
    <P>The voluntary housing scheme operated by local authorities, with finance from my Department, has been very successful in recent years.  Nevertheless, I believe that there is a need to develop alternative approaches to the provision of voluntary housing.  For this reason, I am introducing, initially on a pilot basis, a rental subsidy scheme in respect of accommodation provided by approved voluntary housing organisations for low income households.  The idea is that the subsidy plus the rental income from the dwellings will allow the organisations to service their borrowings and maintain and manage the dwellings.</P>
    <P>The new tenants' mortgage allowance is another important new scheme, but I want to make it clear from the outset that I do not see this scheme as a repeat of the £5,000 &ldquo;surrender grant&rdquo;, the illeffects of which in certain areas are well known.  The proposed allowance is not an &ldquo;up front&rdquo; cash grant but is designed to give tenants or tenant purchasers genuinely wishing to move to private housing the advantages of a &ldquo;low start&rdquo; type mortgage.  I will be keeping its operation under close observation to ensure that it has no unintended effects.</P>
    <P>On top of the new measures, not all of which I can deal with today, I am pleased that additional finance has been provided this year for the local authority housing programme.  The capital provision for the programme in 1991 is £69 million &mdash; an increase of £18 million, or over 35 per cent, on the 1990 outturn.  This will enable us to push up the number of starts to 1,500, to maintain good progress on <Col N="1064" /> remedial works to substandard local authority estates and, very importantly, to start a new sub-programme costing £2 million this year aimed at ensuring that no tenant of a local authority dwelling is without proper bathroom facilities.</P>
    <P>As stated in the plan, I believe that the various new measures combined should, when under full steam, be capable of producing 5,000 units a year.  If this is realised, and assuming a continuation of the existing programmes and vacancies at current levels, we should be catering for at least 10,000 households a year.  It will, of course, take some time to build up to that.</P>
    <P>Most of the measures in the plan involve new legislation and a Housing Bill is, therefore, being prepared as a matter of urgency.  However, with the help of the local authorities, I will be striving to get things moving in advance of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The fact that there are over 100,000 dwellings in the private rented sector demonstrates the importance of this sector in the overall housing system. Rented dwellings are necessary to cater for those who do not wish to become home owners or those who, for employment or other reasons, need mobility in their housing arrangements.  The Government have extended for a year the tax incentives for the provision of private rented accommodation throughout the country, and in the designated areas, these section 23 incentives will be maintained generally for a further two years.  Special improvements have been decided on to encourage the refurbishment of private rented accommodation in the designated areas.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government are introducing a whole range of important new safeguards for tenants in the private sector including mandatory rent books, minimum standards applied nationally and improved terms of letting.</P>
    <P>All of these measures should help to secure the vital role of the private rented sector in the housing system over the coming years and will greatly improve the lot of tenants, particularly those at the lower end of the market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> It is generally accepted that the well-being or otherwise of our economy is directly relevant to the construction industry.  Investment and employment in it derive from economic progress.  During much of the eighties the industry was in decline due to the prevailing economic difficulties and employment was down to about 70,000 at the end of 1987.  Since then there have been significant changes in the fortunes of the industry &mdash; changes which were brought about by the general improvement in the economy and more enlightened and prudent management of the public finances from 1987 onwards. Output in the industry increased by 8 per cent in 1989 and by about 10 per cent in 1990.  Direct employment increased in consequence; there was a 10 per cent employment increase or about 7,000 extra jobs between April 1989 and April 1990 and total direct employment should reach 80,000 in 1991.</P>
    <P>The total Public Capital Programme provision for construction activity in 1991 is £1,046 million, an increase of over 7 per cent on the original budget provision for 1990.  The principal increases occur in the following sectors: roads, sanitary services, are being increased by over £16 million; local authority housing programme &mdash; up £18 million; voluntary housing &mdash; up more than £2 million; construction investment in the industrial sector is set to increase by £10 million; tourism-related construction activity will increase by £12 million; and energy &mdash; an increase of £25 million reflecting increased investment by An Bord Gáis.</P>
    <P>The Government appreciate the significant contribution the building industry makes to the economy, especially in relation to employment.  Consequently, we deliberately excluded the industry from the increase in VAT from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  This exemption, together with the increased capital allocations, will assist in boosting construction output this year with favourable implications for employment.</P>
    <P>As to the future, the performance of the industry during the period of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will mirror general economic <Col N="1066" /> progress, which determines the climate for private investment and public expenditure. Having learned the lesson from the eighties, it is important that we get the economic climate correct with low inflation, lower interest rates and reduced public sector borrowing, in order to create the conditions necessary for the industry to operate to maximum capacity.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> reaffirms the Government's commitment to the environment and recognises the compelling reasons for continued investment in environmental protection and improvement.  In short, the Government are committed to implementing policies which will ensure that Ireland's natural environment is fully protected and enhanced for the health, safety and well-being of this and future generations.  The environment action programme outlined our strategy for this decade at an estimated cost of £1,000 million.  Our approach is based on the concept of sustainable development which seeks to ensure a reasonable balance in all our interests between development and the environment.  The principle of precautionary action and the integration of environmental considerations in all policy areas are also vital elements of our strategy.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment in the environment action programme, we have put in place during 1990 amending legislation which significantly strengthens the powers available to local authorities to control and prevent water pollution.  Last year, too, we enacted new legislation to clean up derelict sites and to ensure that planning compensation claims &mdash; or the fear of such claims &mdash; do not force local authorities to back away from their plans to protect amenities and the environment. We will be maintaining the momentum this year, with new legislation on waste.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> involves the creation of effective and efficient structures within which employment growth and economic development can take place.  Similar structural reform will take place in <Col N="1067" /> relation to environmental protection over the course of the programme.  The new Environmental Protection Agency will be the keystone of a new institutional framework within which cohesive and comprehensive strategies for the protection of the environment can be implemented.  The Bill establishing the agency is currently with the Seanad.  The requirement in the programme that a balance be struck between environmental protection and economic development is reflected in the duty placed on the agency in the Bill to ensure that a proper balance is achieved between those two vitally important objectives.</P>
    <P>Roads are a vital element in any transport system.  They are particularly important in our case as a small island nation with a dispersed population pattern on the periphery of Europe.  That is why we have committed ourselves to an investment of £616 million over the five year period 1989 to 1993, of which £416 million will be financed by the EC.  This is the largest ever single transport investment programme undertaken in the history of the State.  It is designed to tackle two fundamental problems in the Irish economy: the high access costs resulting from Ireland's island location on the periphery of mainland Europe; and the poorly developed transport infrastructure hindering development and adding to transport costs.</P>
    <P>Let me say categorically at this stage that projected expenditure on the programme is fully on target and all EC moneys will be drawn down.  I want also to confirm that we have already secured the maximum moneys available for roads under the Structural Funds for 1990.</P>
    <P>I would like to digress for just one moment to refer to some statements made in the recent past by the Managing Director of the Construction Industry Federation when he launched an illinformed tirade on my Department's handling of the roads programme and made suggestions that EC funding approved for the programme might be lost.  Despite a statement from me giving the facts of the situation, he appears from <Col N="1068" /> recent press reports to be continuing with his unwarranted criticism, so let me state briefly what I have already said.  The maximum moneys available for roads under the Structural Funds in 1990 have been secured.  The approved roads programme is fully on target and all EC moneys for roads will be drawn down.  I sincerely hope this is an end to the matter. The outbursts we have witnessed over the last week or so reflect no credit on anyone, and it is especially sad to find them emanating from a source within an industry which is a major beneficiary of the major roads programme to which this Government are fully committed.</P>
    <P>This year we have provided £234 million, £14 million more than 1990 for State road grants, the biggest annual allocation ever made and £201 million is being provided for road improvements, an increase of 7 per cent over 1990.  The maintenance grant is £33 million, an increase of almost 6 per cent.  These grants, in addition to financing on-going works, will enable work to start this year on eight major improvement projects.</P>
    <P>In addition to the increased spending on the national roads, I am pleased to inform the House that the commitment given in the 1989 budget that £150 million would be provided over three years in discretionary grants to county councils for regional and county roads has been more than fulfilled.  In fact, total grants over the three years will amount to £173 million.  These funds supplement provisions totalling some £170 million made by local authorities, from their own resources, over the same period for works on non-national roads.</P>
    <P>Investment of this scale is going to give a major stimulus to the national economy and to the construction industry.  The evidence of the enormous strides that the Government have been making in improving and upgrading the country's roads is there for all to see and I am confident that we will have remedied most of the main deficiencies in the network of national roads within this decade.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like again to pay tribute to the major contribution made by the social partners in the success of <Col N="1069" /> the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  I believe that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> can build on that success and further strengthen the economy while at the same time caring for the less well off members of our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we should be grateful that we are offered an opportunity to say something on this <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  Certainly this House has had no opportunity to have an input into it and that is serious, though I am glad I am not a party to what is in this document. It is a pretty poor document.  If this is our progress for the next three years on the economic and social side it augurs very poorly for the next few years.</P>
      <P>The Government talk about tax reform.  There is no tax reform.  I wish they would stop using the word &ldquo;reform&rdquo;. They are making some minute adjustments in the tax system and they quickly claw them back whether by additional VAT or an additional health charge.  We see again today reports that ESB charges are to be increased.  Yet there is nothing about such hidden charges contained in this <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.</P>
      <P>With regard to tax reform there appears to be a divergance of views on the far side of the House in that the leader of the Progressive Democrats goes along with the budget and the new programme in the House, while externally the chairman of that party appears to be saying something totally different.  It makes me wonder who speaks for whom or for what within that party, what is their policy on tax reform, which appears to be their linchpin.  It would be interesting to know in what direction that party are moving. Perhaps there is a schism developing within that party.  Perhaps they will do the decent thing so that, when a certain Member leaves that side of the House, they will all move over to their former bed when no doubt they will be very happy.</P>

      <P>I am not having a go at anybody.  I am merely pointing out that their party leader says one thing and their chairman another.  I merely wonder who speaks for whom or for what in that area.</P>
      <P>On the health aspect of this programme there appears to be a complete turnaround in that it is now proposed that everybody will have access to consultants and public wards.  When the Minister was questioned about access to public wards and consultants he replied that basically private patients will not use the public health system.  That clearly demonstrates to me that there is no policy on health. Additionally, in the drawing up of this new programme, it appears that it was the trade unionists who wanted a national health service, and that one of the means of achieving that was their putting down a marker for an open-ended national health service we are all aware cannot be afforded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the sphere of education there is very little discussion in this document with regard to the eradication of poverty, particularly the poverty traps obtaining. Given the contents of this programme and the people who sat around the table in drafting it it is surprising there was not greater emphasis placed on the elimination of poverty traps.  Surely the best method of so doing would be by a proper educational programme, particularly within such poverty-stricken areas now easily targeted within society.  There is no reason for there not being a distinct educational policy to tackle such poverty traps within this programme, indeed the composition of the present Government <Col N="1071" /> should be affording people an opportunity of sharing in all aspects of education.</P>
    <P>The same applies to training and FÁS. People are drifting in and out of courses of 12 months' duration, and emerging in much the same condition as when they began, not trained although they may have gained some little experience.  It is time training overall was examined objectively, moved into the area of vocational education which is its proper location.  Young people should be trained in some skill even if it entails a two-year course.  At least we should ensure that, on completion of such a course, if they must emigrate, they will have a skill or asset to market.  We must ensure that they do not drift aimlessly for 12 months merely to keep their names from the live register or some such purpose.  That is not what training is all about.  I do not see any sign of poverty being tackled within the overall educational sphere.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing the only good thing about this latest document is its presentation.  It contains no real programme of housebuilding.  The Minister for the Environment, who has just spoken, talked about increasing the allocation for house building.  In 1986 the allocation for housebuilding was approximately £200 million, which has dropped this year to £86 million.  That is a huge cutback in terms of a house building programme. The Minister spoke of joint ownership of houses and so on.  I welcome such innovations but, in themselves, they will not solve our housing problem which has been allowed to get totally out of hand in recent years.</P>
    <P>Within this <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> there are two elements, pay and non-pay.  In order to get the pay element right or pitched at the right level, a fair price has had to be paid on the non-pay side.  As far as I can see, anything would have been agreed in order to arrive at a reasonable pay settlement.  I have no doubt that the employers on the social side were not terribly concerned, that their bottom line <Col N="1072" /> was what would be the percentage increase agreed.</P>
    <P>This Government have been very tardy with regard to Dáil reform.  We need a constructive committee system of this House.  We need a social and economic committee to cope with all of these issues. Indeed the members of such committees should sit around the table with the social partners ensuring an input from this House into any such policy-making.  The absence of such input in the new programme is a reflection on this House and our democratic institutions.  We appear to be delegating all of this beyond the House, to be negotiated with various groups of civil servants around tables. This means that, at the end of the day, our contribution is a mere 15 minutes comment on the document as presented. That is not good enough and does not augur well for democracy.  We should be very careful because democracy is a delicate animal and we should treat it as such.  I contend that the drawing up of such economic and social plans over three years without reference to this House is not a good idea.  In future there should be an input on the part of committees of this House into any plans which might bring about such reform.</P>
    <P>There does not appear to be much in this programme to improve people's employment prospects over the next three years.  For example, there is no reference to the current GATT talks or their effect on this country.</P>
    <P>We observed in the budgetary proposals a break in the business expansion scheme provisions.  While the Minister has every right to implement changes in such schemes as he sees fit, he should not abolish certain provisions arbitrarily.  We must remember that there are many people who will have made plans, invested substantial sums of money, that advisers will have advised people and companies to enter into business commitments on the strength of the then provisions of the business expansion scheme. Such people are now left with egg on their faces having advised individuals and companies to enter into commitments on the basis of the provisions then obtaining <Col N="1073" /> but which have been swept away overnight. That is not good enough.  It does not encourage investors to get involved in long term projects.  The financial institutions selling ideas will be slow in selling because they will not be sure whether the rug will be pulled from beneath them again.  This is what worries me.</P>
    <P>I agree with the concept of a three year programme because a long term plan brings stability in pay and in labour relations so that companies can plan effectively, knowing where they are going.  The programme has not been costed and I hope it has not been bought at too high a price.</P>
    <P>I hope that we will have some sort of tax reform as distinct from widening the tax brackets and that sort of thing.  The PAYE worker is paying his fair share and he should not continue to carry the burden he has been carrying over the years.  I am not happy with this programme. It has been bought at too high a price.  If this programme is to be the yardstick for the next three years I do not see any great economic or social progress over the next three years as a result of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my contribution to this debate, due to the fact that I have very little time, I am forced to concentrate on a small number of key issues, namely: the unique partnership between the Government, trade unions and employers which the programme represents; the maturity which, as a country, we have achieved in recent years in conducting our social, economic and political affairs through a partnership rather than a confrontational process; the recognition underlying the programme that no one side has a monopoly of wisdom in dealing with our social and economic affairs; the balance which the programme attains between achieving desirable social and economic objectives and the real constraints posed to their achievement by the huge burden of public debt which still exists and the major economic and geo-political uncertainties facing the world at the present time; the framework <Col N="1074" /> for stability which the programme can create in an uncertain world; the importance of developing a social budget hand-in-hand with our economic policies and the importance of ensuring that need and efficiency are the key criteria in developing our social policies; the contribution which changes in company, competition and consumer protection law can make to improving the efficiency of the economy under the programme; and the need for the further reform of our institutions, including the public service, which play a key role in the social and economic development of the country.</P>
      <P>I am confident that Dáil Éireann will approve the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  The new programme is a remarkable achievement at a critical juncture in our economic affairs.  It represents a unique partnership between the Government, trade unions, employer and farming bodies in achieving realistic and lasting development, on both the economic and social fronts, over the next three years and beyond that to the turn of the century.</P>
      <P>The programme is built on strong foundations.  Its predecessor, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, achieved a level of success in bringing our public finances under control while, at the same time, underpinning a major expansion of output and employment and an improvement in living standards that few anticipated when it was first agreed.  The new programme is based on realistic and sober analyses undertaken by the social partners themselves, by the National Economic and Social Council and by representatives of a number of other institutions and organisations active in analysing social and economic developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new programme coming, as it does, back-to-back with the very successful <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, is a measure of the maturity we have achieved in recent years in conducting our economic, social and political affairs. We have moved over a short period from sterile confrontation between interest groups to a progressive partnership arrangements on the basis of an objective <Col N="1075" /> evaluation of the real issues involved in tackling our social and economic problems. This must be the way forward.  The day is long gone when any single source, from the employer, trade union or Government side can claim a monopoly of wisdom in identifying how better living standards can be achieved and sustained for all our people.</P>
    <P>While the new programme covers a comprehensive range of issues across the entire field of social and economic development, there are a number of elements, which as leader of the Progressive Democrats and Minister for Industry and Commerce, I consider of particular importance.</P>
    <P>Some months ago at the outset of the negotiations for the new programme, I stated publicly that while there was an incontrovertible case for a follow-on agreement to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, such an agreement could not be entertained by Government at any price.  I drew attention to a number of fundamental facts that would have to be addressed.  I said that within any new programme there would have to be a recognition of the fact that in order to compensate for higher import prices in products, such as oil, the only lasting solution is to increase productivity and competitiveness across all sectors of the economy, and to avoid stimulating further inflationary pressures and higher interest rates through increased public expenditure, sustained by heavy borrowings.</P>
    <P>I also drew attention to an international trading environment that will change immeasurably over the next few years under the impact of: the international economic slow-down emerging, especially in two markets of key importance to Ireland &mdash; the UK and the United States; the completion of the Single European Market by the end of 1992; the fundamental change likely to arise under a new GATT agreement; the moves towards economic and monetary union in Europe; the political and economic upheaval in Eastern Europe; and the ominous developments then emerging in <Col N="1076" /> the Middle East, which have since culminated in today's tragic warfare.</P>
    <P>The programme now negotiated has taken these and other factors into consideration. It has, achieved a reasonable balance between the opportunities for, and the real constraints to, development that now exist.</P>
    <P>We are now entering unknown territory in many ways, with the major uncertainties surrounding the world economic order to which I have referred. The proposed <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides a structure and a framework for the development of economic and social policies over the next three years and beyond which can provide an important source of stability over that period.  This is one of the main reasons that it is to be welcomed and supported.  The programme is comprehensive in the range of economic and social policies which it covers.</P>
    <P>Some key elements, which are of particular importance are: the overriding principle of firm control of the public finances; the negotiation of which are sufficiently moderate relative to developments in other countries to enable Irish firms which are well managed to achieve, through productivity increases, further competitive gains in internationl markets; the Government's committment to taxation reform.  The tax base will be further widened.  The standard rate of income tax will be reduced from 30 per cent to 25 per cent by 1993, in accordance with the &ldquo;Programme for Government&rdquo; negotiated between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil in July 1989, and there will also be a single higher rate of tax by that date.  A radical restructuring of indirect taxes will be undertaken over the next few years within the context of the harmonisation needed as part of the Single European Market; and the creation of 20,000 jobs gross per year in manufacturing and international services over the period of the programme.  The development of indigenous industry will be a priority because of its close integration into the domestic economy, and up to half of all State aids will be in the <Col N="1077" /> form of remunerating or repayable forms of funding, including equity.</P>
    <P>The programme also provides a context in which developments in the social budget will be framed.  As a caring society we must continue to devote a substantial proportion of the resources which are available to us to the social budget in order to reflect a continued concern that the most disadvantaged of our citizens are adequately provided for.  In doing so we must, however, ensure that the scarce resources redistributed in this way are concentrated on those whose needs are greatest and that the programmes financed are administered efficiently.</P>
    <P>Social welfare, health, housing and education policies are covered comprehensively as part of the programme. For example, through the considerable additional provisions for education set out in the programme, we are investing in our people's future development.  I especially welcome the proposed extension of a six year cycle to all secondary schools.</P>
    <P>This, together with the commitment to reducing pupil/teacher ratios and allocating additional resources for the educationally disadvantaged, is an opportunity for a major improvement in the quality of the Irish educational system which will contribute to a significant upgrading in the linguistic, commercial and applied science skills available to build strong growth in the industrial and services sectors.</P>
    <P>Reforms in company, competition and consumer protection law will make a major contribution to achieving structural reforms needed to support a more efficient and competitive business sector in Ireland.  I have already introduced many of the required changes in company law and changes in competition and consumer protection law will be introduced during the coming year.</P>
    <P>The new Companies Act will give firms experiencing trading difficulties the opportunity to reorganise and survive, and maintain employment.  The new Act will also curb the abuse of limited liability; strengthen the position of creditors both in relation to preserving the assets <Col N="1078" /> of companies and giving them greater redress in cases of malpractice; give Irish companies the same flexibility in organising their equity as their foreign competitors enjoy; and provide more effective means for dealing with insider trading.</P>
    <P>In the area of consumer protection new measures are planned for the coming year which will, in the case of product liability, impose responsibility on the producers of products and their components for injury or loss caused to persons because of a defect in the product without the consumer having to prove negligence. Measures will also be introduced to curb abuses in moneylending.</P>
    <P>In the area of competition policy, the Competition Bill, 1991, which I will shortly be publishing, aims to make competition law in this country consistent with articles 85 and 86 of the Community Treaty.  The objective is to prohibit anti-competitive agreements and abuse of a dominant position by enterprises operating in Ireland.  Irish firms engaged in trade with other EC countries are already subject to such provisions.  The new legislation when it is enacted will extend these provisions to &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; activities and ensure that the traded sectors of the economy are not subjected to the costs imposed by anti-competitive practices in more sheltered sectors.</P>
    <P>The examination of the institutional aspects of the Irish economy to be undertaken by NESC under the new programme is a significant new initiative.  I think there is scope for major reform in this area and this has been a major policy priority of my party.</P>
    <P>In the case of the formulation and execution of industrial policy, I have initiated certain institutional reforms in recent months and I am keeping the possibility of further changes under review.  I will, therefore, be particularly interested in the conclusions reached by NESC following a comparative examination of institutional developments in other small open economies similar to that of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the commitment under the programme to consider changes in <Col N="1079" /> structures and working practices in the public services as part of the discussions on pay increases above the basic levels set out in the programme and on the approach that will apply to the payment of such increases which involve additional costs beyond 1993.  I believe that it is in the interests of both the trade unions representing public sector workers and the Government to develop an agreed approach to the difficulties of an overall public sector pay bill increasing at a faster pace than public expenditure generally. Such an approach must encompass further public service reform which improves the effectiveness and efficiency of the public service, adequately recognises merit and provides greater job satisfaction and motivation for public servants.</P>
    <P>Given the grave threats facing our economic future from the events in the Gulf; the possible contraction of many important international economies; the continued difficulties in the agriculture sector and the challenges that 1992 and monetary union may entail, I welcome this programme as providing the basis for protecting the significant progress we have made in recent years in achieving increased employment, improved social welfare payments, taxation reform and control of the public finances.  The programme provides an essential framework within which the large scale uncertainties facing the undertaking of development policies at the present time can be dealt with so that a firm launching pad for our next phase of economic expansion can be created.</P>
    <P>I could summarise the value of this programme by saying that over a three year period for certain the kind of increases in pay that are being talked about are the equivalent of increases that are taking place in Britain over a one year period and being negotiated and agreed at present.  The fact that we are in a position to negotiate pay rises of one-third or less the size of those in Britain is due to the fact that our inflation rate is one third or less that in Britain.  It is interesting to note that when leading <Col N="1080" /> members of the British Government are asked what particular economic objective they would most like to achieve in the short term, unanimously their reply is a low inflation rate.  In this country we underestimate the value of what has been achieved in that regard and the lasting value it will be to our economy and our competitive position.</P>
    <P>Not alone as a result of this programme can we maintain the competitive gains that have been made in recent years but we can further increase that competitive advantage.  Of the many ways in which that will be to our benefit the most obvious is in the creation and maintenance of employment.  Once the present world crisis has passed, as I hope will happen soon, I see a very swift resurgence in employment in the firms who, due to external circumstances, have been forced either temporarily to shed labour in recent weeks, or to put a proportion of their workforce on short time. It is a great disappointment that this is happening but it is because of external factors.  However, due to the competitive advantage which Irish industry in general now has compared with many other countries, I am confident that once the external problem has been overcome the employment gains of recent times can be fully consolidated and built upon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak on the agriculture dimension which is referred to in section VI of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  I cannot understand how the farming organisations signed this agreement.  It seems they bought a pig in a poke when they agreed to this measure.  On page 67 the programme states:</P>
      <P>At EC level, the CAP reform process, which has been emphasising reduced support levels and a greater market orientation, will continue, the outcome of the GATT Uruguay Round negotiations will result in a reduction of overall agricultural support, greater discipline in the application of various subsidies and reduced import barriers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to see how the objectives of the <Col N="1081" /> programme will be achieved nationally if this rhetoric is put into operation.  We joined the EC in 1973 primarily to benefit from the advantages which would accrue to agriculture.  We joined it for better prices, unlimited opportunities for production and an overall improvment in the economy.  We did so in the knowledge that traditional long established industries such as textiles, clothing and footwear, motor car assembly and many others would collapse because of the lack of protection.  This area was very sore, politically and economically.  Many jobs were lost.  However, we were to be compensated by the considerably increased income we would obtain from the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>Now this programme quite clearly states that those improvements and those opportunities are to be seriously curtailed. From an agricultural point of view the programme is an absolute disaster. The proposals mentioned in it, those put forward in the GATT negotiations and by the Commissioner for Agriculture, have not been worked out or priced and their impact on our economy was not taken into consideration when the programme was drawn up.  Deputy O'Malley, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, gave the impression that a considerable number of new jobs would be created and that there would be growth.  In the agricultural sector we will have nothing but contraction &mdash; a reduction in output, a reduction in prices and, consequently, a reduction in the number of jobs at a time when jobs in the agricultural sector are a key element.</P>
    <P>Twenty per cent of all full-time jobs here are either in agriculture or in related industries.  If one took into account the spinoff effects of employment in agriculture one would probably arrive at a figure of about 40 to 50 per cent of jobs in agriculture either directly or indirectly.</P>
    <P>The proposals put forward here must result in a considerable reduction in the number of people in employment in agriculture and related industries.  That is not acceptable.  We went to Brussels seven years ago and fought the case for milk production on the basis that Ireland had <Col N="1082" /> a special position where agriculture was concerned.  As a result of that fight we got an exemption which was not granted to any other country in the Community. That created a precedent for all future negotiations involving agriculture and involving Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have not heard one word from the Government or the Minister about seeking special treatment where these negotiations are concerned.  When we were negotiating a special position for this country in 1983-84 we were repeatedly berated by Members of the then Opposition who told us that under no conditions should we accept any deal in Brussels that would affect Irish agriculture or the Irish economy in any way.  There was wholesale criticism because we got an exemption which was not 100 per cent. Now we are expected to accept an agreement that will seriously damage the whole agricultural sector.  I am saying that this is just not good enough.</P>
    <P>The IFA have priced these proposals if implemented in full at about £500 million.  They are being over-cautious in their estimate because I do not think they have considered the knock-on effects of £500 million in direct production.  If we lose £500 million in prices we are quite likely to lose a multiple of that in terms of costs to the overall economy.  That equation has not been worked out by anybody, particularly by the Government. I do not believe it has been worked out even by the Commission in Brussels. The whole matter must be given serious consideration.  We must take a very strident attitude immediately because by our silence we seem to be condoning the proposals which have been made, proposals which will be so disastrous if they are implemented.</P>
    <P>The only delegation that mentioned last week in Brussels that they would invoke the veto was the Danish one.  Our own Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, merely stated that he was examining the proposals further.  There must be outright opposition if we are to achieve the goals of this programme.  We cannot achieve those goals if we have to suffer major cutbacks in prices and production.  For <Col N="1083" /> instance, the Commission proposals which are referred to at length in this document would cost us something like 10p in the price of a gallon of milk &mdash; a 4½ per cent reduction in the quota and a 15p reduction in the price of a pound of beef.  They would mean the annihilation of all cereal growers here because if the proposals go through as outlined cereals would fetch something like £60 to £70 a tonne.  That would be totally uneconomic in this climate where we have rather moderate or small farms.  That price might be obtainable in the plains of Canada or the central United States, in France, or even East Anglia, but certainly not in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This, therefore, means the total abolition of grain growing here.  In addition, it puts a quota on the number of sheep in the country despite the fact that we are still only 80 per cent self sufficient within the Community where sheep are concerned. The curtailment will mean a reduction in prices for commodities.  It will mean a reduction where production is concerned.  Overall it is a vast loss of income not only to the farmer but to the economy and will result in a considerable loss of jobs so far as the workforce are concerned.</P>
    <P>I have heard no mention whatever of our special position in Europe.  The special status we created for ourselves in 1983-84 has been forgotten about in this programme and as I quoted earlier we are expected to bear the worst cutbacks in the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the elements of the programme which refer to the Irish Sugar Company, Siúicre Éireann, which is the subject of a Bill presently going through the House.  We agree with the sentiments of the Bill, the privatisation of the sugar company.  A private sugar company as outlined in the Bill and as outlined in this programme will be of tremendous benefit to the agricultural community.  It will be of tremendous benefit not only to beet growers in the tillage sector but to horticulture generally.  When the company are publicly floated they will provide the type of finance which will mean that <Col N="1084" /> eventually we will have a flourishing horticultural industry and not be dependent on the importation of products that could be grown at home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Deasy denounce the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> just as many of his colleagues denounced the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in 1988.  They now realise that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was a good programme and I am quite satisfied that when the history of this century comes to be written one of the major achievements will be seen to have been that <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, that programme which helped to bring this country back from the brink of economic and financial disaster.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased, as a member of the Government and particularly as Minister for Health, at the manner in which the health services were looked at objectively by the Government and the social partners in the new programme.  I am satisfied that we will see major developments in a number of areas in the health service in the coming seven years.  On 6 February last year I outlined the principles by which we administer our health services. That is recorded in the Official Report at columns 815-34 so I do not intend to go over that ground again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer to the debate that was conducted in all developed countries in the eighties as to where money should be spent on health services in future.  If money becomes available should it be spent in acute hospitals or in the community? As in other developed countries there is a consensus here that we should channel more money into the community rather than into acute hospitals.  The logic is that if you continue to spend all the new money that becomes available in acute hospitals, more and more people will find their way into acute hospitals to be treated for illnesses that can more appropriately be treated in the community. I was particularly glad that the social partners agreed with the Government that the area we must concentrate on in the next seven years is the area <Col N="1085" /> of community services.  Of course, the community services for the elderly, for those with mental handicap, for those who are mentally ill and for the physically disabled will be strengthened as a result of this programme, as indeed will the dental and childcare services.</P>
    <P>Let us look at some of these services. Our services for the elderly benefited last year from the £5 million which was provided in the budget.  We increased the number of home helps, the number of public health nurses, the number of care attendants, of day care centres, day hostels, long stay beds and some short term crisis beds.  Not alone was the provision of £5 million repeated this year but a further £3 million was allocated for the elderly so that we can continue the developments for the elderly in the community. The same applies to the area of mental handicap and I would be the first to recognise that there are gaps in the service.  However, since I became Minister we have continued to increase the allocation for mental handicap well ahead of inflation and indeed as I pointed out last week, the money provided for services for the mentally handicapped has increased by 40 per cent between 1986-91. In addition we provided £2 million, in this respect last year in the budget and a further £1 million has been provided this year.  Last year we provided 145 new residential places, 442 day places, respite care for 200 persons suffering from mental handicap and 25 additional support staff for the service.  This development will continue as a result of the moneys provided under this programme in the current year.</P>
    <P>We also re-established the co-ordinating committees in each health board area, with representatives of the health boards, of my Department and of the voluntary organisations being asked to draw up a list of priorities in each health board area.  Again I am very pleased that there will be money available under the new programme to ensure continued development in each health board area.</P>
    <P>Under the programme, the same will apply to those who are physically disabled. There will be more support staff <Col N="1086" /> put in place, particularly in disciplines that are in short supply at present, for instance, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physiotherapy.  In addition there will be more short term crisis places made available, more day hostels and more residential places for the physically disabled.  It is encouraging also that in the section of the programme dealing with the environment more emphasis will be given to the provision of access for the disabled, which is very important.</P>
    <P>Those suffering from psychiatric illnesses will continue to be provided for. The report of the working party in 1985, <i>Planning for the Future</i>, has ensured substantial development in community based services for those who are mentally ill and this of course, will continue more rapidly under the new programme.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget £1 million was provided for child care services and that of course will ensure substantial improvement in the provision of child care services throughout the eight health board areas.  I would envisage also the development, in the next few years, of a child psychiatric service in each health board area as a result of the programme.</P>
    <P>We have continued to improve the dental services.  In this area £300,000 was provided in 1989, £3 million in 1990 and a further £3 million in 1991.  Of course there have been substantial improvements particularly in the area of orthodontistry where there was a difficulty. Improvements will continue as a result of the new programme.  It is no harm to look at the moneys that will be provided through the new programme.  There will be an increasing amount on the current side each year totalling £90 million net extra in the seventh year of the programme. Over the period of the programme also there will be £100 million spent on capital developments &mdash; on the provision of health centres, day hostels, day centres, workshops and all the facilities we need in the community to ensure that we provide the very best level and the best quality of service for all our people.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the programme are <Col N="1087" /> very important.  For example, the establishment of a performance audit unit in my Department will look at the efficiency and the effectiveness of the service and will compare outputs by different agencies, health boards and voluntary hospitals, to see where we are getting good value for money.  If there is some area that is much more costly we will be asking questions as to why that should be.  Value for money is, obviously very important because as I have often pointed out in the House, a £1 saved in one area of the health services is available to spend in another priority area.  It is very important that we get the maximum benefit for the very substantial amount of money we are spending on our health services.  This year the amount of money we will spend on our health services, including capital, will be £1,550 million, a very substantial sum which represents 22 per cent of Exchequer spending on public services as compared with 18.5 per cent spent in 1987.</P>
    <P>Improved management is very important and the programme draws attention to this and to the fact that we will be putting in place new organisational structures for the health services.  At present we are looking at the Eastern Health Board area which, when all the voluntary agencies in Dublin and the board are included, accounts for one quarter of the total health bill.  The Commission on Funding, the Foxe group, drew attention to the need for the development of good management.  In a number of hospitals which are spending more than £30 million per year we have put in a general manager because of the sheer size and complexity of managing hospitals of that size.</P>
    <P>The programme outlines the change of eligibility status which is a very significant development and one that is very important. At present everybody in the State is entitled to a free bed in a public ward and people with an income in excess of £16,700 are obliged to pay their consultant. After 1 June that will no longer be the case and everybody in the State will be entitled to avail of a free bed &mdash;<Col N="1088" /> as at present &mdash; and will not have to pay their consultant.  They will get a comprehensive service in a public ward.  That will free up beds for public patients which are taken up at present by patients who avail of their free bed in a public ward but who are private patients of the consultant.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that emergencies will continue to be treated in whatever accommodation is available.  The programme recognises the place of private medicine in complementing public medicine here.  We have had an integrated system of private-public medicine here since the foundation of the State.  It has served the people well and it is important that we should maintain that on the same campus rather than driving consultants out of the public hospitals to private facilities that may be four, five or six miles away and may be one hour's journey away.  It is important that the medical staff should be available to patients for as long as possible during the day.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the medical consultants in Ireland provided a very high standard and quality of service over the years.  At present, as the House is aware, we are in negotiation with them on the Gleeson report on higher remuneration. We will be taking into account the change in eligibility status.  It is recognised now by everybody &mdash; the VHI have stated it and I have stated it in the House &mdash; that we do not expect there will be any falloff in the number of private patients.  At present there are only 30,000 patients in the VHI who are insured for consultant only; in other words, the other 1.2 million subscribers to VHI are paying a premium for a hospital bed, even though they are entitled to a hospital bed free if they so desire.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the programme which I believe is particularly important is the patient's charter.  While we have a very high standard and all our health care staff have a very caring philosophy &mdash; something we can be very proud of &mdash; nevertheless, I am pleased to see a patient's charter written into the new programme because I have always seen the <Col N="1089" /> health service as a pyramid and the patient must be at the top of that pyramid at all times.</P>
    <P>The programme recognises the place of health promotion.  Health promotion is very important because more and more information is becoming available which frequently indicates that our lifestyle contributes to some of the more critical illnesses from which people suffer, for example, heart disease, cancers of the lung and a number of different forms of cancer.  It is very important that we continue to highlight the need for people to look at their way of life, to improve their lifestyle so that they will avoid the more serious illnesses and hazards associated with a poor lifestyle.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that I have no doubt that the previous programme, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, will be seen as one of the major achievements of any Government since the foundation of the State.  I am satisfied that the new programme is a very worthy successor.  So far as the health services are concerned we will see much more development and will further improve our health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other speakers from the Labour Party, I welcome the principles inherent in the development of a programme for economic and social progress.  I consider that the Taoiseach has missed a significant opportunity to expand and develop those principles, by enabling the Oireachtas to play a constructive role in the future development of consensus.  The Leader of the Opposition has missed an even bigger opportunity, by choosing to take an entirely negative and partisan approach to the exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to pretend that I like, or agree with, every aspect of the programme, but neither do I want to use this opportunity to score cheap political points.  Instead I want to concentrate on the one area of our economic activity where we most urgently need radical reform, and where the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has done little or nothing to effect the changes <Col N="1090" /> necessary.  That is the issue of unemployment and job creation.</P>
    <P>Before I do so, however, I want to say a few words about the decision of the ESB to pass on the VAT increases announced in the budget to their customers. In the constituency I represent, which has one of the highest levels of unemployment and poverty in the country, this decision will cause considerable hardship.  It will inevitably lead to many families finding themselves being tipped over the edge when it comes to paying ESB bills, and being faced with being cut off by the ESB.  Many families even under the old prices, were cut off by the ESB with ruthless dedication.  This additional burden will leave many families, particularly those with young children, without electricity, heating, or facilities to cook.  That is in a constituency where, unfortunately, the supply and circulation of natural gas is not available.</P>
    <P>When this decision is allied to the local authority rent increases which are now taking place, and the increases in telephone and other heating charges that also flow from the budget, the reality will be that all of the benefits of the budget, such as they are, for families on low incomes will be wiped out.  They will be wiped out before low income families even see them.  The social welfare increase in the budget, for example, does not take effect until July, while the cost increases are happening now.</P>
    <P>The announcement by the ESB will represent for many families the beginning of the unravelling of the budget.  It will come to be widely seen for what it is &mdash; a timid exercise in economic management accompanied by a great deal of hype and PR polish.  The poor remain poor after the budget and indeed for many of them hardship will increase.</P>
    <P>The same is true of the unemployed. The budget, and more particularly the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, have done little or nothing for them.  In the context of our economic history that may not be surprising, but set against the scale of our problem it is a tragedy.</P>
    <P>The experience of the Irish economy <Col N="1091" /> since independence has been the failure of job creation.  That has been the central fact of our economic and social development. Associated with this, apart from certain brief periods, we have had comparatively high levels of unemployment and unique levels of forced emigration by European standards.  Indeed, it has become impossible to consider the unemployment figures released on the first Friday of every month without taking the highest emigration figures in the European Community into account.  In this connection perhaps it is worth saying that there has been a great deal of talk and debate &mdash; justifiably so &mdash; about the legal and judicial extradition of Irish citizens. However, the media are almost completely silent now about the continuing scandal of the economic extradition of thousands of Irish people.</P>
    <P>Forced emigration continues at a disastrous pace.  There are signs that the total number of people who emigrate this year will not be much lower than last year's record levels.  The latest ESRI medium-term review, for instance, forecasts continuing high emigration this year.  If there is a slowing down of emigration over the record levels of the last few years it will be because of the recession in Britain and the United States and not because of any huge surge in job prospects in this country.</P>
    <P>Forced emigration at any level represents a major failure of our political and economic system.  That is a simple fact &mdash; our emigration for a number of years has been at, or close to, the levels of some Third World countries.  If we cannot do enough to keep our people at home, surely we cannot any longer turn a blind eye to the conditions of young Irish people abroad.  How can we read reports, such as the one from the manager of the Conway House Hostel in Kilburn published some time ago, which say that an increasing number of young Irish people in Britain are ending up in prison or in the gutter and not feel compelled to act?  The information available about young Irish people in Britain is as follows: a survey of hostel residents in London <Col N="1092" /> shows that the average age is 19 years; most of them come from inner city areas in Ireland; and many arrive in England with less than £10 in their pockets. According to some authoritative reports, one in every three people living in hostels in London is Irish and one in every seven people living rough in London is Irish. This is a scandal and our failure to respond to it is equally scandalous; it is nothing less than a legacy of failure by our society.  I see it as Labour's task to place back on the agenda the goal of full employment as the fundamental objective of Government.  This needs to be demonstrated and expressed as a moral as well as a political commitment.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the scandal of emigration &mdash; as a statement I issued last week demonstrates &mdash; official figures just available now prove that Ireland has the worst unemployment crisis in Europe. The average European unemployment rate was 8.3 per cent for the year 1990, compared to 15.6 per cent in Ireland.  In other words, our unemployment rate is still almost twice the European average. If we were developing a league of countries with an unemployment crisis in Europe, Ireland would have the greatest problem in relation to male unemployment and second greatest in relation to female unemployment.  Where young people under 25 years are concerned, we have the second highest rate in overall terms, the second highest among males and the fifth highest rate among females, significantly above the European average.</P>
    <P>These are official figures prepared under the auspices of the European Commission itself.  They clearly reveal the total failure of the Government's inadequate response to our unemployment crisis.  Even more, they show the need for the Government to deal with this major crisis by initiating a radical review of the Government's industrial policy.  The recent budget has also failed to provide any workable solutions to the everincreasing number of people out of work. The January figures for the live register indicate that unemployment is set to rise by 12,000 in 1991 as compared to last <Col N="1093" /> year.  If the Government do not immediately implement a progressive industrial policy which will be designed specifically to deal with this crisis our unemployment will shoot out of control to well above the European average.</P>
    <P>The European figures do not take the problem of the long term unemployed into account.  That is why we in the Labour Party have consistently called for the immediate implementation by the Government and the social partners of an action programme to encourage training and the reserving of a quota of vacancies for the long term unemployed in the public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>The European figures to which I have referred show that the only country in Europe with a comparable crisis to ours is Spain.  At the rate our unemployment is set to increase this year, we will pass out Spain on the way to the top of this shameful league, unless policies are changed.  Our perspective on this issue is this: we believe that growth, competitiveness and job creation can and must be pursued in the context of our vision of a humane, just and democratic economy.  However, we recognise that there are a number of critical strategic objectives in ensuring long term economic growth and employment.  I should like to spell some of these out as we see them.</P>
    <P>First, no small country has achieved self-sustaining industrial growth and expansion in employment based mainly on multi-national investment from abroad.  A strong domestic industrial base is of central importance.  The objective must be to retain wealth and value-added in Ireland.  This is simply not being achieved by current industrial policy.  If it were, we would be ensuring that at least some of the £2 billion of repatriated multi-national profits that left Ireland last year was reinvested in this country.</P>
    <P>Second, another major factor lies in the fact that here in Ireland we have an inappropriate mix of firm sizes, with too few firms capable of achieving the scale of activity necessary for a sustained long term competitive position in international markets.  This is expressed in <Col N="1094" /> too low expenditures on research and development, marketing and management development.  This problem is greatly added to and is, to a great degree, reflected by our geographic distance from large markets, with high transport costs, small population and domestic market, and a lack of co-ordinated growth and employment strategy by the major EC economies.</P>
    <P>Third, I would add to this the irrelevance of privatisation as even a part remedy for our core problems.  Privatisation, in Irish terms, is a copycat distraction fostered by the political Right and financial interests who plan to make and share profits from commissions, flotations and the discount pricing of shares. Fortunately, there are examples of public sector, co-operative and private firms which have shown a capability to plan and achieve sustained development.  Privatisation in the form of asset sales is simply another form of borrowing whereby future profits are brought forward and used today.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the most successful companies in world markets are those with the highest levels of participation by the workforce.  This applies equally to companies in Sweden, the USA and Japan. Co-operation rather than confrontation is the central theme in these enterprises.</P>
    <P>In addition, the most successful small European economies have been those which achieved a high degree of consensus on economic policy.  I am not here only talking of the model which has had some success in helping us to come to grips with our debt problems in the last few years.  The kind of consensus I have in mind is only sustainable in the long term if it is based on both equity and the priority of employment in policy formation.</P>
    <P>In pursuit of these objectives, the Labour Party have called repeatedly for a radical revamping of industrial policy, which we believe is essential to retain value-added in the economy.  Among our proposals are public ownership, part or whole, in the traded sector; public intervention by targeting grants and incentives to overcome the issue of firm size and tax <Col N="1095" /> reform through radical changes in the income, company and wealth tax codes with far larger revenues from the company sector.  In addition to these measures, we propose to change the orientation of the IDA, getting them to focus entirely on inward investment from abroad, and to fundamentally reorganise the National Development Corporation as the major leader in the development of Irish industry.  We cannot hope to win the battle for retaining value-added in Ireland and increasing jobs if we sell our proven winners to foreigners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Tánaiste and Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) Tánaiste and Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>To begin with I would like to state that despite what Deputy Bruton said about the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> I firmly believe that the case in favour of consensus has been proven both here and abroad.  Having accepted the merits of this approach some commentators &mdash; Deputy Bruton is one &mdash; have questioned the creation of what has been termed the fifth estate, a process which operates outside of Parliament and which in some way allegedly circumvents the democratic process.  I reject this contention.  This programme, agreed as it has been by all the social partners, is an extension of the democratic process.  In my view it is the correct way to do business.  Having agreed to the programme the House now has the opportunity to debate its contents &mdash; we heard the remarks of Deputy Taylor a moment ago &mdash; in a mature and responsible manner.  Also, as the Taoiseach pointed out, any legislation that arises from the programme will also have to go before this House and be teased out in the various parliamentary stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain arrogance in Deputy Bruton's concept of a restrictive democracy. It is a Celtic kind of thing.  If the father was a bard the son would be mac a bhaird.  If the father was Ó hIcí, a medical doctor, the son, Mac Uí hIcí, would also be a medical doctor.  It is an exclusivity philosophy which I do not believe is appropriate to the running of this country.  The Houses of the <Col N="1096" /> Oireachtas have an opportunity, in their wisdom, to contribute.  The trade unions &mdash; as a life-long trade unionist I must pay tribute to the trade unions and their leadership for the part they played in arriving at this consensus &mdash; the employers, the farmers and the expertise available in the public service contributed to the formulation of this programme and for that reason I have great pleasure in commending it to the House.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that this debate on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> offers us an opportunity not just to discuss its specific provisions but to critically examine the merits of this approach to developing the economy. This approach, based as it is on co-operation &mdash; an important word &mdash; and consensus, while well established in much of continental Europe is a relatively new departure here.  For some the idea of a consensus approach to economic management is anathema.  We do not hear very many cries for the class war as we did some time ago.  The whole thrust seems to be in favour of a consensus, co-operative approach.</P>
    <P>The opponents of the programme will say there is a price to be paid for consensus and that national agreements are in some way inefficient and an attempt to buck the market.  We in Ireland have eschewed co-operation and consensus in the past, as this House well knows.  Memories of how poor industrial relations cost us industries are still fresh in our minds. We remember only too well how days lost through labour disputes discouraged foreign investors from setting up here. The &ldquo;them and us&rdquo;, the class war approach to economic management has never worked here.</P>
    <P>We have seen how divisiveness has stunted our development in the past and how other small open economies such as Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Finland have achieved far higher standards of living through the adoption of a consensus approach to economic and social development.  I am a student of Spain, and all its aspects, and I know that Felipe Gonzalez, the Prime Minister, has been striving sometimes with difficulty, despite <Col N="1097" /> the fact that the UGT and the Comisiones Obreras helped him to power, to get them to agree a consensus for the good of Spain.  I know, because I love that country, that they are approaching that consensus now.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> negotiated as it was at a time when the country was on its knees gave us a chance to try a new approach.  The parlous state of the economy, while setting us a gargantuan task, was instrumental in, like hanging, concentrating our minds and focusing our efforts on the job in hand. The programme set the agenda for the period 1987 to 1990.  Our macro-economic policies were set out clearly for all to see.  Employers and unions alike agreed to specified wage rises over the period of the programme and the Government committed themselves to significant sectoral and fiscal measures. The various sectors of the economy were addressed and the consensus achieved showed tangible results.</P>
    <P>Non-agricultural private sector employment grew by 70,000 since 1987. Inflation fell to the point where we now enjoy the second lowest rate in the Community at 2.7 per cent.  Some people argue that it is the lowest; the contender is Denmark.  The ratio of debt to GNP has fallen from 131 per cent to 110 per cent and we are moving towards 100 per cent.  The standard rate of income tax has been reduced from 35 per cent to 29 per cent, or £6 in £100, and the top rate has been reduced from 56 per cent to 52 per cent, to £4 in £100.  VAT has been reduced from 25 per cent to 21 per cent. This has been achieved while at the same time we have protected the fabric of our social services.  The weakest in our society, those on social welfare, have been protected.  These achievements would not have been possible without the national consensus achieved under the programme.  It is now patently clear that our interests would be best served if we all pulled together within a consistent framework.</P>
    <P>Our record on employment, taxation and social welfare is one with which I believe we can be well pleased.  We <Col N="1098" /> cannot, however, allow for any degree of complacency.  We have made a good start and that is all.  Now is not the time to rest on our laurels.  We must build on our achievements and work towards the creation of a new Ireland of which we can all feel justifiably proud.</P>
    <P>We are now entering a new era.  In his budget speech the Minister for Finance commented that we were 700 days away from the completion of the single market. By my calculation that is down to 680 or so now.  From 1 January 1993 things will never be the same again.  Our task is to create an economy which can compete effectively against the best in Europe. We have made much progress in this regard.  Costs to industry have been reduced and a substantial programme of investment in our infrastructure is in place.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has been formulated with 1992 in mind.  It has been influenced by the NESC document, <i>A Strategy for the Nineties</i>.  In this document, the council emphasise the continuing need for consistent budgetary, monetary and exchange rate policies.  They also stress the importance of consensus on income developments as a means of improving competitiveness and preserving industrial peace.  The council furthermore call for a radical policy programme covering the whole range of public sector policies, especially taxation and social issues.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> develops in detail the policies suggested by NESC.  The programme is set in a ten-year framework and provides a comprehensive strategy for national development.  It addresses all the main elements of the economy.  It sets a coherent agenda which we intend to follow.  It addresses in an earnest and honest manner the economic and social issues facing the country.</P>
    <P>The programme commits us to reducing the ratio of debt to GNP to 100 per cent in 1993 and to 75 per cent or less by 2000.  The achievement of these targets is crucial to the implementation of the other elements of the programme.  The continued reduction of the debt overhang <Col N="1099" /> will have two main spin-offs.  It will increase investor confidence in our capacity to manage the economy and will also free the resources otherwise expended on debt service.  In this regard it is instructive to note that debt service absorbed three-quarters of the total income tax take in 1990 and will cost £2.4 billion in 1991.</P>
    <P>Living standards should continue to rise over the period of the programme. The Government are committed to ensuring that the fruits of growth are spread evenly.  While we have said that expenditure will not be allowed to rise as a proportion of GNP, it is our intention that growth in the economy will finance improvements in public services.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commits us to a ten year programme which will transform Irish society.  That it goes much further in its provisions than the last programme is a tribute to the success of that programme. It addresses all the key areas of Irish life. Its pay and tax provisions will improve the standards of living of those at work while its commitments on social welfare will protect those most vulnerable in our society.</P>
    <P>I will now progress to Marine matters. Our purpose, according to the programme, is to secure higher value-added through improvements in quality and fish processing in Ireland, to increase supply of fish generally through higher take-up of existing fish quotas, additional catches of non-quota species, mainly horse mackerel and tuna, and higher output from the aquaculture sector, to prepare the fish processing industry to compete successfully in the Internal Market and to increase the contribution of the inland fishery resource to the national economy, particularly through increased tourism.</P>
    <P>Briefly, our policies for the fishing industry are backed by a programme of investment in ice plants, processing facilities and the construction and modernisation of our fleet.  A Community support framework providing for an investment of £30 million in fish processing over the period 1991-93 has been <Col N="1100" /> agreed.  An EC assisted programme of investment in our facilities at ports has also been agreed.  The development of our fishery resource depends on the quality of the infrastructure on which it operates. Fishery harbour development programmes, providing for investment of £20 million, are in place.  This includes £7.5 million Structural Fund aid under the operational programme for rural development.</P>
    <P>This is an integrated approach to the development of our fisheries.  It is geared at developing the upstream and downstream elements of the industry, from landing to final processing.  Much progress has already been made.  Employment in fishing, fish processing and aquaculture stood at 15,600 at the end of 1990; the comparative figure or 1975 was 8,130, so it has almost doubled since then. The programme to which I just referred will result in the creation of an additional 1,450 full-time and 1,400 part-time jobs in the period 1991-93.</P>
    <P>I also have responsibility in connection with commercial harbours.  An investment programme amounting to £69 million is in place to develop these ports. I have looked but briefly at my own area of responsibility and I do not think I have much more time to deal with the other parts of the programme.  Our economy is programmed to grow although not at the very strong pace of recent years.  Nevertheless, progress towards our objective will continue.  The budget was the first instalment of the new dawn heralded by the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  Even in this, a relatively difficult year, progress on the correction of the budgetary imbalances will continue. At the same time, tax rates have been reduced further and social welfare payments have been increased significantly. There will be no let-up in our drive to achieve the targets we have set ourselves; our record speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>We inherited a country on the verge of bankruptcy, in four short years we managed to arrest the decline and turn the country around.  Confidence has been restored and we can now look forward with real hope to the future, confident in <Col N="1101" /> the knowledge that we have a programme in place which will ensure that we never again plumb the depths experienced in the mid-eighties.

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme under discussion in the House begins with a statement that the Government, the ICTU, FIE, CII, CIF, IFA, ICMSA, ICOS and Macra na Feirme agreed this programme to succeed the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.</P>
      <P>The debate to date has been nothing short of a complete and total sham.  The elected representatives of this House are sent here by people from all walks of life. They arrive on Tuesdays with their bags bursting with medical card claims, queries in relation to hip operations and a broad range of personal problems.  The people had no input whatsoever to this agreement or the formulation of this policy which is to take us over the next number of years as we approach the end of this century.</P>
      <P>The democratic right of people to elect representatives to this House is paramount and fundamental to our democracy. This charade of Government speeches paraded before us, indicating that everything in the garden is rosy, is a sham as far as proceeding politically is concerned.  It is brilliant from the point of view that it ties down all the named organisations to the conditions of the plan and to the programme in general.  If things go wrong it allows them very little scope to get out of the situation in which they are now in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme, and the Government, operate in a situation where unemployment is approaching 250,000 despite having the highest levels of emigration in Europe.  There is complete and utter frustration among the rising generation in terms of the availability and the ability to create jobs.  The recent budget brought in VAT charges for clothes and shoes, medical lists continue to grow despite all the verbiage in relation to hospital waiting lists and we are now faced wih <Col N="1102" /> rumours of further increases in telephone and ESB charges.  The viability plan for An Post will decimate the heart and soul of rural Ireland; we must compete with a recession in Britain where the Construction Federation expect a further 100,000 redundancies this year, the largest percentage of whom will be Irish.  We also have to cope with the effects of the recession in the USA, not to mention the consequences of the Gulf War.</P>
    <P>The haemorrhage of the life-blood of this country is a national scandal and every political representative on all sides, all bodies and those who have left this country &mdash; or who have been forced to leave the country and who have now climbed the corporate ladder in other countries &mdash; are all guilty to an extent. However, the Government stand indicted for their failure to tackle this most serious human problem.  There are vast areas of this country which have been cast to the winds.  A recent report on peripherality indicates that not one of the Euro routes recommended would even touch the province of Connaught.  How then will the children of the nation be treated equally?  It is perfectly obvious that the reforms mentioned by the Commissioner for Agriculture &mdash; a west of Ireland man &mdash; were merely drawn up to appease the United States.  These proposals will have devastating implications for the livelihoods of a great many people despite the attempt to put across the emotional argument that 80 per cent of the profits are divided among 20 per cent of farmers and the Commissioner's indication that he will be able to reverse this trend.  There is no doubt that price reductions in the beef, dairy and grain sectors will have devastating consequences for those who eke out a living from the land.</P>
    <P>The section of the programme entitled &ldquo;Strategy for the Nineties&rdquo; is very vulnerable, given that the nature of politics has changed in recent years.  Because of this international decisions can immediately affect a broad range of people and activities.  The programme envisages the creation of 15,000 new jobs in tourism but I do not believe for one moment that <Col N="1103" /> our young people are going to spend the rest of their lives either carrying suitcases as porters or working in B &amp; Bs or other small establishments.  The activities of the Provisional IRA in Britain in recent days, and indeed on the Continent in recent times, have heightened fears and will prove devastating in terms of attracting people to this country.  This is a national scandal and those who engage in these terrorist and treacherous activities are doing down this economy and every single person in this country.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister for Labour initiate an investigation into the relationship between training and productivity and output.  Studies carried out in Great Britain and Germany indicate quite clearly that the higher the quality of training the greater the output and productivity.  In recent years we have tended to pump money into basic schemes with the trainee receiving at the end of the course a paper certificate or having a qualification which is very low down the skill ladder.  The Government's aim should be to increase the production of high quality goods at competitive prices which people abroad will buy, as this will be of help to the economy and provide an incentive to stay to those thinking of leaving.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the contributions of the Minister for the Marine to this debate and on Question Time.  He stated that he has no funds at his disposal to repair those piers and slipways which were wrecked during the recent storms. Because of the damage done some fishermen in the west are unable to land their gear at these piers to prepare their boats before the fishing season commences in a number of weeks.</P>
    <P>I also listened with interest to the contribution of the Minister for Health who has condemned people to be prisoners of pain.  It is an absolute scandal that people are nearing the end of their lives with pain etched on their faces simply because the Government have been unable to deal with the waiting lists for orthopaedic operations.  Furthermore, the vast majority of those waiting for cataract <Col N="1104" /> operations are aged between 70 and 90 years of age, but we have condemned them to darkness and pain in the final years of their lives.</P>
    <P>Archbishop Cassidy of Tuam indicated quite clearly recently that 7,500 people have emigrated during the past five years from his parish, which is the equivalent of the population of three small towns. Those people are now living in places such as Camden Town in London or in Boston and in many cases their pride will not allow them to come back here to be deemed failures.  They have been let down badly and are the invisible minority in Britain.  Studies indicate that deaths from cirrhosis of the liver were 63 per cent above average among those who left Ireland and were unfortunate enough to go downhill.</P>
    <P>This programme is littered with clichés and bursting with aspirations and represents a desperate attempt to stave off the political realities which this Coalition Government will be unable to contend with.  There are black clouds on the horizon and the people of Ireland will shortly be given their opportunity to voice their opinions and to give their perception of the performance of the Government. This programme will do nothing for the many parishes right across the country which have disappeared or where the people are disappointed and full of frustration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this important debate.  The negotiation of the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> represents a considerable achievement on the part of all those involved &mdash; Government and social partners. I think that the development of a broad consensus as to the realistic goals we as a country can strive for and the means to achieve these goals is of major importance &mdash; in a decade during which we may be faced with unprecedented challenges, with the likelihood that there will be more uncertainty and a more risky external economic environment in the short term future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key feature of the programme &mdash;<Col N="1105" /> and of overall Government policy &mdash; is that the macroeconomic environment of growth, inflation and interest rates should be as favourable as possible.  It cannot be stressed too often that keeping inflation and interest rates as low as possible is especially important to the welfare of the farming community.  Our record on inflation has been exceptional and we now have the lowest inflation rate in the EC.  However, interest rates have remained stubbornly high, due mainly to the high level of interest rates internationally and within the European Community.</P>
    <P>On the strictly agricultural front, there are also a number of major concerns at international level &mdash; for Government and for the farm organisations.  Both the GATT negotiations and the CAP reform which will be discussed during the coming months could have serious implications for Irish agriculture.  The opening paragraph of the section on agricultural development in the programme provides an opportunity to state clearly what the Government's overall approach to these negotiations is.  It is worth quoting in full:</P>
    <P>The agriculture and food industry continues to be of central importance to the Irish economy, in terms of its contribution to national income, the balance of payments and employment. The Government are committed, through their domestic policies and their stance on the development of EC and international policies, to maximise the contribution which the sector will make to the future of the economy.</P>
    <P>Against this general commitment, there is a further important undertaking in the programme that I would, from the earliest possible date, enter into discussions with the farm organisations which are a party to the programme on the approach to be adopted to the EC's Commission's reorientation proposals and would maintain close contact with them as the Community negotiations on these and as the GATT discussions develop.  I am glad to inform the House of some progress on <Col N="1106" /> this commitment.  Shortly after the programme was agreed and prior to the February meeting of the Council of Ministers at which the CAP reorientation ideas were discussed, I had a very useful meeting with the farm organisations.  At that meeting, we arranged that further regular meetings would take place.</P>
    <P>There is a further important commitment in the programme that the Government will review all national policies relating to the agriculture and food sector and negotiate with the farm organisations a new development programme for the sector.  On this subject of consultation I have accepted a recommendation of the Agricultural Policy Review Group that a forum involving representatives of farmers, food processors, workers, consumers and environmental groups should meet annually to consider aspects of current agricultural policy with a view to obtaining a wider input into the policy formulation area.</P>
    <P>These various provisions of the programme should leave nobody in doubt as to the Government's commitment to maintaining the agricultural and food sector as a crucial and vibrant part of this economy.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to a number of the more specific undertakings in the programme which underline this commitment in the short to medium term.</P>
    <P>On structures the programme provides a number of important commitments. The extension and reclassification of the disadvantaged areas is clearly of major importance.  I expect a formal proposal will be made by the Commission to the Council of Agriculture Ministers in the near future and I am hopeful that the final decision to be approved by Council will be in line with the Department submission which proposed that two million acres &mdash; 72 per cent of the total area of the country &mdash; be classified as disadvantaged. I have also agreed that an effective appeals system, including resurveying where necessary, will be put in place as soon as the Commission proposal on extension of the areas is transmitted to the Council.  It is my intention that it <Col N="1107" /> will be an independent appeals tribunal which will sit at various locations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>A further major development agreed in the programme was that the increase and modulation of headage rates originally intended to apply in 1992 will be brought forward to 1991.  The full benefit of the revised headage scheme payments in respect of 1991 should, on this basis, be £100 million compared to £67 million previously.</P>
    <P>Standard costings used for farm investment aid schemes will be indexed to apply from 1 August each year, starting in 1991, based on appropriate CSO figures.  I know that this issue has been a source of concern for a number of years for farm organisations and I am glad that the new programme has finally laid the issue to rest.</P>
    <P>On livestock products, the country has, at present, its highest ever level of stocking. This fact is an important commentary on the investment made by farmers in recent years and on their confidence, as well as on the progress made over the years in the production of fodder.  I am very conscious that maintaining high stock levels, particularly of beef cows and sheep, is important in sustaining farm output and income.  Thus, I was pleased to agree in the programme that policy measures aimed at keeping stock levels up would be kept under review.  In line with this, the Minister for Finance, announced in the budget that the existing provisions would be extended for a further two years.</P>
    <P>A further matter of considerable concern to farmers was also addressed in the programme.  There is a commmitment that the Government will, as appropriate, through national action and, if necessary, seeking to have the relevant community regulation amended, ensure that the tendering system for intervention purchases of beef is properly operated so that cattle prices to farmers fairly reflect the benefits of intervention prices for our beef.  All interests in the beef sector have realised that the development of the industry must be market led rather than <Col N="1108" /> support driven.  This requires a national effort from producer through to processor to exporter to deliver the high value-added products the consumer wants and to adapt to new needs and tastes in supermarkets and other retail outlets.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to the implementation of schemes and programmes aimed at improving the marketing and quality of Irish food is also explicitly signalled in the programme.  Public funding for CBF was increased by £250,000 in 1990 and by £1.5 million in 1991.  CBF have a policy of promoting the sale of quality Irish beef in supermarket outlets.  In line with this policy a promising CBF promotion was held in the prestigious El Cortes Ingles hypermarket in Spain in November 1989 and this will be followed up by other special promotions which I myself will launch in Spain next month.  The success can be judged by the rapid increase in interest in Irish beef from other premium retail groups.  These follow a very successful campaign in premium retail chains in Italy in which I was happy to take part. I saw at first hand the excellent reception for Irish beef and the work and effort which has to go into ensuring top standards of quality, packaging and product development at all times.  Irish beef was promoted in six premium retail chains. The reason for the success is largely that Irish beef is seen as being produced under natural conditions.  We must guard and enhance this image.  In this connection I welcome CBF's work on a quality assurance scheme for beef.  This will build on the remarkable success with the pigmeat quality mark.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to maintaining an adequate level of support for CBF in future years in the context of an overall industry programme, including additional industry financing, for greater emphasis on promotion and marketing of Irish meat.</P>
    <P>A very unwelcome problem besetting the beef industry has been a tendency to use the illegal growth promoter known as Angel Dust.  I have introduced stringent regulations to deal with the situation and <Col N="1109" /> I am determined to stamp out this problem. In order to supplement testing at factory level, under an EC approved plan, I established a special team to ensure these regulations are observed at farm level.  This intensive campaign will continue on a countrywide basis and offending herdowners will be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>The resolution of this problem is clearly within the control of the industry itself.  It faces a clear choice whether it wishes to embark down the road of creating an industry dependent on the use of these substances.  I am satisfied, and I think most people would agree with me, that it is not the direction in which we should go.  The confidence of consumers, the reputation of our beef industry and our access to vital export markets are at stake.  They cannot be risked by the irresponsible action of a small group, and I am taking the most stringent action to protect and maintain the quality and reputation of our beef on international markets.</P>
    <P>Ireland must be recognised as the European country with the cleanest water and air, which produces fresh food in a wholesome environment.  Environmental considerations will impinge more and more on food production, as there are already clear indications that manufacturers and consumers are conscious both of health considerations and of the impact which food production systems have on the world we live in.  Ireland's image of a relatively clean, unpolluted country which produces food with low use of chemical inputs is of enormous benefit in the context of this new emphasis on the availability of unadulterated foodstuffs.  However, we cannot be content to live on our reputation.  There is a need to offer well graded, well presented, quality products to the consumer.  Much improvement in quality standards has taken place over the past four years but it is only by constant diligence that we can maintain and improve that market image.</P>
    <P>There is also a commitment in the programme that the necessary resources will be provided to enable Teagasc to provide <Col N="1110" /> an effective and integrated service covering education and training, advice and research.</P>
    <P>The need to eradicate bovine TB in the context of the stricter requirements which will arise from the Single Market is obvious.  The programme renews the Government's commitment to the eradication campaign, which will be based on an improved programme to be implemented over the next three years, including adequate research and removal of all sources of infection.  It will ensure that this programme is adequately financed until it is brought to a successful conclusion.  In the context of overall funding for the scheme, including EC funding, the programme also committed the Government to examining the question of financing an adequate income supplement scheme for herdowners whose herds are restricted because of TB outbreaks to alleviate the hardship incurred.</P>
    <P>In this context I particularly welcome the decision taken in Brussels last week to approve the revised TB eradication programme for the next three years.  Subject to ratification by the Commission, this will mean a refund of 50 per cent of reactor compensation payments and is estimated to be worth over £30 million over the three years.  I am particularly pleased at the initiative I took at the Council during our Presidency to ensure that a veterinary fund would be set up throughout the EC on which we could draw to support our ERAD-TB programme. That has now been finally put in place and it will be of immense benefit to Irish farmers and, of course, to the hard-pressed Irish taxpayer.  The funding will make a considerable contribution to the operation and financing of the ERAD Programme.  I believe if the various interests work together we are poised to make a significant breakthrough towards the eradication of TB in the national herd.  Since ERAD was established the programme has been strengthened considerably and it would be foolish not to capitalise on the progress which has been made.</P>
    <P>I am very committed to the promotion of rural development as an integral part <Col N="1111" /> of the adjustment which farming and rural areas will have to face during the coming years.  I announced the introduction of the operational programme for rural development at the end of last year and this is now in the process of being implemented.  I am also pleased about the commitment in the programme to establish a national programme for rural development.  This will draw on the experience of the pilot programme which operated over the 1988-90 period and other initiatives of a similar nature.</P>
    <P>Another important development is the EC own initiative on rural development known as LEADER.  The purpose of this project is to provide funding to encourage local communities to devise and initiate an integrated approach to the development of their own areas.  These groups will be selected by the EC Commission in consultation with my Department on the basis of a business plan submitted by these groups for their own areas.  It is my intention to ensure that these funds will be available as widely as possible.  I expect that the LEADER proposals will be adopted by the EC Commission by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>In the section on farm taxation, the programme makes a commitment that discussions will be held between the farm organisations and the Revenue Commissioners on simplifying the farm profile and extending its use to the maximum number of farmers.  I am confident that these discussions can be brought to a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <P>A further area in which agreement was reached within the programme was on the continuation until 1993 of the 50 per cent accelerated capital allowances for approved expenditure incurred by farmers within the framework of the existing grants schemes for the control of farmyard pollution.</P>
    <P>I have chosen only a number of the key features relating to agriculture and food which are covered in the programme. Time does not permit a more exhaustive treatment of all the important measures. However, I think it is clear from what I <Col N="1112" /> have said that the Government's commitment to the sector remains very strong.  I am committed to continuing an effective dialogue with the farming organisations and the food industry as we face into very difficult negotiations at EC and GATT level.</P>
    <P>The underlying principle of this programme, that of attempting to arrive at a consensus approach to problems, thus sharing responsibility for solutions, is relevant in the agricultural sector also.  At political level, I will obviously negotiate to secure the best possible future for the Irish agricultural and food industry. These efforts will have to be matched by changes at both farm and industry level as we face the major challenges of the markets of the nineties.  I believe that the overall framework of the new programme and the specific provisions concerning agriculture provide a solid base for facing these challenges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am grateful to have this opportunity to speak briefly on the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  On the face of it it is a three-year detailed programme and a less detailed ten-year strategy, the former being incorporated in the latter. At face value it seems to me to be a very bad programme indeed.  It is certainly not a plan.  It is a most inadequate programme which does not deal with the principal issues facing the country.  On the other hand, it does contain a pay agreement which, by and large, is a good one negotiated by the social partners and Government which will maintain the competitiveness of Irish industry.  If the pay agreement remains on schedule over the next three years it will be of benefit to our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the negotiating process to arrive at that pay agreement is what gave rise to the difficulty in the programme.  The social partners, to ensure the type of pay agreement they considered desirable, decided to sweeten the deal by a whole series of arrangements for which they did not have to pay themselves.  Naturally, the employers' side, if they could trade off a low pay agreement against extra <Col N="1113" /> expenditure on education, health, social welfare or reduced taxation, were quite willing to agree without examining its details to any great extent because they they were not going to pay for it anyway. It was the same on the trade union side and in the case of the main farming organisations.</P>
    <P>The faults of the programme arise immediately from the negotiation process in order to achieve what I would consider to be a good pay agreement. Quite clearly the main negotiators were the representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  At present the dominant influence there is that of the public service unions and, from their point of view, they made a rather good deal. Because the employers will not have to pay for much of the programme's proposals except the pay side, they made the agreement.  What is good in the programme is the pay deal but the very negotiation process of that pay deal has sowed the seeds of what will be a very bad programme for economic and social development through the nineties.</P>
    <P>The Government have sold out on the children of this country and on the unemployed in this programme.  I shall deal with that at greater length later.  First I should like to comment on the issue of public service pay.  Much has been said about public service pay recently, a great deal of it adverse.  I dealt with it in my reply to the budget, saying that one would think that public servants were some kind of saboteurs undermining our economy. People tend to forget that public servants, in a spirit of self-sacrifice in 1987, deferred pay agreements to which they were entitled.  Those chickens are now coming home to roost.  The deferral agreements made in good faith in 1987 must now be honoured and the pay bill met in 1991 and 1992, because that is what was agreed at the time.  If there was a fault on anyone's side it was on the side of the Government who pretended that their progress in fiscal correction was more rapid than it was because they did not draw public attention to the IOUs to the public service out there which allowed <Col N="1114" /> them make progress at the start which has to be paid for now.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with the overall public sector pay bill.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance &mdash; which he answered on Tuesday &mdash; asking him what percentage of public expenditure was accounted for by public service pay; in 1991 what was the Finance Estimate and what was it in the last year of the last Government in 1986.  The Estimate for 1991 is that pay and pensions will represent 55 per cent of all public spending whereas in 1986 it was 46.8 per cent.  Therefore, as a percentage of public spending, the public pay bill has risen by 8.2 per cent since the present Taoiseach resumed office in 1987 in a minority Government and continued in this Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Everybody will tell you the Minister for Labour is doing a great job.  If he is doing a mighty job he is now doing it at a very significant price, because you would have to search a long way through the records of this House to see the proportion of public expenditure dedicated to the pay bill rise by 8.2 per cent against a background of such low inflation over a short period.  In itself that would not be remarkable had it not occurred against the most expensive redundancy scheme introduced by the public or private sector.  A colossally expensive public service redundancy scheme was introduced. Taxpayers are still paying for approximately 9,500 civil servants shed from the pay bill.  What is happening now?  This programme, without any evaluation of the merit of those decisions, is hiring extra public servants into the very areas where they were bought out at such expense.  When we look at the pay bill now as a proportion of public spending we must also remember that the public spending figures of the last couple of years have been inflated dramatically by the Structural Funds coming from Europe.  Therefore, at the very time one would think that the public service pay bill would be reducing as a proportion of total spending, it has risen catastrophically. The Government will have to do something about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> It is not enough for the Government to constantly trim the non pay element in the voted amounts for the Departments as they come before this House.  What will happen is that we will have county council workers who will not have the tarmacadam to fill the potholes, the people in the corporation will be asked to repair houses but they will not have the materials to do so and doctors and nurses in the hospitals will not have the medical and paramedical equipment they need.  Already when one visits the hospitals one sees the tatty state of the wards where light switches and lamp shades are broken, plugs will not work and the wards badly need a coat of paint.  What is happening in an attempt to hold public expenditure is that the whole non pay side has been cut back to a point that makes it impossible for public servants to deliver their service efficiently.  At the same time the pay bill is rising enormously.</P>
    <P>That said, it is a good pay agreement that has been put in place, but the Government will now have to bring forward a major redundancy scheme which they will stick to, to reduce the numbers of public servants.  The Government will have to do that in a manner which discriminates between the vast majority of public servants who are excellent, and the minority who are not doing their job and who the public knows are not doing their job.  There is no point in bringing in redundancy schemes to take out the good teacher while the bad teacher remains in the system.  A public redundancy programme, if the Government are to attack this issue, will have to be selective.  It will have to encourage the good, the vast majority who want to do their jobs, who want clear career paths through the public service, who want the same kind of reward and incentive schemes one will get in the private sector.  All boats cannot rise together.  The price of that is that the public service unions will have to take on responsibility for agreeing that all things are not equal in terms of the delivery of service, and that there is a small minority in the public service who do not deliver <Col N="1116" /> a service at all.  They are the people who should be attracted out by proper redundancy schemes, as it were.</P>
    <P>The tax element of this programme seems to be dominated by the ideology of the Progressive Democrats.  The intellectual basis for this programme is the NESC report &ldquo;A Strategy for the Nineties&rdquo;. The report deals with the issue of tax reform but what has been agreed in this programme runs counter to what the NESC put on the table.  Curiously enough the main players in Government were in the NESC.  The civil servant mainly responsible for this strategy chairs the NESC.  The trade union representatives were there as were the farmers' and the employers' representatives.  The only people here who were not involved in the NESC report were the Progressive Democrat Ministers.  It seems that the change in tax strategy between this document and the NESC can only be explained by the fact that we have ideologically driven Progressive Democrat people now participating in Government who are advocating a tax policy that does not stand up to the extravagant claims made for it, and which is in effect an appeal by the greedy to the greedy.  I do not believe the claims that are being made in terms of job creation for the reduction in marginal tax rates.  That does not stand up to any serious tax analysis. What we should be doing is ensuring that the vast bulk of income of ordinary workers, especially those on the average industrial wage, is being taxed at the standard rate.  There is no point in pulling down the standard rate of tax from 30 per cent to 29 per cent and pretending that that is tax reform when the bands, allowances, PAYE allowances, PRSI allowances and everything else are not being indexed and when one has the fiscal drag of 3 per cent inflation taking away any benefit that could occur from reducing the marginal rates of tax.  I am in fundamental disagreement with what the Progressive Democrats have stuffed down the throat of the Government.  I will expand on that when I have more time and will bring forward as a witness to what I am saying the report on tax <Col N="1117" /> reform in the NESC document which was the genesis of this programme and to which the people who negotiated this programme signed their names.  The only difference was that there was not a Progressive Democrat present at the NESC talks.</P>
    <P>The major problem with this programme is that it caters for those who are at work and does nothing for the unemployed or the young emigrants.  I understand that there is a facility now for having statistical tables included in the record.  One day at the end of November when I had little to do I was putting some figures together, before I had any information on Government finances. On the basis of a growth in GNP of 6¼ per cent in 1991 and 6½ per cent after that, I ran certain numbers.  Curiously, if the Government were to balance the budget in 1993, which is their commitment, and if they were to borrow 1½ per cent of GNP to the year 2000 to fund the capital programme, on the basis of those calculations the debt GNP ratio would be just over 74 per cent.  The commitment in the programme is 75 per cent. The basis of the calculation I used is very close to the basis of the calculation here. The trouble is that when all that is done, one keeps current spending at about the same level, GNP grows, some of it is dedicated to reducing the debt and some of it is dedicated to ongoing programmes but there is nothing left to invest in jobs. This programme is not only committed to removing the current budget deficit by 1993 but to increasing expenditure by about £600 million.  The commitments to fiscal rectitude and to expanding public expenditure amount to around £900 million.  That is not compatible with a current budget deficit which is to be eliminated by 1993 nor is it compatible with a debt-GNP ratio of 75 per cent by the end of the decade.  Even if we were to give the Government the benefit of the doubt and take the most optimistic set of forecasts, we have a situation where the social partners and the Government have committed us to a strategy for the nineties which simply keeps those at work employed, which envisages a live register <Col N="1118" /> of almost a quarter of a million persons right through the nineties and ongoing emigration of 20,000.  The FÁS consensus should not prevent us in this House from saying that we do not agree with a programme for the nineties that writes off 30 per cent of our population and does not make any provision for them.  This <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> cannot be a cosy arrangement where the haves will continue to have at the expense of the have nots.  It is not a programme for all the people.  It is a programme for some of the people.  I would suggest, as things have begun to fall out at the start of this year, that it will be a programme for fewer and fewer people as time passes.</P>
    <P>I would refer the House to an article on page 15 of <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning. This gives a list, although not a full list, of all the redundancies notified in the last three weeks in the key manufacturing sectors around the country.  There is a frightening message in it.  I hope it is not the pattern for the year.  If it is I have no doubt that by Easter we will be looking at a live register of more than a quarter of a million people.  This figure is now at 240,000.  We are also looking at a situation where annual emigration will continue at about 30,000, provided that there is somewhere for those people to go.  The experience in our constituencies has been that our emigrants came home for Christmas but because of recession in the UK and in the US and because of the Gulf War they have not gone back and will not go back.  The seeds of an explosive situation have been sown in every community in the country and this document does not take that into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>From the contributions made here today, the authors of the programme should feel well pleased.  Opposition speakers have said volubly that the programme does not go far enough in regard to tax reform, wages, employment and many other sector headings.  Naturally Government speakers have applauded the same programme and listed its many good points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> I could very easily spend my time extolling the virtues of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  It would not be a difficult task to undertake because it contains many laudable and commendable features.  The programme has received much acclaim both inside and outside the House and very deservedly so.  I could litanise its merits and I do not wish that the rest of my contribution should be seen as taking unduly from the undoubted merits of the programme. However, I am perturbed by some aspects and I wish to place my concern on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>It is said that the difference between an optimist and a pessimist is best illustrated by how each looks at a glass of water.  One sees it as half full, the other as half empty.  Although I should like to think of myself as an optimist in life, I have some doubts about the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  This would appear to be looking a gift horse in the mouth, given the success of its predecessor, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Without any shadow of doubt, the latter programme was instrumental in rescuing this country from financial bankruptcy.  The period of its operation from 1987 to 1990 marked a turning point in the depressing downward spiral of the previous ten years.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was soundly based, pragmatic and took a realistic approach to our economic difficulties of some years ago.  Combined with tough and often politically unpopular Government decisions, the country succeeded in turning away from the abyss of economic and financial chaos.</P>
    <P>The financial chaos of 1987 and preceding years did not come about overnight. To arrive at that deplorable and very desperate situation took some doing.  Blame can be pretty evenly apportioned across the political spectrum. All political parties here, with the exception of the Green Party, which was then non-existent, can ignobly claim their share of the blame.  We all blamed outside influences, world economic conditions <Col N="1120" /> and so on but we know that we, the politicians, were the real culprits.</P>
    <P>The period of the last programme brought about a fair amount of growing up for political parties, trade unions and other groups.  Politicians have more or less realised that the electorate is not as stupid as they, the politicians, always assume.  They do not have to spoonfeed the electorate with more and more nonsense or keep throwing taxpayers' or borrowed money back at them just to keep them electorally happy.  The electorate will growl at tough decisions but political parties gain their respect if they operate to a better long term strategy.</P>
    <P>In principle I am not opposed to national agreements on pay and conditions between employers and employees but I have some doubts about the present programme.  The said doubts could be categorised under a number of headings but my overall concern is the effect that this programme will have on State finances.  My <i>caveats</i> about the programme can be sub-divided under three main headings: first, the scope of the programme as it relates to non-pay areas and whether this should be a matter only between the Government and the social partners; secondly, the public pay element of the programme; thirdly the long term commitments of the programme and the ultimate cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>To be fair, neither the Government nor the trade unions have ever made any secret of their wish that this programme should be an all-embracing, long term strategy for the nineties, not just a pay settlement.  I can certainly see the merits in having a coherent, sound partnership approach to running Ireland incorporated, pursuing agreed goals and objectives in harmony with all interests. From the trade union viewpoint I can readily appreciate their desire to be on the inside track.</P>
    <P>In the budget debate last week I referred to my doubts about what I termed the anti-democratic nature of having such a broad programme without participation by the elected Members of <Col N="1121" /> Dáil Éireann.  There is little in the programme that anyone could disagree with regarding objectives under various governmental headings as outlined in the sections.  Furthermore, it is difficult for me to visualise a forum in which Dáil Éireann could participate in formulating such a national programme.  To me the list of objectives reads like a legitimate programme of goals that any good Government should set themselves or, if one were to be uncharitable, it reads like a party political election manifesto. Surely the elected representatives of the people must have some say.  I am already on record as saying that the ultimate logic of this programme is that people should go and join their local employers' organisation, trade union or IFA branch and ignore Dáil elections.  Real power will be seen to rest with such organisations.  If every area of national activity is to become the subject of negotiation between the social partners, why bother to have any ordinary Oireachtas Members?  All we need is a Government to negotiate with the social partners.  To some the foregoing points may appear a trifle academic but I believe they must be made.</P>
    <P>I turn next to the public sector provisions. The public service unions are very testy with anyone who voices even the mildest criticism regarding any aspect of pay or conditions for public servants. Constructive comment is thrown aside by their spokespersons as being anti-public sector.  Undoubtedly some comments are based on personal antagonism towards the public service, but I certainly am not one with any deep-rooted or ideological hang-ups about the public service.  Public sector trade union leaders are very much aware of their clout.  Perhaps some of them utilise the strategy of vitriolic abuse against anyone who voices comment or criticism on the basis of their collective political muscle.  Politicians, being in the front line of susceptibility to public pressure groups and on the understandable basis that public servants make up a large part of the electorate in any constituency, may be somewhat wary of treading this ground.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> I believe in the old maxim that the labourer is worthy of his hire.  Such logic dictates that persons employed in the public sector are also entitled to be rewarded adequately for their work, skill and endeavour.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is my personal belief that the State cannot afford the levels of pay rise agreed in the programme as it relates to the public sector.  In my view there is a vast difference between negotiating wage rounds between employers and employees in the non-State area and in reaching agreement with the public sector.  In the non-State area market forces will dictate and force, if necessary, an employer who concedes excessive wage demands either to reduce his wage costs by layoffs and/or greater productivity and if the long term imbalance is not corrected it will finally put him out of business.  In simple terms if an employer's wage costs are out of line with those of his competitors at home or abroad, he is forced to comply with market conditions.  This is not true of the protective employment which those in the public sector enjoy.  What is the market mechanism which regulates total wage costs in the public sector?  Short term there is none.  In the long term the ultimate sanction is the State's financial bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>The public service conciliation and arbitration scheme is not a market mechanism. It is an outmoded and outdated system to determine special pay awards and relativities.  As a bargaining measure I would have expected the Government, if they were so anxious to have a national agreement which incorporated the public sector, to insist at the very minimum on fundamental changes in the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  I am aware that the programme includes a memorandum of understanding in annex I to appendix A, but I do not believe that this memorandum represents a fundamental change.  The scheme should be scrapped in its entirety.</P>
    <P>Earlier I expressed some doubts about broad aspects of the programme, but accepting the reality that national wage agreements are here for some time to <Col N="1123" /> come I believe that the public sector wage deal need not necessarily be part of future agreements.  It is like trying to mix oil and water.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and its predecessor have been endeavouring to coincide the interests of mutually exclusive sectors, employers and employees in the open market arena and the State and its employees in the sheltered sector. There is no evidence to suggest that at any given time all these interests will coincide.  To try to put an overall package together which will suit all of these mutually exclusive interests is an incorrect strategy.</P>
    <P>From 1987 to 1990 stringent controls were effected on the cost of public pay to the Exchequer.  Notwithstanding this, the cost has risen as a percentage of current spending.  The wage element of the programme may have released a Scud missile on the public financial discipline imposed over the past three years.  I wish to deal with the programme's commitments and its overall effect on the public finances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had been speaking in a debate such as this five or ten years ago I might have painted a bleak but not unfamiliar scenario of the period.  That scenario would include up to one million man-days lost through industrial disputes.  The past year would have been notable for several crippling disputes which caused considerable <Col N="1124" /> hardship to members of the public.  The most difficult and intractable of these disputes would have been in the public service. Inflation would have been in double figures, largely as a result of pay settlements which we could not afford in either the private or public sectors.  The debt-GNP ratio would have continued to increase.</P>
      <P>I could continue for some time in this vein but I hope I have made my point. This was a scenario which was all too commom in the last few decades and which I could be describing now once again were it not for the good sense of the Government and the social partners to arrive at pragmatic and balanced programmes for economic and social development covering six years in all. While I am realistic enough to accept that there may be difficulties we should, with the new programme, continue on the same path as the last three years.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is unprecedented in the depth of its coverage and content and on that basis is more comprehensive than any similar agreements elsewhere in Western Europe, Scandinavia included.</P>
      <P>It is of course by reason of its comprehensiveness that it has given rise to a debate about the role of Parliament and motions such as that put forward by the Labour Party in relation to this debate.</P>
      <P>The reality about this issue is, however, that the Government of the day have a democratic mandate to enter into agreements of this nature and Parliament has the right to accept or reject.  As the Taoiseach said yesterday, legislation on money arising from the programme has to be passed or rejected by the House in due course anyway.  In considering the achievements of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> it is important to realise that in 1987 this country was in a state of crisis, a crisis of such depth, despair and hopelessness that the very nature of our political institutions was being questioned.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> brought this country back from the edge of financial bankruptcy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worthwhile recalling the success of <Col N="1125" /> that programme as we face into the next three years.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> had unique benefits for all the main parties &mdash; Government, farmers, employers and unions.  It provided a period of economic and social stability which allowed businesses to plan ahead on the basis of known costs.  The fact that wages were set for a period of three years at low levels provided advantages in terms of competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> our main trading partners.  Employers were able to spend more time on activities related to the important task of providing quality products at the right price instead of warding off prospective disputes over pay.</P>
    <P>For the record the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> reduced Government borrowing from 12.8 per cent of GNP to about 2 per cent; brought the debt-GNP ratio down from 131 per cent to 115 per cent; reduced the current budget deficit from 6.5 per cent to 1 per cent; led to growth rates of about 4 per cent per annum; increased fixed investment by about 8 per cent per annum as against a decline per annum of 4 per cent in the preceding five years; helped bring inflation to the lowest level of any European Community country, contrasting starkly with the position in the UK; brought interest rates to two percentage points above those of Germany &mdash; in 1987 the difference was almost 8 per cent; increased numbers at work by a net 40,000 while gross job creation in the private sector exceeded 100,000; reduced the numbers on the live register substantially &mdash; it stood at 250,000 at the end of 1987 and was rising by the month; delivered over £800 million in tax concessions; increased real take-home pay by between 4 per cent to 9 per cent; reduced working time for those working 40 hours or more.</P>
    <P>Man days lost through industrial disputes in 1989 fell to the lowest level since the last world war.  Strike levels have fallen dramatically and there are hardly any disputes about pay.  All this amounts to a unique achievement in industrial relations in this country, with obvious <Col N="1126" />&ldquo;spin-offs&rdquo; in terms of increased production at home and the creation of an extra important incentive for the attraction of further investment.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of employees, real wages increased substantially for the first time in many years.  The employment losses of the early eighties were replaced by a similar employment gain.  Net employment, as I have already stated, in the three years up to April 1990 increased by 40,000.</P>
    <P>We have set a new pattern for industrial relations.  Our aim now must be not to rest on our laurels but during the next three years to consolidate that position and, if possible, improve on it so that we can attain conflict levels on a par with the lowest in Western Europe.  We must challenge the usefulness of our adversarial system of industrial relations and move towards spreading the consensus which exists at national level throughout the economy and down to the level of individual industries and enterprises.</P>
    <P>The amazing fact is &mdash; and I use the word amazing advisedly &mdash; that all this was achieved while at the same time the standard of living of social welfare recipients was protected and substantial income tax reductions granted.  Longterm social welfare benefits increased by 27 per cent while all benefits were protected against inflation.  On income tax, reliefs totalling more than £800 million were provided and the standard rate was cut from 35 per cent to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>These last two features are also prominent factors of the new programme.</P>
    <P>As regards social welfare, the Government are committed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to an ongoing reform of the social welfare system, to continue to protect social welfare rates against inflation and to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  During the term of the programme the Government are committed to improving the level of payments to the tune of £400 million in 1990 terms.  We are committed to the achievement of the Commission on Social Welfare's priority rate for all by 1993.  Thereafter, social welfare rates <Col N="1127" /> will be increased in accordance with the commission's recommendations as the resources of the economy grow.  The extra cost of achieving the commission's main rates is £327 million in 1990 terms.</P>
    <P>The new programme recognises the role that the family income supplement plays in directing resources to lower paid workers while preserving the incentive to work.  The £165 million improvement in family income supplement and the child related tax exemptions mean that families on low pay can be better off than if they were claiming social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that while so much was said in the autumn about low pay, in this debate only one or two speakers mentioned the issue.  That speaks for itself.  School-going children up to 21 can now be included for consideration for FIS and the restriction on the amount of the payment based on family size will no longer apply.</P>
    <P>A family with four children and on £160 a week will now be 36 per cent better off working than if they were receiving unemployment benefit with pay-related benefit.  The child-related tax measure will benefit some 98,000 workers with 154,000 children.  This again addresses an issue that was crying out to be tackled by the Government.</P>
    <P>On income tax, the standard rate will be reduced to 25 per cent and there will be further movement towards a single higher rate.</P>
    <P>The programme, however, is not just confined to pay, tax and social welfare. Let me take a few further examples of its wide coverage.  On fiscal policy, the national debt-GNP ratio will be reduced towards 100 per cent by 1993, with a longer-term target of a level on a par with that in the European Community in general.  On health policy, we will shortly be providing free access to hospital consultant services for the whole population. Extra funding is being provided to health boards for community health services to help the elderly and the handicapped to live in their own communities.  On education, which is so important in terms <Col N="1128" /> of economic development, provision has been made for the lowering of pupilteacher ratios at both primary and secondary levels, the introduction of a six-year cycle at post-primary level and greater resources to remedy disadvantaged in education.  Special provision will be made for 60 additional posts for schools in disadvantaged areas.  A Green Paper on education will be published this summer, followed by a White Paper in 1992 and an Education Act in due course after that.</P>
    <P>These provisions illustrate the fundamental nature of the new PESP which covers all areas of economic and social activity.  Other aspects of the programme relate to areas more related to my own responsibilities in the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>The creation of employment must remain our main national priority.  The overall objective of this programme &mdash; and other programmes that follow it &mdash; must be to reduce unemployment to manageable levels by the end of this decade. As I mentioned earlier, a start has been made but we must continue with the work.  Unemployment continues to be an enormous drain on our resources.  I think a number of people do not understand precisely the amount of money we spend on both unemployment and training in this country; we are surpassed only by Denmark in the OECD area in terms of such expenditure as a percentage of GNP.</P>
    <P>Of particular concern are the long term unemployed.  For years FÁS have run a number of programmes for the long term unemployed, the best known probably being the social employment scheme. While these have been very successful, they have only been available in a piecemeal way and they cannot therefore form a coherent programme.  What we now need is a new integrated programme which will harness the resources of local communities and the State resources of the relevant State agencies.  The new reponse under the programme, which will be implemented shortly will be based <Col N="1129" /> firmly in local areas, will have local communities as primary movers, will integrate existing initiative and incorporate the principle of &ldquo;progression&rdquo; with an eventual goal of gaining real qualifications and thus a greatly improved chance of a real job.  It is in all of our interests to do everything we can to ensure this new response really works.</P>
    <P>A feature of the programme is its bias in favour of the lower paid and the pay increases coupled with improvements in the family income supplement should ensure welcome improvements in living standards for the categories involved.</P>
    <P>I remain of the view that a substantial contribution to the issue of low pay can be made through the system of joint labour committees which can set down legally enforceable minimum rates for specific categories of employees and in that way strike a balance between market forces and the need to protect vulnerable employees.  The Labour Court at the moment is completing an investigation into the feasibility of a joint labour committee for the retail trade which could see the number of workers covered by joint labour committees double in a matter of months.  A finding by the court is expected shortly, and if that happens it will remove a great number of people from the trap and it will give them cover, which they never had.  In this connection, I would draw attention to the powers of the new Labour Relations Commission to examine the question whether new joint labour committees should be established or the terms of reference of existing committees amended.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the progress which has been made in legislation during the course of the last programme.  This has been sought by the trade union movement and workers generally and it is of great benefit and assistance to them.  It will work itself through during the course of this programme. There is a new rationalised manpower arrangement in the shape of FÁS delivering assistance to 55,000 unemployed persons per year; a new Health and Safety Act widening the safety coverage from 20 per cent to the <Col N="1130" /> whole workforce; an Industrial Relations Act which amounts to the most fundamental review of industrial relations law since the last war; my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare has a Bill before the House which will cover part-time workers; and I have a Bill before the House to cover part-time workers under the various labour legislation which they have been excluded from for many years.</P>
    <P>The pay provisions are obviously a key element of the agreement as a number of speakers said this afternoon.  I think the pay increases have been widely accepted as representing a balanced response to protecting living standards while at the same time ensuring we maintain competitiveness in relation to our main trading partners.</P>
    <P>What small criticism of the programme there has been has come from predictable sources and have had the same tone as similar criticisms of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in 1987.  Much of the criticism has been directed at the level of pay in the public sector.  In the time available I want to answer some of that criticism.  In my view this criticism is unfairly directed at public service workers whose numbers have been substantially reduced in recent years and who, in spite of this, continue to provide excellent services to the community.  It is only fair to point out in this connection that most of the workers concerned are at the lower end of the pay scale.</P>
    <P>The world has changed drastically in the past few years.  The pillars on which the political organisation of Eastern Europe were based fell with the Berlin Wall.  The ideology on which such political organisation was established also foundered.  A new consensus on what should be the nature of political organisation based on the Western European democratic tradition has emerged.  It is in the light of such changes that developments here at home must be seen.  The future lies in achieving the correct balance between the different interests in our society and not allowing any one particular interest to dominate the others. This amounts to the creation of a delicate <Col N="1131" /> equation with many variables and the achievement of such a balance is not easy. It is always easier, as in the case of the handful of so-called independent economists and other critics who have criticised the programme, to have only one variable, to have only one point of view which dominates all others.  From that standpoint it is easy to adopt what is in effect a one-sided and intemperate position.</P>
    <P>In my view, however, we should move towards co-operation and consensus not just on economic and social policy but also in our industries and enterprises throughout the country.  This is the way to beat off greater competition and to create the jobs we badly need.  It is in this context that I welcome the fact that a joint declaration on employee involvement in the private sector is to be published shortly.  This new approach is an indication of where industrial relations are going in this country.</P>
    <P>There have been other criticisms of the programme.  In the current economic climate the Government felt that a balance has to be struck between the efficient and effective management of the economy and the achievement of increased living standards and greater social equity.  In essence that is what the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is about and it is my firm hope that programmes of this nature will shape the future of our economic and social relations in this country.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should point out that the programme has yet to be voted on and accepted by the trade unions.  The relevant vote, in the usual democratic tradition of the trade union movement, is to take place at a special delegate conference tomorrow.  It is my fervent hope that it will be accepted but I would not like to let this opportunity pass without paying tribute to the leadership of the Irish trade union movement which has displayed a very enlightened attitude in putting forward the idea of a ten-year strategy and in widening the collective bargaining agenda at national level from pay alone to other issues of an economic <Col N="1132" /> and policy nature of concern to us all as a nation.  While recognising and paying tribute to the role of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, I think we should not ignore the constructive contribution by the employers and farming groups, who put in a massive amount of time as well.</P>
    <P>The external environment has worsened. We have the Gulf War and recessions in the UK and the US.  We have a worsening outlook in respect of agriculture and we have increased competition for investment from Eastern Europe.  We are faced with increased competition in what is fast becoming a free global market.</P>
    <P>In these current world circumstances does anything but the type of programme we have just negotiated make any sense? I think the answer to that question has to be a resounding no.  We have a stable currency, low inflation and a growing economy.  Ireland has become a sound location for investment and the way to keep it that way is through programmes such as the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  It is only through creating the right climate for business and investment that we can create the jobs we need to bring unemployment down to tolerable levels.  Our objective by the year 2000 must be a social democracy on a par with the best in Western Europe. We must aim to couple a sound economy, a stable currency and low inflation with adequate care for the weakest in our society and tolerable levels of unemployment. The way to such a society is through programmes such as the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>. I have heard nothing from the Deputies opposite which could persuade the Government to take any other view.</P>
    <P>I recommend the motion and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to the House.</P>

      <P>I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Minister and the Government for their decision to agree to the Bill on Second Stage and allow it to be dealt with by a Special Committee of the House.  I would also like to pay tribute to Deputy Shatter for bringing the Bill forward.  One could certainly not accuse him of legislative inertia as he has been one of the more successful Deputies when it comes to forcing the pace of legislation.  On the other hand, it should be pointed out that too many Opposition Deputies have put across the view that the Minister, and his officials in the Department of Health, are taking a perverse pleasure in placing as many obstacles as possible in the way of legalising foreign adoptions.  They are being both unfair and unreasonable as, after all, the Minister has a responsibility not only to the children concerned but to the adoptive parents to ensure that as sound a legislative framework as possible is put in place with few opportunities to challenge the Bill in the courts following its passage.</P>
      <P>The dilemma we face is that, as legislators, we genuinely want to meet the wishes of the adoptive parents.  We have all been struck by their refreshing, sincere and selfless approach to this issue. Indeed, their enthusiasm is overwhelming. They are looking for the ideal solution &mdash; the adoptions recognised and questions such as succession rights dealt with as quickly as possible.  We have to reconcile this emotional need with the need to be absolutely sure that no legal difficulties will arise later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to frame legislation which will be in accordance with the Constitution, the European Convention on the Adoption of Children and the United Nations' Charter on the Rights of Children which we have signed.  They are instruments which we cannot circumvent.  As the House is aware, the Adoption Bill, 1988 was referred to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality.  Therefore, in framing the legislation genuine constitutional difficulties may have to be surmounted and this should be acknowledged.  In this regard I was struck by the performance of Deputy McCartan last night who more or less sought to put forward the ideal solution.  However, I respectfully suggest to him that if he were to make the same submission in the Supreme Court or, indeed, in the High <Col N="1143" /> Court it would not go very far as much of what he had to say would not stand up to scrutiny.  Nevertheless, I take his point that we must endeavour to facilitate the wishes of the parents to the greatest degree possible within the confines of the Constitution.  I would go so far as to say, as other Deputies have, that if need be we should make amendments to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is not fair to suggest that the Minister or the Government are deliberately placing obstacles in the way of this legislation. In many respects the decision to agree to the Second Stage of the Bill is evidence of our genuine commitment to face up to the issue.  It is also important that there be all-party consensus on this issue given that it is a very emotive and complex one. It should be dealt with by an all-party Special Committee of the House as happened in the case of the Child Care Bill.</P>
    <P>We accept the principle of the Bill and the Minister has made it clear that there are a number of defects in it which he intends to remedy at the Special Committee by way of amendment.  The issues about which we are most concerned are the adoption of children born within marriage and the question of the consent of the natural parents, a question which is not dealt with in the Bill.  The Law Reform Commission in their report did not deal with all the issues in a comprehensive way nor did they provide all of the answers.  As other Deputies are anxious to contribute to this debate, I will conclude and thank the Chair for allowing me to make the essential points.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats, on whose behalf I now speak, have no hesitation in giving their full support to this Bill.  We recognise, because of the recent rush of Romanian adoptions, that the question of foreign adoptions <Col N="1144" /> which was the subject of a Law Reform Commission report in June 1989 had to be addressed sooner rather than later. Hundreds of Irish citizens rightly looked to us as legislators to come up with Irish law to give full legal status to their newly adopted children.  A speedy response was called for.  We studied the Bill and recognised that the essential issues had been well addressed.  We concluded that any alternative draft legislation would not and could not vary fundamentally with the Bill and that any detail which needed to be determined could be so determined by an all party Select Committee.  Happily, that is now the case.</P>
      <P>This is a historic night in the House.  It is the first time in Dáil Éireann that a majority Government decided not to vote down a Private Members' Bill. Accordingly, not alone does it mark a major milestone in the history of law reform, it marks a major milestone in the history of Dáil reform.  A valuable precedent has now been set and my hope, and the hope of my party, is that what has happened tonight will happen more frequently in the future.  When new legislation, or an amendment to existing legislation is urgently needed, and where there is no fundamental policy difference between Government and Opposition, we see no justification whatsoever for the barren practice of voting down legislation initiated by Opposition Members as has happened consistently in the last 30 years. We have a huge backlog of law that needs to be updated.  It is only by continuing the intelligent approach adopted by the Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil Coalition, in this instance, that we can ever hope to make significant strides in the field of law reform.  The Progressive Democrats warmly commend Deputy Shatter for his initiative in bringing in this draft legislation and for the hard work he put into bringing it before the House.  We also warmly congratulate the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, for his open-minded and generous approach to the Bill.  All in all this is a good night for parliamentary democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge fully that there are shortcomings in the Bill and that a <Col N="1145" /> number of key areas need to be fully explored, developed and fine tuned, but surely the same can be said of most draft legislation that comes before the House. The essence of parliamentary debate is to provide for analysis, amendments and improvements to legislation as it passes through the House.  It may very well be that there are elements in this Bill that conflict with the Constitution and that must be confronted if it emerges.  It is an issue we cannot afford to shirk in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence that at the end of the day we will have good, comprehensive, workable legislation as a result of the deliberations of the Special Committee.  Moreover, I hope that proper procedures will be put in place to ensure that at all times the rights and welfare of the child are paramount.  In all adoption cases what is done is not finding children for parents; rather it is finding good, caring, loving parents for children. Some mistakes have been made here in the past but now the Special Committee, to whom this Bill will go after tonight's discussion, will have all the benefit of experience.  The Special Committee will be well positioned to ensure that strict criteria are laid down in relation to the suitability of adoptive parents, that the qualification of social workers is clearly monitored at all times and that adequate provision is made by health boards and adoption socities to enable the aims and objectives of this Bill to be facilitated fully.  In other words, due assistance will be given to adoptive parents both before and after adoption because that is so badly needed.</P>

      <P>The last point I want to make is that I hope that as a result of this discussion, and of the deliberations of the Special Committee, we will emerge with a heightened appreciation of the importance of children in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make one comment and I <Col N="1146" /> hope it is taken in the right spirit.  It is highly ironic that at a time when Romanian babies, and babies from other countries, are finding extremely good homes here there are in this city, and other cities in this Republic, a small number of children living in homes where they are suffering from severe economic social and emotional deprivation.  This issue will have to be confronted by Irish society.  The legislators do not have all the answers.  They have some of the answers, but I make this comment tonight because there is an obligation on all of us to stir the conscience of this nation and remind ourselves that we have an obligation, as was said in the Proclamation of 1916, to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  I hope that will be taken on board in this year, the 75th anniversary of that rising.</P>

      <P>I will confine myself.  First, I congratulate my constituency colleague Deputy Shatter.  This is the second time he has produced a Bill in Private Members' time which I support.  The Bill attempts to deal with a legal limbo in which Romanian and other foreign children adopted by Irish people find themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is arranging for health boards to undertake home study assessment for couples wishing to adopt from a foreign country.  I welcome this move. It is important to ensure that the suitability of couples seeking adoption <Col N="1147" /> abroad is properly assessed by a competent agency.  Most of the foreign authorities require home study, so it is important that prospective adoptive parents have safeguards for the welfare of the child.  I am aware Irish couples have difficulties in obtaining home study reports, and the proposed involvement of health boards in carrying out assessment for inter-country adoptions will ease the situation and facilitate suitable couples wishing to adopt abroad.  The Minister's initiative is also in harmony with the special provision of the UN Convention on the rights of the child which requires states to ensure that children involved in inter-country adoption enjoy standards and safeguards equivalent to those existing in the case of national adoption.  The call for a specialist agency to process applications for adoptions is unnecessary.  In my view the proposed involvement of health boards will obviate the need for specialist agencies.  The health boards already provide adoption services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The welcome from all sides of the House tonight, and on the other nights we debated this Bill, is a reflection of our responsibility and role as legislators in regard to, first, children and their rights and, secondly, the rights of parents giving their children for adoption and those who will have the joy of adopting children.  Let me commend and compliment Deputy Alan Shatter on introducing this Bill and the Minister and <Col N="1148" /> the House for accepting it and treating it in the way such an important and fundamental subject should be treated.</P>
      <P>I welcome also the establishment of a Special Committee, not merely this one, because each time a Special Committee of this House has been established it has been tremendously successful providing us legislators with a role we would not otherwise have had.  Above all, it has shown what a Legislature such as ours is capable of and can produce.  The constructive, productive operations of such a committee, with a commitment to a Bill such as this, should be expanded.  As Deputy Quill said, there is an enormous amount of legislation before this House of tremendous importance.  One positive reform we can bring about is the usage of such Special Committees and all-party consensus which would be fully commended by the electorate.</P>
      <P>My comments will be of a more general nature because I know that Deputies Shatter, McCartan and others have dealt with the various sections in a detailed, fundamental manner.  I agree with the points made by Deputy Shatter in his introductory remarks and by Deputy McCartan last evening.  I reinforce what they, and Deputy Quill, said, that this Bill is historic not merely from a national, parliamentary point of view in this Republic but in global terms.  We are introducing a Bill and adoption laws that must push out boundaries in the same way in which they have been so completely overturned within the last year or two with regard to economic, political and policy structures.  This means that any future legislation of ours must encompass that wider, global sphere.  It means also that the provisions of this Bill cannot be implemented within the more rigid, structured context of the European Convention of 1967 or our Constitution of 1937, all the more so realising the rapid transformation that has taken place in world politics within the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In responding to the reservations expressed by the Minister, and Members on that side of the House, I would say that we should not think of any future legislation merely in terms of our national <Col N="1149" /> interests but also in terms of international law and the laws of other countries.  This should not mean or imply that the laws of other countries are of a lower standard nor should we have the arrogance to suggest that ours are superior to those of other countries.  For instance, we, and prospective adoptive parents, have to be satisfied that the standards and laws pertaining to adoption in Romania are perfectly acceptable and protective of the child and natural mother, indeed of the parents if both are involved.  We must keep a broad, open mind on such issues and ensure that we are not confined to the factors that restrict some of our national legislation.</P>
    <P>Although it is a debate for another day I have argued that our 1937 Constitution, while written with the greatest sense of responsibility to citizen's rights, is now applicable in an utterly changed world, not merely one of attitudes or of politics but of the very structures of home life, long term relationships and units.  Our Constitution still recognises only those units classified as &ldquo;married&rdquo; within the strict rigid Irish context or interpretation. In this country, still regarded as being a conservative, that type of unit is not recognised as the norm.  Henceforth we must bear in mind that there will be other long term relationships or units that do not go through the legal process we accept.  For instance, in the Netherlands I have been informed that there has been much debate, perhaps even legislation at this stage, in favour of all kinds of loving couples, relationships, units of a familyentity type which should be recognised. Indeed, they will have to be recognised in the future because those units, while different, are certainly not lower which is something we must bear in mind continuously within the whole arena of Irish law.  As Deputy McCartan said last evening, even the 1967 Convention is dated compared with the speed with which such changes are taking place.</P>
    <P>We must remain open-minded, compassionate, always viewing the child as of paramount importance.  In doing so we must also recognise parents' rights and sensitivities.  There must be information, <Col N="1150" /> assistance and resources made available to ensure community support for such couples.</P>
    <P>At Special Committee level we will very definitely have to begin thinking about children who because of, say, famine, disaster, war and other violent reasons, may not have natural parents who can be traced, who may be marginalised and excluded from any kind of loving home or family unit as a result.  I might also echo the reservations of Deputies Shatter, McCartan and others about the constraints of our laws which stipulate that a child must be six weeks old before being adopted.  We must remember that there will be urgent circumstances in which that type of constraint will operate to the detriment of the paramount importance of the child, perhaps even of the parents.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Special Committee which I hope will act in that broad, open-minded, international global fashion because, sadly, that is the only way one can legislate for present world conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by saying that I am proud of Fine Gael's record in the area of family law reform. It is fair to say that all of the worthwhile initiatives in this area in the last decade have come from Fine Gael.  In particular, I should like to congratulate my colleague, Deputy Shatter, and commend him on his tenacity in this area which has brought us to the point we are at this evening in relation to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of all of that I am very pleased that the Minister, and the Government, have decided to agree that this Bill should receive a Second Reading and be remitted to a Special Committee of the House.  I am confident that the result of that will be a compassionate, humane Bill which will be a valuable addition to the body of our adoption law.  The history of reform legislation in this House in the last couple of years might have led the Minister a little more quickly than he did to take this view.  I will not go into it at length but the last adoption legislation passed here began as a Fine Gael Private <Col N="1151" /> Members' Bill, voted down by the Government, and subsequently brought in in almost identical form by that same Government.  The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act again started off as a Fine Gael Private Members' Bill which, after some little struggle, was finally enacted into law. Those two cases, and this Bill, surely prove beyond any doubt that there are areas in which a Government should take the view that a successful Private Members' Bill, introduced by the Opposition, will not in any case be read as weakness of any kind on the part of Government or as any parliamentary failure on the part of Government.  The Bill before us deals with an issue that certainly qualifies for inclusion in that category.</P>
    <P>The Review Committee on Adoption Services established by the then Minister for Health, former Deputy Barry Desmond in April 1983, reported in May 1984 and dealt with the question of the adoption of foreign children in paragraphs 3.13 and 3.14.  Those paragraphs are of central importance to the issues we are dealing with tonight.  Paragraph 3.14 reads as follows:</P>
    <P>There will, nevertheless, be particular instances in which persons living in Ireland may wish to adopt a foreign child and where the circumstances would justify a favourable view being taken of such an application.  We would recommend, however, that it be obligatory that all applications in respect of the adoption of a foreign child should be made through a registered adoption society or health board. The agency would have the responsibility to make inquiries about the background of the child and to ensure that the necessary conditions, particularly those relating to consent, had been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The committee's view of the necessity for such provisions have been borne out by subsequent experience and it has been clearly borne out by the recent experience of the adoption of Romanian <Col N="1152" /> children.  There have indeed been other cases down through the years.</P>
    <P>Like many other Deputies I have been in touch with prospective adoptive parents who wish to adopt children abroad for a variety of reasons.  I have seen, as have other Members, the joy and delight of those prospective adoptive parents when they find a child for adoption. But, I have also seen their very deep worry and concern when they find that there is not any provision under which the adoption of such a child can be recognised in Irish law.  Like other Members, I have spoken to numbers of couples who have found themselves in that situation, who looked at the provisions of our law, and who took advice.  I have to say that I very rapidly came to the conclusion that there was a need for specific legislation in this area, legislation of the kind now before us.  I am glad the House has arrived at the point we have got to this evening and that we can now see that legislation in sight.</P>
    <P>The review committee went on to look at the requirements in relation to the recognition of adoption orders made abroad.  They dealt with that in paragraph 13.17.  That paragraph dealt in a very wise way, and in a very foresighted way, with the kind of issues with which we are dealing this evening.  It stated:</P>
    <P>It has been represented to us that difficulties have arisen in some instances in regard to the recognition of adoption orders made abroad.  We are aware that this issue is a cause of considerable concern to adoptive parents.  In addition to the psychological importance of a child adopted abroad being recognised as fully integrated into his new family, recognition of a foreign adoption order affects a range of other matters such as succession rights, taxation, maintenance and issue of passports.  We recommend that the Minister for Health be statutorily empowered to designate countries whose adoption orders would be recognised in Ireland.  The effect of this recognition would be to accord the same rights to children adopted in <Col N="1153" /> these countries as children who had been adopted under Irish law.  The Minister should also be given powers to draw up rules which would govern the recognition of adoption orders made in non-designated countries.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us makes provision to meet the needs identified by the review committee.  In his speech on the Bill last week, the Minister expressed a number of reservations about assurances of consent by natural parents in the countries of origin of the children who are being sought for adoption.  There may indeed be grounds for some of the Minister's reservations.  There may be fewer grounds for others.  It seems to me that the designation procedure proposed in this Bill provides a proper framework for securing any assurance that may be required, going from the consent of the natural parents to all the other concerns that have been raised and that have caused worries throughout the country, in particular concerns in relation to the possible trafficking of children, to use the term used in the legislation and conventions governing this.</P>
    <P>At one point in his speech the Minister seemed to have some difficulty with the idea that the adoptive parents or the adopted person would be entitled to apply to the High Court for a declaration that their foreign adoption is valid here. The Minister asked, &ldquo;what is to happen to a child if the court refuses to recognise a foreign adoption order?&rdquo;  It seems to me that that is an extraordinary question, particularly as the Minister went on to claim that there are no guidelines for the court.  The court would of course have the body of adoption law, including the Bill this House is going to pass, to guide it.  In any case, I find the Minister's question to be a bit out of place in a debate on a Bill which sets out means by which foreign adoptions which cannot now be recognised here, can be recognised.  Not anybody would argue with my view that certainty in the law is at least as important in this area as in any other, if not more important.</P>
    <P>The integration of a child into a family <Col N="1154" /> is of such fundamental importance to the child and the adoptive parents that we must have clarity about all of the issues arising.  From the State's point of view there are the issues of civil status, rights and entitlements.  All of those issues arise and exist from the family's point of view, but beyond those, and far more important than those, there are all of the deep emotional and psychological questions of bonding and family building.  The child and the adoptive parents must be given the maximum amount of emotional and psychological room to build a family.  For that reason, not only must the law not be an obstacle but it must remove any obstacles that it possibly can.  That is why I regard this Bill as being so crucial to innocent young children who are now without families and to protect the prospective adoptive parents.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise one issue in a Bill which I strongly support.  I am delighted it is before the House and that it will be enacted with whatever technical changes may be necessary.  In raising this issue, I should declare an interest, because the problem I am raising is one which was brought to my attention by the fact that one of my relatives is an adopting parent.  She is in the UN service and has been working for most of the last ten years in either Kampuchea or Vietnam.  She has adopted two children under the law of Vietnam.  The children, happily are now Irish citizens.  My relative is not married, and the adoption is valid under Vietnamese law.  Our proper concern in domestic adoptions, given the desirability, all things being equal, of a two-parent family, the shortage of children and the large number of couples who want to adopt and who are very well adapted to adopt is to allow married couples to adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under our law there is no provision for a single parent adopting.  I fully understand and accept that, but in this law where we are dealing with adoptions from abroad, we should not put an obstacle in the way so that a person in the position of my relative coming back to Ireland with two children who would be Irish <Col N="1155" /> citizens, would not be in a position to have the legal privileges of parenthood here because of the requirement in our law, well founded in the domestic situation but inappropriate in this instance. I would ask the mover of the Bill and the Minister to have regard on Committee Stage to this problem and to make whatever provisions are necessary to ensure that the provision in our domestic law should not impede a case of this kind.  I do not want to detain the House on a special specific point, but as the Bill will go into Committee and I will probably not be on the Committee, I thought I would raise this point and ask that it be considered.</P>

      <P>I thank all those who contributed to this debate.  It has been an historic debate.  Deputy Máirín Quill correctly set that out this evening.  We have had some very good contributions.  I should like to thank the Labour Party and The Workers' Party for supporting the Bill.  I thank the Independent Deputies who I know would have supported it if we had had a contested vote.  I should also like to thank in particular my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party who have been supportive throughout in the processing of this Bill before the House and many colleagues contributed to this debate.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased that despite the two months of interviews during which the Minister indicated his intention to oppose the Bill there was a change of mind.  It was a good day for the Dáil last week when that change of mind took place.  I thank the Minister for adopting a constructive approach to the passage of the Second Stage, although I will have some remarks to make later about the criticisms he makes of the Bill.  We need to respond to these criticisms in preparation for Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I should also like to thank the Progressive Democrats who have been unambiguous in their support for the Bill. That support was very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned in my opening speech last <Col N="1156" /> week, and now reiterate, my appreciation of the tremendous work done by the Irish/Romanian Parents Group who have lobbied in support of the Bill.  They have always been anxious that this should not become a political football and they made that point to every Member they could lay their hands on.  They are a group of people who have taken a tremendous burden on themselves in seeking to have legislation changed and they have done this country proud in going to Romania and bringing back many children for whom there would otherwise have been little hope.  We hope these children will settle into a new and happy life in Ireland and will be proud Irish citizens of the future.  When they grow up they might look back on this debate as the start of their Irish citizenship, as opposed to their simply coming to Ireland in a family in circumstances in which Irish law was not prepared to recognise their existence.</P>
    <P>We started in the autumn raising the need for the passage of legislation in this area.  It would be correct to say that initially the reaction of Government was, to put it at its most charitable, inertia. The attitude was that there was no particular need to pass any legislation or to change procedures.  This is something which could have been put into the long list of hoped for legislation that might finds its way through our bureaucratic processes in perhaps four or six years' time.</P>
    <P>I also found that at the beginning there was a great deal of confusion on the part of Government as to the way in which, even administratively, we should deal with the many couples in Ireland who wanted to adopt in Romania.  As the numbers of parents going to Romania increased in the spring and early summer of 1990, I raised with the Minister for Justice by way of parliamentary question the issue of whether an Irish couple adopting in Romania would be allowed to bring their Romanian adopted child back to Ireland without any difficulties in the context of visas or otherwise.  In reply to a question in June last the Minister for Justice indicated that there was no problem.  Provided the couple had an adoption certificate from the Romanian <Col N="1157" /> authorities or the proper foreign documentation in regard to couples who were adopting in other countries, the child would be allowed to enter Ireland.</P>
    <P>During the summer months the Department of Justice when requested to do so issued letters to any couple going to Romania who sought them for confirmation to the Romanian authorities. As we came into October confusion hit. For between two and four weeks the Department of Justice refused to issue such letters and great difficulties arose for couples who wanted to go to Romania for the purpose of adoption.  Some people who had already gone were uncertain as to the reception they would get on coming back to this country.  It was only as we came into early November that the confusion cleared and the Department again agreed to issue the letters which they had previously been issuing.</P>
    <P>The initial reaction on the part of Government was inertia; the second was confusion.  The third reaction was from the Minister for Health when on 29 November in this House we again asked him to introduce legislation.  All he would say was that the Government would have the Attorney General's office look at the Law Reform Commission's report.  When he was asked if he was promising legislation he categorically said he was making no such promise.</P>
    <P>On 11 November 1990 the Report Stage of the Child Care Bill gave us an opportunity to try to resolve the problem of home study reports.  An amendment was tabled to section 6, which dealt with imposing obligations on health boards to provide adoption services in the domestic sense.  The amendment required health boards to carry out assessments and provide home study reports for the purpose of inter-country adoption.  At some considerable length I and Deputy Ivan Yates and other colleagues explained to the Minister the difficulties which prospective adopters were experiencing in having home study reports prepared and asked that provision be included in the Child Care Bill.  I regret that the Minister opposed that and it went to a vote which resulted in the Fine Gael amendment <Col N="1158" /> being defeated.  Two days later, on 13 December, we published this Bill.</P>
    <P>Adopters not only initially were greeted with Government confusion and inertia but also found themselves being presented with obstacles.  The health boards were unwilling to co-operate in the carrying out of assessments and the Government had voted down a reasonable amendment to a Child Care Bill which was designed to ensure that assessments would be carried out.  Much has been said about the European Convention on the Adoption of Children and its application in this area.  The absence of provision up to now in our legislation for the carrying out of such assessments is in clear breach of an article of the European Convention.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this Bill resulted in a vigorous debate as to the needs in this area and that it has produced a considerable change of approach on the part of the Government.  It was only in response to the Bill on Tuesday last that the Minister for Health indicated that the health boards would now be asked to co-operate in the carrying out of family assessments and home study reports.  He indicated in the context of Romania that there would be some contact made with a new central authority which has been put in place in Romania, although he was not clear whether this contact would be made by his Department, all health boards or a particular health board.  This contact would be in the hope of providing a co-ordinating approach by this country in the context of the adoption of Romanian children.</P>
    <P>I regret that we are still not clear whether health boards will now carry out assessments.  The Minister has said he will give instructions in this regard.  Although the Minister is not in a position to reply to me this evening, I would ask him within the next couple of days to make it very clear to all couples who want to go to Romania to adopt whether, if they approach their local health board, assessments will be carried out and home study reports prepared and whether those couples will be given the priority that is necessary to ensure that the assessments <Col N="1159" /> are carried out with reasonable speed whilst also ensuring that the necessary work is undertaken to satisfy the health board as to their suitability to adopt.  It is not totally clear whether this is operating on the ground or when it will start operating.  Couples are entitled to know. This could always have been done by way of an administrative instruction from the Minister to the health boards.  The reason we sought to impose an obligation on health boards in the Child Care Bill was that there was no such administrative instruction and health boards were being obstructive rather than helpful.  It is important that many couples who want to go to Romania to adopt are told now or as soon as possible when health boards will provide this service.</P>
    <P>The Minister by his approach to the Bill and his decision not to oppose it on Second Stage has acknowledged that there is an urgent need for legislation. That is a welcome recognition of the problems we have.  I am greatly disturbed not only by the speeches made by the Minister and the junior Minister at the Department of Health but by the speeches that continue to be made from the backbenches of the Fianna Fáil Party on the Bill.  I am even more disturbed by the speech of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice than I was by the speech of the Minister for Health last week.  I am not trying to score political points by saying this, but I know the Minister's speech last week and, perhaps, Deputy Flood's as the junior Minister in the Department of Health, were more likely prepared in anticipation of opposing the Bill than actually allowing it to pass.  In saying that I am not trying to do any injustice to the Minister or to Deputy Flood.  Events moved on and the Bill was not opposed.</P>
    <P>My concern is that Deputy Treacy, who is Minister of State at the Department of Justice, continued to run the themes that the two Ministers in the Department of Health ran last week. There is one very clear problem on the part of the Government in dealing with this.  That is that there seems to be a <Col N="1160" /> complete failure to understand the difference between enacting laws for domestic adoption to apply to the adoption of children living in Ireland, placed by Irish adoption societies for adoption and adopted through an Bord Uchtála, as opposed to the provision of laws under private international law to recognise foreign adoptions.  There is an absolute and complete confusion as to the dichotomy of approach between private international law rules and domestic rules. Indeed, listening to the Minister's speech, it does not surprise me that the Government were not able to come up with a Bill.  It would be impossible to deal with the recognition of foreign adoptions in the context of legislation to incorporate the type of provisions that the Minister and his colleagues on the Fianna Fáil side have been talking about.</P>
    <P>I wonder about the extent to which the Minister's speech, and those of his colleagues, arose through any discussions with the Attorney General's Office.  I would hope that the Attorney General would set the Minister right on this because all of the problems being raised by the Minister are not real; in the context of this legislation they are illusory. None of these problems are raised by the Law Reform Commission's report in the context of any of the rules they recommend for the recognition of foreign adoptions. Unfortunately, the Minister's speech is full of confusion.  It was Deputy McCartan, in a very excellent speech who very clearly made the point that if we continue along that road in the Special Committee this evening will be a false dawn and we will run into very real difficulties in the Special Committee.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be misunderstood.  I have said all along that I will be happy for the Bill to incorporate constructive amendments that are proposed from any side of the House that will make it work as well as it could possibly work. However, I am really concerned as to whether the Government amendments will, in reality, allow that to happen if the Minister continues to travel along the road he is suggesting.  The Minister seems to envisage that to recognise a foreign <Col N="1161" /> adoption it is necessary for the foreign country to incorporate within its own domestic laws, Irish domestic adoption law as it applies from time to time.  He seems to envisage that whenever we change our adoption Acts the United Kingdom Parliament, the Romanian Parliament and the parliament in Peru should automatically change their Acts to accord with our domestic adoption law.  There is very real confusion.  It has lost the point that to recognise a foreign adoption, just as to recognise a foreign divorce or even to recognise a decree of a foreign country in a number of different types of legal actions, that recognition is based on what is known as the connecting factor, the true connection between the country that has made the court order or the adoption decree and the person subject to it.  It is suggested that the provision of a recognition rule of adoption based on the nationality and residence of a child would result in some open ended system of adoption which would undermine our own adoption system.  That is complete and utter nonsense.  One could equally say the same about recognising an adoption based on the domicile or habitual residence of one or both adopters, that it would undermine the entire adoption system here.  It is based on a complete lack of understanding of how private international law works.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan was correct when he said there was a narrow view coming from the Government side.  Not only is it a narrow view, it is a dangerously misinformed view that, if carried into Committee, threatens to undermine the very essence of the Bill and to ensure that all of the children who have been adopted in Romania by Irish couples properly according to Romanian law will, at the end of this process, find themselves deprived of recognition of their adoptions. That is the last thing that must come out of the Bill.  The Bill must ensure that where an Irish couple properly comply with the law of a country in adopting a child and where the child is a national and a resident of that country, that we extend to that adoption the full recognition it deserves and that we ensure <Col N="1162" /> that the child adopted is placed in a position of legal equality in Ireland with the child adopted within Ireland.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that there are constitutional problems.  I must say that there are no constitutional problems in the context of the recognition rules provided for in the Bill.  Indeed, the Law Reform Commission expressed that view.  A member of the Minister's party managed to stand that report on its head by saying that the Law Reform Commission did not mean it when they said there was not a constitutional problem but that they really meant there might be.  That is not what the Law Reform Commission said.  There is no constitutional problem.  Let me illustrate it in a way that it has been previously illustrated. We have within our Constitution a prohibition on divorce, but we also passed legislation in 1986 which recognises foreign divorces and which our courts have fully and properly upheld. There is no question that recognition rules in the adoption area as the Minister thinks they should apply would apply to the recognition of divorce.  If that were the case there would be no divorce granted anywhere in the world to anybody, no matter whether they were nationals domiciled and resident in a foreign country, that we could possibly recognise because we would always have to relate it back to our domestic law. There is a very real and serious confusion.</P>
    <P>Much mention has been made of the European Convention on the Adoption of Children and that copperfastens the confusion.  The European Convention on the Adoption of Children has absolutely nothing to do with the recognition of foreign adoptions.  The only existing convention in that area is the Hague Convention 1946, the full contents of which are published in the Law Reform Commission's report and the provisions contained in it which are so unrealistic that the convention has only been ratified by three countries and is basically inoperable. It is a sort of dinosaur convention that has been proved to be irrelevant in the international legal sense.  The European Convention on the Adoption of <Col N="1163" /> Children is solely concerned with domestic adoption law and domestic adoption rules and has nothing to do with recognition. It does though impinge on two areas of the Bill and in both respects the Bill is trying to ensure that this country, which ratified this convention in 1968, finally complies with it, because we have been in breach of it since 1968 in the sense that in the context of that convention there are two important Articles.</P>
    <P>Article 11 provides that where a child is adopted by parents of a different nationality the contracting State is required to facilitate the acquisition by the child of the adopters' nationality. Under that convention if an Irish couple adopt a Romanian child this State should have in being laws which ensure that that child acquires Irish nationality.  We do not have that.  At the moment it is a discretionary function of the Minister for Justice who can wait years before agreeing to exercise his discretion to give the child Irish nationality.  We are currently in breach of Article 11 of that convention.</P>
    <P>Article 14 of the convention provides that where a couple are adopting in another State and inquiries have to be undertaken as to their suitability to adopt the requesting State shall if a request for information is made, promptly endeavour to secure that information.  It obliges us to ensure assessments are carried out and home study reports are provided.  We have been refusing to do it in this context and we are in breach of the convention. Section 12 of the Bill resolves that problem.</P>
    <P>I hope we have a constructive Special Committee.  I hope we can tease out the problems that some Deputies believe exist and that the Minister will get greater clarification through the Attorney General's office as to the difference between domestic adoption law and private international law.  I want to conclude by saying that I am happy that on this issue tonight the House is not dividing, that the Bill will get a Second Reading without the bells ringing.  This has been a good day and a good two weeks for parliamentary democracy.  I hope Fine Gael have been <Col N="1164" /> seen to tackle a major social problem that deserves to be tackled.  I hope this will be the first of many Private Members' Bills that are brought forward from this side of the House that the Government will agree to take on board and not oppose. I hope, Sir, that we can move swiftly on this legislation and ensure that it is enacted into law well before the summer vacation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The family income supplement is to be increased.  This is a measure I welcome very much.  For far too long many people were, financially speaking, better off on the dole than at work.  There was no incentive to work and the advent of the family income supplement has in a small <Col N="1165" /> way remedied that situation.  It helps to make life bearable for many families throughout the country and I hope this scheme will be developed in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Another provision which has proved very well worthwhile is the carer's allowance. I know there have been teething problems with the scheme, but I am sure they can be sorted out in time.  The carer's allowance is not just a financial reward to the unsung heroes in our community, but recognition of the tremendous work that these people are doing.  The allowance has been increased by 11 per cent and, while the allowance is quite small, I am sure that when times get better this allowance will be increased to a level that will reflect the tremendous work being done.</P>
    <P>An industry which is very close to my heart is the racing industry.  Following many submissions and much publicity, the Minister decided in last year's budget to grant £3 million to the racing industry and it will receive a similar amount this year.  The bloodstock industry is a major national resource and represents 8 per cent of gross domestic product.  It has enjoyed enormous success over the years and during the past 12 months three Irish trainers, Mr. Dermot Weld, Mr. Vincent O'Brien and Mr. Paddy Mullins picked up big prizes in the USA, a feat which is quite rare in this part of the world.  I would like to pay tribute to the owners, trainers and jockeys involved in those wonderful victories.  It is victories like these that keep Irish racing on the world stage.  While these wins were very welcome, those connected with these wins will not forget the year 1990 because the majority of people involved in the industry will remember this year for very different reasons.  The year 1990 was a disaster for the bloodstock industry.  The international buyers stayed away from the sales.  With such uncertainty prevailing in the world economy, they decided not to spend.  As a result prices fell dramatically and a number of breeders were unable to sell their bloodstock or had to accept a very poor price. The Irish bloodstock industry is in a state <Col N="1166" /> of horrors today.  Owners are being forced out of the game as training expenses are running at £600 a month while the prize money for the smaller races is less that £1,500.  Owning a horse is once again becoming an impossibility for the ordinary man.  A horse would want to win five small races before his winnings will pay for his keep.</P>
    <P>The Government have given a commitment to grant aid the industry for the next few years and I appeal that more of the money be directed at the lower end of the scale.  We must increase the prize money at the smaller races.  The Phoenix Park Racecourse tried to attract the crowds by offering big prize money.  They were responsible for the infamous Cartier Million, but despite all the hype and publicity for last year's race, it attracted an attendance of only 5,000 people.  The so-called rejuvenated Park continued to adopt this policy.  Despite the poor attendances there was no change in policy and the Phoenix Park Racecourse was forced to close during the year.</P>
    <P>The country racetracks continue to be as popular as ever and continually attract large attendances.  However, facilities at some of these tracks are urgently in need of repair and this must be put right.  In 1989 a submission from the Irish Racing and Breeding Industry Committee recommended that a campaign be launched to promote the Irish thoroughbred worldwide.  With adequate marketing and public relations resources it was decided that the campaign should be orchestrated in tandem with an aggressive tourism programme, aimed at significantly improving visitor figures at Irish race meetings.  I am delighted to learn that this recommendation has been taken on board and that the executive of Punchestown Racecourse together with Bord Fáilte are to launch such a campaign. They hope to turn the three day meeting into a real festival, Ireland's equivalent to Cheltenham.  The prize money is to be increased and every effort will be made to attract overseas visitors.  It is this type of initiative that the racing industry needs today.</P>
    <P>New members were appointed to the <Col N="1167" /> Racing Board at the beginning of the year.  While I wish the board the best of luck in their very difficult task, I must voice my disapproval at the structure of the board.  As it stands, six of the 11 members must belong to the Turf Club. This prevents the Minister for Agriculture and Food from picking the best people for the job.  At present the Turf Club and the Racing Board are responsible for the running of the racing industry. I must ask in whose interest is it that this situation continues?  It is certainly not in the best interest of the Irish bloodstock industry.  It is time that we had one racing authority to look after the industry.</P>
    <P>I must refer to the state of the county roads throughout the country.  The Government have provided over £150 million over a three year period to deal with this problem but unfortunately this has not resolved the problem.  The reality is that our county roads are worse now than they ever have been.  The counties bordering our capital are most affected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal reason for this is the volume of traffic these roads carry.  Counties Wicklow, Meath and Kildare are within commuting distance of Dublin and have experienced exceptional development pressures over the past 20 years.  Unfortunately, we have a ridiculous scenario where money is allocated not on the volume of traffic that the county road carries but on the number of miles of county road.  In the period from 1971-86 the population of County Kildare increased by 61.2 per cent while the national average for the same period was less than 20 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my appreciation of the time allotted to me to speak on this motion.  At the outset I compliment the Minister on the budget. Admittedly, there will not be many more millionaires after it than there were heretofore; but at least certain steps were taken which I consider are steps in the right direction, namely, the reduction of VAT from 23 per cent to 21 per cent and the reduction of income tax from 30 to 29 per cent.  Those are very desirable changes.  Unfortunately, the budget was not all give and no take.  The 10 per cent VAT rate was increased to 12.5 per cent. This increase will hit the less well off section of the community more than they will benefit from the reduction in VAT from 23 per cent to 21 per cent, which generally speaking will benefit the business people, whereas the PAYE worker will benefit from the reduction in tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase of 4 per cent to social welfare recipients is a move in the right direction, which is very welcome.  We would all like to see that figure increased, but unfortunately the Minister thought that his funds would not be able to stretch that far.  However, they are the most illlooked after sector of the community and are least able to voice their own opinion. It would be desirable if in the future <Col N="1169" /> the allotment to that section could be improved.</P>
    <P>The £8 million that has been allocated this year to the psychiatric services cannot be regarded as a very large allocation. Generally speaking, the thinking in the modern world on psychiatric health is to have patients rehabilitated in their own locality rather than having them institutionalised.  Not all patients would be in a position to take advantage of such a service so there will still be need for hospitals or institutions &mdash; or whatever word one wishes to use &mdash; where psychiatric patients will be hospitalised.  We have heard much about some of the existing psychiatric hospitals, that they are old and grey, that they are depressing buildings.  If it is necessary, let new hospitals be built.  I understand that there will be such developments in some of the counties closer to us west of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>We are told that a fairer deal in the area of hospital services is on the way. Let us hope that &ldquo;on the way&rdquo; is not too far away.  I am looking forward to seeing what the fairer deal will be.  The provision whereby a bed in a public ward will be available to all members of the community is desirable but that provision already exists for most people; the people who gain by that provision at present are those who would possibly have taken the semi-private or private beds in the past. However, telling a person that he has a right to a free bed in a public ward and free consultant services is fine but when that patient arrives at the hospital and is told: &ldquo;We know what your rights are but unfortunately there are no beds available&rdquo;, that does not improve matters very much.  Unfortunately, that is still the case in many hospitals.  The surgeons and those in control of the hospitals are becoming increasingly concerned about insurance claims.  While in the past certain people thought very little of putting six beds in a four-bedded ward and so on, in the future they will be very slow to do that because they will not be prepared to risk ending up in court which is the situation many consultants may find themselves in if more beds are not made available in the near future.</P>

      <Col N="1170" /> With a budget of £1.5 billion for the health services one would expect that we would have the best medical services in Europe; admittedly, they are not the worst but they are certainly not the best. We still have waiting lists of up to two years for hip operations, for ear, nose and throat operations and for orthodontic treatment.  Children attending national school are deprived, for instance, of speech therapy services.  When I checked that out further with the Department and the health board I was told that the resources for speech therapy are very limited and are now being concentrated in a small area rather than spread out over the whole ambit of those people requiring speech therapy.  Consequently one section of the community, those between five and 11 years of age, do not have speech therapy service available to them.  Certainly something should be done in that regard.  I hope that the Minister for Health will see to it that funds will be made available immediately because that is one service which, in my own County of Roscommon, is badly in need of extra personnel.  I note that for certain educationally deprived children the Minister has made provision for 60 extra teachers: I hope some of those will be speech therapists who will be able to take care of the needs of the children to whom I have referred.  Their plight has not been eased one iota over the past 18 months, if anything it has been made worse.</P>
    <P>A budget of £1.5 billion for health services begs the question as to whether we are making full use of our resources. Some years ago when the health boards were set up we thought all our problems would be solved, perhaps some have been solved.  As time went on we discovered that some of those problems have been replaced by bigger ones.  Perhaps the time has come for a review of the management of the health services.  With a budget of £1.5 billion one would not expect to have to wait for a year or two for any operation.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that the Department of Agriculture and Food have <Col N="1171" /> agreed to bring forward the headage payments for 1992 to 1991.  In the past, the Department of Agriculture and Food were not known for their speed in paying grants.  Perhaps this change of heart on their part is merely an atoning for past sins.  It is a welcome move and all who were concerned with bringing it about should be complimented.</P>
    <P>Various sections of agriculture have benefited as a result of the budget, for example, a provision of £1.5 million was made to CBF, £1.2 million to Teagasc and a sum of £2 million has been put aside for the depopulation of herds affected with BSE.  Any money given to CBF is a move in the right direction.  I understand that the meat factories are to produce a corresponding amount.  I hope it will be the meat factories who will produce that sum and not the farmers via the meat factories with an extra 1p or so levy per pound being imposed.  I hope the meat factories have listened to the Minister's request and will live up to it.</P>
    <P>CBF have a mammoth task.  Unfortunately, because of the BSE scare in the past couple of years the British beef industry got quite a shellacking from the media and from the home customers who refused to eat beef as well as from their customers in foreign countries.  Unfortunately, and most unfairly, our beef was tainted with the same brush.  We should never hesitaate to state loud and clear that BSE is not endemic to this country. Ireland is basically free of BSE. However, the situation is different in England where they have a ewe population of about 40 million, 20 per cent of which is affected by scrapie which is the forerunner of BSE.  That means that about 8 million ewes can pass on the BSE disease whereas in this country we do not have that problem.  The only cases of BSE found here could be traced to either imported infected and affected cattle or to the importation of meat and bone meal.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food saw to it that both avenues were cut off.  He must be complimented on that.  Our foreign customers were very concerned about the BSE scare which, <Col N="1172" /> unfortunately, hit our trade over the past 18 months.  However, things are improving in this area again thanks to the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and others who have negotiated deals with some former customers.  That is a very desirable development.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that at a time when the BSE scare is wearing off we are rushing headlong into another scare which will be just as fatal from the point of view of the consumer and the future of our beef industry, that is the treatment of beef with what is known as &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo;. According to our veterinary experts &mdash; and these are the people who should know &mdash; a frighteningly high percentage of finishing bullocks are treated with &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo;.  Irrespective of whether or not &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo; has any ill effects on human beings the perception among people is that it is very detrimental to humans, and once customers believe this they will refuse to buy Irish beef and rightly so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>If the people who fatten cattle continue to treat them with &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo; as sure as night follows day our beef industry will go down the same road our lamb trade went in the fifties and sixties.  It was because unscrupulous, greedy and avaricious people exported hoggets instead of lambs that time we lost the Paris market for our lamb.  We lost that market overnight but it took farmers 16 years to get onto that market again. They paid dearly for it.  If we do not take steps to ensure that &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo; is not used in any form in fattening cattle our customers will not buy our beef.  As beef amounts to 10 per cent of our total exports this would be disastrous for the beef industry, the producers of beef, namely the farmers, and our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the allocation of £1.2 million to Teagasc I doubt if this amount will do much to help that ailing organisation. After all, the budget of this <Col N="1173" /> organisation was cut by £2.3 million a few months ago.  Now more than ever the farming community need the support and advice given by Teagasc.  We are moving into uncharted waters on the agricultural scene and I doubt if anyone, including Commissioner MacSharry, knows what the future will hold, even up to the end of 1991.  Negotiations are still taking place but the proposals put forward by Commissioner MacSharry are similar to the American proposals.  Our agricultural industry will change from a high production one to low production.  It was a high input and a high output industry, although some farmers would say that it was a high input and low output industry.</P>

There is nothing in the budget to suggest that this problem will be rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the budget. People may think that because the budget was introduced at the end of January it is no longer important but it is very important to refer to the background to the budget.  While some people might criticise the budget as not doing anything much for people I believe the action taken by the Government over the past four years has left us in a stable position. The Minister for Finance faced a very difficult task in these uncertain times.  He presented the budget after the war in the Gulf had started.  It was important that the strategy which had been adopted by the Government was maintained.  It would have been very wrong for the Minister to make rash decisions in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister set about doing two things in the budget.  First, he tried to deal with the tax imbalances <i>vis-á-vis</i> our <Col N="1174" /> European partners, in particular, our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, and also having regard to 1992.  He was helped in this regard due to the fact that our economy had been turned around over the past four years and that we had the lowest inflation rate in the history of the State, one of the lowest inflation rates in Europe.  This low inflation rate has been brought about as a direct result of the policies pursued by the Government over the past four years.  I do not think anybody had any doubts about the need to reduce our level of borrowing.  The Government have continued the policy of aiming for a zero rate of borrowing in 1992.  If they do this it will be a major achievement for this country.</P>
    <P>We must look at the budget in the context of the Gulf War which could have major consequences for us if it continues. I hope the efforts being made to end the war will be successful and that oil prices will not be forced through the roof due to a lack of supplies.  Unfortunately, we are not sure what will happen from day-to-day.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in the budget in regard to VAT.  Any reduction in VAT rates will be welcomed by consumers. The changes proposed in the budget in regard to VAT rates will help bring us into line with the VAT rates in other European countries.  It is important that the changes in the VAT rates, together with the changes in the income tax rates, are brought to the notice of people.  Many people may think that the small reduction in these rates will be of no consequence but every reduction in rates will be of benefit to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I especially welcome the introduction of a special allowance for widows &mdash; an allowance which has gone unnoticed by many people &mdash; which will be paid during the first three years of widowhood.  The payment of this allowance at a traumatic time will help cushion the blow for many widows.  I believe the Minister will achieve his aim to reduce our level of taxation over the coming years.  Government Departments and Ministers are to be complimented for living within their budgets.  This will help the Government <Col N="1175" /> in their efforts to create jobs and reduce unemployment.  The financial policies pursued by the Government have created a favourable climate for people who regard Ireland as a suitable place to set up industrial operations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals in the budget in regard to housing.  The housing policy announced by the Minister for the Environment and funded by the Department of Finance in recent weeks is very welcome. It is the first real attempt to deal with social housing problems.  If people on the opposite benches feel it is not an appropriate move, their constituents might not agree with them when they see the full value of the package that will be available in the coming years.  We all know we were heading towards a housing crisis and this is the first attempt to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we also deal with another matter which some would say might not be directly involved with the budget, that is An Post.  Because some of us decided to bring to the attention of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications that the proposed changes would cause problems, we have managed to prevent an attack on rural life by a semi-State company.  This is something that had to be dealt with, and I welcome the Minister's decision today to have an NESC report commissioned with regard to An Post and their operations in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>On the agricultural front, like Deputy Foxe I welcome the increased funding to CBF, but I hope that funding is used to create markets of a continual rather than a seasonal nature.  For too long we have allowed our agricultural produce to be sold via the handy route to many manufacturers, namely, intervention.  That route is not in the best interests of the country or the producer.  If farmers are to get the maximum benefit from their produce they should be concentrating on selling to the consumer markets right across Europe.  We have the best product in Europe but we are not making full use of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" /> I also agree with Deputy Foxe in regard to angel dust.  The use of angel dust is a criminal offence, and I say that without any hesitation.  If somebody is found in this country with heroin they are put behind bars, but angel dust is a taboo subject which has been brushed under the carpet by many people.  It is something we must face.  In a recent court case in another part of this island where a person was found in possession of angel dust the justice said that because it could not be proved that it caused damage to human beings the maximum fine he could impose was £100.  That is a licence to destroy our meat production not alone in the Republic but in the entire country. I know the Minister for Agriculture is committed to stamping out this problem and he deserves the full support of every Member of this House in doing so. Farmers who use angel dust are committing suicide in that they are doing away with their own livelihood and their own future.</P>
    <P>The recent announcement of the increased headage payments is welcomed by everybody.  The change in the disadvantaged areas is also in the interests of agriculture.  Prior to the budget many people believed that the commitment to increase headage payments might not be met, but the money for payment in 1991 is provided in the budget.  That proves that the Government and the Minister are committed to making these extra payments which will be very necessary in view of the forthcoming changes in the Common Agricultural Policy.  I hope that in the next couple of weeks we will have an opportunity via some of the sub-committees of this House or in the House itself to discuss the changes in the CAP and in the price structure for this year which are being proposed by Commissioner MacSharry.  We are lucky to have an Irish Agriculture Commissioner at this time.  I know he will do his utmost in the Commission to protect the interests of the small farmers.  We as politicians have a duty to voice our fears sooner rather than later and to be constructive in what we say with regard to the changes in the CAP.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> There is an increase in the allocation for health services in this budget, although maybe not enough.  It is time that a full review was carried out of the operation of the health boards throughout the country.  The amount of money allocated to health should be reviewed to see if we are getting good value for the expenditure on the health services.</P>
    <P>The proposals with regard to improved community care are to be welcomed, particularly the proposal to bring people who have been long term institutionalised back into society.  Where this has been done even on a moderate scale it has proved quite successful.  People who have been institutionalised for many years are well able to live in the community with the proper support, and I hope more of these people will be brought back into the community.  I would voice a word of warning, that people coming out of these institutions will be able to cope only if society is willing to accept and support them.  It is important that we as a community give them our fullest support in trying to rehabilitate themselves.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will this year again be reasonably well funded.  The increases that have been consistent over the past three years for county roads have been of major benefit.  They might not be as great as everybody would like but at least it is the first genuine attempt to put in place a proper county road structure. Many counties do not have the benefit of major stretches of national primary roads and there is a need for improved roads in those counties.  This is important if we are to develop tourism and other industries in rural areas.  The Minister, Deputy Flynn, is to be complimented for his efforts in this field.  He is also to be complimented on getting Structural Fund moneys for the development of our national primary roads.  I hope that as time goes on the roads into our capital city will be improved because it is important that there is good access to our major cities. The by-passes proposed for some of the towns on these major roads will not, as some people think, be the death knell for those towns and villages.  They will give people an opportunity to use the facilities <Col N="1178" /> provided by the business community in those towns and villages.</P>
    <P>Before I finish it is only fair that I refer to the business expansion scheme and the changes proposed here.  The scheme was brought in originally to promote smaller projects, but some of the sharks of the financial community decided they would make full use of it.  They created schemes beyond what was envisaged in the original proposal.  The limit of £500,000 as proposed by the Minister in the budget is to be welcomed.  I hope those financial gurus will see their way to fund small projects in rural Ireland.  Many of the projects have been aimed at tourism facilities in our major towns.  Very few of them have been used to fund projects in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the increase to Bord Fáilte, £1 million extra is very welcome. The chief executive of Bord Fáilte, Mr. Dully, should be complimented for his proposals to make up for the business which will be lost as a result of the Gulf War.</P>
    <P>The budget is an honest attempt by the Minister for Finance and the Government to keep their policy on the rails. They will ensure that the programme is implemented and that we will reach the target, which many people said could not be achieved, of having nil borrowing in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>It is not often in the Dáil that my two constituency colleagues are here to listen to me.  I compliment one of them for going on television last week to ask the Minister not to close the post offices in rural areas.  At least one of them has taken credit for it anyway.  He said that the NESC report will support the view of all rural Deputies that rural post offices should not be closed. However, he did not say when that report will become available and I have a feeling that it could be sometime in July when certain local elections are out of the way. The people in rural areas will not be fooled by anything like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is just the way I was brought up.  The two major ills affecting our young people are unemployment and emigration.  We hope that our young people will remain in this country because they are its future; in 20 years' time we should like to see young people in the House producing policies which will leave the country in good hands for future generations.  The Minister for Finance said that there would be an economic growth of 2.5 per cent this year but that is balderdash because the economy is failing.  I know that some of the causes are outside the control of the Government, including the Gulf War, but the 4 per cent pay increases outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> over the next three years will not be possible.  Trying to base our finances on that economic growth will not, unfortunately, work.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of increases in indirect tax in the budget.  Car tax has been increased which affects everybody, especially younger people.  The Government are unable to do anything about unemployment or emigration, yet they increased VAT on many items which will make disposable income much scarcer which, in turn, will cut down on economic growth.  Young people cannot survive economically because, even if they have a job, they pay an extremely high rate of income tax.  Their disposable income has been cut to the bone and they have no choice but to emigrate or try to survive on a miserly wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person under 30 years of age is discriminated against in relation to car insurance.  For example, if Deputy Flaherty has a two litre car with open insurance and wishes me to drive it I cannot do so because I am under 30 years of age.  That is discrimination and, until politicians face up to the problem and do something about it, young people will be cynical about politics, which is very <Col N="1180" /> serious, because we need young people to become involved in the democratic process so that they will have a country which will cater for generations to come. By not attacking these problems we are engendering cynicism, understandably so.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority, I believe that the section in the budget dealing with the environment raises many difficulties.  Deputy Ellis said that there would have been a housing crisis if action had not been taken by the Minister. There is a housing crisis and, while the action taken by the Minister may go some way to resolving the problem it will not solve it.  For example, in County Leitrim, in 1985 there were 60 starts made for local authority housing; in 1986 there were 55 and when this Government attained office in 1987 there was a sum total of 11. That was dramatically increased to 28 in 1988 but it decreased to 12 in 1989.  I do not know if Deputy Ellis or Deputy Mattie Brennan had a word with the Minister for the Environment but the number again increased to 28 in 1990.  We are looking for 86 starts this year and, regardless of what plan the Minister brought in for housing, I know quite well that we will not get 86 starts and, even allowing for the number of people who will move out of local authority housing into private housing, it will not be enough to accommodate the housing list in County Leitrim.  Remember that County Leitrim is the least populated area in the country. What is the situation in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick?  It must be horrific.</P>
    <P>When I was growing up I always heard that the Fianna Fáil Party put a lot of money into the building industry.  In 1985 the Coalition Government introduced the house improvement grant.  There is a rumour that this grant will be reintroduced. Unfortunately the Minister had a chance to do this last week but he did not take it.  Industry benefited and a lot of money was spent when the house improvement grant was in operation.  It was one of the best grants ever introduced <Col N="1181" /> and it benefited the decaying housing stock&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Money was provided for it but Fianna Fáil did not avail of it. I am glad the Minister of State is present because I want to speak about tourism. Perhaps the Minister will take his head out of the sand in that regard.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, had a big publicity stunt in the Custom House last week to announce the great housing plan which would solve the problem. One of the incentives is in relation to local authority tenants who wish to move to private accommodation.  I applaud that excellent idea but, when we were in Government, we gave a £5,000 grant, plus a £2,000 new house grant and a £3,000 mortgage subsidy.  In the Minister's great plan a person will receive a grant of £4,000, £1,000 less, and a £2,000 new house grant.  We were giving more money for people to move out of local authority housing in 1985-86 than the Minister is giving in this great plan to solve our housing crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would now like to make a number of points on the tourism industry and hope that the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications who is present in the House will take them on board.  Great play was made of the fact that an extra £1 million is being made available to Bord Fáilte for promotion, but it should not be forgotten that £1 million was taken out of the Estimate for that Department.  Therefore it is quite clear that Bord Fáilte will receive the same amount of money this year as last year, this in a year when the tourism industry is facing the greatest crisis it has faced in recent years.  I realise that some of this is not the fault of the Government, but it must be borne in mind that Americans are afraid to travel because of the Gulf War.  We must therefore try to attract tourists from both Great Britain and the Continent.  The only way to do this is to promote the country very <Col N="1182" /> aggressively and forcefully in those markets. To this end extra funding is needed but this has not been provided.  I fail to understand how the Minister can expect his three year tourism plan to be successful in its final year because, given the lack of funding, it is not possible to attract the extra tourists needed.</P>
    <P>I would now like to repeat a point that I made last year which, unfortunately, has not been taken up by the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications, that is, that a hotel with 30 bedrooms or fewer cannot avail of grant aid for the development of leisure facilities and the construction of extra bedrooms. Therefore the top end are receiving all the money, from the European Community, Bord Fáilte and the Government, while hotels at the other end of the market cannot get any aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The only other hoteliers who can avail of grants are those in the Border areas.  They can avail of grants from the International Fund for Ireland. As a member of the Fine Gael Party, I take full credit for that because if the Anglo-Irish Agreement had not been signed there would be no International Fund for Ireland.  The Fianna Fáil members of Leitrim County Council voted against the Agreement but now they are shouting that they cannot get enough.  If this is not hypocrisy, I do not know what is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes in the business expansion scheme will cause great difficulty. Recently the Taoiseach visited County Leitrim to open the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  I congratulated him in this House for doing so and have no doubt but for the tenacity he showed this project might not have gone ahead.  A number of developers were willing to construct hotels in the county but following the changes in the business expansion scheme all those plans have now gone up in smoke; we have the canal but no accommodation for the tourists.  This, in effect, is putting the cart before the horse.  I hope the Minister of State will <Col N="1183" /> make it known to his senior colleague that the changes in the business expansion scheme have caused serious problems for the tourism industry, particularly in the hinterland of the Ballinamore-Bally-connell Canal where extra accommodation has to be built.</P>
    <P>Deputy Foxe made the point that we will receive both the 1991 and 1992 headage payments in 1991.  I welcome this move but, as anyone who has tried to get payments for farmers in the counties of Leitrim and Sligo and other disadvantaged areas would know, this can prove to be most difficult because of the bureaucracy involved, and God only knows what will happen when they have to make two payments in the one year.  However I hope I will be proved wrong.  I also thought that I would be proved wrong in the case of the payments to be made last year but I was not.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, last Wednesday a Government backbencher described some members of the last Fine GaelLabour Coalition Government as retarded in the context of the initiatives taken by them to try to get us out of our financial problems.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance for introducing an excellent budget and continuing the good work commenced in 1987 by his predecessor, the former Deputy, Mr. Ray MacSharry, who is also a former Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to dwell for a few moments on agriculture.  Agriculture is and, for many years to come, will continue to be our principal industry.  It is more than an industry; it is a way of life and offers the most stable lifestyle our people could <Col N="1184" /> look forward to in the nineties and into the next century.  The livestock industry forms the backbone of our agricultural activities.  In my constituency the vast majority of farmers adhere strictly to the rules and regulations governing livestock, particularly those relating to the use of hormones as growth promoters in cattle. I welcome the decision by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to ban the sale of these products as this is in the best interests of producers and consumers alike.</P>
    <P>We are living in an age in which an increasing number of people at home and abroad are demanding good food produced under natural conditions and which is free from artificial agents at both growth and production level.  If it is found, at the international level, that meat produced in this country contains traces of growth promoters, hormones or angel dust, the consequences for our exports could be disastrous.  For this reason I propose that all cattle containing traces of hormones should be slaughtered and dumped and that all grants and subsidies should be withheld and withdrawn from the farmer concerned for a considerable length of time.  Furthermore, a very heavy penalty should be imposed on him.  Once again, I thank the Minister for Agriculture and Food for banning the sale of all growth promoters.  We encourage tourists to come here and the country has always been known as a country with clean, healthy food and only top quality meat should be presented.  I feel very strongly about this issue and feel confident that the Minister will take whatever steps are needed to stamp out this abuse once and for all.</P>
    <P>I also wish to thank the Minister for Agriculture and Food and to praise the Government for relaxing the conditions of the headage payment scheme.  As a result part-time farmers can now qualify for full headage payments for cattle and sheep without income limits.  Heretofore a part-time farmer with an income of £5,000 did not qualify for headage payments. Now all are entitled to them.</P>
    <P>A number of farmers in my constituency are unable to farm their land to <Col N="1185" /> full potential because of flooding of the Owenmore and Arrow rivers.  These rivers have been on the priority list for drainage for a number of years.  A former Member of the House and former Minister, Mr. Ray MacSharry, made sure they were included for priority.  They have been brought forward to some extent and I hope they will be drained sometime in the not too distant future.  I am confident that the Minister for Finance will make some money available in the next year or so to start that work and so give the farmers in the area a chance to farm their land to full potential.</P>
    <P>Former Deputy Ray MacSharry, once a Minister, is now an EC Commissioner. I wish him every success in the GATT negotiations and the CAP.  The CAP made a very important contribution to this country when a wide range of quality foods were produced at reasonable prices.  Unfortunately, there was overproduction of beef and dairy products, not by the small producers of this country but, unfortunately, from the factory farms of Europe.  I feel Commissioner MacSharry will do everything possible to get a reasonably good income for all our farmers.  He has the portfolio for agriculture and rural development.  Small farmers in the west depend on farming for the greater part of their income and I hope Commissioner MacSharry will try to make sure they are compensated.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for the Environment for the many water and sewerage schemes he has sanctioned in County Sligo, particularly the long awaited sewerage scheme at Strandhill, a tourist town where the people depend on tourism for their livelihood, particularly in summer.  Almost £1 million has been sanctioned for that scheme and it will be of great benefit to that town.  The Minister has sanctioned schemes at Riverstown, Ballisodare and Collooney. He sanctioned phase two of Lough Talt water supply scheme that brought water to Achonry and linked group schemes at Quarryfield, Doocastle, Kilaville, Emlaghnaughton, Cloonkeavy and other areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> I thank the Minister for the Environment too for the money he has made available for road strengthening grants since 1987, and I am glad to see here the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment.  From 1984 to 1987 our county roads were in a deplorable condition but since 1987 they have been greatly improved.  The people of rural Ireland at least can drive on our county roads at the moment, thanks to the Minister's action in this regard.</P>
    <P>I thank also the Minister for Health for supplying the necessary funds for the day care centre and welfare home at Tubbercurry, County Sligo.  This long awaited amenity is about to be opened and the people in Sligo will welcome it greatly.  It is a great boost to the Tubbercurry area and will be of great benefit. I thank the Minister also for making finance available for the provision of a new hospital in Sligo.  Now we have one of the most modern hospitals in Ireland there. I am delighted to be able to say in this House that, while it has not been officially opened, that excellent hospital is now open and will achieve nothing but good.</P>
    <P>An outstanding example of community endeavour has brought a well deserved national honour to Tubbercurry.  The Gallagher House Resource Centre has been chosen for the Helious Award out of some 600 entries submitted by EC member states.  The main drive behind this project was Mrs. Ann Killoran, President of the County Sligo branch of the Downs Syndrome Association of Ireland. Mrs. Killoran is in Brighton at the moment at an EC conference and exhibition where she will accept this presentation. I congratulate her on her achievements.  This centre has now been taken over by the North-Western Health Board and I congratulate everybody working there.  This is a great achievement.</P>
    <P>One of the Fianna Fáil Government's great achievements over the past three years has been decentralisation which has brought great benefit to rural areas.  The Department of Social Welfare was allocated to Sligo approximately 18 months ago and now 350 people work there. <Col N="1187" /> Decentralisation has many benefits for the country as a whole.  It benefits our capital city by relieving overcrowding and moving to a rural area like Sligo where building land is freely available and cheaper than it is in Dublin.  The location of Government administrative offices in a district in which housing is readily available brings public servants into contact with greater sections of the population and enables them be more aware of what is taking place in such areas.  It also brings approximately £100,000 more to be spent in a rural town such as Sligo.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications on his new portfolio.  We were all very worried about the abolition of rural post offices and the social implications for rural communities.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say at a party meeting today that very definitely these rural post offices will not be closed because they provide one of the greatest social services to rural communities.</P>
    <P>There was no mention of the closure of post offices in the city of Dublin where, within five minutes, one could walk to approximately five different post offices. Rather the proposal was to close post offices in rural areas.  Do the proposers of these closures realise how much post mistresses or sub-postmistresses receive for running their post offices or sub-post offices?  They receive in the region of £2,000.</P>

      <P>May I say to Deputy Brennan that we urban Deputies share his concern at the proposal of An Post to close post offices.  My father is a pensioner who attends a post office well known to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle <Col N="1188" /> on Ballygall Road West which is being assessed for its throughput and potential viability.  My father and mother do not look with any great anticipation at having to travel a good deal further to obtain their old age pensions.  I might add my father came from a little village in north Kerry.  Last year, with a number of local Deputies, I engaged in a successful campaign with An Post, who tried to close that post office, to retain at least a one day per week and a monthly service so that pensions and childrens allowances could be cashed locally.  Therefore, I can assure Deputy Matt Brennan that it is not an issue on which urban Deputies are unsympathetic, rather, it is one on which this side of the House are very sympathetic. Indeed, we are concerned that what has been proposed today will simply avoid the issue until the local elections are out of the way.  We will be maintaining a close watch on developments.  Nonetheless we give credit to Deputy Brennan for bringing his party, and Minister, to their senses and helping in that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While talking about pensioners I will begin by referring to a retired CIE pensioner in my constituency who telephoned me on budget day.  He said that his experience over the last few budgets had led him to believe that it would be better if we did not have any budgets at all but just left pensioners alone because, while they might receive a little, on the other hand, they might lose an awful lot. That pensioner on a fixed income &mdash; the House will be aware that CIE pensions are not the most generous in the world &mdash; had very severe ill health.  The previous year the rationalisation of the VHI had left him, with very severe medical problems, £5 a week worse off so that he was unable to recoup anywhere.  While faced with that prospect he was not very optimistic about the impact of the latest budget on himself.  He telephoned me today having found that all his anxieties had been confirmed because the £4 monthly increase he will receive by virtue of various budgetary changes has been eaten away already by the increased charges announced by the ESB which in his case he estimates will cost another £1 per <Col N="1189" /> week.  He anticipates a further £1 being lost on similar increased charges by Bord Gáis.  As he is not very mobile he anticipates that his only source of communication, the telephone, will also be hit.  Barely three weeks after the budget he has already lost £3 of that £4 he will receive without coping with any of the other general increases in the cost of living.  Perhaps his view that we should not bother with a budget at all is a general one.</P>
    <P>It contrasts severely with the self-satisfaction of the Taoiseach to whom I listened in my room yesterday in relation to the great achievements of the Government. He pointed to the macro figures thrown at us so often.  I would like him to reflect on the macro figures we, as a Coalition Government, inherited in 1981-82, for example, the macro figures of 22 per cent and 23 per cent inflation when, in order to compensate people we had to grant 25 per cent social welfare increases.  I would like him to consider what would have been the impact of that on his narrow bookkeeping exercise.  I might also refer to the inflation figures which have been reduced to single figures from their previous enormous high and to interest rates which had been reduced to a level a great deal lower than those prevailing at present.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it will readily be seen that a great deal of groundwork was done for the Government which they have never acknowledged.  Many of the initiatives which have yielded fruits were commenced then such as the refurbishment programme undertaken by the Department of the Environment, the Custom House Docks site and designated areas in Dublin and other urban regions.  Those ideas were in train and the legislation in place.  All that was necessary was for the incoming Government in 1987 to develop and/or maintain them.  I do not think sufficient credit has been given to those initiatives.  However, that day will come.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the energy brief I might refer to matters of immediate concern to me under my other that called &ldquo;family policy&rdquo;.  The Government have <Col N="1190" /> chosen to approach the support of families in a very traditional, unimaginative way.  There have been some increases in the family income supplement, in dependant allowances and in child benefit if one happens to have a fourth child. Irrefutable evidence has been produced indicating that in the case of families with children, more children have been growing up in poverty over the past ten years. I do not believe the Government acted in any way to tackle that problem in the budget.  I note the responses of the welfare reform groups in our society representing the poor and families who might not appear to be poor from the outside but who may be experiencing extreme difficulty in meeting the enormous costs associated with school-going and teenage children.</P>
    <P>Before the budget Fine Gael published a radical proposal which I would like to write into the record of the House, involving elements that would not be all that palatable but which would have radically transformed the circumstances of families with children.  That proposal was for the doubling of child benefit from the current level of £4 per week to £8 per week.  It involved the taxation of that benefit and the taxation of short term social welfare benefit.  Without a single additional element of expenditure that would have entailed a radical redirection of our tax concessions towards families with children.  For those on low and middle incomes it would have led to a substantial increase in the amount of money in their pockets to deal with children and a welcome increase in the direct income going into the hands of mothers or those people caring directly for children.  Most important of all it would have meant a more substantial increase to all those in receipt of social welfare benefit.  At that rate of £8 per week even those with the highest tax liability would not have lost out.  Without a penny of additional revenue this very much more radical approach for supporting families might have been adopted.  It indicates how much of a disappointment this budget is.  The Minister himself has described it as cautious.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> I warmly welcome the proposal for locally based anti-poverty projects.  That proposal is a central part of Fine Gael policy.  I am concerned about the sketchy details of the proposal which have come out and which indicate movement in a direction which we in Fine Gael cannot support.  Certainly, the community development groups throughout the country do not want a new structure set above them.  The people with local proven track records should be respected and they should not suddenly find that a new group is being established above them through political largesse.  The way in which these projects are structured is vitally important so as not to undermine the tremendous work being done by local community groups.</P>
    <P>Neither in the programme nor in the budget is there a reference to energy policy or to the energy industry.  The Government are clearly unaware of the immense potential in this area for our economy.  There are no programmes for conservation to realise any of the potential of £400 million in savings.  What could we do with £400 million?  We can look around here and see windows open throughout the House.  We are wasting energy, burning off the resources of the country.  One will find the same throughout public utilities.  Whitegate and Whiddy are limping on.  They are resources which are not realising anything like their full potential.  Hidden subsidies are hindering our assessment of the performance of Bord Gáis Éireann, the ESB, the INPC, Bord na Móna and so on.  We need a Green Paper on energy urgently, and we need the Competition Bill, if the question of monopoly in our energy systems and supplies is to be dealt with adequately.  There is a lack of direction and of a substantial energy policy in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and in the budgetary documentation and the budgetary approach.</P>
    <P>I give credit to my predecessor, Deputy Richard Bruton, who published a White Paper on energy which identifies many areas which should be considered.  It assesses the progress and development of <Col N="1192" /> the major semi-State agencies to which I have already referred.  It highlights two areas which are particularly relevant, areas where we should act to reduce waste and to release for constructive purposes money which is being wasted. There is a lacklustre performance evident in the development of our enormous natural resources.  By comparison with other countries natural resources are totally underdeveloped here.  We have not tapped the potential of hydro power, wind power, solar power and I will not even refer to the more exotic possibilities with which I am coming to terms.  Oil and gas exploration is a tricky area, a volatile area, and an area which is hard to control as it depends on international prices. Because of environmental reasons, the natural prices for gas and oil are often interfered with.</P>
    <P>However, there are areas which are entirely under our control &mdash; for instance, the potential to use hydro electric power and wind power.  It stands to reason that Ireland should be naturally gifted in producing substantial amounts of energy in those areas.  For various reasons we are not.  The ESB monopoly on the sale of electricity to third parties closes off alternative markets for private producers. They cannot get a decent price for their product.  This again highlights the need for the Competition Bill.  The Government have also made certain provisions which inhibit development in this area. There is a total lack of commitment and there is not any focus in relation to policy. This is something to which I will come back time and time again and I will work on it at Question Time next week.</P>
    <P>The other major area of waste relates to conservation.  We see waste when we look at houses, public utilities and industry. We have a record of waste second to none.  We use 20 per cent more electricity than the EC average.  We have conserved energy at a much slower rate than the EC since the oil crisis made everybody look at energy sources and see them in a new light.  We have made little or no progress in developing combined heat and power systems, which means, for example, that the hydro electric station pours back into <Col N="1193" /> a river having realised only 30 per cent of its potential in providing energy and heat.</P>
    <P>We have a passive Government.  In the area of public transport there has been little progress, although the potential for energy conservation by use of public transport is great.  It has not been understood among the people to any adequate degree.  We see waste all around us. About half of the housing stock lacks roof insulation.  Half of cars are not properly tuned.  Industry could save 20 per cent of the energy used by the year 2000 by applying simple known methods, but the Government have only taken away the energy audits which had an impact in this area since 1985.  Forty per cent of homes depend on open fires for winter heating although enclosed fireplaces could make a huge difference.  The Government gave no assistance at all to that.</P>
    <P>The Estimates show a drop in grants for private bogs and a drop in expenditure by 28 per cent on energy conservation. They show a gross drop of 16 per cent or a net drop of 9 per cent in the budget for the Department of Energy.  Clearly, the Government are listless and incompetent and have no clear energy policy.  Energy is a wasted resource.  This is a Department which is not being taken seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take up a few points made by Deputy Flaherty because they should not go unopposed.  Deputy Flaherty mentioned, for instance, the CIE pensioner who is extremely worried because he might lose a percentage of the money&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">

    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which was granted to him.  Deputy Flaherty said that maybe we should not have had a budget, but I am glad we have had a budget.  The Deputy may not be aware that there are quite a number of ex CIE employees who had no pension at all, who would, but for this budget, still not have a pension.  They are the people who are described as being in the <i>pro rata</i> group.  They are the people <Col N="1194" /> who were misfortunate enough to move to be promoted at a given time in their career.  Deputy Flaherty may not be too worried about these people but the Minister, Deputy Woods, is worried about them and I am worried about them.  It has taken two years to get to a point where we got agreement to give them a proper pension.  I am glad this Government took on board the problem of this anomaly which had existed for a long time.  Mixed pensions have been dealt with this year, as the <i>pro rata</i> pensions were dealt with previously.  This is important to people and that is why we need a budget.  Our own friends may not really need changes but the people I represent need them.</P>

      <P>Reference was made to the funding of community groups.  They may be worried that some other regime or group will be put ahead of them.  The previous speaker concentrated on the city area.  I am deeply involved in a rural development area and these people would like to see the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods, canonised, not somebody who died hundreds of years ago. For the first time there is a direct financial intervention in these areas.  Money is being directly targeted there.  I can give a long list if the Deputy wishes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Carey stirred her up a bit.  Regarding Whitegate refinery, I worked on the construction of the original plant and I agree that redevelopment is long overdue.  I was among those who campaigned against selling it off or closing it down when this was proposed by the Coalition between 1982 and 1987. <Col N="1195" /> Deputy Flaherty is quite right in saying that we should develop it and the £57 million from Tara Mines is targeted for that purpose.  I am glad the Deputy is coming around to our way of thinking.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flaherty mentioned the failure to give credit for the 1987 approach.  It is perhaps correct that credit was not given. Whatever credit may have been given is being eroded very speedily because of the antics of Deputy John Bruton, who seems to be hell bent on ensuring that any bit of strategy that might be tagged onto Deputy Dukes' regime must be upturned. It has been obvious in the House during the past few weeks that this is the way he is going.</P>
      <P>I stated yesterday during the debate on the new programme that it is linked with this budget and future budgets.  We are co-ordinating our efforts with the social partners.  Two key elements in this very small economy are confidence and credibility. Earlier we were told about debts. I was amazed that people like Deputy Garret FitzGerald should say that we actually borrowed money.  This is incredible. Last year's borrowing was the lowest for 40 years.  It is unreal to hear them cautioning us about borrowing for the national economy.  The figures are there for previous years and we could discuss the doubling of the national debt and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Credibility is judged from the claims made by different speakers on budget day.  For the past four years on this side of the House Deputy MacSharry and Deputy Albert Reynolds as Ministers for Finance have put forward their forecast and predicted what will be achieved over the following 12 months.  They covered the question of economic growth. Invariably, the Fine Gael spokesman, and on at least two occasions Deputy Spring, said that the growth figures could not be met.  In 1988-89 the forecast was a growth of 3.5 or 4 per cent, but Deputy Noonan predicted a zero growth rate and said we could not achieve anything above it.  That is the pattern year after year and the records are here to prove it.  That is where credibility comes in.  The social <Col N="1196" /> partners, economists, farmers, trade unionists and others have seen where the credibility and integrity lie.  These people are pragmatists and they are impressed most of all by the achievement of reaching targets.  That is what the budget is all about &mdash; the broad thrust of where we are going.</P>
    <P>In the context of both the budget and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> I am worried about suggestions that the Dáil will be made redundant by virtue of the fact that this Government are discussing with representatives of the community where we should be going. Some of the things which have been said would worry me.  A newspaper reported Deputy Spring as saying that power is not given, that it must be taken.  That was in the context of this House.  There is in Dublin a hoarding advertising the film <i>The Godfather</i> and stating that real power is not given, it must be taken. Who is plagiarising what?  Deputy Ruairí Quinn spoke of confrontation in the House because we discuss with our social partners what is happening.  This illustrates the helplessness of the Opposition in facing the strategy which is drawing this country out of the mess.  It would appear that the Opposition would rather return to the position from which we are being dragged.  The results being achieved must be driving them to recklessness.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly disappointing and puzzling to find the Labour Party making these noises, seeing that the ICTU are moving towards long term co-operation with the social partners and the Government. They are willing to work on achieving economic growth and a stable economy and they are willing to plan ten years ahead.  Still we have this disruptive <Col N="1197" /> voice expressing the opinion that this should not happen.  The Labour Party are out of touch with their claimed constituency, whose views are obviously more accurately reflected by this Government than by themselves.</P>
    <P>I return to this matter of the Dáil being made redundant because of the enormous contribution made by the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and by the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  It is blind to the point of stupidity not to recognise the progress we have made and this attitude must be stamped out.  The record shows reduced borrowing, tax reductions, greater income to the less well off, economic growth, good investment figures, a healthy balance of payments and balance of trade.  People may say this is macro economics, but the figures are there.  Progress is being made.  It is recognised by all parties, although perhaps not publicly admitted, that progress is dependent on negotiated agreements between all the social partners.  It must also be in coordination with carefully designed budgets.  They must be passed by the Dáil.  It certainly does not threaten or make the Dáil redundant.  If this year's budget is cautious, so be it.  Last year the growth rate forecast was exceeded.  This year there is some doubt for obvious reasons &mdash; the Gulf War, the British and American situations &mdash; so it is rightly a cautious budget.  Hopefully the previous speaker is not complaining about the fact that this is a cautious budget.</P>

I would like to nail the big lie that is being put across constantly by this Government &mdash; and Deputy Dennehy repeated it again &mdash; that this is the greatest Government in the history of the State.  It has been stated by the Taoiseach and by many Ministers so often that many Deputies even on this side of the House are beginning to believe it.  I just want to nail that one and to say that in fact it is the worst Government in the history of the State.  This Government who have been three years in office end up with 240,000 unemployed having sat through three years of the greatest emigration in the history of the State: 120,000 people have emigrated since this Government came into power.  It is probably many more; we do not know the figure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dennehy spoke about the question of confidentiality and credibility. That is all right for a few economists and so on, but for the people generally it has been absolutely disastrous and the progress that was made in the area that Deputy Dennehy was talking about was made because workers sacrificed themselves in order to pay the debts of the country but they were betrayed by private greed, people ripping off money, taking it out of the country and the economy for themselves and not putting it back in.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance whose budget we are talking about stated again that it is not the responsibility of the Government to create jobs.  That is an old Thatcherism now that is as obsolete as the Berlin Wall.  It is the responsibility of Government to create jobs and to look after the citizens of the State.  It is the responsibility of the Government to live up to the Constitution at least, to see that every citizen has equal opportunities and is enabled to have the appropriate education and to have jobs available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> The real disaster of the economic policies being pursued by this Government will be hitting them in the next few months.  All the signs are there that a disaster will come on the economy of the country and the first figures for unemployment show that, with an extra 3,000 unemployed.  Furthermore it is evident now that with the recession in Britain, in America and in Australia where unemployment is increasing in all of those countries, jobs are not available and emigrants are returning.  Whole families are coming back.  A couple of weeks ago a family came to me who were in London only about nine or ten months looking for work.  They gave up a corporation house here in the city and went over there expecting to make good.  They found it a total failure, came back and they are now in the position that they have neither a home nor a job and they will not even be put on the waiting list until 1 May and, of course, they will not have enough points to get a house and will not get a house because there is none available.  It is quite a disaster with the increasing numbers returning plus the redundancies we hear about every day which will increase unemployment.  We will rapidly reach the stage where almost 300,000 people will be unemployed.  If that is the Government's idea of confidence and credibility, then the Government will need to think again.</P>
    <P>Some interesting statistics in that regard were brought out by CII in January relating to job advertisements in the month of December 1989 compared to December 1990.  They showed 14 different occupational areas.  In every one except two there were huge reductions. There was a 50 per cent reduction in the craft and skilled area; a 50 per cent reduction in the medical area; a 42 per cent reduction in the education area; a 49 per cent reduction in machine operators; a 25 per cent reduction in engineering and 43 per cent in office staff etc.  There were only two occupational areas where there was an increase in jobs advertised and those were accountancy/finance and computer staff. In both of those there was an increase, <Col N="1201" /> but overall the tendency was down because there was a huge reduction in December 1990 compared with December 1989.</P>
    <P>That indicates that very bad times are coming.  Jobs are not available and Government policies need to be adjusted to take care of this.  The budget, of course, does not cover that scenario at all.  If the philosophy of the Minister for Finance that it is not the responsibility of the Government to create jobs had been adopted by previous Governments in this State, there would be no ESB, no Sugar Company &mdash; which the Government now want to sell off to greedy private enterprise because of their great success &mdash; no Bord na Móna, no Bord Gáis, no Irish Steel, and none of the semi-State companies which today employ 73,000 people, just as many as the multinational companies who were invited to this country and employ approximately 80,000 people.  They were bought in at greater expense to the taxpayer than the semi-State companies have been.  This, of course, has never been highlighted or brought to light.  We are always hearing of the burden that semi-State companies place on the State but let us remember the burden of the multinational companies who give an equivalent level of employment but repatriate their profits, to the extent of almost £3 billion last year. The successful semi-State sector have created 73,000 jobs, spend their money here, retain their profits and give their surplus funds to the State.  Of course, semi-State companies are subjected to all sorts of interference by Ministers, for example switching air routes from Aer Lingus to a private airline of whatever the Government decide for political reasons those companies should do rather than allowing them develop commercial viability.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the State to create jobs and it can be done either by establishing semi-State companies or joint ventures to exploit our resources. We have to exploit our natural resources just as Bord na Móna exploited our bogs successfully and commercially.  We could do the same for our timber industry, our <Col N="1202" /> mineral resources, and in fisheries and food processing.  Private enterprise has been given ample opportunities to do so. They have been given the appropriate climate as Minister after Minister has said in budget after budget.  They have also been given the appropriate tax breaks and a free hand, yet they have failed for decades to do the job.  During that time our people have lived on the dole or emigrated in their tens of thousands in search of jobs.  The most recent private company which was given every opportunity by the State to develop a food processing industry here was the Goodman company and we realise now, of course, what a disastrous failure that was.</P>
    <P>My brief is to speak on education, and I have to comment on that topic.  I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be able to tell me who it was who said:</P>
    <P>Man may smile and smile and be a villain.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has proved in good feminist fashion that this is true of women too, because she smiled and smiled and was quite a villain in the field of education.  She has been a disaster as far as the educational opportunities of tens of thousands of our children are concerned.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> of three years ago various phrases were used such as ensuring &ldquo;that the burden of adjustment does not fall on the disadvantaged&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;the Government will continue to encourage and foster the participation of the disadvantaged at all levels of education.&rdquo; None of this was done.  In fact, it was the opposite.  Government policy discouraged and prevented the disadvantaged from participating in education at all levels.  It was also said that:</P>
    <P>A particular area of focus will be to encourage more second-level pupils to complete the senior cycle.</P>
    <P>The reverse has happened in areas where there were senior cycle schools and, furthermore, no post-primary schools are being built.  Areas are crying out for post-primary schools, but they are not being <Col N="1203" /> built because the capital was not made available.  The PNR also says that the Minister will encourage &ldquo;more working class children to advance to third-level education&rdquo;.  That is the biggest joke of all.  It was very bad before but after the three years tenure by this Minister for Education, the situation is much worse at third level than ever it was.</P>
    <P>The Minister has created greater disadvantage for disadvantaged children.  I do not like using the word &ldquo;disadvantaged&rdquo; because it appears to express the view that due to some accident of disadvantage that children happen to be in this category but it is as a result of State policy that people find themselves in this disadvantaged position.  Instead of doing what was set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Minister got rid of remedial teachers, completely abolished the school psychological service, that was building up at that time, and guidance counselling, all of which are absolutely essential for what are called disadvantaged children in disadvantaged areas.  The Minister created a two tier educational system.  I would like to quote from an excellent survey carried out by the National Parents' Council entitled, the <i>The Cost of Free Education</i> which opens with a quotation from the Constitution:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State shall provide for free primary education.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The survey goes on to point out what has happened.  It gives very interesting statistics which point out that only 52 per cent of educational costs in Dublin came from the capitation grants from the Department of Education.  The figure for Leinster was 60 per cent, Munster, 63 per cent and in Connaught it was 64 per cent. The State is supposed to provide free primary education but 17 per cent of expenditure was raised by fundraising in Dublin and 11 per cent by voluntary contributions, that is contributions by parents.  The amounts raised by voluntary contributions in disadvantaged areas were as follows: 11 per cent in Dublin; 5 <Col N="1204" /> per cent in Leinster; 4 per cent in Munster and 9 per cent in Connacht-Ulster.  Voluntary contributions vary from school to school.  Some schools were able to get £60 per child as a voluntary contribution while others got £20 per child and in many areas a school would be very lucky to get £5 per child.  That is what created the two tier educational system.  The variation between schools is enormous.  A school that gets a voluntary contribution of £60 per child has every facility provided whereas those which receive smaller contributions cannot give the same level of education because they have not the facilities.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mary Flaherty has given me notice of her intention to raise the following matter: whether the Minister for Energy proposes to absorb the cost of the increased ESB charges.  Deputy Flaherty knows the procedure, she has five minutes to present her case and the Minister has five minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael believes the Government should absorb the increases in ESB charges.  They are a direct result of changes in VAT imposed by the Government.  The Irish taxpayers, workers and pensioners are already struggling to meet the increased costs of home heating fuel as a result of the Gulf crisis and its impact on prices.  In Dublin the imposition of the ban on smoky fuels has led to a very great increase in costs which has not been covered by the additional funds made available by the Government; those who are not in that category have had to bear the full burden.  At this time it is difficult for many and impossible for some to absorb the additional energy costs imposed as a result of the VAT changes which are to be passed on to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> I anticipate that the Minister will indicate that the amounts involved are relatively small.  I refer to the pensioner to whom I referred in my budget speech who talked about the £4 per month he would receive as a result of the budget. A sum of £1 will be taken back by virtue of this change, another £1 by the anticipated increases in his gas bill and another £1 as a result of extra telephone charges. Out of that £4 he has £1 left to cope with all the other increases.  While the amounts involved may be small, as a result of the other cumulative changes they are substantial.  I make a particular case for the social welfare recipient.  I would also like to ask the Minister to reassure us on the points raised earlier in the day by Deputy Michael Noonan, our spokesman on Finance.  Is this the end?</P>
    <P>In his budget contribution the Taoiseach said he anticipated that all items in the 12.5 per cent range would gradually move up into the higher band and only those which were at the 10 per cent rate would move into the lower group.  Is this the Government's policy?  Is this what we can look forward to?  The EC recommended that the appropriate range for home heating fuels would be in the order of 4 per cent to 9 per cent.  The Government and the ESB promised there would be no increases until the end of 1992.  The consumer should not have to pay for the Government's slowness to reform VAT leaving us to pay higher energy prices than our EC partners.  It also underlines the need &mdash; this point was made this morning by Deputy Bruton &mdash; for a Competition Bill to ensure that we are getting value for money from the ESB which has a monopoly in relation to the supply of electricity in this country.  I hope the Minister will give a positive reply and additional information as to the Government's intent in relation to these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 30 January 1991, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, announced that, with effect from 1 March 1991, the low rate of 10 per cent VAT will be increased to 12.5 per cent on a wide range of items and <Col N="1207" /> fuels, including electricity.  At the time of the budget the ESB announced that on 19 February 1991 its board would consider what to do about the VAT increase.</P>
      <P>The ESB, which had itself adopted a policy of price freeze for three years, absorbed two previous VAT increases imposed.  In the 1988 budget, when VAT of 5 per cent was imposed on electricity bills for the first time, the board absorbed this in a general concurrent price reduction, so it was not passed on to customers.  The 1990 budget increased the VAT rate on electricity bills to 10 per cent.  Because of the good financial outcome for the 1989 year the board applied a discount on domestic electricity bills during 1990 to offset the VAT increase.  The absorption of these two VAT increases represents an annual benefit to the consumer of £31 million.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the ESB board considered the present position.  It decided that the tax could not be carried and it approved a rise of 2.5 per cent from 1 April 1991 in its charges arising from the budgetary decision.  It will mean a £1.50 increase on a typical ESB bill of £60 for a two month period or less than 17p per week.  Most consumers would only use half of the average, therefore, the VAT increase represents less than 9p for them, not the £1 claimed by Deputy Flaherty.  It is the first rise in domestic bills since 1985.  As is the case with all VAT charges, the amounts which the ESB collect will be transferred to the Exchequer and will not benefit the ESB.</P>
      <P>The ESB have expressed their regret that because of their changed financial situation a further discount of 2.5 per cent is not possible and, accordingly, the VAT increase must be passed on in bills from 1 April next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>VAT on electricity was first introduced in 1988 as part of the moves towards harmonisation of our rates with our European colleagues in 1992 and this has to continue.  This increase has to be seen in the context of the positive movement in ESB prices in the past few years.  Since January 1985 electricity prices have been reduced in real terms by 35 per cent <Col N="1208" /> for industry, 27 per cent for commercial and 20 per cent for household.  ESB electricity prices are now below the European average for domestic and industrial.  It is still a major objective of the board to supply electricity at a price which helps to keep Irish industry competitive abroad.</P>
    <P>To put this into greater context, it is interesting to read in today's <i>Financial Times</i> that there is a suggestion that UK electricity prices will rise by a further 10 per cent on top of increases of about 26 per cent since 1988.  That is a total of over 36 per cent compared with the forthcoming ESB increase of 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>When in 1989 the ESB announced that they would not increase the price of electricity to their customers for the following three years, that was dependent on no unforeseen or significant cost increases arising over which they had no control. The cost of the VAT already absorbed has been heavy.  While astute oil purchases at low cost about 12 months ago have sheltered the ESB from price increases so far, the ESB have to have regard to further pressures on their financial performance.  The ESB also have a large accumulated deficit of £54 million and a heavy debt repayment burden.  They will be faced with a major capital expenditure programme to meet increasing demand later in this decade. In the face of rising costs and projected accelerated capital expenditure for the future, the ESB decided that this VAT imposition cannot be absorbed.</P>
    <P>The increase in VAT rates in the budget was decided by the Government as part of the overall budget package, which included provisions for the less well-off.  The budget provided for a 4 per cent increase in welfare payments generally, and with inflation in 1991 projected at 3 per cent, the budget went beyond the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in matching inflation.  In addition, a reduction in the standard VAT rate from 23 per cent to 21 per cent will apply to most consumer and household goods. The estimated net effect of the overall VAT changes is that consumers will be <Col N="1209" /> better off to the tune of £37 million in 1991.</P>
    <P>While the ESB are unable to absorb the costs of this particular imposition, I wish to reiterate that the ESB have assured me that they will continue doing everything possible to hold down costs which are within their own control and to manage the potential risks in a sudden uncertain environment outside.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Flaherty, I would finally say that we will apply the VAT rates after 1992 in line with whatever the EC proposals are then.</P>

      <P>Emerald City Production Limited is a film animation company which makes full length animated feature films.  It is based in Dún Laoghaire and has a full-time workforce of 45 and employs a further 20 people on a freelance basis.  Emerald City is a wholly owned subsidiary of the New York based D.L. Taffner.  It has been in Dún Laoghaire for over five years and has reputedly received £500,000 in various IDA grants and aids.  On Wednesday, 6 February, its employees were informed that their employment was being terminated. They were given 30 days' notice of redundancy to take effect on 11 March next unless the parent company can get a buyer in the meantime.  The employees were all asked to leave the premises and the locks were changed on the doors.</P>
      <P>The reasons given to the employees for the closure related to the company's alleged financial difficulties.  Both the closure and the stated reasons for it, were a major surprise to the employees.  Over the past five years they had never been told of any financial or trading difficulties. Indeed, they had been led to believe that there were orders for the next two years. Since Christmas they had been working flat out to complete films and they finalised their last film late on the Saturday night before the closure.  Indeed, some of them were working so much overtime that they were taking pills to stay awake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" /> The closure of this company is a major blow to the employees, to Dún Laoghaire and to the film industry in Ireland.  Dún Laoghaire is an ideal location for an animation film company because the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design specialises in animation studies.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to intervene in this case and to use his good offices and those of the IDA to secure a new owner for this company.  I ask him, if he has not already done so, to make contact with the parent company and to find out the real reasons for the sudden closure of this successful enterprise and what efforts are now being made to secure a new owner so that these 60 jobs in Dún Laoghaire can be saved.</P>
    <P>I ask him to let us know how much State aid has been given to this company and whether it will be repaid.  Was there a five year agreement with the IDA which has now expired and are the company now simply pulling up and getting out?</P>
    <P>The more I hear about this company, the less impressed I am with them.  They are a strictly anti-trade union company. When six employees attempted to join a union over a year ago, they were all either dismissed or squeezed out.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire cannot afford another closure.  As it is, there are almost 7,000 out of work in the constituency and there is very little industry or prospects for industrial development in the area.  This industry was ideally suited to the area and I had hoped that it would grow in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>This industry should not simply be allowed to close.  Over the past five years a pool of talent has been assembled in Emerald City which should not be dissolved. The films they made have won world-wide recognition.  The enterprise is ideally located beside Dún Laoghaire port, on the DART line and close to the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design.  It should, therefore, be perfectly possible to secure a new owner for this firm.  I know the Minister has with some success, intervened in closures in the past and I now ask him to interest himself in this case, if he has not already done so, <Col N="1211" /> and to make every effort to save this company and these jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I greatly regret the difficulties which have arisen in relation to the operation of Emerald City in recent weeks and the consequent effects on their very committed and skilled workforce.</P>
      <P>I should like to advise the House that Emerald City Productions were established in Dún Laoghaire in August 1985 by Donald L. Taffner Limited whose headquarters are in New York.  The Irish facility was set up to create and produce animated programmes, commercials and services for use on television which would be sold worldwide through the D. L. Taffner sales and distribution network. The company in Dún Laoghaire produced animated classics such as &ldquo;Oliver Twist&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ghoststories&rdquo;, &ldquo;Phantom of the Opera&rdquo; and &ldquo;Brer Rabbit&rdquo;.  These were one hour productions for the children's television market.</P>
      <P>The company commenced business with ten people and at times of high output employed over 50 people during the six years of their operations in Ireland.  At the date of the company's redundancy announcement on 6 February, 43 full-time staff were employed. I understand that in their announcement the company indicated that they had suffered substantial losses over a period of time.  The redundancy notice for all Emerald City employees will be effective from 11 March 1991.  In the meantime the company are trying to attract new projects and additional revenue.  If they are successful in this regard the employees will be advised immediately. The company received financial assistance of £497,637 from the IDA in capital employment and training grants.  If production is not restarted the IDA will revoke and seek repayment of grants with outstanding liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason for the company's difficulties are the recession in the company's biggest market, the USA, coupled with uncertainty caused by the Gulf War <Col N="1212" /> and losses sustained over their production period.  I have been advised by the IDA that they have been in contact with the company on an ongoing basis and are monitoring all developments as they arise.  Every effort will, of course, be made by the relevant State agencies either to place those who may lose their jobs in Emerald City or to secure a new industrial project for Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <P>I raise this matter in the House this evening because I am seeking help for some constituents of mine who have serious problems.  I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter and I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Justice for being present in the House.  It restores one's faith in democracy when one can raise a matter like this in the House of Parliament.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it is a sad day for Ireland that I have to raise this matter here.  During my days of studying law, particularly jurisprudence, I was always in favour of rehabilitation rather than retribution in regard to criminal activity. I am raising this matter against a background of limited resources and at a time when the Department of Justice are operating under grave financial restrictions and when there are not adequate numbers of gardaí on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the matter I am raising tonight with the Minister of State at the Department of Justice could be raised by any Deputy from any rural town in Ireland &mdash; the spate of crime being carried out by and large by juveniles.  Despite the best wishes of their families and society, unfortunately there are no custodial places available for these offenders.  I have been informed that there are 33 places of detention for people under 16 years of age and there is no possibility of the offencers currently before the courts being offered custodial facilities.  In many instances this is a source of heartbreak for parents of these children.  The mother <Col N="1213" /> of the child, in the case I want to bring to the Minister's attention, wants her child to be taken into custody.  She is unable to cope with her child who has a string of convictions and who when released from Tralee District Court this afternoon will go back on the rampage again.  She knows that he has no future by virtue of the fact that he comes from a broken home and the Department of Justice, the responsible organ, have no facilities whereby they can take this young man of 15 years into custody.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that our first responsibility must be to our children and certainly our constitutional imperative in that regard must be borne in mind. However, due to the apathy and ignorance which exist we seem to be unable to provide any answers to the crime rates in our society at present.  We have always believed that our greatest asset &mdash; I hope this is the case &mdash; are our young people.</P>
    <P>In the case to which I am referring the parents need assistance.  The district justice in question wishes the Department of Justice or the Department of Education to provide facilities for this young man who has been in trouble with the law, has been convicted of many crimes and has many charges pending but who cannot be dealt with because the facilities do not exist.  This young man needs attention, help and assistance.  This is why I have availed of this opportunity to bring this case to the attention of the Department of Justice.  It is regrettable to think that in a society which proudly regards itself as Christian there is no room at the inn for this young man.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister of State to outline to the house the steps he is taking to provide additional custodial facilities for young offenders.  If we cannot provide the answer to this problem it will be exacerbated and we will have to deal with a far more serious problem in the future than the one which exists at present.</P>

      <P>The question of accommodation for young offenders has been dealt with on a number of occasions recently in this House, indeed as recently <Col N="1214" /> as last night in response to items raised by Deputy Jimmy Deenihan and Deputy Bill Cotter.  It might be no harm, however, to set out again the responsibilities of the Department of Justice in relation to the provision of custodial facilities for offenders in the younger age group.</P>
      <P>Generally the institutions operated by the Department of Justice cater for young male offenders aged 16 years and over and young female offenders aged 17 years and over.  Young male offenders aged 16 to 21 can be committed by the courts to St. Patrick's Institution.  Male offenders aged 17 years and over can be sent by the courts to the committal prisons: Mountjoy, Cork, Limerick and Portlaoise. The Department of Justice also have responsibility for the operation of places of detention set up under the 1970 Prisons Act which include institutions such as Wheatfield and Shanganagh Castle.  I should emphasise that these institutions are entirely different in nature from places of detention set up under the provisions of the 1908 Children Act.  The places of detention operated by the Department of Justice can legally only cater for offenders who were committed by the courts to St. Patrick's Institution or to prison.  Mountjoy Women's Prison generally caters for female offenders aged 17 years and over.</P>
      <P>It is the case, however, that 15 and 16 year old offenders can be committed to prison in very particular circumstances. This can happen only in cases where the court certifies under the provisions of the 1908 Children Act that the young person is &ldquo;of so unruly a character that he cannot be detained in a place of detention provided under the Act or that he is of so depraved a character that he is not a fit person to be so detained&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having, I hope, made clear the legal position in relation to institutions operated by the Department of Justice, I would like to address the suggestion that there may be a grave shortfall in places for young offenders in custodial facilities operated by the Department of Justice. While it is the case that there is always pressure on custodial accommodation for <Col N="1215" /> young offenders &mdash; and, indeed, for adult offenders &mdash; it would be wrong to characterise this as amounting to a grave shortfall in places.  This is all the more so given the fact that the past couple of years have seen the bringing into operation of the 320 places at the new place of detention at Wheatfield which is geared primarily to cater for offenders in the younger age group.  In addition, it should be worth reminding the House that this year's Estimates allow for the recruitment of 31 additional staff for the Probation and Welfare Service to enable the introduction of a scheme of intensive supervision in the community for about 200 offenders, many of whom can be expected to be in the younger age group. This major initiative should lead to a significant reduction in pressure on custodial facilities.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, be misguided to assume that, simply because a young person appears before a court on criminal charges, the Department of Justice inevitably have statutory responsibility, or indeed would be the appropriate agency, to provide residential facilities to which the courts could send the young person involved.  The 1908 Children Act enables the courts to send young offenders to what are referred to in the act as industrial and reformatory schools which are the statutory responsibility of the Department of Education.  These have become known over the years as special schools and are also designated in certain cases as places of detention under the 1908 Children Act.  The House was informed, in response to an Adjournment debate on 27 November last, that a new residential school to house 20 young girl offenders is being planned for location adjacent to the existing Finglas Children's Centre.  The House was also informed of the possibility of providing a temporary arrangement to cope with the current demand for places for girls.  In addition, details were given of work to provide an additional 40 places for boys at the former Scoil Ard Mhuire at Lusk.</P>
    <P>I have been impressed by the case made by Deputy Spring and I can readily <Col N="1216" /> identify with the problem.  I want to assure the House that the Government are fully aware of the position.  We have the whole matter under active consideration at present and will take the appropriate action as opportunities and resources become available.  In conclusion, I can assure the House that there is regular liaison between the Departments of Education, Health and Justice to endeavour to ensure the most effective co-ordination of services for these young people.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear one minute statements on matters appropriate to the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Health.  I propose to call on Deputy Noel Dempsey and Deputy Jimmy Deenihan to make one minute statements appropriate to the Minister for the Environment in the first instance, to be followed by a statement by Deputy Eamon Gilmore appropriate to the Minister for Health.

      <P>The reason I ask the Minister to approach An Bord Pleanála <Col N="1217" /> to waive their rights to legal costs against the community group at Clarkestown in Summerhill, County Meath, is that I believe the community group there and the community generally have been grievously wronged by RTE and Radio Luxembourg.  In the original specification regarding the Radio Tara mast RTE stated that the mast should be sited in a sparsely populated area, but that was ignored.  The elected representatives of the people of Meath democratically decided that the mast should not be sited in the community, and that too was ignored.</P>
      <P>Because of this injustice the community spent almost £20,000 on an appeal to An Bord Pleanála, which they lost. They appealed to the High Court and won their case there.  The Supreme Court recently overturned that decision, leaving the local community to face a bill of around £100,000.  That is the outcome of their efforts to secure a hazard free environment.  I appeal to the Minister to try to restore the faith of the local community in the political system and in democracy.</P>

There are 180 householders involved in the scheme, including 120 farmers and 60 private householders.  Many of these houses have wells which are suitable only for farm use and not for domestic use.  Other houses have water troughs.  However, there are some houses without any water supply whatsoever.  These people have been waiting for the past four years for the scheme to commence.  The group have carried out all the preliminary work, including the purchase of a site for a reservoir.  As 83 per cent of Kerry is supplied with mains water, very little work would need to be done to supply the remaining areas.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the finance is provided for this scheme immediately.</P>

The children's ward of that hospital was closed down due to the health cuts.  This little boy is in pain. His tonsils are inflamed every two or three weeks and he has already had 12 courses of antibiotics.  He got so sick last Sunday that he was rushed to Harcourt Street Hospital.  I would ask the Minister to make whatever arrangements are necessary to ensure this boy is operated on quickly.  When I raised a similar matter with the previous Minister of State I was informed that action would be taken to try to reduce the waiting list for tonsillectomies at this hospital, but so far that has not happened.</P>

      <P>I have no power under the Planning Acts to intervene in the affairs of An Bord Pleanála in the manner suggested by Deputy Dempsey.  I do not think it would be right for the Minister to take any action which could have the effect of distorting a court order of this kind.  The question of An Bord Pleanála pursuing costs in this case is a matter for the board to decide, having regard to well established principles in such matters.</P>
      <P>For Deputy Deenihan's information, in 1990 the Rathae-Lyrecrompane group water scheme was redesigned to include the Tournageehy district to cater for long term water supply needs. Kerry County Council recommended the enlargement of the scheme's trunk mains and they recently submitted proposals in this regard.  These are under examination in my Department and there will be no delay in dealing with the matter.  Since the extent of the enlargement will have a considerable influence on the overall cost of the scheme it is not possible, at this stage, to estimate the level of grant necessary to complete the scheme.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there <Col N="1219" /> are difficulties at present in regard to the waiting lists for ear, nose and throat services at St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire.  I have received a report from St. Michael's concerning the specific case raised by Deputy Gilmore.  This child was seen by the consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon at out-patients in St. Michael's Hospital in December 1990 and was placed on the in-patient waiting list for a tonsillectomy at that time.  The hospital has indicated that it will be at least one year before the child can be operated on at St. Michael's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware, however, that there is considerable variation in the waiting time for tonsillectomies for children between hospitals in the Dublin area.  For example, the waiting time for tonsillectomies for children at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, is nine months and at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital it is six weeks.  In an effort to be helpful in regard to this case, I suggest that the child's family may wish to consult their GP about <Col N="1220" /> the possibility of referral to another hospital.</P>
    <P>As regards ear, nose and throat services at St. Michael's Hospital, I understand that a locum ENT consultant provides a limited service at the hospital consisting of one out-patient and one in-patient session per week.  I understand that Comhairle na Ospidéal, the statutory body for the regulation of consultant medical appointments, have recommended that ear, nose and throat activity at St. Michael's should be confined to clinics, ward consultation and day surgery in accordance with their policy document on the development of ENT services.  In this context my Department will be reviewing the organisation of surgical services generally in Dublin south-east and the role of St. Michael's in regard to ear, nose and throat services will be specificially examined as part of this review.</P>

      <P>Abalone are seaweed eating marine gastropods or snails.  They are one of the highest priced shellfish in the world and markets are buoyant.  In additon, the shells of the abalone have a good market potential being one of the most important sources, for example, of mother of pearl. Cultivation practices are environmentally friendly.  I consider abalone, therefore, to be a very attractive species for development by the aquaculture industry in Ireland and I am fully behind research efforts to date.</P>
      <P>The main research and development work in relation to the species &mdash; both the Japanese and European varieties &mdash; has been conducted by the Shellfish Research Laboratory at Carna, County Galway.  The Laboratory operates under the auspices of the Zoology Department of UCG and receives funding from my Department to support their research efforts.  As abalone are not a species native to Irish waters, its introduction had to be carefully controlled through quarantine under the supervision of my Department and in accordance with the code of practice laid down by the relevant international organisation which is the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.  This involves rearing a second generation of abalone in quarantine and ensuring that that generation is free of pests and parasites.  Research and development in connection with the cleared material is in turn expensive and time consuming given the complex life-cycle of abalone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The research and development programme for abalone has involved the co-operation of a number of State agencies which include Udaras na Gaeltachta, the Central Development Committee and, under my own wing, an Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Trial growing is now under way at a number of locations and I am hopeful that ultimately the species will make an important contribution to our marine <Col N="960" /> development efforts.  I will continue to support initiative in this area.</P>

      <P>My objective in the management of the Celtic Sea fishery is to allocate the available quotas as evenly as possible over the main spawning seasons with a view to maximising income and employment both for the fishermen and the processors.</P>
      <P>The fishery, which is primarily a roe fishery at present, can be divided broadly into two distinct elements from a spawning viewpoint.</P>
      <P>First, the western element from Dingle to Cork Harbour, is an autumn fishery where the roe is suitable for commercial exploitation in the October to December period.  The eastern element from Cork Harbour to Dunmore East is a winter-spring fishery where the roe is suitable for commercial exploitation in the December and early new year periods. Each year the quota is divided between the winter-spring fishery and the autumn fishery to ensure that fishermen in the various constituent parts are able to catch an equitable portion of the quota.  Last year the fishery which was managed locally by the industry was closed on 30 November when the quota was exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fishery reopened in January under <Col N="962" /> the 1991 quota arrangements.  A spawning area off Dunmore known as the Dunmore Box was closed to fishing for the period 15 to 31 January.  This was a prearranged EC conservation measure involving the closure by rotation of one of the three main spawning areas in the Celtic Sea each year.  For this reason the catch possibilities for fishermen operating in that area of the fishery were reduced in the period up to 31 January when the fishery closed as the winter-spring catch allocation agreed with the industry had been reached.</P>
    <P>When the fishery reopens next autumn I will continue to monitor the rate of catching to ensure that the available quota is divided as evenly as possible between the eastern and western sectors.</P>

In the case of Dublin-Dún Laoghaire final decision on development options will have to await consideration of the outline development plan for Dún Laoghaire Harbour being prepared at present by the Interim Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board, which I set up in January 1990.  The Dún Laoghaire plan will be ready soon.  The interim board intend to mount a public display of its proposals <Col N="965" /> and all interested parties will be afforded an opportunity to make their input into the nature of the developments recommended for the harbour.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of these plans and the comments offered by the public, I will decide how best to progress the development of passenger reception facilities in the Dublin Bay area.</P>

      <P>The number of active licence applications on hands at 31 January 1991 was 220, the vast majority of which do not meet the criteria for the granting of licences.  My Department are busy processing these cases at present.  Five licences have issued so far in 1991.</P>
      <P>I have explained on a number of previous occasions the background to national licensing policy.  I would refer the Deputies in particular to the Adjournment Debate on 31 May 1990 and subsequent press release.  I would also refer the Deputies to my reply to the written question from Deputy Mary Coughlan on 12 December 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position briefly is that in August of 1989 I imposed a total embargo on the issue of new licences except where prior written commitments had been given. Policy has evolved since then to the point where licences, other than licences for vessels engaged in aquaculture or bivalve fishing or certain vessels which have been approved by the European Commission, are granted only to those who are able to meet the condition of withdrawing from the current sea fishing boat register tonnage and horsepower equal to the tonnage and horsepower of their new vessels.  In addition they must be able to satisfy me on the following criteria: (a) that the new vessel is safe and seaworthy; (b) that the skipper/crew will be <Col N="966" /> duly qualified in accordance with relevant legislation; (c) that no decommissioning grant shall have been paid in respect of the new vessel; and (d) proof of ownership.</P>
    <P>I must also be satisfied that the economic and social benefits arising from the exploitation of the target species of the boats involved will accrue primarily to the coastal regions and communities which the quotas concerned are designed to benefit.  Of the five licences issued so far in 1991, three were issued in respect of change of ownership cases within the existing fleet and two in respect of people who had written commitments to licences pre-dating the embargo referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>It is long-established policy not to disclose the details of individual applications received or licences granted.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the fact that the pattern of fishing changes from time to time, and that this may change further as new opportunities are pursued around our coasts.  While I have no immediate plans to change existing fishery harbour centre arrangements, I do intend to review the position as fishery harbour development progresses under the programme announced recently.</P>
      <P>The objective of fishery harbour centres were to provide a network of strategically located fishery centres around the coast with the appropriate facilities.</P>
      <P>In addition to the five centres there are almost 900 additional landing places which are controlled by the various local authorities.  These provide a comprehensive network of harbours and landing facilities for the Irish Sea fishing fleet.</P>

      <P>Approximately 150 inquiries in relation to finfish farming and 500 inquiries in relation to shellfish farming have been raised with the Department of the Marine since its establishment.</P>
      <P>Primarily for environmental reasons, priority has been given to the licensing of finfish farms in which regard the Governments environment action programme contains a commitment to bring all such projects fully within the licensing framework before the end of 1991.  Progress in that regard is now very well advanced with over 70 per cent of capacity now fully covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that all licence decisions be properly evaluated and researched and in that connection in order to provide a comprehensive basis for licensing I have developed a dual approach: (a) for finfish farms of more than 100 tonnes an Environmental Impact Assessment is required, which is publicly displayed. This comprehensive technical and other data must be supplied by the promoter to the Department and evaluated by the experts there; and (b) for shellfish farms the promoters are made aware of the data required but it is necessary for my <Col N="969" /> Department to assemble all the relevant information for areas concerned.  I have therefore put in place a programme of &ldquo;base line scientific studies&rdquo; by BIM in over 15 areas around the coast, in order to underpin future licensing programmes and decisions and to better inform the public consultative process.</P>

      <P>Under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes, a soldier's pension consists of: (a) a basic pension in respect of 21 years' qualifying service; and (b) an additional increment of £3.15 a week in respect of <Col N="978" /> each year of qualifying service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years.</P>
      <P>The basic pension is paid to the pensioner during his lifetime.  As a general rule, the additional increment continues to be payable until the pensioner becomes entitled to a social welfare retirement pension, at age 65, or to a contributory old age pension, at age 66, at which stage the additional increment is withdrawn.  As a special concession, the additional increment continues to be payable up to 70 years of age in the case of a pensioner discharged prior to 1 August 1978, provided he is not in receipt of a social welfare retirement pension.</P>
      <P>This is the only instance in which payment of a pension under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme is affected by a social welfare payment.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are aware of non compliance with tax obligations by certain elements within the security industry.  The special inquiry branch within the Revenue Commissioners are actively engaged in identifying firms in this and other industries which are not on the tax record.  Joint investigation units of social welfare and revenue officers set up to combat the black economy have undertaken projects in this industry and continue investigations on an ongoing basis as required.  The programme was strengthened by the introduction of the Social Welfare (Notification by Employers of Commencement of Employment) Regulations 1988 which became effective on 1 January 1989. These regulations require employers in certain industries, including the security industry, to notify the Department of <Col N="979" /> Social Welfare of any new employees taken on by them.</P>
      <P>Information concerning abuses of the social welfare, income tax and VAT codes has been brought to the Revenue Commissioners attention by representatives of both trade unions and the security industry.  All information provided has been examined.  Measures to combat evasion are kept under continuous review, and all relevant information should be communicated to the Revenue Commissioners. If the Deputy has specific information in this regard he should refer it to the Revenue Commissioners for investigation.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the situation outlined by the Deputy.  The Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, apply tax relief in certain circumstances in respect of motor vehicles purchased by disabled persons.  As the vehicle in question will not be purchased by the person concerned but supplied to him on a loan basis by the charitable trust, the existing regulations do not allow for the repayment of excise duty and VAT. A review of the operation of the regulations is currently being conducted in accordance with an undertaking I gave to the House last year.  The circumstances which arise in this instance will be examined as part of that review.</P>

    <P>In the time available, it was not possible to obtain up-to-date figures on excise duties on vehicles for the other member states of the EC.  However information on the levels of excise duty or corresponding taxes in the other member states as at 1 September 1987 is contained in the most recent edition of the Inventory of Taxes, published by the European Commission, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The various rates of excise duty charged on road diesel in member states are set out in Table 1 which is being circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>
      <i>VAT</i>
    </P>
    <P>The rates of VAT applying throughout the Community on road diesel and on vehicles are set out in Table 2 which follows.  The rates of VAT applying to spare parts cannot be readily identified.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Road Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The most readily available comparative road tax data relate to heavy goods vehicles with a laden weight of 38 tonnes.  The Irish road tax for this category of truck will be increased to about £1,000 per annum &mdash; from £900 per annum &mdash; from 1 April 1991.  According to EC Commission data, the average EC road tax for a 38 tonne truck is about IR £1,200 p.a. &mdash; ranging from about IR£300 p.a., in Spain to about IR£4,000 p.a., in the UK.</P>
    <P>Further details are available in the above mentioned EC Inventory of Taxes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>EC Harmonisation Proposals</i>
    </P>
    <P>VAT: It is proposed that vehicles, spare parts and road diesel will be liable to VAT at the standard rate &mdash; a range <Col N="983" /> of 14 per cent to 20 per cent has been put forward by the Commission.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Excise</i>
    </P>
    <P>To the extent that any excise duties on vehicles and spare-parts rely on the operation of border controls, the completion of the Single Market will require their abolition.</P>
    <P>For road diesel, the Commission have recently proposed that the excise duty rate should be between 245 and 270 ECU per 1,000 litres &mdash; £18.93-£20.86 per hectolitre &mdash; from 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Road Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The latest Commission proposal is that the road tax for a 38 tonne truck would initially be harmonised at minimum rates of between IR700 and IR2,150 &mdash; depending on axle configuration &mdash; over the period 1992-94.  Road tax rates would then be further harmonised, on a phased basis, between 1995 and 1999, in order to cover road infrastructure costs generated by heavy goods vehicles, on the basis of road cost and usage data which the Commission envisage being submitted by EC member states.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the <Col N="984" /> Government have taken a very positive attitude to the completion of the internal market, including the tax harmonisation dimension, but have also indicated that the budgetary problems which the various proposals pose must be recognised and addressed.  We will be approaching the specific tax proposals in the transport area against that background, and with a view to ensuring that the overall effect of any adjustments which may be required do not undermine the competitive position of Irish road hauliers or exporters.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in relation to the provision of customs services no costs accrue to traders other than charges in respect of attendance of officials outside normal hours which apply to both ports and land frontier stations.  Differentials in costs between the use of ports in the State and stations on the land frontier may arise due to haulage rates and costs of sea voyages, matters which are outside the control of the Revenue Commissioners. Customs procedures at ports in the State and stations on the land frontier are identical in relation to documentation and examination of goods.  The same clearance criteria apply in both areas.  Delays can occur due to presentation of faulty documentation or failure of carriers to present goods promptly for examination. The Revenue Commissioners constantly review the time taken to process entries and effect clearance of consignments in order to minimise delays.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that identical customs procedures and documentation apply to all ports and stations on the land frontier. It is proposed to introduce a new system of technology viz. automated entry processing (AEP) at all import and export points, including the land frontier on 1 April 1991.  AEP will permit importers and exporters to have their documentation processed and customs formalities completed in advance of presentation of the goods.  This technology will further enhance customs clearance of goods.  Statistics relating to the cost to the State of providing customs services on the land frontier and the named ports and airports cannot be supplied in the time available.  Material is <Col N="987" /> being compiled at present and will be forwarded at a later date.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer claimed exemption from income tax in the current tax year.  His income is expected to exceed the relevant exemption limit of £7,500 and he is not therefore entitled to exemption from income tax.  However, as his estimated income does not greatly exceed the limit, he has been granted a measure of marginal relief in the certificate of tax-free allowances which issued to him on 2 May 1990.  His allowances were restricted to take account of his social welfare pension, which is paid gross, leaving a tax-free allowance of £39.93 available to him for use in connection with his retirement income.</P>
      <P>Marginal relief operates to ensure that the tax payable in respect of the taxpayer's total income is no more than 53 per cent of the excess of his total income over the exemption limit.  In every case in which it applies, it is more favourable to the taxpayer than taxation under the normal system of applying the standard rate to his taxable income, i.e. income less personal allowances and reliefs: this is because, although the rate of tax is higher, the amount of income to which it applies is considerably less.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the native red deer herd passing from Killarney National Park lands onto other lands which adjoin it.  Deer are wild animals and cannot &ldquo;trespass&rdquo; on lands in the legal sense.  Part of the range of the red deer herd is within the national park but a significant portion is actually outside the park.  The herd have never been enclosed within the park, as it would be both impractical and undesirable to do so.</P>
      <P>While there is no legal obligation to erect fencing to prevent a wild species from passing between the park and private holdings, the Office of Public Works are prepared in the interest of good neighbourly relations to provide fencing materials to landowners in the Tomies area provided the landowners maintain any fences they erect.</P>

      <P>The House is aware that I appointed the Interim Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board last year to advise on all aspects of the management and development of the harbour.</P>
      <P>The board are at present drafting an outline development plan for the harbour which will encompass the commercial and recreational amenities alike.  At the outset, the board identified as a priority the need to secure the operation of the fery terminal and invited Sealink, the harbour's main user, and CIE to submit development proposals for the future operation of the facility.  The board are currently considering the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the board's development plan for the harbour will incorporate an agreed proposal and specify how development will impinge upon the ferry <Col N="989" /> terminal facilities.  I do not wish, however, to pre-empt the board's consideration of the matter.</P>
    <P>I would point out that I have already indicated my support for the retention of the ferry service to Dún Laoghaire Harbour.</P>

      <P>The total share capital issued at the time of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited amounted to £16.347 million.  This represents the cumulative equity invested in the company by the shareholder, in this case the Minister for Finance on behalf of the State.  For further details of the periodic increases in issued share capital in the years mentioned by the Deputy, I would refer him to the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies (Pl. 3091), Chapter V.  If the Deputy wishes to gain a more precise picture of the company's profits and losses during the period referred to in his question, he might wish to examine the annual accounts of the company which are also available in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <P>Liner conferences provide scheduled deep sea shipping services on long haul routes worldwide.  The cargoes carried are mainly containerised and the average capacity of the vessels deployed on these services would be of the order of 2000 &mdash; 3000 TEU, 20 foot equivalent units.  The containers carried on articulated trucks are normally 40 ft. in length, e.g. equivalent to two TEUs.</P>
      <P>Following the development in the early to mid-seventies of large capacity container ships the number of ports of call was reduced for reasons of economy. Since then Irish exports/imports to and from these destinations are transhipped via conference base ports such as Liverpool, London or Rotterdam.</P>
      <P>This should be seen in the context of the overall pattern of Irish trade.  During 1989 for example more than 70 per cent by value, of Irish trade, imports and exports, was with the EC.  High volume imports such as grain, coal, ore and animal feedstuffs are carried in large drybulk vessels which mainly operate outside the liner conference system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of aid for the construction and modernisation of vessels will depend on the multi annual guidance programme <Col N="992" /> for the fleet which is to be agreed later this year and on the scope and results of the forthcoming review of the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
    <P>Aid for aquaculture is dependent on the level of private sector applications for aid, which is itself dependent on a variety of factors such as the availability of private finance, licensing, markets, etc. Other factors determining the level of aid include the availability generally of EC funds and the eligibility of projects.</P>

    <P>It is estimated that approximately 1,200 people are directly employed by shipping companies whose vessels are registered under the Irish flag.  However there are also a considerable number of people employed in ancillary activities such as ship agency, ship survey, pilotage, bunkerage, warehousing, etc., whose employment arises from shipping.  As many of these employees are also engaged in areas not directly related to the shipping industry, it is difficult to accurately estimate their number.</P>

    <P>Investments in harbour improvement works are considered as improvements in the basic infrastructue of the country and benefit not just the harbour authorities but the whole economy.  It is, therefore, difficult to assess the overall rates of return on harbour investment.  All applications for State grant assistance towards the cost of harbour development works are examined to determine whether marginal investments achieve at least minimum targets in terms of return on investment; but all the benefits are not fully quantifiable.</P>
    <P>Since my Department assumed responsibility for Dún Laoghaire Harbour on 1 January 1989 no major capital investment has been made in the harbour.  The cost of minor improvements to the ferry terminal and other harbour structures has been met from the operational budget for the harbour.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to recent Commission proposals in relation to excise duties on petrol, <Col N="1002" /> leaded and unleaded, diesel and kerosene and on which the Commission issued a press release last week.  These proposals update the target rates for excise duties on petrol and revise the target excise duty band proposed for road diesel towards which excise duties in the member states would converge over time.  They also incorporate a supplement for CO² content which works out at close to the $10 per barrel to which the Deputy refers in his question.  The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Finance leads generally on behalf of the Government on the discussions with the Commission in relation to the harmonisation of taxes, including those on energy products.  The proposals are still at a stage of preliminary discussion and my Department are keeping in close contact with industrial representatives and with other Departments on the matter.</P>
      <P>A preliminary assessment would indicate that since, for the petrol and kerosene products covered in the Commission's recent proposals, the target rates are higher than existing Irish excise rates &mdash; which are higher on average than those which obtain at present in other Community countries &mdash; general Community convergence towards the target rates would, therefore, reduce any cost disadvantage suffered by industry and services in this country.  In the case of road diesel the current Irish excise rate is marginally higher than the top of the range of excise duty proposed and the Commission's present proposals would not disimprove the relative position as far as industry and services in this country are concerned.</P>

      <P>Commissioned Army officers and permanent members of the Army Nursing Service pay a modified or reduced rate of PRSI providing cover for widows' and orphans' pensions but not for disability benefit, invalidity pension or old age pension.  They could qualify for such benefits on the basis of other employment and entitlement would not be affected by receipt of a Department of Defence pension.</P>
      <P>In the case of non-commissioned personnel, a modified rate is also payable which provides cover for all benefits with the exception of occupational injuries benefits.  Disability benefit and invalidity pension are not payable to this category, however, while they are serving in the Defence Forces.  Receipt of a Department of Defence pension would not affect entitlements arising from social insurance contributions.</P>

      <P>I am committed to providing social welfare clients with as wide a range <Col N="1007" /> of payment options as possible.  My Department already use a variety of payment methods &mdash; cash, cheque and personalised payable order (PPO) &mdash; to pay social welfare clients.</P>
      <P>At present, these payment methods are related to specific schemes.  For example, people in receipt of a pension or child benefit are paid by order book at post offices while disability benefit recipients are paid by cheque delivered to their homes.  Unemployed persons are normally paid in cash at local offices of the Department and post offices around the country.  In addition unemployed persons aged over 60 can receive their unemployment payments by means of an order book encashable at a post office.  It would be my intention to arrange for the transfer over time of more payments from the Department's offices to post offices if the necessary arrangements can be made.</P>
      <P>Progress is being made towards developing and installing the necessary support systems for the introduction of new payment options.  These include post drafts payable at post offices for unemployment payments and an electronic fund transfer (EFT) system whereby payments generally can be made direct into a person's current or deposit account.  It is planned to introduce the post draft facility on a pilot basis later this year.</P>
      <P>It is expected that an EFT facility will be introduced for child benefit recipients during the first half of 1992.  In time this will be extended to other groups of recipients.</P>
      <P>These developments will provide a choice in the method by which people can receive their social welfare entitlements. My Department are working closely with An Post on these developments and are, in principle, prepared to co-invest over the next ten years with An Post in the automation of An Post's counter services.</P>
      <P>This will enable a wide range of services to be made available, using modern technology, to customers of An Post generally and to social welfare clients in particular. Detailed discussions with the parties involved are at an advanced stage.</P>

Payments of fines-on-the-spot notices issued by traffic wardens and members of the Garda Síochána in the Dublin Metropolitan Area for the same period yielded approximately £12,599,000.  In addition to this sum other revenues were also received by the Exchequer in the years in question in respect of court fines imposed for non-payment of fine-on-the-spot notices.

      <P>The operational programme on peripherality sets out, <i>inter alia,</i> the Government's objectives for the development of the various elements of the public road network together with the strategies adopted and the measures to be implemented under the programme in order to achieve those objectives.  A copy of the operational programme, which was published last December, is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Congestion levels on a public road can be gauged from traffic flow data and the physical features of the particular road. Details of traffic flows on every section of the network of national roads, including such roads in Dublin city, are collected annually by the environmental research unit of my Department.</P>

      <P>Statutory undertakers such as ESB, Telecom Éireann and Bord Gáis have statutory powers to open public roads for the purpose of laying and maintaining cables, pipelines etc. and do not require a licence from a local authority to do so.</P>
      <P>Section 101D of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 (as inserted by the Dublin Transport Authority (Dissolution) Act, 1987) enables prescribed local authorities to issue directions to statutory undertakers and others for the purposes of co-ordinating road openings and minimising traffic disruption.  In September 1988 I made regulations prescribing Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation as authorities who could exercise these directive powers.  Arrangements are also in place in Dublin to ensure the advance notification of planned works to enable them to be co-ordinated as far as possible.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming roads Bill will update and strengthen the powers of local authorities to temporarily close roads to facilitate works such as those referred to and other activities.</P>

      <P>During the period 1985 to 1990, road grants totalling £135.3 million have been paid by my Department to local authorities in the Dublin area for improvement works to the network of national primary routes, including £46.2 million in respect of the Dublin ring road. A further £2.3 million was paid in respect of the Dublin ring road prior to 1985.</P>
      <P>The major improvement projects on national primary roads in the Dublin area, including the Dublin ring road, which are scheduled to be commenced and/or completed in the period to 1993 are identified in the operational programme on peripherality, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. Annex 3 to the programme sets out details of these projects, including estimates of cost and the construction period for each project.  Road grant payments on these projects to the end of 1990, apart from the Western Parkway section of the Dublin ring road which has been completed, are as follows:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the South-Eastern Health Board that there were 750 adults on the waiting list for dental treatment in <Col N="1016" /> Carlow/Kilkenny while 592 children were awaiting secondary care orthodontic treatment at the end of December 1990.</P>
    <P>A special allocation of £3 million was made to the health boards in 1990 to bring about improvements in these services. This extra allocation enabled the health boards to provide over 23,000 additional dental treatments and over 2,500 additional orthodontic treatments. In the South-Eastern Health Board approximately 2,100 additional treatments were provided.  A further £3 million is being provided to the health boards for the same purpose in the current year and I am confident that the improvement in services will be sustained this year.</P>

    <P>I understand that the EC Commission, following a recent meeting with a number of European airlines, is at present formulating a number of new proposals which would enable airlines to take measures to counteract the effects of the Gulf crisis on traffic levels.  The Commission's proposals are not yet available but are expected to be submitted to Council in the coming days.</P>

      <P>Aeroflot use Shannon Airport as a transit stop for the majority of their air services between the USSR and North and South America.  This arrangement dates from 1979 when Aer Rianta constructed a fuel farm at the airport to enable Aeroflot to supply Soviet fuel to their own aircraft. Aeroflot transitted some 2,000 flights through Shannon in 1990 and Aer Rianta expect this number to increase in 1991.</P>
      <P>In 1983, Aer Rianta entered into a barter arrangement with Aeroflot under which Aer Rianta are paid in Soviet fuel instead of hard currency for landing fees, catering and other services provided for them at Shannon.  Aer Rianta subsequently extended the fuel farm and formed a subsidiary company, Shannon Aviation Fuels Limited, to sell Soviet fuel to other airlines at competitive rates, enhancing Shannon's attractiveness as a transit stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August 1988 Aer Rianta established a facility at Shannon for the painting and refurbishing of the Aeroflot aircraft fleet and set up a wholly owned subsidiary, <Col N="1029" /> Aer Rianta International (Aircraft Services) Ltd., for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Early in 1988 Aer Rianta and Aeroflot established a joint venture company, &ldquo;Aerofirst&rdquo;, to set up and operate the first duty free shop in the Soviet Union at Moscow's International Airport.  This shop was opened on 1 May 1988.  Aer Rianta have since opened up duty-free shops in Leningrad as a joint venture with Aeroflot and arrangements have been made to open up similar shops shortly in both Kiev and Tashkent.</P>
    <P>In addition, Aer Rianta are involved in the provision of inflight duty-free sales on all Aeroflot international flights out of Moscow.</P>

      <P>Since 1985, £22 million has been spent by my Department on air navigation equipment and communication systems at the three State airports.  Most of the expenditure, i.e., £17 million, has been incurred since 1988 following a review of the Air Navigation Services Office by consultants, Price Waterhouse.  Arising from the consultants' recommendations a five year re-equipment programme was embarked on in 1988.  The programme, which involves total budgeted expenditure of £30 million, is expected to be completed in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The re-equipment has involved the complete replacement of the main VHF <Col N="1030" /> communications systems, the replacement of navigational aids, the provision of instrument landing systems, and the installation of new radar systems at all three State airports.  While some of the equipment is specific to individual airports, it is not feasible to apportion the expenditure to individual airports.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the present equipment is fully adequate to meet existing traffic levels and the ongoing re-equipment programme will ensure that our system will be capable of meeting any new demands up to the mid nineties.</P>

      <P>Following negotiations with the United Kingdom and French Civil Aviation Authorities and with the approval of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAQ), the Shannon Air Traffic Control Centre are, since 10 January 1991, controlling air traffic in the Shannon Oceanic Transition area &mdash; commonly known as SOTA.  This is a block of approximately 30,000 square miles of air space south of Ireland, which was formerly controlled from Prestwick.  This additional air space gives Ireland direct access to continental air space.</P>

      <P>The information, in so far as it is available, is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards State airports, total investment to date in Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports is £129 million of which £63 million was provided by the Exchequer and £66 million was funded by Aer Rianta out of their own resources.  A breakdown by airport on this investment is not readily available.  The rate of return on <Col N="1037" /> investment at State Airports is 18 per cent.</P>
    <P>Depreciation at State airports is calculated to write off the cost of fixed assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis at the following annual rates: buildings 2%-5%; runways and lighting 3%-10% and plant and equipment 5%-33.3%</P>
    <P>Exchequer grants paid to regional and local airports are as follows: Connaught £9,858,000; Kerry £1,319,979; Galway £1,187,500; Carrickfin £375,000; Waterford £1,082,500; Sligo 374,250; and Abbeyshrule £80,839.</P>
    <P>I do not have information on the depreciation methods or rates of return on investment for regional and local airports, as these are owned and operated by private companies.</P>

      <P>Under Council Regulation (EC) No. 2343-90 of 24 July 1990 on market access and capacity sharing, fifth freedom rights are available for scheduled air services between member states, subject to certain conditions.  Council Regulation (EC) No. 294-91 of 4 February 1991 makes provision for the operation of cargo only services on a fifth freedom rights basis between member states.</P>

      <P>Aer Lingus have recently dropped their scheduled Dublin &mdash; Manchester &mdash; Hamburg service as part of their &ldquo;Blueprint for Recovery Programme&rdquo; and are not at the present time seeking the right to operate any additional fifth freedom services.</P>
      <P>During the seventies, fifth freedom rights previously held by Aer Lingus at Manchester were withdrawn by the British authorities.</P>
      <P>EC Regulations now enable Aer Lingus to operate fifth freedom services within the Community which were either withdrawn or denied in the past.</P>

      <P>On the grounds of commercial sensitivity I do not consider it prudent to disclose net profit levels of duty free activities at the three State airports.  Turnover from the duty free shops at those airports for the years 1985-90 was as follows: 1985, £28.0 million; 1986, £26.8 million; 1987, £29.8 million; 1988, £33.9 million; 1989, 39.2 million; and 1990, £40.5 million.</P>
      <P>The average numbers employed on duty free activities at the State airports between 1985 and 1989 were as follows: 1985, 549; 1986, 543; 1987, 530; 1988, 490; and 1989, 505.</P>
      <P>Average numbers employed for 1990 have yet to be finalised.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a parliamentary question on 13 February 1991 in which I gave details of Aer Lingus' fleet replacement programme. As the operations on the UK and continental routes are integrated, it would not be meaningful to attempt to provide separate figures for these two areas.</P>

      <P>The traffic rights refused to Aer Lingus by other EC member states since 1985 are as follows: (i) fifth freedom rights on Dublin-Manchester-Milan were refused by the Italian authorities in 1988.  The rights have now been granted by the Italian authorities on foot of the adoption of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2343/90 of 24 July 1990 on market access and capacity sharing on scheduled air services between member states; and (ii) fifth freedom rights for all-cargo services were refused by the British authorities during 1989 on the following routes: Dublin-Birmingham-Brussels, Dublin-Manchester-Brussels and Dublin-Manchester-Amsterdam.</P>
      <P>These rights are now available to Aer Lingus under the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 294/91 of 4 February 1991 on the operation of air cargo services between member states.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The main provisions of the bilateral agreements, which provide a legal basis for the operation of air services between Ireland and the respective countries, specify the routes on which air services may be operated between the two countries, the number of air carriers which may be designated by each side, as well as any rights that may be agreed for operations to third countries.  Such agreements also normally determine the manner in which <Col N="1044" /> capacity is to be shared between the airlines of both countries, fares are to be approved and disputes settled.</P>
    <P>The agreements are published in the Treaty Series and are available in the Oireachtas Library, with the exception of the September 1990, Amendment to the Ireland/US Agreement, 1945, which is being printed prior to being laid before both House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Current policy on the liberalisation of air services within the EC is being pursued in the context of creating a Single Market in air transport.  The aim of the policy is to gradually replace existing bilateral arrangements by a Community wide framework which will give consumers a wide choice of services at as low a cost as possible, consistent with maintaining satisfactory safety standards, and will allow air carriers to operate in a sound financial environment by a reduction in operating costs and an increase in productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal measures adopted so far to give effect to this policy have involved <Col N="1045" /> the opening up of greater opportunities for access to the market by air carriers, including fifth freedom rights; the gradual abolition of capacity sharing restrictions between member states; the phased introduction of a system of double disapproval of air fares; and the application of the competition rules of the EC Treaty to the air transport sector.</P>
    <P>The foregoing measures are contained in the following regulations: (i) Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2342/90 of 24 July 1990 on fares for scheduled air services; (ii) County Regulation (EEC) No. 2343/90 of 24 July 1990 on market access and capacity sharing on scheduled air services between member states; (iii) Council Regulation (EEC) No. 294/91 on the operation of air cargo services between member states; (iv) Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3975/87 of 14 December, 1987 laying down the procedure for the application of the rules on competition to air transport; and (v) Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3976/87 of 14 December 1987, as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2344/90, on the exemption of certain categories of inter-airline agreements, decisions and concerted practices from the application of the competition rules of the Treaty.  I am arranging for copies of the regulations to be sent to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>In the context of completing the Single Market in air transport, the Council is to decide on the revision of regulations (i) and (ii) above by 30 June 1992, at the latest, on the basis of a Commission proposal to be submitted by 31 May 1991. The regulation at (v) above is to be revised by 31 December 1992, at the latest, on the basis of a Commission proposal to be submitted by 1 July 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The pace of liberalisation in the international road haulage sector has accelerated in the past few years, brought about by an EC policy aimed at complete freedom in the movement of goods within the Community by 1993.</P>
      <P>Council Regulation EEC No. 1841/88 amending Regulation EEC No. 3164/76 on the Community Quota for the Carriage of Goods by Road between member states provided that by 1993 all bilateral and multilateral road haulage quotas within the Community would be abolished. With this aim in view, the EC Council of Transport Ministers agreed in December 1990 to a 40 per cent increase in the quota for multilateral authorisations for intraCommunity road haulage in each of the years 1991 and 1992.</P>
      <P>The Council of Transport Ministers also approved the introduction of a limited system of road haulage cabotage, the opening up of the domestic road haulage markets to transport by hauliers of other member states.</P>
      <P>Further liberalisation of the international road haulage market is dependent on other proposals at present being discussed at EC level which are outside my remit.  These relate mainly to the charging of infrastructure costs for certain road vehicles and the harmonisation of excise duty on diesel oil, in the context of the abolition of fiscal frontiers.</P>

      <P>There are no statistics available as to the cost and speed of Irish internal haulage relative to other EC member states.  It has been generally acknowledged, however, that the Irish haulier suffers from cost disadvantages relative to foreign hauliers.</P>
      <P>These cost disadvantages arise from a number of factors, including port charges, fuel costs, excise duties, wages and overhead costs, control over which do not lie within my remit as Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications.</P>
      <P>Another factor which has cost implications in the context of haulage speeds or travel times is the deficiencies in our road infrastructure, which my colleague the Minister for the Environment will be addressing in the operational programme on peripherality which is currently being implemented.</P>

The information involved is, in many cases, of a commercially sensitive nature.
