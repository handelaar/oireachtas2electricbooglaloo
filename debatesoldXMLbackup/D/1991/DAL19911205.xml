      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach back from the Summit and express the hope that he did not find it a bore meeting a Prime Minister whose agenda is obviously so short and whose timescale is so limited.  Will he tell the House when the Christmas recess will begin and when we will resume?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that it is not customary, but in view of the outcome of the meeting I was wondering if the Taoiseach was prepared to break with custom.  He has not been so constrained in the past. I take it the Taoiseach does not propose to make a specific report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

The revised management buy-out proposal was received by the Government only yesterday, at 3.30 p.m.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government made a decision last night on the sale and that basically the unions have been wasting their time in putting together a deal?</P>

    <Col N="295" />
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned on Tuesday I was dealing with the issue of road maintenance.  I drew the attention of the House to the fact that the Bill before us which proposes the establishment of a National Roads Authority will not address the issue of road maintenance and the problems with which many road users have to deal &mdash; for example, potholes and unsatisfactory roads.  Essentially the Bill proposes to establish a two tier road system.  One would be a very well financed &mdash; largely from European funds &mdash; system of national roads under the control of the National Roads Authority and underneath that there would be a very poorly resourced network of non-national roads which would be maintained by inadequately financed local authorities.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that we should be addressing this issue at a time when local authorities are grappling with their estimates and trying to deal with a situation where the rates support grant provided by the Department of the Environment is not sufficient to enable them to carry our their functions effectively and maintain the road network in a proper state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that there appears to be no end of money available for the building of national roads and in some cases for the construction of roads, the desirability of which has been questioned.  For example, in my constituency the Department of the Environment had no hesitation in providing £3 million to enable Dún Laoghaire Corporation to purchase a road reservation for the proposed St. Helen's Road between Fosters Avenue and Booterstown.  This was a very controversial road proposal, the deletion of which from the Dún Laoghaire development plan is now being proposed.  There was no difficulty in getting money for that purpose, yet at the same time proposals from the same authority in relation to the improvement of urban roads in the area has not met with any favour from the Department of the Environment.  For example, the Department of the Environment have had proposals for some time <Col N="296" /> from Dún Laoghaire Corporation in regard to the widening and improvement of Barnhill Road and the improvement of Whitefield Road, a road which is falling apart and which originally was a rural road in the village of Ballybrack at the time Michael Davitt lived there.  This road is still in much the same condition as Michael Davitt would have experienced it, despite the fact that that part of Dublin has been greatly developed, there are many houses and housing estates around it and people use the road in a much more concentrated way.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to explain to people why money is available in large measure from the Department of the Environment for road proposals about which there is doubt &mdash; if not strong opposition &mdash; and yet there is a blank refusal for much more modest proposals for the upgrading and maintenance of existing roads which are used very extensively by local people to get to and from their places of work and to shops and so on.</P>
    <P>One of the disappointing features of this Bill relates to road safety.  The Bill makes, at best, only a passing reference to the need to tackle problems associated with road safety.  Every year in this country about 500 people are killed and almost 10,000 people are injured on our roads.  That is five times the rate of casualties in Northern Ireland, it is the equivalent of a Stardust disaster every year and yet there is little on nothing in this Roads Bill to address the question of road safety.  Indeed, the Government's record on the question of road safety, apart from the occasional announcement from the Minister for the Environment of an assault &mdash; which is welcome &mdash; on drunk driving, especially during the festive season, is a mere public relations exercise.  The fact is that since 1988 the National Road Safety Association have been abolished.  Only the three Dublin local authorities have full-time road safety officers.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated &mdash; the Minister's predecessor confirmed this in a Dáil question some time ago &mdash; that the cost to the State of road accidents is £600 million per <Col N="297" /> year.  That is an extraordinary figure, an extraordinary loss both in terms of human suffering and death and in terms of economic loss because of the carnage which is taking place on our roads.  One would have expected that in the Bill, which apart from providing for the setting up of a National Roads Authority, is aimed at updating legislation in relation to our roads, the question of road safety would have featured more prominently given the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>Essentially, this Bill gives legislative effect to the Government's strategy on roads and transport, that is to place primary emphasis on the encouragement of private transport and facilitating private transport and to give encouragement to the construction of more and more roads. To some extent it is also an attempt to placate a certain section of the construction industry which now sees the construction of roads as the only potential outlet for major contracts and major works.  I am not opposed to road building. Clearly there are many cases where road construction is necessary.  For example, there are many proposals for the by-passing of towns which need to be carried out as quickly as possible.  I support the completion of the Dublin ring route and &mdash; I want to emphasise this &mdash; I support the bringing forward of the proposal for the south-eastern motorway which would link the southern cross route with the Bray-Shankill by-pass and thus complete the ring around Dublin.</P>
    <P>It would make sense to drive the commercial traffic from Rosslare through to Belfast on a ring road on a motorway around the city and also to take traffic out of the city areas.  For example, people who want to get on to any of the ready routes out of Dublin, Cork, Waterford, or wherever, should be enabled to do so. I support the proposal.  I realise that the proposal for the south-eastern motorway has been brought forward to the 1993-97 plan, but I would encourage the Minister to have the plan brought forward because when the southern cross route is completed it will pose a major traffic problem <Col N="298" /> in the Leopardstown area.  The four strategic routes have been listed in the roads plan and in the operational programme on peripherality: Rosslare to the Border; Portlaoise to Dublin; Dublin to Kinnegad and the Cork-Waterford-Rosslare road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the Dublin to Kinnegad road which would have gone one part of the way to Castlebar at one stage. No doubt there will be an orientation northwards, given the present Minister for the Environment.  There is always a tendency for roads to follow the direction of the Minister for the Environment of the day.  I sometimes wonder whether the people who draw up the roads plans are not frustrated when they find that the road plans follow the occupancy of Ministers for the Environment.  There is no doubt that some of the national roads need a good deal of improvement works.</P>
      <P>A certain amount of funds have been made available for this country to tackle the question of peripherality.  There is an assumption underlying this Bill and the establishment of a National Roads Authority that the problems of this country's peripherality can be addressed mainly by improving the road network within the country.  That is not a sound assumption.  I do not think it is wise that 75 per cent of the funds which have been made available to Ireland from the EC for peripherality should be invested in the development of roads within the country at the expense of developing sealinks, air links and links with Britain and mainland Europe.  There is an overemphasis on spending on roads which needs to be questioned.  The Bill before us and the National Roads Authority will help to consolidate that.  What is being put in place is a body which will strengthen the case for additional investment on roads within the country and will strengthen the case for roads to get as large as possible a slice of the EC Structural Funds, perhaps at the expense of other areas of transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> It is remarkable that in the whole operational programme on peripherality where over £400 million is being spent on roads &mdash; total investment on the whole programme is £800 million, £515 million of which comes from the European Community &mdash; that not a penny is being spent on the development of sea passenger facilities at a time when another EC programme deals with the need to improve tourism into the country. The other question that arises in relation to the assumption that continued road building is a good idea is that it does not necessarily deal with our current traffic problems.  Indeed, there is a considerable body of opinion that the more you build roads the more you will find cars to fill them.  That is not by any means an exaggerated claim.  At a conference in May 1991, organised by An Taisce, a number of experts in this area commented on this matter.  For example Professor Tony Ridley of the Transport Engineering Department of the Imperial College, London stated:</P>
    <P>We may not agree with the work plan of the European Commission's drive programme ... which stated that it is no longer economic to continue to increase the capacity of road systems by building more roads.  But it is undeniable that to increase capacity at a rate which will match forecast increases is no longer a policy option.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>Regardless of how much new infrastructure can be put in place it is clear that civil engineering is not going to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; the problems of transport.</P>
    <P>Closer to home, Dr. P.J. Drudy a transport economist made the case that the more new roads are constructed, the more we will find people who will use them, and that that is perhaps not the best solution from an economic point of view.  He stated:</P>
    <P>Even if road construction were to reduce congestion in the short run, the <Col N="300" /> increased traffic generated must lead to an increase in pollution levels, noise, visual intrusion and traffic hazard.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>The fundamental point being made here is that the provision of more road space on its own is unlikely to resolve the traffic congestion problem.  This simple fact is now widely recognised and urban authorities around the world are taking other measures, including an emphasis in public transport provision, to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable body of argument to support the view that it is unwise for this State to commit such a large proportion of EC funds to road building at the expense of other areas of transport. There is also a strong view that we need an integrated approach to transport which would combine roads, public transport, rail and other elements and that what we need to give effect to that is not a roads authority which will fight the corner of the roads lobby, but a national transport authority which will see the problem in its overall context.</P>
    <P>At present two layers of Government are responsible for road policy, road development and maintenance &mdash; the local authorities and the Department of the Environment.  Even when this Bill is passed local authorities will be at least responsible for non-national roads and they may well be involved in a contractual way in some of the work relating to national roads.  We will still have the Department of the Environment involved because the Bill gives various roles and responsibilities to the Minister for the Environment.  In between, will be slotted a national roads authority.  One scenario is that the national roads authority will be given many of the powers currently held by the Minister for the Environment and powers currently held by the local authorities, in which case very significant powers will have been placed in the hands of an unelected body. That is probably the most likely scenario. The alternative scenario is that the National Roads Authority will not be <Col N="301" /> given those powers and three layers will continue to relate to each other &mdash; the Department, the National Roads Authority and the local authorities.  In that case the National Roads Authority will just become another layer of bureaucracy between the local authorities and the Department of the Environment.  The confusion that that is likely to give rise to is evident if one looks at some of the sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 13 (1) states that subject to Part III the administration of the maintenance and construction of all national and regional roads shall be the function of the council or county borough corporation of that county, but section 17 (1) (a) states that overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of national roads will be the responsibility of the National Roads Authority.  Who exactly will be responsible?  Section 17 (2) adds additional powers to the National Roads Authority.  It states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, by regulations, assign to the Authority such additional functions in relation to the construction or maintenance of national roads as from time to time he considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>In that the Minister is coming into the picture.  Many of the functions proposed to be given to the National Roads Authority are functions which are being performed by the Department or the local authority.  Section 18 talks about the preparation of road plans by the National Roads Authority.  Already, the Department of the Environment produce road plans and a while ago, in a lighter moment, we saw how road plans can sometimes be sidetracked if a Minister wants to advance one part of it as against another.</P>
    <P>Virtually all the specific functions being given to the National Roads Authority are being performed by either the local authority or the Department.  Preparing designs, construction or improvement works, programmes of maintenance works, schemes for the provision of traffic signs and the maintenance <Col N="302" /> of traffic signs and so on are already being performed, in relation to the overall national roads plan, by the Department of the Environment or by the local authorities. Why are the National Roads Authority being given functions which are being performed by the Department and the local authorities?  Section 19 deals with the specific functions of the Authority and this is one of the most alarming sections of the Bill.  Section 19 (5) states:</P>
    <P>Development consisting of the carrying out of any works by or at the direction of, or on behalf of, the Authority under this Act in relation to the construction or maintenance of a national road shall be exempted from development for the purposes of the Act of 1963.</P>
    <P>In other words the National Roads Authority or any agency acting on behalf of the National Roads Authority will not have to apply for planning permission for the building of a road and to carry out any works in relation to a road.  If we read that section in conjunction with sections 20 and 22 which deal with the directions the National Roads Authority may give to a local authority, we get a clear picture of what is intended.  Section 20 (2) states:</P>
    <P>Before issuing a direction under subsection (1) in relation to any works which would, in the opinion of the Authority, if carried out require a road authority to contravene materially a development plan or a special amenity area order, the Authority shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>It goes on to give a procedure whereby the Authority will publish a notice and allow people make representations to them about the contravention of a development plan or of a special amenity area order.  Section 22 makes another reference to development plans and states that the Authority may at any time make recommendations in writing to a planning authority as to the content of that authority's development plan and any such recommendations shall be considered by the planning authority.</P>
    <P>What all of that means is that where a <Col N="303" /> local authority are considering a road development and include that proposed road development in a development plan, the National Roads Authority will have the overall responsibility for the construction, design, etc. of that road. Under section 19 the National Roads Authority will not have to apply for planning permission, so the question of the local authority's development plan will not arise in that context.  If the proposal from the National Roads Authority would contravene the local authority's development plan, the local authority will not have to go through the normal procedure for the contravention of the development plan which would require the publication of a notice, the receiving of submissions and, critically important, a decision by the elected members of the local authority to contravene the development plan.  That will not happen in this case because a different procedure is provided for here, that is, that the National Roads Authority will publish the notice itself, give a month for people to come in with their submissions and then the National Roads Authority, not the elected members who made the plan, will make the decision as to whether or not the work should go ahead.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the belt and braces section there is section 22.  Under this if the National Roads Authority feel, for example, that a provision in a development plan might be a little embarrassing or a little bit awkward, they can make a recommendation to the local authority. There is nothing wrong with the National Roads Authority making a recommendation to a local authority.  That is perfectly in order.  What I find alarming is the provision that &ldquo;the local authority shall consider that recommendation&rdquo;, which would appear to put a certain amount of very gentle pressure on the local authority to comply with it.</P>
    <P>What all of that means in practice is that, for example, the decision that was made last week by Dublin City Council to remove from its development plan the proposal for the eastern bypass could be <Col N="304" /> overruled by the National Roads Authority. Once this Bill is passed the National Roads Authority can carry out the work without having to apply to Dublin Corporation for planning permission. Secondly, it can bypass &mdash; you will pardon the pun &mdash; the provisions of the Dublin Corporation development plan.  Dublin Corporation will not have any function in the matter at all under this.  What will happen is that the roads authority can, in the case of the eastern bypass contravening the new development plan of Dublin City Council, publish a notice saying they are going to build the eastern bypass and give the public a month to make their submissions.  After that the National Roads Authority can make their decision.</P>
    <P>The same procedure would apply in relation to Dún Laoghaire Corporation if it decided to remove the St. Helen's motorway.  The same position applies in relation to Dublin County Council if it decides on a particular line for the south-eastern motorway &mdash; and there is a lot of controversy in that part of County Dublin in relation to the south-eastern motorway and some concern on the part of a number of residents associations about where it might go and so on.  All of that will be considered by Dublin County Council when they come to making their development plan.  Despite all of that, if the National Roads Authority want to go a particular way, then under this Bill the National Roads Authority can do that. The elected representatives of the people are being taken out of the picture as far as road design and road provision are concerned.  Very few issues have aroused the kind of public passions and have mobilised people on committees and in groups in recent times as have proposed road plans.  Up to now the public could exercise its voice by influencing the people that it elected and who were accountable to the public on local councils. That will not be possible under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Bill deals with the publication of programmes for EC assistance. Again there are two points to be made in relation to this.  The first is that <Col N="305" /> at the moment the Department of the Environment prepare the plans for EC assistance for road works, but there has been criticism of the way in which this country has applied for EC assistance. That criticism has come from two quarters. It has come first from the European Commission and, second, from community organisations here which have criticised the lack of democratic involvement in the decision making process which resulted in the programmes for EC assistance.  Another criticism is the lack of any regional approach to it. On the eve of Maastricht, the principle of subsidiarity is one of the buzz terms being kicked around.  There is no sign of subsidiarity.  The principle of subsidiarity is dead in this country and will be buried by the time this Bill is passed.  What is happening here is that, instead of allowing regions to evolve their plans and programmes for EC assistance, the National Roads Authority, which will not be an elected body at all, will be responsible for deciding the programme that will go for EC assistance.  Whatever criticisms we may have had about it up to now &mdash; and it has been raised in this House on a number of occasions &mdash; if this Bill is passed what we are doing is building into legislation a provision whereby applications for EC funding for roads will be evolved and developed by the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>There are various other sections of this Bill under which it appears that the National Roads Authority will have considerable power.  For example, under section 23 it appears they will have powers to make recommendations or certainly influence the Garda in particular ways in relation to traffic matters.  They will have extraordinary powers to borrow up to £500 million.  There is no other organisation in this State, no commercial semi-State company or no local or public authority which will have the power to borrow that amount of money; and, remarkably, that borrowing will be State guaranteed under section 26.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with the problem of tolling.  The intention of the Department of the Environment with <Col N="306" /> regard to tolling is already well known. In 1989 the Department of the Environment, without any authorisation or any approval from the elected members of Dublin County Council, advertised for tenders for the tolling of the Dublin ring road.  Not alone that, the Department of the Environment entered into an arrangement with a French-American company to offer them the franchise for the tolling of the Dublin ring road.  The Department of the Environment issued instructions to Dublin County Council to proceed on foot of that to erect toll plinths on the ring road.  All of that was done without Dublin County Council making a decision, as is their entitlement to do and as is in their power to do under existing legislation.  In fact, when Dublin County Council realised what was happening they announced that it was not their intention to toll the Dublin ring road and issued instructions that the toll booths which were being erected should be removed.</P>
    <P>The problem now is that the Minister wants to toll the Dublin ring road.  Dublin County Council, which under existing legislation have the power to make the tolling schemes, have clearly declared their intention not to toll the Dublin ring road.  The Minister needs to get around this problem.  He has found that the way to get around this problem is to take the power to introduce a tolling scheme away from the local authority and give it to the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>What section 5 means, in practical terms, is that the Minister is going to toll the Dublin ring road.  If one wants to use this road when it is completed, from Bray to the Belfast road, at the airport, one will have to pay a toll, not just to go over the bridge &mdash; there have been few objections from the public and this is generally accepted &mdash; but to use any section of it.  This will be the only major city, certainly the only capital city, where a relief motorway around the capital city will be tolled.  One certainly pays tolls on some of the major auto routes on the Continent but when one gets close to a major city there are no tolls and the <Col N="307" /> reason is that the purpose of the motorway is to keep traffic out of the city areas. The purpose of the motorway being built here with substantial public funds is to keep traffic out of the city but what happens?  The Minister for the Environment wants to toll the road which will have the effect of driving traffic back into the city.</P>
    <P>There is no point arguing that it will not have this effect because the people of Ringsend would tell us &mdash; I am sure Deputy Doyle would confirm this &mdash; that in the case of the East Link bridge commercial trucks come up the quays, go over Matt Talbot bridge, go back up the south quays and up through Ringsend in order to avoid paying the price of two pints to cross over the East Link bridge. The fact is some traffic deliberately avoids paying tolls by using various rat runs.  If the Dublin ring road is tolled it will have the effect of driving traffic back into residential areas and the villages of south-west and north Dublin, even though the intention is to remove traffic from those areas.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Part V of the Bill which deals with tolls is to get around the problem where a local authority clearly have no intention of tolling a ring road.  It has been decided that the way to get around this problem is to remove the power from the local authority and give it to the National Roads Authority.  The matter may not end there, however.  I remember there was controversy some years ago when the Department of the Environment wanted to toll the Naas by-pass. As I read Part V, the National Roads Authority will not be confined to tolling new roads; it will be open to them to introduce tolls on existing roads.  It is possible, therefore, that the Naas by-pass, the Newbridge by-pass, when built, or any other similar road could be tolled by the National Roads Authority and the elected local representatives of the people in those areas will have no say in the matter because the power is being taken away from them.</P>
    <P>Who will be the members of the National Roads Authority?  Under section <Col N="308" /> 28 (1) the members of the National Road Authority will be hand-picked by the Minister for the Environment.  It will consist of up to 14 members whose term of office, under section 28 (2), will be determined by the Minister for the Environment. If he likes them he may leave them there for a long time but if they make a decision which displeases him he will be able to remove them.  Under section 28 (1) (b) the chairman of the National Roads Authority can also be the chief executive of the Authority when he would certainly have extraordinary power.  The chairman of the National Roads Authority if he was to be appointed chief executive also of a body who will have the power to borrow up to £500 million and all the powers contained in the Bill could end up being a far more powerful figure than the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>There is no indication in the Bill who will be the members of the National Roads Authority, or from what interest groups they will be drawn.  This is in contrast with the Bill introduced by the same Department which established the Environmental Protection Agency and which sets down that the members of that agency will be drawn from various organisations.  For example, it establishes a panel the members of which will have the responsibility to recommend nominees to be appointed to that agency.  One would have expected that there would have been some indication of the way in which members would be appointed to a body with this kind of power and what interest groups they would represent. Will all 14, for example, be representatives of the construction industry? How many will represent local authorities and will local authority members also be members of that body?  The Minister will have discretion to decide who the members of the National Roads Authority should be.</P>
    <P>There might be some tolerance in allowing a Minister that degree of discretion when establishing a body who would not have the power this body will <Col N="309" /> have but this will be an extremely powerful body.  Despite that, there is no mention of accountability or of the way in which the members will be selected.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset, The Workers' Party have tabled an amendment to the Bill to the effect that the House should decline to give it a Second Reading for the reasons I have stated. What we need is a transport authority. The problems associated with road maintenance and construction need to be addressed.  However, I do not think that this is the way to go about it.  It has been proposed that we establish a body who will have extraordinary powers and who will very often, over-ride the democratic wishes of local people and local authorities but I think the House should reject that proposal and that the Government should come back with a Bill to establish a National Transport Authority who could tackle in a comprehensive way the problems associated with transport both internally and those clearly being encountered in relation to our peripherality within the European Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and to wish him well.  He has been appointed to the Department at a difficult time.  However, given his record in his previous Ministry, we are all aware that he has the capacity and the resilience to do a good job and to deliver the best possible service having regard to the limited financial resources available. This will be the acid test of both the Government and individual Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which will give effect to a new national roads policy and establish a National Roads Authority who will have responsibility for the development and administration of our national and secondary road network.  Few would disagree that there is an urgent need to make considerable improvements to the road network, to apply consistent standards and to adopt a planned approach to road improvements.  One has to drive only a few hundred miles on any of our national roads to observe the large <Col N="310" /> variations in standards between one county and another and the abuse of finance in relation to the implementation of road programmes in each of the individual local authority areas.  I know that the non-availability of sufficient funding is very often an inhibiting factor in planning an efficient road development programme and that insufficient funding in the past has been responsible for some of the justifiable criticism in relation to what is observed by the public as inefficient road construction and inefficient road improvement programmes.</P>
    <P>With few exceptions, the vast majority of our national and secondary routes are inadequate in terms of capacity and construction from the point of view of accommodating the increasing volume of traffic which is now using these roads daily. I know, from my discussions with Irish international truck drivers, that the standards of our roads are far behind those on mainland Europe.  International drivers coming in the opposite direction often experience a culture shock when they drive on our national roads network. There is, undoubtedly, a need for considerable improvements, particularly in the context of our membership of the full European Community of 1993.</P>
    <P>As a nation we have successfully tackled other infrastructural deficiencies, some very successfully, such as telecommunications. Those developments have been favourably commented on by industrialists from abroad and by people who have invested in our country and appreciate the advances made in that area.  To some extent, perhaps, we benefited in this area because of the lateness of our entry to an overall improvement programme.  As a result of that delay we were in a position to put into operation the most advanced technological developments available in relation to telecommunications.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can say the same about our roads because we have allowed our considerable national investment in the construction of roads over the years to deteriorate.  The roads network is an obvious area of infrastructure which is seriously deficient.  We all know that the <Col N="311" /> greatest challenge facing the Government &mdash; and indeed our people &mdash; is the challenge of unemployment, which is serious and frightening.  The economic and social consequences are horrific and will be difficult to contain.  While the Government cannot by direct intervention create new jobs they must create the economic environment in which jobs are created.  They must eliminate all the problems which up to now have prevented that level of economic activity. We have proved that, with the right motivation, such challenges can be overcome. We have now put in place &mdash; not without sacrifices on the part of many workers &mdash; the economic infrastructure such as inflation control and low interest rates, which are essential ingredients in the foundation on which future developments can take place.  It is vital to retain and consolidate that achievement and to add to it by consolidating our position in areas such as the physical infrastructure to which this Bill is directed and which deals with the provision of an adequate roads network.</P>
    <P>While there are obvious environmental advantages in being an island nation on the periphery of Europe there is also a corresponding disadvantage in terms of transport costs to reach the markets of Europe because of our isolation.  In the competitive world in which we operate cost control is a key factor in industrial development; without new and substantial development we will not be in a position to tackle unemployment.  For Irish industry transport is a primary factor and consideration.  It is estimated &mdash; it was mentioned here yesterday by another Member &mdash; that for Irish industry transport costs are, on average, 10 per cent of total export sales which is twice what our competitors on mainland Europe pay.  When one adds this inhibiting factor to the increased tendency towards greater efficiencies in other areas of European production, one can readily see the seriousness of the challenges facing us in the important area of transportation.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Europe of 1993 will <Col N="312" /> lead to a consolidation and protection of the market for European producers.  If the Common Market and the Treaty of Rome mean anything surely this point is particularly important.  It is particularly important in relation to agricultural production, a section of Irish industry on which many workers depend.  Europe's potential for increased internal trade cannot be fully exploited while the peripheral regions remain isolated through bad infrastructure from the central market place.  For this reason alone it is vital that there are no delays in improving our road infrastructure.  Even when our roads are brought up to European standards we will still have the added costs of fuel, labour and other related costs which will also have to be compensated for if we are to retain our competitiveness in the European market.  The speed with which these improvements can be undertaken and completed is a factor which is related to the availability of funds.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Minister's speech that the cost of the proposed improvements to the national, primary and secondary routes is very high.  In relation to the national primary route the cost is in the region of £3 billion and another £600 million is necessary to bring the national secondary roads up to European standards.  This is a considerable investment which, of course, could never have been made available from national resources.  Again I make the point that if the concept of Community means anything &mdash; and if there is a genuine concern to help the less developed regions like Ireland &mdash; this funding must be made available quickly from Community funds.  I am pleased to note that there is a genuine and positive commitment on the part of the Community to make funding available, at least for the development of the main infrastructural routes to this country.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging the benefits derived from common membership, the result in terms of closing the gap in living standards between member states has not been as successful as I would have hoped. The objective of improving the infrastructure, particularly in relation to <Col N="313" /> roads, for less developed regions is to enhance the potential of such regions to create more jobs and to achieve higher living standards.  This is what economic and social cohesion is about.  Even by 1992 it is estimated that we will not have reached 72 per cent of the living standards of our partners in Europe.  With unemployment at 20 per cent we have the highest level of unemployment in the European Community.  We still have a considerable distance to travel.</P>
    <P>As the Maastricht Summit addresses the problems of the regions of Europe it is of equal importance that we as a nation address the question of regionality in our own country.  While acknowledging this Government's commitment to decentralisation and its success to date we must in no circumstances relent on our total commitment to and full implementation of that programme.  Of course good infrastructure, particularly a good road network, is a necessary requirement for success in this area.  I acknowledge the Minister's allocation of funds for a new motorway through County Laois on which work has commenced.  When this work is completed the capital city will be within one hour's drive of Portlaoise.  In conjunction with this is the Government's decision to decentralise and relocate part of a Government Department in Portlaoise.  This is a very good example of a positive commitment to regionalisation in terms of spreading the national resources and putting in place adequate infrastructure.  I do not want to sound too parochial but I have to make the point that Portlaoise is one of the most obvious areas for a further expansion of the Government's decentralisation programme. The new motorway on which work has commenced is a positive move in this area.</P>
    <P>Apart from the point of view of industrial development, Portlaoise and the surrounding towns of Mountmellick, Abbeyleix and Mountrath offer unlimited potential for industrial development; and again the provision of adequate infrastructure, particularly in relation to roads, is an important requirement to bring about that development.  We <Col N="314" /> cannot isolate industrial development from economic and social development. We must at all times take positive steps to ensure a balanced distribution of EC funding in other developmental areas, but this does not always happen.  I will cite the most recent allocation of funds under the Leader Programme by way of a passing reference.  I am disappointed that responsibility for co-ordinating this programme was taken by consultants and that their proposals were submitted to Brussels as being the Irish position.  Under the legislation we are discussing today there is reference to consultants. Very often we go overboard in terms of the appointment of consultants. I would not like to see a position develop whereby consultants would usurp the authority of democratically elected structures, be they national Government, local authorities or whatever.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that in any debate on road infrastructure reference is made to roads other than national primary roads, which represent only 16 per cent of the total road network.  The balance, approximately 84 per cent, represents county roads, roads for which each local authority have responsibility and for which sufficient funds are not being made available by national Government.  These are the roads which serve the rural communities and the agriculture industry. They are used on a daily basis by our children going to school and by the increasing volume of commercial vehicles which service the agriculture industry. They are roads in which each local authority over the years invested considerable funding in road construction and maintenance. I am sorry to have to say that the condition of these roads has been allowed to deteriorate seriously.  This is something we will have to address as a matter of great urgency.</P>
    <P>National Government will not be able to provide the level of funding necessary to restore the county road network to a proper standard.  Therefore some case will have to be made for structural funding from the EC to allow these improvements to be made.  As a member of Laois County Council, I can say that we have <Col N="315" /> not been able in our Estimates to provide the level of funding needed to undertake even a reasonable maintenance programme. We do not have the commercial base in our county which would enable us to raise sufficient funding from commercial rates or indeed through service charges.  Therefore we cannot bring the road network up to the standard to which our people are entitled.  That is a very frustrating and disappointing experience for any member of a local authority.</P>
    <P>As regards service charges, it is not good enough that the large urban area of Dublin city and county is exempt from service charges while at the same time each local authority in the country are expected to increase on an ongoing basis their level of charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of rate support grant available from the Department to Dublin City and County Council is proportionately greater than the allocation to any rural local authority.  Obviously the funding available to Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council is such that they do not have to apply service charges.  The time has come when rural local authorities will have to take a stand in relation to this inequality as between our capital city and rural areas. I would ask the Minister to address this problem as best he can.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and support the proposals contained in it.  It will lead to a more co-ordinated approach to the overall construction of the national road network.  The Minister is facing a serious task in terms of providing funding to enable local authorities to tackle an even more serious problem in each local authority area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to extend my good wishes to the new Minister for the Environment. I have absolutely no doubt that he will have a very successful tenure in this office.  My colleague, Deputy Yates, dealt in his usual thorough and stylish <Col N="316" /> manner with the overall approach of our party so far as the National Roads Authority Bill is concerned.  I propose to confine my remarks to specific elements of the Bill.  I will be brief, as I know many of my colleagues wish to contribute also. The Roads Bill, 1991, provides for the setting up of a National Roads Authority, but there is much more involved than the future of our national roads network. Inextricably tied in with the quality of our roads is the whole issue of regional development, which is of particular interest to me.</P>
      <P>We have been talking about regional development for a very long time.  The very first study carried out by An Foras Forbartha in 1968, 23 years ago, was the Buchanan report on regional development which was funded from a special United Nations fund.  One of the major issues addressed in the report was the imbalance created by the growth centres in the east.  To counteract this imbalance Buchanan suggested a number of areas would be designated as growth centres. Sligo was designated as the growth centre in the north-east.  Unfortunately, the Buchanan report suffered the fate of many other reports produced by wise men &mdash; nothing much happened.  The powerful lobbying by the east continued and won out, and the west and north-west were left to their own resources.  We now have a further imbalance because, as the Minister knows from his own area, we see the virtual depopulation of town-lands and indeed of entire parishes as a result of emigration and the structure of the remaining population.  If the reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy go through in their present form, I believe we are now seeing the last generation of small farmers.  To a great extent forestry will replace people in large tracts of the west.  As I heard someone remark recently, one will have to look straight up into the air to see if it is day or night because of the circles of forest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we need to do to attack these imbalances is to ensure that there is ease of access.  The disadvantage of the north-west's peripheral position in Ireland and in the new Europe must be minimised <Col N="317" /> and it is absolutely essential, therefore, to have a good road and rail network. Sadly, we in the north-west have neither and there needs to be speedy action on both fronts.  Structural Funds have arrived, thankfully, to provide the money for at least a half decent roadway, or so we are told.  I hope the National Roads Authority will ensure this happens, that work will be carried out in accordance with the timetable already laid down and that there will be no substantial time slippages. However, we cannot be too confident. We were told that in 1991 a start would be made on the Lucan-Kilcock and the Mullingar bypasses: mind you a start has been made, but just now at the back end of the year.  The bulldozers will be in place for Christmas, but the work did not start on schedule, there was some slippage.</P>
    <P>There are three starts scheduled on the N4 to Sligo in 1992.  Works will be carried out on 5.4 Kilometres of road in the Longford bypass at a cost of about £6.5 million, or 7.2 kilometres of the Drumsna-Jamestown bypass at a cost of over £6 million and on the Collooney-Ballisodare bypass, a dual carriageway for 8.6 kilometres from Collooney to Carraroe at a cost of £22 million.  We would like to get an assurance that there will be no time slippage and that the start up will not be left to the back end of next year, just technically meeting the time schedule. I fear that at least one section of road will not start on schedule.  Because of some hold up in the Department of the Environment, Sligo County Council have still not been given permission to go ahead with land acquisitions and compulsory purchase orders on the route of the new road, where the work is scheduled to start this year.  I question whether it is a deliberate delay in order to postpone the start up of the works and thus save some money in that way.  I hope this is not the case, but as far as I understand the necessary clearance has not yet been given to Sligo County Council to start on the land acquisitions.</P>
    <P>I question also why work on the Collooney-Ballisodare bypass is programmed to last until 1995, taking four <Col N="318" /> years to complete 8.2 kilometres of road works.  I suspect this has nothing to do with the technical or other abilities of a contractor to do the work in that time but has more to do with money.  I believe the Exchequer moneys needed to supplement the Structural Funds will be meted out in that way and I would like to have this matter examined.</P>
    <P>When the new roadworks have been completed, together with a new road through the Curlew Mountains, it will take approximately three-quarters of an hour, if not more, off the time taken to travel between Sligo and Dublin.  That will be an extraordinarily important factor as far as we in the north-west are concerned.  I am very pleased to see that this will happen and I hope that the new National Roads Authority will ensure that the work will be completed to schedule.  Because of our peripheral position we cannot afford to be less competitive. We need good access facilities. A road network alone is not sufficient; we also need a good rail service.  Fine Gael believe that the National Roads Authority should be expanded to become a national roads and rail authority with responsibility for upgrading and maintaining our national road network in addition to the rail network.</P>
    <P>The Sligo-Dublin rail line, as I think everybody in the country now knows, is an essential artery for the entire north-west. There is a very genuine fear that the line to Sligo will be closed, like many other facilities that have closed down in the region.  The service is now in a shambles because of the condition of the track, the signalling and the rolling stock.  The maximum speed limit on long stretches of the line between Mullingar and Sligo is 50 mph; it has already been decided that the maximum speed limit next year will be reduced to 40 mph and it is expected that because of the condition of the track the maximum speed limit in 1993 will be 30 mph.  What kind of service will we have then?</P>
    <P>No one will say that the rail service between Sligo and Mullingar will be closed.  No Government Minister or Irish <Col N="319" /> Rail spokesman will say that the rail service will cease, but it will happen by a process of slow strangulation and not by order, because people will simply refuse to travel if the train is running at 30 mph. The engines are now all over 30 years old and break down on a regular basis. Indeed, one questions when and where the train will break down; one hopes that it will not break down in the middle of nowhere because the signalling is such that one cannot get word sent along the line and people very often do not know where the train has broken down.  That is the position of the rail line to Sligo, which is a vital artery to the north-west. What is needed is an upgrading or renewal of the line.  I accept that last year a squad was gathered especially to work on the track and provide a continuous rail track like the Cork line.  Suddenly that work stopped because of a lack of money.  I know that finances are scarce but I ask the Government why there was no application for Structural Funds for the railways in proportion to the volume provided for roads.</P>
    <P>We are becoming very environmentally conscious now and the ability of the railways to take much of the traffic off the roads if properly handled could see them become a major factor in our transport structure.</P>
    <P>Rail transport is the only form of transport in Ireland in which the transport user, Irish Rail, have to pay the total cost of the infrastructure, which is very substantial.  It is essential that a proper proportion of EC Structural Funds be given to the railways and also that increased resources be allocated from the public capital programme, even in these scarce times.</P>
    <P>The railway line between Mullingar and Sligo, a line in which I have a particular interest, has been designated as the first part of the network to be cut off unless sufficient funds are made available. I accept that these are difficult times for the Exchequer, and that we may be asked to wait for two or three years. Unfortunately, we cannot wait because if <Col N="320" /> there is such a delay there will be no railway line left.  The line will have broken down structurally and the railways' potential passengers will have gone elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the new National Roads Authority to be set up under the Bill will look after the national road network and that when the work is finished the roads here will equal the European challenge.  However, 94 per cent of our roads do not come under the aegis of the Authority and, as Deputy Hyland said, most local authorities are able to resurface their roads only very occasionally, perhaps once in every 25 years.  No one knows more about this than the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Present funding is inadequate.  Fine Gael have suggested that the present system of funding should be replaced by a local roads fund to be funded by receipts from motor taxation.  Something has to happen.  The condition of our roads is extraordinarily frustrating and vexing.  It creates aggravation within local communities. County councils are being asked to do something about the problem but because of financial limitations they cannot do anything.  The problem will get progressively worse as the years go by.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister will seek all possible imaginative and inventive ideas to try to do something about the state of the roads and to remove what is a continuous source of aggravation in local communities. Whenever one travels from one area to another, one is immediately conscious of the problem and is reminded of it constantly.  The state of our roads is something that cannot possibly be forgotten and it is doing an enormous amount of damage.  It would be a great relief if something could be done to at least alleviate the problem.</P>
    <P>At the moment, sadly, our national and secondary roads compare very badly with the roads of most of our EC partners &mdash; and when we talk of partners we are also talking of competitors.  Until now the state of our roads was an embarrassment, to say the very least, but from now on it will be an embarrassment that we as a nation cannot afford.  Let us hope <Col N="321" /> the Authority will quickly catch up and make amends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I wish the new Minister for the Environment every good luck in his new portfolio.  It might be better for me to use a different word to &ldquo;luck&rdquo; because I expect the common saying in relation to football that one makes one's own luck applies also to politicians.  I trust the Minister will be successful as Minister for the Environment as he was in the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>I wish to take the opportunity to thank the previous Minister for the Environment, Deputy Pádraic Flynn, for the tremendous work he did in his years as Minister of that Department.  He brought his ministry to a new plateau and his work is something the Fianna Fáil Party can be proud of.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a very necessary and comprehensive Bill.  The Minister stated in his speech that when enacted the Bill will establish the National Roads Authority on a statutory basis and update the law relating to public roads.  That development will be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>The planning, supervising, improvement, maintenance and construction of the network of national roads will now become the responsibility of the National Roads Authority.  It is vital that we have one authority that will ensure that our country has a modern, proper network of national roads.  We must all realise the tremendous improvements that have taken place in the network of roads, in particular around the capital city.</P>
      <P>A serious effort has been made in recent years to improve access routes to the airports and ports but we must accept that much more needs to be done.  As a country, Ireland has spent a considerable amount of time and money attracting various industries to our island and the necessity for those industries is greater today than it has ever been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be admitted that the unemployment figures of the past few years are a disgrace for such a small country.  It is frightening to think that almost 300,000 <Col N="322" /> people are not able to find work in their own country.  If we are serious about creating employment, surely one of the first priorities must be the provision of a proper infrastructure.</P>
    <P>While there is a huge market at our disposal, competition has never been greater and it is vital for any firm to be able to transport its products to the marketplace and still remain competitive. Unfortunately for most firms operating here &mdash; transport costs are at an unacceptable level.  I have no doubt that the National Roads Authority will play a major role in reducing the transport cost disadvantage being experienced by Irish firms that export their produce.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the National Roads Authority will play a very significant role in the development of our country.  At this stage I thank the chairman of the interim authority, Dr. Con Power, and the other members who have done such good work since it was established.</P>
    <P>During recent years major changes and improvements in the national roads network have taken place throughout the country.  Today I suggest to the Minister that when he comes to appoint a chairperson and other members to the Authority he might appoint some of those who have proved their ability in that area.</P>
    <P>Earlier Deputy Gilmore seemed to resent that the Minister for the Environment would be appointing those people but he did not seem to have a better suggestion to make.  I have no doubt that when it comes to appointing members to the new Authority the Minister will pick capable people who will do their job &mdash; which is a difficult job &mdash; in the best interests of the country.  I wish the Minister every success in the appointment of members to the Authority.</P>
    <P>When the Bill is enacted the classification of public roads will be simplified. It is proposed to have three classes of roads: national roads, regional roads and local roads.  In turn, those classes may be divided into sub-classes.</P>
    <P>The classification of roads has caused much concern in many counties, and in particular in those counties bordering the capital city.  On a few occasions I have <Col N="323" /> demonstrated to the House the disadvantageous position in which County Kildare finds itself.  Parts of County Kildare have come under the influence of the rapid expansion of the Dublin region over the past few years, the population of these areas having exploded.  Unfortunately that rapid expansion has not been matched by improvements in the roads system, which in turn has led to traffic chaos.  Regrettably, funds have not been provided to upgrade these roads. We have allowed thousands of houses to be built in these areas but have refused to tackle the problems this type of development entails.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister will consult the National Roads Authority, but it will be the responsibility of the Minister to classify roads.  Celbridge is a town that has suffered from a population explosion resulting in severe traffic problems.  Traffic leaving the town destined for Dublin must cross one bridge which carries in excess of 17,000 vehicles daily, so that tailbacks are a regular occurrence there every morning and evening.  In normal circumstances a road carrying 17,000 vehicles daily would be of dual carriageway proportions.</P>
    <P>Our present system of funding our roads must be revised because it is obviously unsatisfactory.  Funds must be provided where there is greatest need. We must acknowledge that roads in counties bordering Dublin carry more traffic than any other counties nationwide. Since such counties are facilitating such a large proportion of traffic we must be prepared to compensate them therefor.</P>
    <P>In recent years a number of our towns have been bypassed, bringing much relief and reducing traffic congestion in these towns.  Initially there were fears that business in such towns would suffer as a result of such bypasses.  When the bypass of Naas was planned many local businessmen were concerned that it would enormously reduce the volume of their business.  Thankfully the opposite has been the case: additional business has been generated in that people are now able to drive into the town, park their <Col N="324" /> cars and conduct their business in more comfort.  There is a thriving business now in Naas.  I am sure the same is true of towns in other counties.  Deputy Nealon mentioned that the bypass of Leixlip, Maynooth and Kilcock has commenced, which is much to be welcomed.  Anybody travelling to the west will readily appreciate the difficulties encountered on that road.  Hopefully in the not too distant future those bypasses will help resolve that problem.</P>
    <P>We receive large amounts of funding from Europe for the provision of motorways and bypasses for which we are grateful. We all accept the necessity for such changes and the benefits to be derived therefrom.  As Deputy Hyland pointed out &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; in a number of counties we have gone to great lengths to ensure that we have these modern motorways.  We accept that they are necessary, that our transport costs are unacceptably high and must be reduced.  At the same time we must acknowledge that restoration of the county roads network is equally important. I cannot understand why we can receive so much money for the construction of these motorways while the same amount of funding is not available for improvement of our county roads network, which has suffered enormously in recent years.  I know that the former Minister for the Environment increased allocations to local authorities to enable them to improve the county roads network. Nonetheless it would appear there are insufficient funds to undertake that task properly and resolve the problem. Perhaps we have not been getting value for the money we have been spending on our county roads network, but that is for another day.  If we are not prepared to tackle this problem immediately our county roads network will deteriorate beyond redemption.  We have all observed their atrocious condition countrywide.  Hopefully some assistance can be got from Brussels to tackle this serious problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland mentioned service charges.  I will say merely that the system of funding of local authorities is totally <Col N="325" /> inadequate.  We have observed their difficulties, in particular last week in Cork. While I am not familiar with the politics in Cork, when it comes to striking rates many local authorities tend to point the finger at Dublin, contending that the same system does not appear to obtain nationwide.  I note that Deputy Doyle has removed his glasses and is ready for an argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the true facts; no argument at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be a fair, equitable system nationwide, eliminating the present inequalities which cannot continue to be tolerated.  I would ask the Minister present to take the bull by the horns in this respect.  We will never resolve the serious problems encountered by local authorities until we are in a position to introduce a local government tax, thereby providing local authorities with funding.  At present they are unable to properly fulfil their functions on the basis of their present inadequate allocations.  At present the local authorities have no teeth or power and this has caused many of our difficulties. I hope that that problem can be tackled in ensuing years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Nealon referred to our rail system.  Anybody who listened to the radio during the past week will readily appreciate the difficulties being experienced by Sligo people in this respect. Indeed our rail system has been raped in recent years.  It is vital that we realise our error in allowing this to happen.  Over the years there has been a policy of closing down a number of railway lines.  We must acknowledge our mistake in that respect and re-open some lines which would help to alleviate some of the problems being encountered on our roads network. While the National Roads Authority is to be established, they will not solve problems overnight.  I predict it will be a number of years before we will observe any real benefits from their role. Our rail system should be examined to ascertain its capacity as an alternative mode of transport, to solve some of the <Col N="326" /> problems being encountered on our roads.</P>
    <P>I might deal with the provisions of section 66 of the Bill dealing with the erection of temporary dwellings on national roads.  Henceforth such temporary dwellings will be prohibited and local authorities are being given appropriate powers to enforce such prohibition. This power will be welcomed by local authorities because to date their hands have been tied.  For example, in County Kildare in recent years on occasion up to 100 and more such temporary dwellings have been erected.  Yet the relevant local authorities and/or Garda have been unable to have them removed.  They have been the cause of great trouble and disturbance in some areas.  It is necessary to get a court order to have them moved and this is quite costly, placing an unnecessary burden on local authorities.  The provision in the Bill will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>When this Bill becomes law we will have in place a modern administrative structure for the development of our national roads and I wish it every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his new portfolio.  The Department of the Environment is an interesting one in which to work because it touches the lives of most people.  I am sure the Minister will find his work very rewarding and I wish him every success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not intend to speak about service charges but both Deputies Hyland and Power have referred to the fact that there is no service charge in Dublin.  I want to put the record straight.  Dublin had a service charge for two years and raised £3 million.  After the local elections in 1985 the city council decided in their wisdom to eliminate the service charge and they did so by cutting back on various programmes.  Economies were made in each programme to the extent of £3 million in total.  That is why we have no service charge in Dublin.  We succeeded in our efforts to eliminate it and it is up to every other local authority to do the same.  We were actually penalised by the Department of the Environment, who <Col N="327" /> reduced our rate support grant by 6 per cent for the next year.</P>
    <P>Section 52 allows local authorities themselves, or in an arrangement with a private operator, to provide services on local or national roads.  With the removal of the <i>ultra vires</i> rule, I hope local authorities will be able to raise some revenue. The Bill has the effect of putting the National Roads Authority on a statutory footing.  The Authority will have overall responsibility for planning and supervising the construction, improvement and maintenance of the network of national roads and motorways.  Local authorities will retain responsibility for non-national roads.  They will normally be relied upon to prepare road design and maintenance programmes and to enter into road network contracts, but the Authority will have power to carry out these functions should they consider this to be more convenient, expeditious, effective or economical. This formula of words is to be found many times throughout the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires the proposed Authority to prepare at regular intervals a road plan for the development of the network of national roads.  This will be subject to public consultation in a process very similar to that followed in repect of local authority draft development plans. While it appears that the Minister retains overall control of roads policy, the Authority will displace the role of the local authorities and the Department of the Environment in relation to road construction, design and maintenance.  It appears that the Minister and his Department are no longer anxious to be involved in the day to day supervision of the works programme on national roads and are anxious that the National Roads Authority should take over this role.  This Bill gives the Authority substantial powers to enable them to get on with the task of overseeing and co-ordinating the development of our national roads programme.</P>
    <P>If we are to have economic recovery we must make every effort to reduce <Col N="328" /> transport costs significantly.  Manufacturers, especially exporters, suffer a great disadvantage when compared with their counterparts in other EC states. Transport costs are a significant factor affecting the competitiveness of industry, both at domestic and national levels.  It is estimated that transport costs for Irish exporters to mainland Europe account for 9 per cent of export sale values, approximately twice the cost incurred by traders on the European mainland.  The completion of the internal market and the opening of the Channel tunnel require that the transport system linking Ireland with the rest of the Community be competitive and efficient so as to facilitate the expansion of trade.  Road improvements and better traffic management would contribute to lowering transport costs by possibly as much as one-fifth, thereby reducing overall costs and making firms more competitive.</P>
    <P>If we are to halt the rise in unemployment by creating 20,000 new jobs each year, we must look to the manufacturing industry to provide many of those jobs.  Industry depends to a predominant extent on the road network for delivery of raw materials, carriage of goods for export to ports and airports and the distribution of products to wholesale and retail outlets on the domestic market. A poor national road network adds to the cost of our exports.  This factor cannot be underestimated in view of the fact that 70 per cent of our net output is exported. Poor roads are also a disincentive to enterprise considering Ireland as a location.  Farmers also depend on roads to get their produce from farm to market or to a processing centre.  They too need a good national road network.  Safe, fast and comfortable travel is essential for tourists heading from the main ports and airports to the principal tourist areas.  The improvement of the road network is a vital element in increasing our tourism potential.  These are some of the reasons for improving our national roads network.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that an improved road network would yield an immediate and significant economic return.  Job creation <Col N="329" /> in the road construction industry is high and the direct and indirect employment content of road improvement works on national roads, expressed in man year jobs per £1 million expenditure, is 34 for major improvements and 50 for other improvements.  However, the primary purpose of our road development programme is not direct employment creation.  The programme is directed to other policy measures which will create employment in industry, agriculture and tourism.</P>
    <P>It must be assumed that the new Authority will be successful only if they have the necessary finance.  With the restriction on the public capital programme, every effort must be made to obtain EC funding and to attract private funding in respect of the design and construction of roads.  Speaking in May 1983 on the Environment Vote, I stated:</P>
    <P>If money cannot be raised on the public capital programme, then I suggest we make greater efforts to attract private sector participation in financing, design and construction of roads. One suggestion is that a national road agency should be established to own, develop and maintain the national primary routes.  This agency would be funded partly by the State and partly by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>This has been common practice on the Continent, especially in Italy and Spain, for many years.  From my knowledge of Italy, I know there are many excellent roads there which are tolled.  I have no difficulty with the principle of tolling national roads especially when money has been invested by the private sector in such roads.  As Deputy Gilmore said, the company which financed the building of the bridge on the East Link road not alone built a bridge which the city council could not afford to build at the time but have also gained financial rewards from their investment.  This toll bridge is not only a source of revenue for Dublin Corporation and the Port and Docks Board but, more importantly, is a source of revenue for the local communities <Col N="330" /> north and south of the river at Ringsend and the East Wall.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the proposal to take the function of applying tolls from local authorities and to give it to the National Roads Authority.  When tolls are placed on national roads I hope that the local authorities in whose areas the roads are situated will get some financial benefit.  This would help local authorities to overcome their present financial difficulties. Local authorities see this proposal as a means of earning extra revenue.</P>
    <P>Over the years I have noticed that Members avail of the opportunity on debates on various Bills to refer to problems in their constituencies.  It would be remiss of me if I did not refer to a road which is causing much controversy at present, namely, the Dublin Port access and eastern relief route.  This matter was referred to by Deputy Gilmore in his contribution.  This route has not been included in the draft development plan which will be endorsed by the city council on 16 December due to the fact that a feasibility study is being carried out at present by Ove Arup &amp; Partners.  This study, which was commissioned by Dublin Corporation will be paid for by the Department of the Environment, and will, I understand, cost approximately £500,000.  It has always been the strongly held view of local representatives that they should not have to make a decision on this road until the feasibility study was available.  I understand that the feasibility study will be available in March or April of next year and that the relief route will then be introduced as a variation or amendment to the draft development plan.  The city council will make a final decision on the matter at that stage.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this route has been included in the national roads programme for the past five years and, as such, will come under the auspices of the National Roads Authority.  I also understand that the National Roads Authority will be involved in the eastern by-pass issue as they will take over responsibility for national road planning and construction. The National Roads Authority <Col N="331" /> will have a say in the eastern by-pass issue because under the powers being granted to them in the Bill they will be able to issue a direction to Dublin Corporation one way or the other.  It would be inappropriate for the National Roads Authority to make a decision on this matter before the elected members of Dublin Corporation have the opportunity to make their final decision.  As Deputy Gilmore rightly said, there is much to be said for allowing elected representatives to make decisions in regard to roads. However, if local authorities cannot make up their minds a final decision will have to be made at a certain stage.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made to section 28, which contains some interesting provisions.  As those of us who are familiar with planning know &mdash; as chairman of a planning authority this is one of the things I regret &mdash; when a person makes an application to a planning authority which is in breach of a development plan the council have to make a material contravention and go through a certain procedure if they wish to grant approval to the application.  However, if they do not wish to make the material contravention, then the application by its very nature fails.  An applicant who fails to get a material contravention from the local authority can make an appeal to An Bord Pleanála, who for some extraordinary reason can overrule a local authority's development plan and give permission without going through any procedure.  Before issuing a direction which would require a local authority to materially contravene a development plan the Authority will have to go through a procedure which mirrors that for a material contravention of a local authority development plan.  This will give the public an opportunity to make their views known on the proposal.  This is a distinct improvement on the present procedure in relation to the granting of planning permission by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that it would be wrong to place a toll on ring roads as this would force more motorists to travel <Col N="332" /> through the city.  Thirty per cent of the traffic in the eastern part of the city goes north-south or south-north.  Unfortunately, motorists who do not have any direct business in the city but who want to go north or south of the city have to go through the city centre.  Such motorists have to be encouraged to use ring roads around the city.  Instead of putting a toll on ring roads motorists entering the city should be asked to pay a toll.</P>
    <P>If it is proposed to build new roads then a light rail system should be built simultaneously on the existing roads in Dublin city.  This would require traffic management.  Cars which use existing roads will transfer to new roads.  This means that the existing roads have to be dedicated to public transport; we cannot allow even one extra motorist to use those roads.  This is why a light rail system should be built simultaneously with the building of new roads.  If this was done we could get over many of the problems in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals in regard to busways and cycleways.  I hope the Minister decides to give approval for the building of a cyclelane as distinct from a cycleway on the Stillorgan road.  A proposal in this regard has been with the Minister's Department for some time now.  We look at traffic in a picemeal fashion.  The best means by which to have an overall view of traffic in the city would be through a transport authority but unfortunately that is not provided for in the Bill.  Some consideration should be given at a future date to a transport authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this Bill I am glad of the opportunity afforded to the House to address the many issues relating to the management and maintenance of our road infrastructure.  By comparison with our partners in mainland Europe and in the UK we have many miles to travel before we reach comparable standards of roads.  We have started from a lower base and we have made great strides to improve the standard of the main arteries.  I am pleased to speak on this Bill within a month or so <Col N="333" /> of a marvellous new road being opened in County Wicklow which by-passes Bray and Shankill.  Hundreds of thousands of commuters and tourists to Wicklow and the south-east will be delighted with this new road.  I hope it will encourage many more visitors to the beautiful county of Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate all those involved in the planning and construction of this new roadway.  If I am permitted to be a little parochial for a moment I would like to refer to the proposed by-pass of Arklow town.  Many of my colleagues will be aware that this is on the main Euro route to Rosslare. Industrial activity has been strangled because of traffic congestion in Arklow. It is vitally important that at local authority and national levels we get on with the task of planning and undertaking the Arklow by-pass.  It is causing major disruption to economic growth and the establishment of industry particularly in the town of Arklow and in the south Wicklow hinterland.  Recently, droves of industrialists, taken to Arklow by the IDA, voiced an aversion to the traffic situation in the town which is having serious adverse effects on the economic development of that area of south Wicklow. From a national point of view it is causing a major upset for tourism and other traffic to and from the major port of Rosslare.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;arteries&rdquo; is well applied to the principal roads as they provide the life blood for industrial development in the various regions of the country.  We have long recognised that the expansion of industrial development in Ireland was heavily correlated with the establishment of a well-planned road infrastructure. The new market situation which will obtain throughout Europe from 1992 onwards puts a new focus on this requirement. The necessity to compete well in this market from our peripheral position highlights the need to provide industry with the optimum infrastructural base so that overhead costs can be minimised and that they are not unduly disadvantaged through inadequate transport routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creation of the channel tunnel <Col N="334" /> between England and France will physically the most of the United Kingdom to the mainland of Europe and will both enhance the competitive advantage of those availing of it and increase the throughput from mainland Europe to our main market, thereby significantly increasing competition.  We must react in a planned and comprehensive way. Transport systems will be a key element of that plan.  Ireland is the EC state which is most dependent on foreign trade and because of our location on the periphery of Europe we need to provide ourselves with maximum facilities in terms of infrastructure such as roads, bridges, ports, etc.  Our freight transport costs as a percentage of total export value are twice the EC average.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides a framework for us to address matters pertaining to the national road infrastructure.  This is a key element of economic development of all regions of the country; so also is the role that must be played by the National Roads Authority.  Therefore, I welcome this very important Bill, the purpose of which is to establish a National Road Authority on a statutory basis and update the law relating to public roads.  It is a comprehensive Bill with six Parts.  The thrust of Part II is proposals relating to the assignment to road authorities responsibility for the construction and maintenance of public roads, the classification of public roads and procedures for the declaration and abandonment of public roads.  I welcome the new classification system proposed in the three classes of road: national, regional and local.  Clear definitions and assignments of responsibility are essential to any effective management system.</P>
    <P>These three classifications replace eight different classifications which existed previously.  While the various subsections of section 10 provide for sub-classes of the three new clssifications, the designation of particular roads for particular purposes as in the designation of a particular road as a Euro route will operate within a logical structured classification. Subsections (5) and (6) provide for the keeping of a schedule and map of <Col N="335" /> public roads in each road authority area and the taking of inventories of public roads at the request of the Minister.  I am interested in the provisions for the keeping of this map in different formats which would include a computerised format.  It is likely that roads authorities may keep the map in paper form also.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be prudent to ensure there is consistency and standardisation of formats between all road authorities in order that all these maps together make an integrated single system, particularly in a computerised format.</P>
    <P>Apart from the logic of having a standardised computer compatible system there may well be revenue potential from providing access to such a system by the public, institutions or businesses.  If this is happening already or is about to happen I would encourage the Minister to provide guidance and direction on the development of new systems.  It may well be that the Minister has in mind a linking arrangement with the geographical information system in the Ordnance Survey Office and if that is so it would make sense.  A similar system is owned by Coillte Teoranta for the mapping of their forest properties and road systems.  As these are very expensive systems it may be worthwhile to draw on any work undertaken to date on these systems. There may be a significant opportunity in the future to sell on this service provided sufficient planning is undertaken at this stage.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 deal with the power to declare roads over which there is a public right of way as public roads and procedures regarding the abandonment of certain public roads.  These are important provisions and obviously will evoke local sentiment in one form or another wherever used.  What is important, therefore, is the procedure applying in each case for objection, representation and adequate public notice of the road authority's intentions in either case.  In the case of abandoned roads will the Minister indicate the position with regard to future ownership, repairs, and maintenance of <Col N="336" /> such roads where there is local interest in having a road maintained to a certain standard, and what processes will exist for such local undertakings?</P>
    <P>Under section 13 (6) there is provision for road authorities to provide any amenity, structure or thing for the safety or convenience of road users and for landscaping or other artistic features.  While that is a reasonable provision I would like to see a more pro-active approach to amenities and landscaping in general.  In a country which places a high priority on tourism generation it would make sense to establish guidelines or standards so that the provision of amenities and landscaping would become an intrinsic part of any road making or maintenance plans, and adequate upfront funding should be provided for this.  We have a wealth of resources in landscaping and tree planting expertise in the private and public sectors.  This should be used by road authorities to assist them in their work.</P>
    <P>In County Wicklow the county management set-up takes full cognisance of the importance of tourism and ensures wherever possible that there is a synergy between necessary works and tourism development.  This must become the standard rather than the exception. There is potential for grant-aiding private contributions in this area where bodies or individuals are prepared to develop roadside amenities such as picnic areas or to generally contribute to the enhancement of the road landscape within specific guidelines.  We should consider that as a useful addition to the services provided by road authorities.  It could be a more cost effective venture in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I compliment road authorities who have shown the way in landscaping roadways. The planting of suitable trees, shrubs and flowers shows the road user that sensible and sensitive planning has gone into the works.  It is important for road authorities to see in these developments an opportunity to create a good image.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with agreements between road authorities with regard to <Col N="337" /> national and other public roads.  The section is essential for effective planning. Part III of the Bill deals with the establishment of the National Roads Authority and its functions.  The Authority will have overall responsibility for planning and supervision of the construction and maintenance of national roads, including access routes to principal ports and airports. Whereas these roads represent under 6 per cent of total road mileage, they account for 37 per cent of total road traffic, two-thirds of which is work related.  I wholeheartedly welcome the establishment of the Authority on a statutory basis.  The national road infrastructure is one of the most strategically important areas of national endeavour. The planning and building of roads requires the highest levels of expertise and co-ordination.  The right balance has been struck in the Bill between functions which need to be co-ordinated centrally and those which are properly delegated to the road authorities.</P>
    <P>Road users nowadays demand high quality roads.  Unfortunately there has been a lot of publicity with regard to potholes and the general state of minor roads.  This reflects a sad situation in many areas.  However, people are also aware of the improvements that have taken place in the relatively recent past. National routes have been greatly improved and there is a general belief that we are getting it together and going in the right direction.  The availability of EC funds has been a great boon to road development.  The improvements show evidence of the benefits of EC membership and the significant contribution which is being made from Structural and Regional Funds.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the preparation of a draft plan for the construction and maintenance of national roads for submission to the Minister and for procedures to enable objections or representations to be made to the Authority on the plan.  It also provides that the Authority shall review the implementation of the plan approved by the Minister. I presume that where modifications <Col N="338" /> are proposed the same system of publishing notices as provided in subsection (3) will apply.  An approved plan can only be replaced by another plan prepared in the same way.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would elaborate on that for me.</P>
    <P>The functions of the Authority outlined in section 19 are quite extensive, as are the powers in section 20 relating to the construction and maintenance of national roads.  Section 19 (1) (c) relates to traffic signs.  This is one area in which we could do more to help road users.  I would be glad if the Minister would explain if the definition of traffic signs is different from the definition of road signs.  Notwithstanding that, I would welcome a thorough re-examination of policy with regard to road signs or traffic signs in terms of design and size along with other relevant aspects.  I am glad that this matter of road and traffic signs is receiving attention where new major roadways are being developed.  I would not like to think that improvements in general road signs would have to await road development.  The black and white post with signs pointing in all directions may look well on a postcard but it does not do anything for tourism or the road user generally.  Anyone who has travelled on the Continent cannot but be impressed by the quality of road signs by comparison to those which exist here.</P>
    <P>Driving is always potentially hazardous and the driver should be given every possible assistance to avoid unnecessary distractions or problems.  Inadequate road signs are a hazard to drivers and particularly to tourists who are unfamiliar with the roads.  There are new coded systems operating to EC standards and they must be applied.  I strongly urge that adequate planning and funding should be provided so as to bring our signs to the highest standards.  Policy in this area must also have regard to non-traffic or direction signs, for instance B &amp; B signs and other advertising signs which are often more prominent than direction signs to towns or villages.  I know that local authorities will undertake improvements as funding <Col N="339" /> permits but central direction and assistance through the new authority will speed up improvements.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides that the Authority should actively investigate and pursue EC grant aid for national road development. This is appropriate and provides a structural approach in order to obtain grant assistance.  I am glad that there is provision in section 22 for the Authority to make submissions to the planning authority with regard to development plans.  This is another feature of co-ordinated efforts to achieve the best overall plan.</P>
    <P>The sections dealing with the appointment of the chairman and members of the Authority and the chief executive and staff are standard sections similar to those in most other Acts establishing other bodies.  I have referred in this House on other occasions to the need to ensure that in the transfer of staff there is good communication and consultation with staff representatives and trade unions.  This is vitally important in order to ensure that the Authority receive the benefit of a fully motivated staff.  Section 31 (4) provides that staff transferred to the Authority shall not have less favourable terms and conditions of employment than those which were enjoyed prior to their transfer.  I presume that also will apply to section 34 (1) (b) covering membership of a local authority and that the Minister's designation of the class of staff under subsection (1) (c) takes that into account.</P>
    <P>If section 34 (2) effects a change in that situation, as I understand is proposed, for example, in the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, there may be difficulties with staff representatives.  I would therefore urge the Minister to ensure that full negotiations take place with trade unions on all aspects of the Bill relating to staff.</P>
    <P>Provisions are made in Part 4 for motorways, busways and protected roads.  I note in particular the prohibition on the use of motorways by pedal cyclists which I believe is right.  I was delighted, <Col N="340" /> however, to see that in section 65 provision is also made for the development of cycleways.  Although it is but a short reference to cycleways I sincerely hope these are taken fully on board with all other major developments and included in the initial planning process.  Many people use bicycles for leisure, touring and holidays and it is very important that the Authority keep them fully in mind in any of their plans.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in sections 48 and 49 for the preparation of environmental impact statements and assessments. Although now necessary in so many areas of development it is fitting that where public developments take place the road authorities and the National Roads Authority should also be seen to comply in like form with these requirements.  In this context I refer again to my earlier comments on landscaping and the provision of amenities.  We have much to gain by being proactive and responsive to environmental concerns. As I have spoken at length on this matter on other Bills I will not do so again now.</P>
    <P>While section 51 deals adequately with works by State authorities, statutory undertakers and local authorities on major roadways, I would only ask that special attention be given to providing adequate knowledge for the public well in advance of any such works on these roadways.  This again relates to traffic signs and I think it would be in the public interest that specific guidelines should be drawn up to provide for advance signs at regular intervals so that everyone is well warned of potential dangers or hazards ahead.</P>
    <P>Part 5 provides for toll roads.  While we are all well used to free roadways I know that the high quality road systems throughout Europe are heavily subsidised through toll schemes.  This is something we must face up to and, in fairness, it ensures that those using the roads contribute directly to them.  I have no doubt that individual proposals will be contentious but more and more Irish people are getting experience of toll schemes, for example, in France and they <Col N="341" /> now understand the direct co-relation between high quality road systems and toll schemes.  At the end of the day it is the quality of the road system upon which a toll scheme will be judged.</P>
    <P>I want to turn my attention to the matter of non-primary roads which are being neglected to an extent.  Roads which are not primary roads must also receive adequate investment.  It is a major mistake to direct all investment in road building via European Regional Development Fund to the primary network. Rural development is a priority objective of the European Regional Development Fund.  It is one of the five priority objectives of the European Regional Development Fund that cognisance be taken of rural development and funding coming from that particular source channelled in the direction of rural development. How can one adequately and properly develop rural Ireland without a proper network of roads?</P>
    <P>We tend to put too much emphasis on the national primary roads and not enough on our ordinary roads.  For historical reasons Ireland has a great number of roads.  It is estimated that Irish roads are twice the length, per head of population, of roads in the UK.  We have a job on hand in terms of providing the funding for these roads but it is vital that we attend to them.  We should move them up our list of priorities.  The whole of Ireland, including rural Ireland and our small towns and villages, must benefit from the roads programme.  We must not get carried away with the primary roads despite their importance.  We must address all our roads, particularly those that have been negotiated for some time.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on this important Bill.  It is an excellent opportunity for the House to consider the major strategic significance of the national road infrastructure.  The establishment of the National Roads Authority on a statutory basis will, I am certain, greatly improve planning and development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been promised for quite some time.  As its responsibility will only be for national roads it will therefore concentrate on six per cent of the total road mileage which accounts for 37 per cent of the total road traffic.  It is estimated in 1988 that it would cost over £3 billion for national roads and £600 million for national secondary roads.  Parallel to this amount was a projected amount of £750 million which is earmarked under the operational programme on peripherality and would cover the road works up to the end of 1993.  Therefore, the scale of the undertaking is massive and there will still be a considerable shortfall.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the roads covered under his programme is for the total of 3,000 miles, of which 1,500 miles are on the national primary route and 1,500 miles are on the national secondary route.  When one considers its costs in excess of £1.5 million for each mile of road on a single carriageway, the problem of maintaining our national roads is daunting.  It is questionable, even with the introduction of this National Roads Authority, whether we will be able to address the situation satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>Having analysed the Bill, I believe it would be a retrograde step to take the responsibility away from the local county councils when it comes to allocating contracts for roadways in this area of responsibility.  Breaking contracts up into smaller packages means not only that the present system, under which county councils operate, is fair but it enables contractors within the county to quote, along with contractors from outside the county. I would have a major concern if the National Roads Authority were to take over the responsibility for road construction because I believe the contracts would be given to a few large contractors. The present system is fair and represents good value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In county Limerick road works which extend for about five miles are taking place on a major national route, the Limerick to Killarney road, and are anticipated to cost £8 million.  Although this is a big undertaking for Limerick <Col N="343" /> County Council they are doing a professional job.  I give this example to substantiate the reason why responsibility for allocating contracts for work on these projects should remain with the appropriate county council.  It is, of course, understandable that the National Roads Authority should oversee this activity.  That is the true responsibility of a National Roads Authority.  The county councils have a great appreciation of the roadways within their counties and have the expertise to deal adequately with what is required.</P>
    <P>In relation to the erection of speed limit signs &mdash; a matter of concern for me &mdash; the county council, in consultation with the Garda authorities, submit for approval the recommended new speed limit signs to the Department of the Environment but, regrettably, it can take them up to 12 to 18 months to make a decision and communicate it to the appropriate county council.  This responsibility not alone extends to towns and villages on national routes but to towns and villages on county roads.  I have often seen local communities extremely concerned and approaching public representatives to have a speed limit sign erected.  This is a long process and as a result people often get very frustrated with the officials whom they feel are not effective on this specific issue.</P>
    <P>Recently I welcomed the Minister's response to a parliamentary question I had tabled that it would continue to be the responsibility of the Department of the Environment to accede to a request to erect speed limit signs on national primary roads.  However, he indicated that he was considering whether it would be feasible to give the county council, in consultation with the Garda authorities, direct responsibility for the erection of speed limit signs outside of national routes.  That would be a worthwhile decision and I hope that the Minister will implement it.  I am also confident that it would be welcomed by communities not living on a main national route and by county council officials and <Col N="344" /> Garda authorities.  I urge the Minister to take prompt action to change the present system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill which will prohibit temporary dwellings on national roads.  Undoubtedly, this is the greatest nuisance not alone on our national roads but on our county roads also.  It is amazing when a scheme of houses is to be built in a town or village &mdash; admittedly these are now scarce &mdash; how quickly the word spreads and for a period of some 12 to 18 months a convoy of caravans congregate outside a town or village.  For example, outside Abbey-feale, County Limerick, at least eight caravans are parked, the occupants of which are waiting to be allocated houses. I give this as an example of what can happen.  They usually create an extra hazard on a national route.  In addition, derelict caravans and rubbish of all kinds are left behind which add to an unpleasant scene which is not conducive to portraying a good image for tourists.</P>
    <P>There appears to be an inherent weakness in the system when it comes to moving these caravans on because when their owners are requested to move by the Garda authorities and the county council they often move only a short distance. I have seen county councils press ahead with imaginative proposals and provide very nice lay-bys on main national routes where tourists and others can stop and have a picnic.  I note reference is made in the Bill to the need to provide such facilities for those who use our national routes.  Regrettably, in many cases, county councils have to resort to constructing an embankment at a later stage to prevent them being used as unauthorised halting sites by travellers. This often results in extreme annoyance and frustration among residents living adjacent to these lay-bys.  While we hope this has been included as a positive recommendation unless the Minister is sincere in implementing it, it will not change the current position.</P>
    <P>In my county we have housed a large number of travellers during the years, in addition to providing halting sites.  They have been integrated into the <Col N="345" /> local community within housing estates. This policy has proved very effective.  An analysis of any records will show that we, in County Limerick, have a consistent record when it comes to housing travellers. However, we are still confronted with this problem throughout the county. I should say that some county councils share an intolerable burden while others are shirking their responsibility.</P>
    <P>The problem has been compounded in recent times by the draconian restriction imposed by the Minister for the Environment in relation to the provision of housing.  Not alone is there pent up frustration among the settled community but also among travellers who look to the local authorities to provide them with housing.  It will, therefore, be necessary for the Minister to dramatically revise housing plans for all county councils if we are to address this problem and ensure that it will not be necessary for travellers to park on the side of the road.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I would like to refer to &mdash; Deputy Jacob made reference to this but I may put a different emphasis on it &mdash; and that is the strict planning regulations which govern the provision of signs, especially on our main national roads.  In my home town of Newcastle West, which is on a main, national primary route, I have often had to tell business people who had erected a sign that they would have to remove it as the council would not give planning permission for the erection of a sign on a main national route.  This is regrettable.</P>
    <P>Some other scheme should be considered as I think businesses are entitled to be given an opportunity to advertise their businesses.  This is especially important given that in recent times many of our towns and villages on national primary routes are being by-passed.  If they are not to be forgotten there will have to be some opportunities to make passing motorists aware of their existence. I ask the Minister to consider some alternative, such as licences, for the provision of these signs because the present rules are stringent and unfair to commercial properties.  Indeed, it is interesting to note that planning authorities will <Col N="346" /> not prosecute the person who puts up a sign.  It is almost a form of intimidation: the prosecution will be served on the landowner who allowed the sign to be erected.  In many cases the landowner would, out of courtesy, have facilitated a businessman whom he knew.</P>
    <P>Commercial properties are helping to sustain county councils in payment of commercial rates.  I am sure an analysis of most of the estimates of county councils who have struck a rate would show that, in many cases, it is a direct source of revenue for councils.  They have to resort to a percentage which at times may be excessive for businesses who are finding it extremely difficult to survive and to meet their commitments, not alone to the county council but to others. They need positive encouragement in their businesses but I question whether they are getting it at present.  I trust the Minister will be sympathetic to such people when the Bill is being considered and discussed in detail on Committee Stage.  The matter of business signs will have to be seriously addressed and I hope it will be done in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill which will allow the road authority to deal with dangerous trees.  This is a vexed issue; we all remember the terrible tragedy last year near Portumna where people were killed by a falling tree.  It is extremely important that the power to deal with dangerous trees and structures should be rigorously implemented. People know that a rotten tree is dangerous; if the tree is a hazard and a source of danger to motorists and others, regardless of whether it is rotten, it should be removed.  As we are speaking of trees, I compliment the county councils around the country who continue landscaping projects.  It is very easy at estimates time to reduce the horticultural budgets of county councils, which is regrettable and should be avoided.  Where there is landscaping, especially on national primary routes, it enhances the route, makes it more pleasant to drive through and is conducive to tourism.</P>
    <P>The importance of improving our national primary routes &mdash; and indeed all <Col N="347" /> our roads &mdash; must be recognised if we are to encourage tourism, a premier industry, which has been targeted by the Government as a growth area.  While the Bill concentrates on 6 per cent of our national routes, one might well ask about the other 94 per cent, which causes much frustration to county councils and councillors throughout the country.  It has been obvious over the past years that there has been a rapid deterioration in county roads.  I am sure the Minister is fully aware of the position in his own constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  He can see at first hand what was outlined on television before this year's local elections and which led to the success of &ldquo;pothole&rdquo; candidates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State also knows the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wanted a startling reminder of people's feelings in this regard the local elections proved the strength and depth of local feeling in relation to the quality of the roads.  Of course the problem is not confined to Monaghan-Cavan, Laois or Offaly; there are similar problems in County Limerick and in other counties.  Considerable strengthening of most of our roads is required.  The depth of many county roads is only six inches, a depth we would hardly use for the driveway of a house, and yet heavy articulated trucks are using these roads which were never designed for that type of traffic.  In my own county, well known for its strength in dairying, huge trucks belonging to the major cooperatives are using country roads which were never designed for heavy loads. Over the last few years all county councils have been involved in a fire brigade action in trying to maintain roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past many of our roads were taken over by county councils.  Quite often they led to cul-de-sacs with a minimum number of road users.  That was in the good old days when councils had buoyancy in revenue and took on roads which they now cannot maintain.  People are frustrated because the roads are not <Col N="348" /> being maintained.  County councils may argue that the volume of traffic on some roads does not warrant maintaining them and that they do not have the finance to do so.  However, the individuals who use these roads are not allowed to repair them because it is regarded as the council's responsibility and if anything happened they would not be covered by insurance.  Unless finance is improved, I can see one aspect of the Bill being implemented, the section relating to the abandonment of roads.  This is likely to happen because people who use the roads cannot rely on the council to repair them and are penalised if they try to repair the roads themselves.  What will happen in future if councils cannot maintain roads? I mention this to highlight the frustration of councillors and the people who live on these roads.</P>
    <P>I welcome the local improvements scheme which allocates a small amount of money each year which is availed of by people who have not had their roads taken over by the county council.  As things turned out they are probably fortunate because the money spent on these roads guarantees a superb job.  It appears to be the solution for the future.  When one considers the damage to cars and the extent of human tragedy as a result of the condition of our roads, we can truly appreciate the frustration of many.  In county councils there is a resistance to increasing service charges and quite often, in order to produce an estimate, the roads allocation is reduced.  This is frustrating but it is symptomatic of the dilemma of councillors in local authorities because of the severe restriction in the allocation of finance for a local authority to function effectively.</P>
    <P>Many people are willing to pay service charges if they are provided with a service. It was a retrograde step originally to allow the Dublin area not to pay service charges.  There should have been an even playing pitch nationally.  It has caused much annoyance in rural areas, which is understandable because many people in my county feel that Dublin has the best facilities and does not have to endure the frustration of those living in the country <Col N="349" /> in regard to the quality of service and roads.  The whole area of local authority funding will have to be seriously addressed by the Minister as, unfortunately, our county roads are deteriorating fast.  We are merely tinkering with the present problem because of restricted finance.</P>
    <P>I note that the Bill covers the roads into the principal ports.  In the operational programme on peripherality the ports were outlined but were confined to certain selected ports.  In Limerick there is a very successful port, Foynes, where I was born.  It is situated on the west coast and currently deals with in excess of one million tonnes of business.  Indeed, over a period of time, the port and its facilities have been considerably upgraded.  As a result it is attracting overseas industry and is providing much needed employment at local level.  It is situated on the Shannon Estuary which has often been described as the jewel of the western world.</P>
    <P>However, the heavy volume of trucks which use the port and have to travel through the village, day and night, puts an unnecessary strain on the local people and creates extra hazards.  Why can Foynes not be bypassed?  This has been done in the case of other ports, it is unfair discrimination.  I hope the Minister will address this issue and not confine funding to selected ports.  The road from Limerick to Foynes is regarded as a secondary road but it carries a massive number of heavy trucks.  It is a winding, tortuous road on which there is considerable scope for widening, strengthening and removing bends.  Not alone is the port of Foynes on this route but there are also many major industries such as Cement Road-stone, Aughinish Alumina, Wyeth and many other industries but every year a token amount of money is spent on this road which does not alleviate the difficulties experienced by motorists.  I have requested on occasions that the Minister upgrade this route and give it the status of a national primary road.  This might lead to increased funding and to the appropriate development of this roadway. However, the Minister has declined the request as he does not rate this road <Col N="350" /> as a national primary route.  This is unfortunate and regrettable.  I request the Minister to take note of the traffic survey which Limerick County Council have compiled which will verify the heavy concentration of traffic on this roadway, especially the massive volume of trucks.</P>
    <P>The Minister has moved from the Department of Health, where he faced many problems, to a daunting position as Minister for the Environment.  What I have illustrated is symptomatic of the frustration experienced by public representatives in every council around the country.  The main criticism which county councillors hear from people in their area is about the condition of the roadways. However, one is helpless to do anything about the matter because the funds are not available to carry out the works.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he would approach the debate with an open mind and would listen very carefully to all constructive suggestions and criticisms made.  I am sure that when the Bill is fully debated the Minister will be aware of the frustration of public representatives and also of the massive assignment required if we are to seriously address the problem of our roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important Bills to come before the House for some considerable time in the sense that it sets down a series of guidelines for the future development of the roads system by the National Roads Authority. Since the foundation of the State one of the great tragedies has been the lack of development of the infrastructural roads system.  That is a matter I will address during the course of my relatively brief speech.  The condition of our roads has been the cause of many tragic accidents resulting in death and injury.  I speak particularly of one road which I use regularly, the Dublin-Galway road.  This road has been neglected for many years.  It comprises a series of connecting roads between Dublin and Galway, roads which are in such a bad condition that they destroy towns and villages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When travelling from Dublin to Galway one first encounters a bottleneck <Col N="351" /> at Leixlip, then the bottlenecks at Maynooth and Kilcock.  There is then a breathing space until one reaches Kinnegad which might be seen as a halfway house, although for me the halfway house is Tyrrellspass and the Village Inn, an excellent hostelry run by the Pearson family.  We should be ashamed of the road from Kinnegad to Athlone.  It is no more than a glorified boreen and should be seen in that light.  In fairness to the local authority there, with the help of EC funds they built a most magnificent by-pass which does much to lower one's blood pressure on the testing journey from Dublin to Galway.  From there one travels to Ballinasloe and on to Galway via some very nice towns which have been destroyed by the condition of roads passing through them.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Padraig Flynn, announced the building of a by-pass at Leixlip which will circle Maynooth and on to Kilcock.  He said he expected it would be completed by the middle of this decade.  That would be a marvellous achievement.  While I am very critical of the Dublin-Galway road one of the greatest achievements on it is the motorway from Heuston station to Leixlip. Nobody can do as well as us as far as road building is concerned.  I am not a member of a local authority but I must pay tribute to the engineers and others who, when they get down to it, do a marvellous job on building the roads which are so urgently required.  The road developers, architects, engineers, builders and workers should be very proud of the outstanding roads they build.</P>
    <P>The Dublin-Galway road is an example of a pathetic effort at inter-connecting two major cities on a small island.  Nevertheless there is much to be said for the improvements that have been made to that road and, hopefully, further improvements will be made in the future. I do not wish to be critical, but, hopefully, I will be constructive.  In 1991, 70 years after our independence, we are still wrestling with problems of this nature. There should be an inter-connecting fast <Col N="352" /> highway between Galway and our capital city, between Cork and Dublin and between all the major cities and towns. The Dublin-Galway road is a test of endurance and patience, particularly at holiday time.  On holiday weekends there is usually a backup of traffic from the roundabout approaching Leixlip and even further back on the dual carriageway. This augurs very badly for our planning authorities.  I hope this Bill will solve that problem.</P>
    <P>I listened with great attention to Deputy Finucane's remarks on tourists and the need to improve our roads for tourists.  We should develop the roads for ourselves and if the tourists gain as a result, so be it.  We should look after our own needs in the first instance and if that is advantageous to anybody else, that is good.  To return to my exposition on the Dublin-Galway road, it must be hugely tragic for the people of Leixlip, Maynooth and Kilcock to see a continuous snake of traffic trundling through the villages day after day, hour after hour.  I wonder how in the name of God they put up with the traffic?  The proposed by-pass will give them some respite from the continuous flow of traffic.  I presume by the end of the century that work will have been carried out to by-pass villages and towns on the route and to straighten the road between Galway and Dublin.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the National Roads Authority could be asked to examine heavy vehicular traffic on our roads.  In fairness to truck drivers, it must be said they are very courteous.  I have been behind them at all hours of the night and, indeed, early in the morning.  I go regularly to the west as I have a small place beyond Spiddle in Ballinahowen where I go to fish and I also pursue my profession in the courts in Galway from time to time.  I know the road intimately.  I would often leave at 6 or 7 a.m. when going off on a fishing expedition.  Invariably one gets stuck behind a truck but the truck driver cannot get out of your way because there is nowhere to go.  However, the moment he gets the opportunity to pull in on the hard shoulder, which is a danger to himself, <Col N="353" /> he will inevitably do so.  I have to pay tribute to the professional truck drivers as I have had nothing but good experiences of them.  I have an impatient nature and I like to get on with driving and that I think, reflects the view of many drivers. The National Roads Authority, and the authorities in general, might examine the possibility of allocating certain times for heavy trucks to use the roads.  I am not certain that if one were to suggest that trucks could use the roads only between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. it would add a huge additional cost to the transport of goods &mdash; which would be a problem &mdash; but it could be of advantage to the drivers themselves because they would have the opportunity of driving on less cluttered roads.  It would also be advantageous to the ordinary road user.  Heavy vehicles also cause huge traffic jams in the city.  I know this is not the truck driver's fault because he has to deliver his goods on time but this causes huge problems for the ordinary motorist.  I do not know what the solution to the problem is.</P>
    <P>I expect that everybody has the right to use the roads 24 hours a day but I understand in other countries, not least of all Germany, that certain times are set aside for heavy vehicles to use the roads.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority will be responsible for the national roads network. I have a modest proposal which might sound rather strange to others and I admit that it may be beyond the realms of ordinary reason.  The railway line follows the easiest means of access in a straight line between two points and I suggest that highways could run alongside it on each side of the line.  Indeed, the Dublin-Galway railway line runs in as near a straight line as possible between Dublin and Galway and roads constructed on each side of the line would have the following advantages.  It would be much easier to transport goods on the railway line.  Acquisition of land on either side of the tracks would be easy because it is inevitably in the hands of the rail authority, CIE.  Construction costs would be obviated by the railway's ability to bring goods and materials to the point of construction at any given time.  It would <Col N="354" /> have the effect also of upgrading the permanent way.  This is just an idea, it is probably totally outside the realms of reasonable thinking in terms of both planning and costs but perhaps it could be looked at by the engineers and planners &mdash; if they ever bother to examine the contributions made in the House, least of all my modest offering &mdash; and perhaps the Minister might respond to it.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Jacob rightly pointed out, we have a magnificent road from Donnybrook to Bray and beyond.  The dual carriageway which by-passes Shankill has been a huge success and is a great achievement.  However, the advantages of such a highway become irrelevant if one is travelling from Wicklow to Dublin. The road from the beautiful county goes to nowhere because the carriageway suddenly peters out at Donnybrook and one is into a massive traffic jam from Donnybrook into the heart of the city.  The time gained on the dual carriageway is suddenly lost when one is stuck in traffic jams right into the city.  I do not know whether the planning authorities can confront this huge problem.  There would be massive expense involved in the compulsory purchase of lands on either side of the road from Donnybrook through Leeson Street into the city.  I would certainly like to know if there is any solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>I will plug two problems in my constituency resulting from the dual carriageway. There is a lovely little community of long time residents in Vale View, Shankill.  The dual carriageway runs at the back of these houses.  The local authority might examine the possibility of breaking the sound of traffic on the dual carriageway by planting trees because I understand trees have the effect of absorbing sound, particularly the noise produced by traffic.  I would appreciate it very much if Dublin County Council would examine the possibility of planting trees to lessen the sound of traffic on the dual carriageway which passes the backs of houses which were there a long time before the dual carriageway was even thought of.</P>
    <P>Another matter of local moment arises <Col N="355" /> from the construction of the ring road. The matter relates more particularly to a problem raised by the Leopardstown Residents Association, the southern cross route motorway scheme.  In a letter dated 23 October to myself, the residents association sent a copy of their submission to the inquiry into the southern cross motorway.  There is a series of reasonable objections to the main recommendation, the exclusion of Brewery Road and Leopardstown Road as part of the Dublin orbital road.  The association offered an alternative, the completion of the south-east motorway linking Sandyford and Shankill.  The association have asked for my support and I have no doubt that they have also asked other Dáil Deputies and local representatives for their support.</P>
    <P>Again there has to be a balance made between advantage and displacement. Should a first-class route be built to the disadvantage of a local community?  In this particular instance I should respectfully say that if the road as intended goes ahead many hundreds of people will be disadvantaged as a direct result.</P>
    <P>The residents association itself represents some 350 householders residing in Leopardstown Estate and on Brewery Road, approximately 1,000 people.  The proposals as outlined in the southern cross route motorway plan together with other ancillary works will mean that a motorway will extend from Belfast Road to Murphystown roundabout and then become a dual carriageway to the junction of Brewery Road and Leopardstown Road.  It is then proposed that all traffic from that roadway would divide between single carriageways on Brewery Road and Leopardstown Road.  Those two roads run through and around the Leopardstown estate.  While there are future plans to complete the motorway by linking up the Shankill by-pass by way of the south-eastern motorway, the problem is the lack of a firm date for the latter work and the probability that the residents could find themselves suffering intolerably for some 15 to 20 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> Apparently the county council witnesses at the inquiry referred to the economic advantages of the present proposals and the beneficial effects to many areas by way of improved air quality and amelioration of traffic noise.  The residents will be forced to pay for all of the benefits outlined by the county council witnesses. Needless to say, house values have decreased considerably on Brewery Road, and the environment will be very seriously affected.</P>
    <P>Several very serious problems will be faced as a direct result of the proposal: unacceptable noise levels; severe access problems; an increase in foul air; the vibration to houses; permanent loss of pleasant visual amenities; devaluation of property; and severe disruption to normal daily living standards.  I think it is fair to say that the degree to which all of those problems will affect residents can be put under two headings: first, those residing in Brewery Road will be affected by all seven problems I have just listed, and, second, those who reside in Leopardstown estate will be affected by severe access problems and, to varying degrees, by unacceptable noise levels, an increase in foul air, devaluation of property and severe disruption to normal daily living standards &mdash; depending, of course, on their location in the estate.  It is a lottery, it depends on where one lives in the estate as to whether the road proposal will have an effect.</P>
    <P>My own experience, which I think is also the experience of the people in the Leoparadstown area, is that the most severe effects will be felt on Brewery Road.  Many of the residents there have made individual or group objections and the Leopardstown Residents' Association support them in their stand.</P>
    <P>I do not have to go into great detail on the submission to the inquiry.  It is on record, it stands and I support the residents in their campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the Deputy's support in this regard, too.  It is <Col N="357" /> not unreasonable that the recommendations of the residents' association should receive a fair hearing and that the association should receive respect for the integrity of those whom they represent. All that the people of the locality want for themselves and their families is quiet enjoyment of their own property. It seems to be not unreasonable in the circumstances that that, as a very basic minimum, should be offered to them.</P>
      <P>I have been studying <i>Ireland &mdash; Road Development 1989 to 1993,</i> an operational programme submitted to the Commission of the European Community on 30 March 1989.  The programme was published by the Stationery Office and can be bought through the Government Publications Sales Office.  It is, of course, under the copyright of the Government of Ireland.  The document is very worth while as well as being technically complex.  I do not have the confidence to deal with much of what is contained in the document nor do I understand much of the content. However, the programme deals with matters that can be understood by the ordinary person and it is couched in very simple language.</P>
      <P>There are three headings in that document which are of enormous importance to the future development of our roads. I have no doubt that the new National Roads Authority will take particular account of several features that will be required in the development of national roads.  The first fact that would need to be taken into account is environment impact, which I have just outlined in relation to a particular constituency problem in Dún Laoghaire.  Another factor would be that of road safety and the third would be the energy expended by road traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already said, roads can have either a beneficial or a harmful effect on the environment.  Traffic congestion in urban areas and the encroachment of traffic into residential districts can result in increased numbers of traffic accidents, air pollution, noise, vibration and general visual intrusion.  Road improvements can have the beneficial effect of removing <Col N="358" /> heavy traffic from town centres and of facilitating the fuller use and enjoyment of the natural environment.</P>
    <P>As I have already pointed out in relation to the Dublin-Galway road, many towns on national roads are adversely affected by very heavy traffic flowing through them.  Traffic reduces the attractiveness of those towns for residents, shoppers and tourists and has a bad environment effect in terms of pollution and noise.  There is a very simple solution to the adverse effect on such towns which is, of course, a by-pass.  By-pass routes are being constructed.  I do realise that here, in the final analysis, we are talking about money.  Unfortunately, at the moment we are going through a rather difficult time economically and perhaps there is not as much cash available as we would like to have.  I understand there is general recognition of the need to have our roads updated and upgraded, which is what this Bill is all about.  In ten years time, hopefully the benefits from the establishment of the National Roads Authority will be evident in a physical sense in our having better roads.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the improvement of roads is the effects on roads safety, road accidents and deaths. Identification of the causes of road accidents is extremely difficult because of the multiplicity of factors involved and the interaction between all of those factors.  Speed is one, if not the main, cause of road deaths in this country.  Drink driving also has an important bearing on the number of road fatalities as have the construction and configuration of our roads and people's misjudgment when driving on bad roads.  All of those interact and it is difficult to put one's finger on the reason that so many of our people are killed annually on our roads.  On average there are some 500 people killed annually on our roads whereas, since the tragedies in the North of Ireland began in 1969, there have been in excess of 2,500 people killed there.  One could draw a rough comparison only by taking the figure of 500 annual fatalities on our roads here and <Col N="359" /> multiplying it by 20.  Yet there does not seem to be a flicker of concern expressed any longer about the number of people killed on our roads.  We must continue to kill ourselves and appear to do less and less about it.</P>
    <P>I know that the National Roads Safety Campaign and the people who run that do their best but we do not listen to them; we continue to massacre ourselves. Perhaps in 100 years time, when our roads will have been improved out of all recognition &mdash; when no doubt we will then have different modes of transport &mdash; future generations looking to ours will say to themselves; &ldquo;What did they do with themselves?  Why did they do it? Why did they not listen?&rdquo;  Nonetheless we continue unabated to kill ourselves annually and do not appear to be able to do anything about it.  Neither do we appear to have the will to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>The whole matter rests with us and our general attitude to driving.  I should say I take a drink myself.  In this respect, I should like to congratulate the Government and the Garda on their drink-driving campaign at Christmas time.  I regret that they do not engage in this campaign continuously but apparently they do not. There is, therefore tremendous pressure on drivers not to drink and drive at Christmas time.  There is no doubt that drink-driving has a huge bearing on road traffic accidents and fatalities.  Those of us who take a drink know that, after two or three, no matter what anybody may say, one's judgment becomes impaired; one becomes either euphoric or depressed, according to its effects.  Of course, the obvious answer is if you drive do not drink.  It is as simple as that.  I know it can take the joy out of social functions but the answer to that is to take a taxi, if one can.</P>
    <P>With the greatest respect to taxi drivers &mdash; I am a Dubliner and many taxi drivers are Dubliners and are good people &mdash; to suggest there are sufficient taxis available in this city at Christmas time is simply untrue and not reasonable, as is the contention that the additional 100 licences <Col N="360" /> will be sufficient to rectify that position. At Christmas time, during holiday seasons and so on, there are simply not sufficient numbers of taxis available at night.  This results in people queueing at taxi ranks, sometimes in the most appalling weather conditions.  I do not know what is the solution to that problem.</P>
    <P>As an aside, I should like to see a standardised type of taxi here, in other words, that their appearance would be uniform.  While that may sound very conventional, conservative and dull, if such were the case everybody would know exactly what a taxi looked like.  While we should be concerned about tourists &mdash; although we should look after ourselves first &mdash; then, for goodness sake, let us have clearly identifiable taxis.</P>
    <P>To revert to the matter of road safety, an interesting statistic is that in an 1984 review it was discovered that 42 per cent of accident fatalities and 31 per cent of injuries were recorded on national routes, representing 6 per cent of the total length of our national roads network and 35 per cent of all road travel.  It was said that that gave serious cause for concern and indicated that there will be greater benefit when road improvements are effected on those parts of our roads network.  Under the heading of Energy on page 23 this document entitled &ldquo;Ireland &mdash; Road Development 1989 to 1993&rdquo; had this to say:</P>
    <P>Road transport was estimated in 1981 to account for 17 per cent of total energy consumption.  Road design characteristics, such as gradient, curvature and operating speed, are the principal factors relating to roads which have an effect on fuel consumption.</P>
    <P>That makes a lot of sense and is a matter of logic.  When there are good roads inevitably one travels faster, even though there is a national speed limit of 55 miles per hour.  Of course, higher speeds also mean one uses more fuel.  Equally, driving on bad urban or city roads, when one is constantly stopping and starting, will have a significant bearing on petrol consumption. In time, when the National <Col N="361" /> Roads Authority obtain their objective, that is decent roadways and highways, perhaps they would examine the possibility of increasing the speed limit from the present 55 miles per hour to something between, say, 65 and 70 miles per hour.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the bad standard of driving here is related to the lack of decent roads. Here I am as guilty as anybody else but, as a nation, we have much to learn about driving standards.  Perhaps a comprehensive education programme on the correct usage of multi-lane highways, main roads and secondary roads would be of some help.  As an example of how wrong things can go for an average driver like myself &mdash; I should say I am not guilty of this fault &mdash; it appears that traffic lights have become a test of nerve with the fellow who drives through the red light appearing to proclaim to the world he is a macho man or whatever.  I have seen many accidents occurring as a direct result of people breaking traffic lights. People appear to ignore them nowadays, seeing them as an obstruction, as something to be avoided rather than observed. In addition, it appears that the green and amber lights have no significance for drivers any longer with red being a test of one's nerve; if one can leave the fellow travelling from the right on a green light in a state of nervous devastation, so much the better.  Perhaps an education programme on the proper observance of traffic lights at road traffic junctions and driving on multi-lane main roads would be of considerable advantage to all road users.</P>
    <P>I welcome this very comprehensive Bill.  Hopefully its provisions will lead to an efficient roads system here.  I might make one final plug in relation to buildings in cities, something the National Roads Authority might examine.  When new buildings are constructed, particularly in cities, there should be a compulsory requirement that underground parking be provided, sufficient to accommodate the needs of people working or living in those buildings.</P>

      <P>It was intriguing to listen <Col N="362" /> to Deputy Andrews as he took us on a very interesting trip around the country, missing not a single bend, pothole, tree or bush.  It was good to listen to and I hope it will be noted by our planners.</P>
      <P>The condition of our roads is a matter of enormous public interest, yet today there are very few people in the public gallery.  This issue takes up 75 per cent of time at meetings of local authorities, residents' associations, Macra na Feirme and the IFA.  The road system has simply broken down.  Some roads were described recently as owing more to character than to engineering or technology. This is an apt description of many of our roads.  On a recent radio programme Joe Duffy described a tour of the potholes in Cavan, giving a graphic account of the manoeuvring required and the obvious consequences for the motor vehicle and its driver.  That this issue should preoccupy the nation is an indication of the disgraceful state of the roads.  I do not want to blame any Minister or Government.  Probably we are all responsible and the public have a certain responsibility as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried that this Bill is likely to be hailed as the panacea for our transport problems for the foreseeable future. People will also expect it to resolve existing transport problems.  The primary function of the National Roads Authority is to provide national primary routes to the highest possible standard as quickly as possible.  If they are to be beset by the same kind of problems as the local authorities in this regard, the same bureaucracy, red tape and stop-go attitude of the Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment, ultimately the Authority will find themselves in the same position as the local authorities, who talked about the issue for ten or 12 years and were unable to do anything about it.  We had national road plans in the past which were carefully worked out and costed.  By the time money was offered to carry out the proposed work, the schemes had to be reevaluated and updated and new tenders had to be sought.  The National Roads <Col N="363" /> Authority will not be successful unless the financial wherewithal is provided.</P>
    <P>A road plan will be insufficient unless it encompasses a national transport plan for the foreseeable future which includes road and rail transport, ports and airports, both local and international, and the interlinking of all those services to provide a safe, secure and adequate service for the next 50 years or so.  We should be able to plan roads for at least 50 years. Some of the roads planned 500 years ago are still in existence and carrying traffic, and the volume has increased beyond all expectations.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of finance, we must not think that the Authority by themselves will be able to solve all our road transport problems.  The Authority may be a means of getting extra finance from the EC to target specifically national primary routes.  In the past all those targets have been subject to the comings and goings of Governments.  It makes a minimum of four or five years to plan a road network.  If that planning is not ongoing and the necessary expertise is not kept in place, it will be a total waste of time.  It will be ten years before we see any beneficial effect from the setting up of the Authority.  We have experienced that problem in the past.</P>
    <P>How many times have we sought to bring forward plans to alleviate traffic problems only to be told that the designs are only at the drawing board stage, that the plans have not been reviewed or examined by the Department or that the plans have been submitted to the Department and referred back to the local authority for further consideration?  Another stock reply is that money is not available. We may be told in reply to parliamentary questions that the local authority in question have received from the Department funds which are sufficient to meet &ldquo;ongoing requirements&rdquo;.  Will that happen in relation to the new Authority?  Will it be said again and again that the Minister has made an allocation sufficient to meet the Authority's needs?  Will it appear that the Minister, after considerable soul searching and extractions from various other <Col N="364" /> Departments, has salvaged a sufficient amount of money to allocate to the Authority, out of the goodness of his heart? This makes people feel that the reception of such funds is somewhat akin to winning the national lottery.  Money is required on an ongoing basis.  We all know that moneys are allocated and we are familiar with the jargon, but when we use that jargon with the general public and tell them what the Minister has given to the local authorities, they ask why they cannot see any results.  We then have to explain the minute details and how a specific amount of the allocation for a constituency, county or local authority area has been earmarked by the Minister for certain areas.  When we strip away all the wrapping we find out exactly what is provided by way of funding.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the need for a properly co-ordinated national transport policy.  Despite the provisions contained in the Bill I do not think it will carry through such a policy to its logical conclusion. There should be a national roads network from north to south and east to west with adequate interlinks in various places.  We also need to ensure that our ports and airports are able to deal with any increase in traffic which will result from the development of our motorways. As Deputy Andrews said, the construction of a motorway in a particular area merely means that the traffic can move quickly from point A to point B and that there are queues of traffic at point B.</P>
    <P>The long queues of traffic along the quays in Dublin every morning of the week are an indication of the problems experienced by people who wish to use our ferries, be they drivers of heavy vehicles which use roll-on-roll-off ferries or tourists.  We need to have a proper plan and adequate funding for improving access to ports.  Consideration should also be given to how fast traffic can get out of a port so that there is no congestion in the area.  The huge ferries which can be built nowadays would resolve traffic problems in this area better than a tunnel similar to the Channel Tunnel.  Such ferries could be operated between this <Col N="365" /> country and the Continent on a low cost basis.  Roll-on roll-off ferries would be an easy, cheap and efficient means of transport for the multitude of people who travel to and from this country.  The people who designed the Channel Tunnel will soon realise that they have not solved all the problems when they have to deal with the traffic congestion at both ends of the tunnel.  Our regional airports also need to be interlinked in some way with the national primary and national secondary routes.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the conflict which may arise from the establishment of the National Roads Authority.  I hope the establishment of this Authority will not further pauperise local authorities who are responsible for the maintenance of county roads.  One of the major problems facing local authorities at present is the condition of county roads.  Even though people criticise the state of the national primary routes they rightly criticise the state of the county roads even more.  I know the Minister sitting opposite has ample evidence to support my claim in this respect.  The road from Rathangan to Edenderry is a case in point.  I am sure the Minister travels this road regularly. Driving this road has been compared to a journey on the high seas in very strong gales.  Parts of the road have now subsided to such an extent that motorists who do not travel with due care and caution run the risk of their cars turning over.</P>

      <P>I have looked at the issue of discretionary grants and I have to say I am worried about the trend in the disbursement of these grants.  It is clear that discretionary grants are exactly what they imply &mdash; discretionary.  The Minister has the discretion to give a greater amount of grants to some local authorities.  I suppose this is only right but I ask him to expand the concept of discretion somewhat and adopt a little more discretion when he is considering the position in County Kildare.  I do not mean any disrespect to my good friends in County Offaly but the population of County Kildare is expanding at a much faster rate than the population in County Offaly. County Kildare is next door to Dublin city and county where one third of the national population live.  Every day 80 per cent of the motoring population travel through some part of County Kildare in order to get to our capital city.</P>

      <P>Yes, and County Wicklow which is also next door to Dublin. The Minister should show some discretion in the allocation of discretionary grants and discriminate in favour of the people of County Kildare.  He should let us know that he realises how badly off we are, as he travels through the county on his way to and from his constituency.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews gave a fine dissertation on the state of the Dublin-Galway road.  Tourists from Britain, France and elsewhere remember this road because of the huge traffic jams on the way into Dublin at Kildare and Maynooth.  Public representatives have been asking the Department for more than 20 years to build a by-pass.  While thankfully this is finally being built I believe another by-pass will have to be built as the problem has overtaken the solution.  I do not mean any disrespect to the design team.  I should like to compliment all design teams, particularly those in County Kildare who have done a tremendous job under much pressure and with insufficient staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to accident black <Col N="367" /> spots which I hope this Bill will eliminate. Strictly speaking the development of motorways and modern interchanges should eliminate all accident black spots. However, accidents occur almost on a daily basis at the interchange on the N4 at Palmerstown and the interchange on the N7 near the Red Cow Inn.  In recent years design teams have produced a modern road network which was alleged by the Minister in reply to a parliamentary question to conform to international safety standards.  Yet, day after day, night after night we have created a black spot of our own.  Modern technology has created black spots.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The one B767 aircraft which Aer Lingus has planned to operate on the Los Angeles service in 1991 has been sub-leased by the company to another airline until such time as the company requires it for the service.  The airline has not taken delivery of a second B767 aircraft which <Col N="368" /> it had also proposed to acquire for the service at a later stage.</P>
      <P>The airline announced last year its decision to defer the inauguration of the Ireland-Los Angeles service in 1991.  This arose as a result of the impact of the Gulf War on travel abroad by US citizens, the weak dollar and recession in the US.</P>
      <P>Following a review of their plans for trans-Atlantic operations for 1992, Aer Lingus have confirmed to me that they are proposing to again defer the inauguration of the Ireland-Los Angeles service until 1993.  This arises as a result of the increasing competition between US and British carriers on trans-Atlantic routes and the soft market conditions in the US. These are having a significant impact on the demand for direct services between Ireland and the US and on the economics of Aer Lingus trans-Atlantic services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my response in this House on 5 November, columns 16 and 17, of the Official Report, when I explained that in my formal review of the operation of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, I had consulted with all relevant interests including representatives of the independent radio sector and the print media.</P>
      <P>The concerns of independent radio operators including their concerns in relation to news and current affairs coverage were some of the many issues considered during the course of the review. My review addresses the problems of the independent radio sector in relation to the supply of national and international news.</P>
      <P>The review has been completed and is currently being studied by Government. I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on consequent legislative changes as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to issue a White Paper on Broadcasting. Over the past six months I have been engaged in discussions with all of the interested parties. I have met RTE, the Independent Radio and Television Commission, the National Newspapers of Ireland, TV3 Consortium, Century, local radio interests, film makers of Ireland, the advertising industry and the major advertisers.  I have received submissions from many parties. There has been a public debate in the press, and on radio and television.  The purpose of a White Paper is to stimulate debate and it is evident that a very full debate has taken place on broadcasting. Further opportunity for debate will arise in the Dail and Seanad when the proposed legislation is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My review has taken account of <Col N="371" /> developments elsewhere in Europe and I intend to publish this review as soon as possible.  Based on my review and on nearly all of the representations I have received I am convinced that action must be taken.</P>
    <P>In relation to the portion of the question on the telecommunications sector, there are no proposals under consideration at the moment for the sale of shares in Telecom Éireann or for its privatisation in any other manner. Accordingly, the question of a White Paper on this matter does not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his long reply which I suspect he will have reason to regret but I will let that be on his head for the future.  Did the Minister notice that I used the phrase &ldquo;media policy&rdquo; rather than broadcasting policy to emphasise that one section of media policy cannot be separated from other sections and that one section cannot be judged in isolation?  In view of the complexity of this matter and the very many fundamental questions which arise, such as monopoly versus competition, the use of public money for commercial purposes, alternative news agencies and so on would the Minister, even at this late stage, consider that a White Paper would be the way forward because it is becoming utterly impossible to get an impartial view of these matters from all the biased sources who are putting forward their vested interests?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that even after 20 White Papers it would still be difficult to make up one's mind, that is what I am in the process of doing.  That is the job of Government.  When you talk to all the interested parties I agree it is difficult to come to a conclusion because you will hear one thing one day and another the next.  It is a very difficult and complex subject.  If I were sitting on the Opposition benches I would probably be looking for a White Paper too, but I am not.</P>

      <P>I have to take some action in this area and I propose to do so as soon as is practicable.  Incidentally, the purpose of a White Paper is to stimulate some discussion publicly.  I am sure it did not go unnoticed by the Deputy that in the past month alone there have been 14 editorials on the subject of broadcasting and, indeed, one newspaper group has had six editorials in seven days on the subject.  Maastricht has not got a fraction of that coverage.</P>

It is difficult for the Deputy's party to come to any conclusion on this matter because of the various approaches and complex issues being put to them.  For my part, I have to come to some conclusion and I propose to do that.</P>

      <P>Bearing in mind the Minister's reply that he had discussions with all interested parties would he not think the proper course would be to introduce a White Paper to enable Members of this House to discuss the future of broadcasting in view of the fact that present legislation is a creature of this Parliament?  We should be allowed an opportunity to try to unscramble what has been put before us.  Does he not think that the fact that this topic has been the subject of many editorials is a fair indication that there is concern outside as to the way broadcasting is going in this country?</P>

      <P>The debate has been going on for three years.  I do not want to be in any way provocative but I get the feeling that those people seeking a White Paper are simply afraid to come to some conclusion on the very tricky issues, both politically and broadcasting wise, which are before all of us in the broadcasting area.  I have four clear objectives on broadcasting.  I want to make sure RTE are strong, I want to ensure that the independent privately owned broadcasting sector can progress and develop, I want to ensure that the newspaper industry is protected because it has its own difficulties with imports and that the independent production sector gets some additional work because there are good employment prospects in that area.  I have four clear objectives for broadcasting and I would not mind hearing some objectives from the other side of the House.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>I am in the course of finalising my consideration of proposals for the liberalisation of the bus industry and I expect to be in a position to submit detailed proposals for a general scheme of a Bill to the Government shortly.  I expect it will be the new year before any such Bill is brought before the House.</P>
      <P>One of the major objectives of my proposals will be to improve the levels and quality of bus services available to the general public and to introduce competition into the bus industry on a sensible and orderly basis.  The issues involved are complex and I have put in place liaison arrangements between my Department and the various interested parties, including the trade unions, in order to elicit the widest possible range of views in relation to the future development of competition within the industry. I receive regular progress reports on discussions with all these parties.  It is my intention to meet with the trade unions at the appropriate time.  There are no proposals for the privatisation of Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> The arrangements which I have made for the provision of late night bus services over the Christmas period are in the nature of a test and experiment in relation to private sector participation in the provision of scheduled bus services. They are also, of course, a response to the growing demand for alternative late night transport over the Christmas period, particularly in view of the drink-driving crackdown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this promised legislation, will the Minister outline a specific time-table for it?  Will the licensing authority be the Department or some new authority?  Will the Minister give an assurance to the House that he will avoid the type of free-for-all there was in Britain which resulted in fewer people using public transport in certain instances?  Will he ensure that there is uniformity of competition, so that Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus will not be unfairly undermined?</P>

I am thinking of another authority, but I ask the Deputy not to hold me to that because I have not finalised my thinking on it.  I agree with the Deputy with regard to the position in the UK which I studied carefully.  I am not interested in buses racing each other to bus stops and acting like pirates.  I am interested in the orderly, sensible, phased introduction of competition.  That is the objective of the proposed legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply on 14 May 1991 to a similar question by Deputy Currie, Official Report, Volume 408, No. 4, column 878, one of the major reasons I rejected Telecom Éireann's original proposals for timing local calls at five minutes intervals peak and ten minutes off peak, was my concern that the groups mentioned by the Deputy might be adversely affected by the proposed changes.</P>
      <P>As I also indicated in that reply, I am mindful of the problem referred to by the Deputy and I have ensured that an overall reduction of 8 per cent will take place in the national telephone bill.  This means that £48 million in savings will be passed on to the consumer.</P>
      <P>I agreed to the timing intervals for local calls which will take effect on 15 January 1992.  They are quite generous at a unit charge for a quarter hour for weekday peak time calls and a half hour for all other local calls.  When considered against the reduction in trunk call charges and the expansion of the local call areas the vast majority of subscribers should experience a significant reduction in bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> As I pointed out also in my reply on 14 May a number of charitable organisations avail of the Freefone 1800 service.  This service is charged independent of the ordinary telephone service and the introduction of local call timing has no effect on the charges.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern for the groups he mentions and it was precisely because of this that I rejected the Telecom proposal and extended the times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 8, 20, 26, 29 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The conclusions about Ireland's relative peripherality in the Europe 2000 report referred to by the Deputy help underline the need for special provisions for peripheral regions.  As Deputies are probably aware, the Government have already undertaken a range of initiatives to develop high quality, low cost transport and communications links with our trading partners, including the £800 million operational programme for peripherality co-funded by the EC and due for completion by 1994.  It involves major investment in our primary roads, airports, seaports and public transport systems; liberalisation of air transport policies resulting in reduced fares, and much expanded services to our main markets; development of a state-of-the-art telecommunications system; ongoing discussions with the UK, and at EC level, about the importance of rail and road links between the channel tunnel and British ports serving Ireland; and an application for assistance towards investment in expanded transport services between Ireland and the Continent which is currently under consideration in Brussels.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister envisage setting up a commission to report on the consequences of the Channel Tunnel to this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got a commission in mind.  I will, however, be watching it very carefully.  This report acknowledges the post-tunnel situation but it also acknowledges and supports the types of initiatives that are necessary for Ireland to reduce peripherality.  I have an action programme to reduce peripherality. I do not see the need for a <Col N="382" /> commission as such but I will certainly see what other ways I can study the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the further tilting of the balance against Ireland and against the west arising out of the Channel Tunnel and associated developments, and in view of the fact that no Euro route gets further west than Kinnegad on the major structure that the Minister has been talking about, would the Minister not consider seeking Structural Funds for the immediate upgrading of the Sligo, Westport and Galway lines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am committed to investment in the railways, including investment in the Sligo line.  Iarnród Éireann are given a specific allocation to maintain the railway network and it is a matter for Iarnród Éireann in the first instance to decide on the allocation of that within their budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a matter of acute personal embarrassment and some humiliation to the Minister that out of the total package of the peripherality programme, 1989-93, not one penny was sought for rail links outside the Dublin area?  Is it not the case that the EC transport commission turned back the first submission because it was not an integrated transport plan as it had no reference to any thing other than roads in the first instance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 19, 31 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly acknowledged the role of the railway system in our national transport infrastructure.  However, investment in the railways must proceed against the background of the availability of State resources.</P>
      <P>State support for railways over the years has been very significant.  For example, since 1980 total State day-to-day subvention for rail services provided by CIE has amounted to over £940 million. In addition, capital investment of over £228 million has been made in the railways by CIE in the same period bringing the total to almost £1.2 billion in just over a decade.  In view of this and the future very substantial investment required, I would like to take this opportunity to announce that I have decided to conduct a full and urgent strategic study of the future investment needs and resources available for our railway systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as investment in commuter rail services for the Dublin area is concerned, I have approved investment by CIE of up to £18 million on the provision of new railcars for use on a number of suburban lines in the Dublin area.  Iarnród Éireann is currently examining a number of options for the acquisition of these new railcars.  I expect to receive proposals in this regard from the board shortly.  This investment will enable Iarnród Éireann <Col N="385" /> to improve the quality of their suburban rail service in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>In addition, a number of possible public transport investment proposals for the Dublin area, including the re-opening of the former Harcourt Street line, improvement of commuter rail services for the west of the city and the development of a light rail network to serve the Dublin area generally, are under consideration by my Department at present. Progress on such proposals will depend on, among other things, the availability of finance from a range of sources including EC Structural Funds and private sector funding also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that what is needed is not a strategic study but a commitment that on all inter-city routes out of Dublin he will seek to upgrade the lines to a continuous welded rail track &mdash; as opposed to a jointed track &mdash; which can cater for speeds of 90 miles per hour and, for example, on the Dublin-Galway route, reduce travelling time from two and a half hours to two hours?  What is required is an additional £5 million over ten years.  Will the Minister now give that commitment to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be £5 million per annum in addition to very substantial sums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to £45 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's view that there is a need to upgrade the inter-city routes particularly.  They have increasingly to compete with substantially improved roads, motorway standards in many cases.  The railway also has to compete with cheaper and cheaper bus fares between inter-city routes.  It has a difficult job to do and does require substantial investment in the entire system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if the investment in the rail network will extend to the Cork-Cobh line in view of the fact that in recent days two trips had to be cancelled because a generator in use on the Cork-Cobh line had to be put into use on the Cork-Dublin line? Students, who had purchased commuter tickets, had to transfer to the bus service and pay an extra fare in the process.  May I further ask the Minister if he has had discussions with his colleagues, the Ministers for Energy and Labour, to prepare contingency plans in case there is an ESB strike in the coming weeks?  Such a strike would disrupt the Dublin DART system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cork-Cobh line will be included in the strategic study which I propose to undertake.  It would be of help if CIE decided to allocate some of the new rail coaches, which I have authorised, to this line but the House and the country should be aware of one fact, that is, that there are 1,500 miles of railway track, 60 per cent, or 900 miles, of <Col N="387" /> which is more than 50 years old.  Deputies on all sides of the House would like us to examine coolly as a matter of urgency the scale of investment required and where it should be directed.  That is an issue which this or any future Government will face for some time and it is not one on which we should play politics given the scale of investment required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that there is an urgent necessity to make a proper allocation to meet the needs of commuters living within a 50 mile radius of Dublin city who require regular rail services?  Is he now prepared to seek the Structural Funds which are available to develop a proper commuter rail service within a 50 miles radius of Dublin city which would be of benefit to all concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said publicly many times that I am fully committed to developing an urban rail system, preferably a light rail system, for the city and county of Dublin as a matter of urgency, but the House must not delude itself.  EC Structural Funds will only go so far.  I have indicated the size, the extent and the scale of the problem and that there is a need to look, strategically, at railway systems before committing Irish taxpayers to investing in the railway system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Irish Rail are cannibalising some provincial lines to provide tracks which are needed in other areas, and they have to borrow carriages and trains from Northern Ireland Railways and that the speed limits have been reduced on most lines, in particular on the Sligo line, for safety reasons?  Why is it that when trains are travelling at a faster rate everywhere else in the world the complete opposite is happening here?  The last thing we need is a further strategic study.  Would the Minister therefore stand up in this House to tell us that if we are to have a light rail <Col N="388" /> system in Dublin private sector investment will be required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling us, for the first time, that if we are to have a light rail system in the city private enterprise will have to have an input?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would envisage some private sector investment in such a system if I can attract it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat to the Deputy that during the past ten years the Irish taxpayer has invested £1.2 billion in the railway system and that is the reason I am looking for private sector investment for any light rail system which might emerge in the future.  Speed limits have been imposed for safety reasons.  The trains are, however, safe.  Irish Rail recover one-third of the cost from passengers while the other two-thirds is made up by the taxpayer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>To follow up the Minister's earlier reply in response to a question on commuter services in the greater Dublin area, I should say, first, that I welcome his commitment in the matter but I was concerned, when he mentioned specific areas, that he did not mention an undertaking which he gave to me in the House in November last year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the problems of the railways are because of the total under-investment in the line? Will the Minister recognise that the capital investment in the line reduces maintenance costs and, therefore, that it is good, sound economics?  Is the Minister aware that there is a demand for using the railway line in Kildare, the Maynooth-Dublin section, but that there is massive overcrowding and breakdowns because of the state of the line, engines and carriages? Has he any proposals to give a better service at that section where there is a public demand?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bring the latter matter to the attention of Iarnród Éireann because it is an operational problem. With regard to investment, I think that a sum of £228 million over the decade is clearly very substantial on top of the £940 million by way of subvention.</P>

      <P>I have extended the remit of the expert working group, which was established to assess and report on the most suitable public transport options for the former Harcourt Street line and the Tallaght area, to include examination of the possibility of developing a light rail system for Dublin.  This work will include an examination of the public transport requirements of areas such as Finglas and Ballymun.  In this context, consideration of a recently completed preliminary feasibility study carried out by Aer Rianta and CIE into a rail link to Dublin Airport will form part of the group's work.  In the case of the Harcourt Street line, I expect to receive a report from the expert group shortly.</P>
      <P>A number of important issues must be evaluated comprehensively including the overall network of operations and the financing of the investment involved. These matters are being examined in detail by the working group which I have asked to report to me as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Membership of the expert working group comprises representatives of the Departments of Tourism, Transport and Communications, Environment and Finance, Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council, the Dublin Transportation Task Force, Iarnród Éireann and Bus Atha Cliath.</P>

      <P>Ten years ago, in the constituency of Dublin South, I was very interested in that line and I am still very interested in it.  It would be very easy for me to set a date and to say I would provide funds.  However, I cannot do that because I have not yet located a source of funds to develop that line.

For some months now the Minister has had a proposal on his desk from a major consortium of international <Col N="397" /> interests, headed by a former boss of CIE, to provide a light rail system for Dublin.  Will he give support to this private sector investment proposal so that he can find the finance which he says is not available at present?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister seriously telling the House that a major integrated public transport policy is dependent on a role for private enterprise?  Is there any likelihood of a private enterprise running a public transport system, a light rail system, for Dublin?  What are his alternative plans?  Will he agree that, since a decision has been taken to scrap the eastern by-pass, the £300 million which was available for roads could now be transferred to building the infrastructure for a light rail system in Dublin city?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any antipathy to the private sector investing in public transport if I can attract them to such an enterprise.  As I said, the major international groups who expressed an interest in helping us to develop our light rail system in Dublin have all said it is contingent on major EC Structural Funds.  I have been to Brussels to meet Commissioners to discuss the possibility of locating such funds and I will continue the search.  It is not a matter of depending on private funds, it depends on very substantial public funds, mainly from the European Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility of introducing and increasing competition in telecommunications services is kept under continuous review by me.  At present I have received no firm proposals for the provision of a competing service in the mobile area.</P>
      <P>A new digital mobile radio telephone service known as GSM, Global Standard for Mobile communications, is just now emerging on world markets.  This will permit subscribers to use their mobile phones anywhere across Europe without technical difficulty.  As part of a co-ordinated pan-European introduction of GSM, Telecom Éireann plan to offer this service, initially on a limited basis, in 1993.</P>
      <P>I would not rule out the possibility of licensing, in time, the provision of GSM services to compete with Telecom Éireann.  While I have no plans at present to license a competitor to Telecom Éireann, I am empowered under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, to grant such licences and, as I have indicated, I am keeping this matter under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company applied in late 1989 for the restoration of the special subvention arrangements in relation to the company which were terminated with effect from 30 June 1987. Under those arrangements financial support had previously been made available by CIE to the company in respect of the provision of public transport services in north east Donegal.  In the period covered by the Deputy's question, namely 1 April 1981 to 30 June 1987 a total amount of £1.8 million was made available by CIE to the company under the subvention arrangements.</P>
      <P>In relation to the application for the restoration of special subvention arrangements, the owner of the company and representatives of the workforce were advised earlier this year that agreement on the future ownership and structure of the company would have to be settled before the application could be considered.  I understand, however, that it has not been possible for the parties to reach agreement on these issues.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, and having regard to the legislative proposals for promoting competition in the bus sector which I am currently finalising, I decided that it would not be appropriate to consider any application for payment of State subvention in respect of private bus services until the proposed new legislation has been enacted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I deny it most vehemently.  I have given no such commitment. In a letter from my Department dated 12 June 1991 it was pointed out to the ICTU representative who inquired about the matter that Mr. Doherty was totally incorrect in asserting that he had received any such undertaking.  I met Mr. Doherty in my Department, with officials present, to discuss his application and I never met him in my Department at any other time.  The minute of that meeting is quite clear and the correspondence is available for the inspection of any Member if they so wish.  It is quite clear from the officials who attended that meeting and from the subsequent letter to the ICTU that no commitment was given but rather quite the contrary.</P>

      <P>I am very anxious to tease out this matter with the Minister.  If this is the type of private entrepreneur the Minister chooses to run a public transport system will he give the House a commitment that Mr. Doherty has no outstanding PRSI or tax liabilities to the State given that he was the subject of a High Court case taken by the Revenue Commissioners?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has clearly and categorically outlined how he envisages public transport being run in this country.  If this is the type of entrepreneur he has in mind God help those who have <Col N="404" /> to use public transport.  The Minister is about to bring more chaos into the city and long distance transport systems unless he considers an integrated system using Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, which is the key to improving the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's antipathy to the private sector is well known. It is not my job to answer for Mr. Doherty or anybody else in regard to his taxation affairs.  Let me say that that company are not in receipt of State funds at present, but were for a limited period up to 1987, until this Government stopped them.  I have no proposals to reinstate it, quite the contrary, and in fact I have made that clear at all times.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, in the course of my Department examining the cost involved, the cost of running the service by either the private sector or the public sector was much of a muchness and both produced very similar figures for running the routes around north-east Donegal.  We looked at the figures in both cases.  One cannot draw any conclusions on the role of the private sector from one incident, no more than one can draw conclusions about the future efficiency of the public sector from the performance of one public sector company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The CSO estimate that some 2.4 million overseas tourists had visited Ireland up to the end of September this year. This represents a drop of just over 2.5 per cent on the same period last year and it is widely acknowledged that the main reasons were the combined effects of the Gulf crisis and economic difficulties in our main markets.</P>
      <P>There has been a slow but steady recovery since July and indications now are that overseas visitor numbers will exceed the three million mark for the second year running.  Furthermore, Central Statistics Office estimates for tourism expenditure for the first six months of the year show a rise of almost 8 per cent on the same period last year and there is every reason to believe that this level of increase will be maintained to year end.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte are well advanced on marketing and promotion for 1992.  Already the board, based on inquiry and booking levels to date, are confident that we have put the Gulf difficulties behind us and that we will see a strong return to growth next season.  Other initiatives for 1992 include planned expansion of our ourseas distribution network, incorporating some major new tour operators, retail chains and a new computerised reservation system to begin operating in March. Investment in the tourism product will be maintained at a high level using EC Structural Fund assistance.  Finally, the Government are currently looking at ways and means to increase commercial and trade involvment in the selling of Irish holidays in overseas markets to build on Bord Fáilte's marketing and promotion efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that Bord Fáilte's allocation for this year is sufficient, taking account of the fact that even when £1 million was added on budget day they were still allocated only the same amount as the year before?  We are told that the Estimates have been finalised and does the Minister intend to allocate the same amount of money again this year or will their allocation be <Col N="406" /> increased to bring up the numbers to the level prior to 1982?  Does the Minister have any plans to reverse the drop in the American market, because as we have seen from his reply, no other airline will service the route between Ireland and Los Angeles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has acknowledged, the Bord Fáilte budget for the years 1990 and 1991 were of a similiar scale and in the circumstances of budgetary constraints that was the best we could do.  I cannot give the Deputy any commitment for 1992 until we complete our meetings on the Estimates. Bord Fáilte are continuing to make every effort to win back visitor numbers from the United States which we lost this year. The US is a difficult market and I share the Deputy's concern about it.  I have asked Bord Fáilte to look again at ways of increasing visitor numbers.</P>

      <P>The operational programme on peripherality provides for a detailed study of the costs and benefits of the proposed upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast rail line. This study was commissioned jointly by my Department, the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment and the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultancy study has recently <Col N="409" /> been completed and it is being examined at present by my Department and by the UK and EC authorities.  I have expressed my personal support for this project in a number of fora, including the Anglo-Irish Conference and, earlier this week, the Anglo-Irish Inter-Parliamentary body. While I am satisfied that some financial assistance would be available from the EC for the project, I am seeking maximum assistance from that source. I expect to report to the Government shortly on the outcome of the joint study and on the funding possibilities for the project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the rail link is symbolic and means much more than just a railway line?  It is a crucial link between the North and the South.  Will the Minister give an unequivocal commitment to fight every inch of the way to get funding for this rail link?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's view that it is very symbolic and it is very important to maintain the line.  The estimated cost in the consultants' report is £65 million and approximately £42 million of that would have to come from the resources in the Republic.  The consultants envisage that we would require very substantial grants.  They suggest that the line would have to attract grants in the region of 65 per cent to make it viable. As I said, in my reply, the EC, UK and Irish authorities are studying ways of progressing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 25, together.  I wish to make an important announcement in relation to the future of the B &amp; I line.  Before doing so, I would like to remind Deputies of the background to the State's involvement with the company. B &amp; I were acquired from the private sector by the Government in 1965.  The Government injected equity into the B &amp; I line in 1971 and 1972, and in each year from 1976 to 1990 for working capital purposes.  Pending a decision on the future of the company, it was decided not to inject additional equity in the current year.  Instead, the Government have guaranteed short term borrowing of up to £8 million by the company in 1991.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer has invested £106 million in the B &amp; I Line since 1965.  Of this amount, approximately £100 million has been invested since 1977 and £53 million since 1985.  Despite an improved trading result this year, B &amp; I are still making losses after interest charges.  The company still require, therefore, substantial Exchequer financial subsidy to meet their ongoing commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>SKC Corporate Finance Ltd. were appointed by me last year to examine the future options for B &amp; I with the main objective of determining how soon the company's dependence on Exchequer <Col N="411" /> financial support could be ended.  Having assessed the feasibility and financial implications of a number of options, the consultants came out strongly in favour of the sale of B &amp; I as the best option.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to sell their shareholding was strongly influenced by the fact that they do not have the resources for the continued heavy investment in the company which the consultants highlighted and which all parties concerned agree is necessary for the continued survival and development of the company.</P>
    <P>Following an extensive competitive tendering process carried out by my financial advisers, SKC Corporate Finance Ltd., a memorandum of agreement on the sale of the entire issued share capital of B &amp; I was signed on behalf of the Minister for Finance and Irish Continental Group on 28 February 1991.  A clause in the agreement provided that it would lapse if, for whatever reason, the sale was not completed by 16 August 1991.</P>
    <P>Following the signing of the agreement, ICG had a comprehensive due diligence exercise carried out on B &amp; I.  This led to further complex and protracted negotiations with my advisers on a range of additional items in respect of which ICG had sought compensation.</P>
    <P>ICG also entered into extensive negotiations with the B &amp; I unions with a view to reaching a comprehensive agreement on rationalisation and work practices prior to completion of the sale.  However, I regret to say that negotiations with the unions took much longer than was anticipated.</P>
    <P>By 16 August 1991 a share purchase agreement had not been concluded and the necessary enabling legislation had not been enacted.  Accordingly, the memorandum of agreement with ICG expired on 16 August 1991.</P>
    <P>Further detailed discussions took place with ICG after 16 August.  While progress was made, the expired memorandum of agreement was not replaced by any new legal agreement.</P>
    <P>While discussions were continuing with <Col N="412" /> ICG during September I received representations from the chairman of B &amp; I acting on behalf of independent board directors to the effect that in their view the terms of the proposed sale to ICG did not represent good value.  They recommended that, in view of the Government's intention to proceed with the sale of the company, the way should be opened once more to competitive bids.  The chairman of the B &amp; I board advised me that, given a decision to sell now at the best price available, their advice was that fair value is whatever is the best price that can be obtained in the market.</P>
    <P>At the same time, my advisers became aware that a consortium of B &amp; I management and staff, together with their Danish backers, were anxious to make a revised offer for the company.  The management had previously made an unsuccessful bid.  The B &amp; I group of unions were not involved with the buy-out on that occasion and did not support the previous offer.  However, following representations made to me by the management of B &amp; I and the B &amp; I group of unions, I agreed to allow them to attempt to prepare a proposal for the acquisition of the company.</P>
    <P>Both Irish Continental Group and a consortium of B &amp; I management and staff, together with their Danish backers, were invited on 25 October 1991 to submit fully comprehensive offers within a two week deadline ending on 8 November 1991.  Following requests for an extension from the management/staff buy-out consortium, the deadline was extended first until 15 November and then for a further week until 22 November 1991.</P>
    <P>As a result of the collision involving the <i>m.v. Kilkenny,</i> I agreed to give the MSBO consortium a further extension until 28 November.  Offers were finally received on that date from both the consortium and Irish Continental Group.  A further period was subsequently allowed for clarification of the offers.</P>
    <P>I appointed an assessment committee comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Finance <Col N="413" /> and SKC Corporate Finance Ltd. to examine the two offers.  Following detailed consideration of the offers, the assessment committee made a recommendation to me, which I accepted, that the sale should be concluded with Irish Continental Group subject to final agreement on all issues.</P>
    <P>The matter was considered by the Government at their meeting yesterday afternoon.  During the Government meeting my Department passed me correspondence they had received at 4.30 p.m. yesterday from the advisors to the MSBO consortium indicating, <i>inter alia,</i> that management and staff had withdrawn from the consortium bid involving Danish interests and wished to have an amended bid submitted on their behalf on terms substantially similar to the consortium bid.  In other words, the management and staff were proposing to go ahead without their Danish backers, who were equal partners in the consortium and were the largest financial contributors to the proposal.</P>
    <P>The terms of this revised offer were presented as being essentially the same as the original MSBO offer.  However, only £2 million of the proposed £5 million purchase price offered could be paid immediately.  The balance would be paid on a deferred basis to be agreed.  In addition, discussions with suitable partners, including Irish Ferries, would take place after 12 months.</P>
    <P>Having considered the overall position in the light of the report of the assessment committee, the Government decided that the sale of B &amp; I to Irish Continental Group should take place subject to final agreement on all issues.  In arriving at their decision, the Government noted the view of the assessment committee that the buy-out proposal had represented a welcome initiative in Irish industry, involving an equal partnership between management and staff.</P>
    <P>The Government agreed with the committee's conclusion, however, that, in line with standard practice, B &amp; I should be sold at the best price available, that was to Irish Continental Group, unless <Col N="414" /> there were other compelling circumstances for not doing so.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss details of the two offers at this time because negotiations on all issues with Irish Continental Group have yet to be finalised.  I can say, however, that the ICG bid of £8.5 million purchase is substantially better than the buy-out offer of £5 million with £3 million of that on a deferred basis. Both ICG and the buy-out consortium have sought an Exchequer investment of £35 million to remove the company's debt prior to the sale.  Clearly, the sale to Irish Continental Group will result in a substantially lower cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the sale to Irish Continental Group represents the best prospect for the future of B &amp; I.  The company, as indeed were the MSBO consortium, are committed to investing £30 million in B &amp; I over the next five years. It will create a strong shipping entity with substantial synergy benefits, a proven track record and the ability to make the necessary investment in the future of the combined entity.</P>
    <P>There will be an opportunity for Deputies to debate this matter fully during the course of the B &amp; I Line Bill, 1991, which has been circulated to Deputies today.</P>

      <P>I should say to Deputy Rabbitte that it is almost 12 months since I publicly announced the Government decision to sell the B &amp; I Line to Irish Ferries.  In the intervening period, at the request of the workers themselves, I reopened the tendering process to allow them make an offer.  They made an offer over a five-week period, received finally on 28 November, which was considered by Cabinet on 4 December.  The Cabinet got to it five or six days after the final submission had been received from both sides.  It was at the very last moment only, long after the deadline of 28 November had been reached, that a note arrived to say that the Danish interests, who form almost half the bid from the workers' side, were no longer available to be involved.</P>

      <P>I must repeat, I reopened the process in order to facilitate workers and management to make a second bid, they having made a previous one.  But the second bid effectively failed because of the inability of the Danish backers and themselves to come to a final agreement.  The third bid, with phased payments and such things, was &mdash; as I have already indicated &mdash; substantially worse than the bid from Irish Ferries.  I must have some regard to the tendering process and a fair assessment by the two Departments and outside advisers.  We have dealt with this matter fairly and openly, having regard to the taxpayers and the workers.  The B &amp; I workers can have a better, more professionally organised future than would have been open to them if we had taken some other route with a less certain future.</P>

Is the Minister aware that in the aborted discussions between the unions and Irish Ferries, one of the major problems was the history of a huge inter-union dispute within B &amp; I and that this union is very prominent within Irish Ferries? This will be a recipe for chaos.  Will the Minister confirm that when the Dutch group backed out, Allied Irish Corporate Finance filled their place and the deal stood up because of their continuing involvement in it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour whether he intends to intervene or to seek the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission to resolve the dispute at Dublin Port: and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern expressed about the damage being done to the commercial life of Dublin and the country as a whole by this unofficial dispute.  This industrial action was taken without notice and without recourse to procedures which are laid down for the resolution of disputes.  It is a matter of concern that industrial action should be undertaken in total disregard of procedures.  I had hoped that unofficial strikes of this nature were a feature of our industrial relations past.  I have no doubt that the dispute can be resolved if the workers concerned accept the advice of their own union and return to work. The Labour Relations Commission are available at short notice to assist the parties once normal procedures are followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of course concerned at the situation in Dublin Port at a time when Dublin Cargo Handling are in financial difficulties.  The action being taken does not bode well for the future of what should be our premier port facility.  For some time Dublin Port has lacked the flexibility needed for modern port operation. In a country heavily dependent on exports, it is essential that work practices <Col N="426" /> there are such as to ensure the efficient operation of the port.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement.  What action does he intend to take to resolve the problem?  Does he agree that the current dispute poses a serious risk to the future viability of Dublin Port, that it will be seen as again raising the spectre of the port being unreliable and result in substantial loss of business to the port?  Would he also agree that this dispute, taking place at this time of the year, threatens many businesses who rely on the port and the trade which takes place through the Christmas period to maintain the viability of their businesses and jobs?  Would the Minister agree that the dispute is placing at risk a substantial number of jobs?  Would the Minister agree that it is a recipe for disaster to preserve the current Mexican stand-off whereby the Labour Relations Commission are not intervening until the workers go back to work and the workers will not go back without the problems being resolved?  This is a recipe for disaster which will involve the continuation of the dispute for weeks rather than days. What steps will the Minister take to break this stand-off and tackle the problem so that Dublin Port can rapidly return to normal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no trouble in agreeing with the sequence of statements made by the Deputy in relation to the damage to the port and to the national economy.  I have stated that as a matter of fact.  Is the Deputy suggesting that I as Minister should encourage a total departure from agreed procedures by telling the Labour Court that they should sanction this kind of unofficial action, taken without notice, contrary to precedents and procedures, by interfering in response?  The Deputy appears to be hinting at this in asking me to insist that the so-called Mexican stand-off should stop.  He had better acknowledge the chaotic consequences of what he is suggesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not <Col N="427" /> agree that the function of the Labour Relations Commission is not to give sanction to either official or unofficial action but to resolve industrial disputes and that the current stand-off is a recipe for the continuation of this dispute for a substantial period?  Would the Minister not agree that the Labour Relations Commission, through the good offices of the Labour Court reconciliation officer intervening at this stage, could provide a mechanism for bringing the dispute to an end, without in any way expressing approval or disapproval of the behaviour of the unofficial strikers or any side in the dispute?  Would the Minister not encourage that intervention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must know that there are agreements in place between management and unions.  The best guarantee of good industrial relations is to adhere to that partnership. If any degree of sanction or recognition is given for unofficial action which ignores all those procedures there is only one consequence, namely chaos.  That is not in the interest even of Dublin Port, which is vitally important to the economy. I was amazed to learn that Dublin Port will not handle meat.  I believe a number of things can be done to improve Dublin Port: first, the re-establishment of normal work procedures and, second, the creation of an efficient, reliable and consistent port to which importers and exporters will come to do business.  The taking of strike action without notice would only be encouraged if people did as the Deputy suggested, and he must know that.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not accept that his recipe to resolve the dispute is that he should do nothing, that the Labour Relations Commission should do nothing and that we should simply hope that the dispute will go away?  Will the Minister accept that this is unrealistic?  I join with the Minister in calling on the workers on strike to come off strike.  If they are not willing to respond to that call the only way the matter can be resolved is for an intermediary to get involved, and the appropriate body is the Labour Relations Commission through a conciliation officer.  In that context I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that where procedures were not followed in the past in a dispute which affected the vital national interest his predecessor was willing to involve himself in the resolution of those disputes.  The Minister is adopting an excessively legalistic response to a problem which requires flexibility and urgent resolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I was referring to the interchanges which have been built in recent years at enormous expense to Irish taxpayers and the European Community.  I have referred specifically to the interchange near Palmerstown on the N4 and the interchange near the Red Cow Inn on the N7.  I want to emphasise that local authority road design teams are excellent. However, the restrictions placed on them make it almost impossible for them to carry out their job.  For example, I understand that the design teams involved in the two interchanges to which I have referred were instructed by the Department that an underpass or similar facility was not desirable, necessary or acceptable for whatever reasons &mdash; usually these are financial.  As a result, a second rate facility was built which has proven to be an accident black spot.  This reflects badly on our seriousness to resolve problems which have existed for several years.  It is a disgrace that those inter-changes have now become regularly identified with accidents.  In the last few days I have seen further renovation works taking place which is another sad reflection at attempting to resolve the problem.  When the new Authority produce a plan I hope they will have regard to the need for traffic to move as quickly and as safely as possible from A to B and that they will not adopt short term expedients to save money because, eventually, they end up as false economies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which has come to our attention over the years is the number of traffic lights erected as a permanent solution to a problem on what should be reasonably fast roads.  This was referred to by Deputy Andrews.  In any other country the purpose of a motorway, or even a dual carriageway, is to get <Col N="455" /> traffic from point A to point B as quickly and as safely as possible and in doing so to eliminate roundabouts, traffic lights and junctions.  We have provided straight roads to get traffic from A to B but instead of providing easy and smooth access for intermingling traffic, to get on to the routes we have erected traffic lights.  The traffic lights continue to cause the traffic congestion we have had over the years.  Obviously, we have learned nothing.  Our use of under-passes and fly-overs is amazing in comparison with other European countries.  I do not understand why we have not paid more attention to them though I note that there are one or two exceptions.  Instead of purchasing 40, 50 or 100 sets of traffic lights local authorities would be well advised to put in place a proper junction which would not necessitate lights.  It would be as cheap in the long run.  The benefit to the economy and the motoring public would be much greater.  One could speak <i>ad infinitum</i> on this issue.</P>
    <P>Members of local authorities have long since come to the conclusion that the officials in the Department of the Environment who are concerned with road building and transportation do not understand the problems or how the system should work.  In the past the Department of the Environment felt local authorities were not the best people to operate the system and were not in the best position to assess local requirements.  As a result they imposed certain restrictions.</P>
    <P>Another danger is about to raise its head in this legislation.  The Authority will, obviously, be in competition with local authorities for funds and that will be a serious issue.  There is no question but that if after a short period local authorities discover their funds are being curtailed or restricted, arising out of developments proposed by the National Roads Authority, there will be a problem. Local authorities who are already in financial difficulties will be ten times worse off after a few years of operation of the Authority.  I implore the Minister of State in the adjoining constituency to use his influence in this regard as a former member of a local authority and one who knows how that system works.  Those of <Col N="456" /> us who have been or are members of local authorities are only too well aware of the difficulties that exist.  Those interests who have been calling for the establishment of a roads authority over a number of years are concerned with the national primary and national secondary routes. That is their remit and they are right to be so concerned but they do not understand the difficulties that beset the local authorities, which have been the roads authorities up to now, with the backing of the Department of the Environment. They do not understand how those authorities are affected.</P>
    <P>The matter of urban roads is another issue the Minister, this Bill and the National Roads Authority should address.  Areas close to expanding populations have problems not being experienced elsewhere in the country caused by the volume and weight of vehicular traffic.  There is no compensation or recognition by any agency outside the local authorities to provide an alternative in terms of funding to resolve that problem. The result is that our minor roads are constantly churned up by heavy vehicles which criss-cross our towns and villages in an effort to escape the over-congested national primary routes and are severely damaged as a result of this traversing.  Those vehicles travel on roads which were built 500, 600 or 700 years ago for lighter and less traffic.  It is inexplicable in this day and age that we should expect roads, streets and parking facilities in towns and villages, within 20 miles of the capital city to cater for the volume of traffic that uses them at present.  Reference has been made to this matter by Deputy Power.  We all attended a public meeting recently in the town of Celbridge where this was discussed at great length. This is not on a national primary route but is very close to what will be a national primary route when a by-pass, which is due to start, is finished.  Some 20 years ago the population of Celbridge was 700, now it is about 12,000.  There is only one point across a bridge to the town from the city side.  All the traffic from that expanding population has to go down the main street, cross that bridge to get on to the Dubin road.  Almost 12,000 vehicles operate daily on that road.  Some of the <Col N="457" /> traffic is local and some of it drives through the Minister's constituency to Edenderry which is supposed to be a regional road.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Bill to regional roads and it is on them I wish to concentrate my attention.  Regional roads are a very hazy area because they have no status in terms of funding except by way of special allocation.  National primary and secondary routes are dealt with directly by the Department of the Environment.  Main and county roads are dealt with by way of discretionary grants and from whatever other rersources the local authority may have.  Regional routes are funded from those same sources and they are not catered for financially at present.  In the context of this Bill I am afraid they will not be catered for because the reference to regional routes is hazy and vague.  The Minister and his staff should take note of that problem.</P>
    <P>To those who may say the local authority are given resources on a yearly basis to deal with them I say that is not true.  I will give a classic example.  For the town of Celbridge in County Kildare the total rate warrant is somewhere in the region of £340,000.  That is a town with a population of 12,000 people.  Some buildings in this city carry as much of a rate warrant. When one relates that kind of revenue to the population one realises the difficulty the local authority have to face. Until that is recognised by the Department the problem will not be resolved. It should be at least admitted that the problem exists.</P>
    <P>While on that subject, the towns of Leixlip, Maynooth and Kilcock which were also mentioned by Deputy Andrews, are all within a 25 mile radius of this city and they all suffer from the huge weight of vehicular traffic which affects this city on a daily basis.  Congestion in those towns is chronic.  There have been repeated calls for financial assistance over the years.  The national primary routes have been the responsibility of the Minister.  I know the problems in those towns are about to be resolved at last but there are similar problems in various other towns in County <Col N="458" /> Kildare.  Towns and villages within a certain radius of the capital city are specifically affected by their proximity to the city.  All the traffic is generated in one way or another by the capital city, by Dublin port, rail termini, airports and so on.  The traffic must go through one or other of the towns and villages in the surrounding counties.  Despite the pleas made, the problems of those towns and villages have not been recognised.</P>
    <P>Nobody is prepared to accept that if we want to resolve the problems with regard to roads we must treat the area around the city as a special area to be dealt with as a whole as opposed to living on a county or constituency basis.  I accept that the Minister cannot make a special case of every town and village. That would not be the answer.  The answer is a recognition of the special problems with regard to infrastructure in the towns and villages surrounding Dublin.  Neither the capital city nor the County of Dublin have the problems we have because in Dublin the commercial value of property is far higher than in country constituencies.  Our people are looking at the resources available in Dublin and they are envious and are asking a whole lot of questions which I will not go into here today.  If the Minister gave the sort of recognition for which I am asking, all public representatives would have their confidence in the Department restored and the taxpayers in those areas, although they do not like the intensive development that is taking place, would recognise that their requirements were being considered with regard to road transportation.  Until such time as that happens the public will remain cynical.  They see themselves being neglected and forgotten.  That is not good for us or for them.  That problem is a favourite hobby-horse of mine and I know that Deputies in neighbouring counties have referred to it as well.</P>
    <P>I will not say any more about design flaws in roads other than that funds should not be discountinued at a crucial stage.  When draughtsmen, engineers or design teams are preparing a plan they find that three-quarters of the way through there is to be a restriction on funds.  There is a restriction then in the <Col N="459" /> degree to which the road proposed will serve the public.  There is a restriction in funds and in the safety factor.  It is an area that should be examined.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the bureaucracy and red tape around road construction and land acquisition.  We need at least a five to ten year programme.  I hope that when the programme which will emanate from this legislation is produced it will be proceeded with until the end.  We should get away from old stop-go attitude where in the run up to an election there is a sudden rush to draw up design plans. All Governments have done it without exception, and afterwards nothing has happened.  Another well known ploy for a Government anticipating exit from office for any length of time is to ensure that preparatory or design work is not done knowing that it will take at least four or five years for people to advance the plans that are necessary and to proceed to bring the plans to fruition, so that they can go to tender and so on.  I am sure that every Member of the House saw this happen but it is not good politics. It just sabotages the proposal for the foreseeable future.  Then because of bureaucracy and red tape a few yards down the road there will be a technical problem and the submissions will be returned to the Department, sent back to the local authority and possibly referred back to the design team again so that another team can have a look at it. Eventually final approval is given in this long, protracted procedure which I understand is to be streamlined in the context of this Bill, which is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Tolls have been referred to in the context of the Bill and provision is made for the re-enactment of the 1979 Act.  Tolls are useful in certain areas provided the charges which apply are not too great.  I can think of one or two places where the charges are creeping up to such an extent that the traffic which is supposed to use the toll bridges is escaping and using circuitous routes which are totally unsuited to the volume of traffic, in order to save money.  The West Link bridge is one; we in County Kildare have the visitation of that traffic because of the level of the toll <Col N="460" /> on the bridge.  The heavy vehicular traffic is now using a series of roads through Leixlip in County Kildare &mdash; one a narrow road which is not even a regional road &mdash; because the toll is too high.  If tolls are to be applied at all they must be pitched in a way that makes it attractive for people to use the toll bridges.  If the toll is too high people will just set out half an hour earlier and use the alternative routes so that they can motor at a much cheaper rate.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that the N4 bypass would be tolled as well.  The western bypass was long awaited.  There were numerous representations to various Ministers for its implementation since long before I came into this House. If a toll is to be applied now, the result of which is diminuition in the use of the new road, traffic congestion may well continue in the towns involved after the bypass has been provided.  If that occurs it would be far better not to get involved in tolls at all.  The people who have campaigned for a good road for so long now find themselves having to pay a toll while their colleagues on the southerly circuit moving southwards can do so toll free.  I cannot see the logic in applying a toll on one route but not on another.</P>
    <P>I realise that other Members want to speak so I will conclude very soon.  This is a subject particularly dear to the hearts of people living where I live.  The Minister of State will recognise that.  Suffice it to say that I am sure we will have other opportunities to pursue the matter further.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the classification and the reclassification of roads. This is also provided for in the Bill.  In that area I would draw the Minister's attention to the regional roads and the new urban road requirements.  I would ask that when roads are being reclassified they would not be classified in such a way that they cannot attract funding from any quarter other than the local authority itself.  Such a category will never receive funds from any quarter and that road will have all the potholes.  I know the Minister is familiar with potholes in his own constituency. I know also that he has done his best to eliminate as many potholes as possible in his constituency.  When he is <Col N="461" /> finished there I would be more than happy to welcome him across the county boundary into County Kildare where we have some of the finest potholes the country has ever experienced.  They are deeper and carry more water and, it has been suggested, wildlife has been known to exist in them.  The Minister will be more than welcome to join us and help us to resolve that problem.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which I wanted to discuss but unfortunately time always catches up on one.  I would like to thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for bearing with me.  The Minister knows well what I am talking about.  I am particularly glad that he happened to be sitting here during the discussion so far this afternoon.  I hope he will take on board what I have said.  It is not secondhand information but information I have gleaned from my own experience as a member of a local authority &mdash; and I do not necessarily always agree with what is said to me by so-called experts. However, at this stage of our political life we should be able to recognise the needs and respond to them.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that Deputy Durkan could speak all day about roads. He was in full flight and I appreciate that he is being generous in allowing me to contribute for the remaining portion of the time.</P>
      <P>It has been a very wide ranging and enlightening debate in that it has stretched from motorways to potholes. Indeed we were brought on a magical mystery tour around the roadways of Ireland earlier today by my colleague, Deputy Andrews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a good Bill and it is long overdue. Some of the points mentioned by Deputy Durkan are very relevant.  He spoke about interceptions, differences that have emerged in design work and engineering.  I hope the Bill will address that and I am convinced it will.  Deputy <Col N="462" /> Durkan has made arguments for the Bill in that respect.</P>
    <P>I would also support him in relation to the problems of the towns in his constituency near Dublin.  I would ask that the new Authority should look at those problems because they are not really constituency matters but national issues at which a national body should look.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Bill the Minister is responding to an obvious need to co-ordinate the efforts of the public and private sector in road building and also the need to put in place proper management, improvement and maintenance of the network of national roads.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the new Minister, Deputy Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, on the calm and determined way he has conducted business in his other portfolios. I know he will do the same in this Ministry.  His predecessor, Deputy Pádraig Flynn, can be very proud of his achievements and the new roads and motorways stand as monuments to his distinguished period in office.  I know that his junior Minister, Deputy Connolly, who is here today, will agree with me when I speak those words in praise of the previous Minister.</P>
    <P>I would like at the outset to respond to what I can only describe as the alarmist and mischievous comments that have come particularly from The Workers' Party in relation to this Bill.  These comments were obviously intended to cause great disquiet in the community.  The Bill we are discussing here today does not erode local democracy.  The statement that it does is simply not true.  I would like to make a few points about this new Authority.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority will be responsible to the very same Minister. The national roads have always been funded 100 per cent by the Exchequer. The Department of the Environment have always had a supervisory role to play in this matter and no project would go ahead without the approval of this Department.</P>
    <P>What has changed?  As a result of this Bill the mechanisms through which these national projects are implemented are being clarified and, more important, being given a legal basis.  There are no <Col N="463" /> changes in the mechanics themselves and it is very important to point that out.  The Workers' Party should please note these facts before they launch into these alarmist type accusations.  The functions which have been heretofore performed by the Department of the Environment on a non-statutory basis will now be carried out on a statutory basis by the National Roads Authority.  It is not a private enterprise; it is a statutory corporation.  It has been given specific functions.  It will have a legal base and means that we as a nation will be managing our affairs better and in a more co-ordinated way in relation to national road construction and related matters.  What is wrong with that, might I ask?  Why do we knock ourselves when we do get our act together and get it right?  That is what we are doing on this occasion.</P>
    <P>This will not be a strange and mysterious new body.  They will manage and co-ordinate our national public infrastructure and there will be full accountability, involving the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The body will be staffed by public officials and a small number of experts will be recruited in the normal way.  An annual report will be submitted to the Minister and it will be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I fail to see how any statutory body would act irresponsibly.  Who are these people who will flagrantly disregard democracy? The reality is that the National Roads Authority will be staffed primarily by officials of the Department of the Environment who are at present performing these functions together with a small number of additional staff.  I suggest to those who have chosen to knock the establishment of a National Roads Authority that they should stop this nonsense. We are talking about public affairs where at the end of the day a body will be responsible to a ministerial boss and to the House.  We are not replacing parliamentary democracy, as the detractors among us might suggest.</P>
    <P>I have argued on a number of occasions that there is an urgent need to co-ordinate the activities of Government agencies <Col N="464" /> and Departments, particularly when it comes to our dealings with the European Community.  I welcome the fact that the National Roads Authority will prepare our submission on our national roads for submission to Brussels.  I have also argued in the past that there was a need to co-ordinate the workings of all those sections of Government Departments dealing with transport issues.  This became very evident during the past year when I was involved with the European Affairs Committee of the British-Irish parliamentary body in compiling a report on freight transport which was presented to the plenary meeting of that body in Dublin Castle on Monday, a meeting which was co-chaired by your good self, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, this body is composed of 25 Irish members and 25 British members and they are now involved in detailed committee work, much of which will be of benefit to both Governments.  The work of the European affairs committee was mainly concerned with transport issues on this island, the rest of Europe and road and rail links between the two parts of Ireland.  We consulted widely with those concerned with transport issues on this island, the United Kingdom and Brussels and made recommendations which, if implemented, would greatly help the people of Ireland, North and South, and ensure that the island of Ireland is not left out in the cold when the Channel tunnel joins England with France and mainland Europe.  My views on the need to co-ordinate the workings of Government Departments on transport matters were reinforced by my involvement in this committee's work.  There are three Government Departments here who deal with transport issues &mdash; the Department of the Environment, the Department of the Marine and the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications.  As a matter of interest, there is a Department of Transport, with a Secretary of State, in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>This Bill will result in a significant level of co-ordination in the way we manage road construction nationally.  However, one crucial and vital step remains to be <Col N="465" /> taken before 1 January 1994.  Let me outline what I have in mind.  I have always argued that all transport matters &mdash; roads, airports, public transport, rail and bus &mdash; should be dealt with under one departmental roof.  To be fair, the Operational Programme on Peripherality, 1989-93, which was approved by the EC Commission last August, deals with all transport modes and is concerned with roads and public transport investment. It was prepared by various Government Departments, and co-ordinated by the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Because of the dominance of roads in our transport system, roads became the anchor.  All the detailed technical research and figures and all the information on traffic flows showed that 96 per cent of passenger movement was by road and that 97 per cent of all freight was transported by road.  Most of the money from Europe, therefore, went towards roads with some going to airports and ports and a small amount towards public transport.  I strongly urge the Taoiseach and the Government to ensure that we get our act together in relation to transport matters before our next operational EC programme is prepared by 1994.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest that all matters relating to transport policy be dealt with under one departmental roof, that is, a fully fledged Department of Transport. This Department would maintain responsibility for public transport by rail and bus, air transport and navigation services and take on new responsibilities, the section of the Department of the Environment which deals with roads and the section of the Department of the Marine which deals with harbours.  It is ludicrous that three Departments are involved at present which must make it very difficult for the bureaucrats at EC level to deal with us.  What is of most concern to me is that there is a possibility of delays due to the number of Ministers and civil servants currently involved in these matters.  We need to act speedily and efficiently at European level to ensure that we get the best possible support due to our peripherality.</P>
    <P>Our transport needs are great.  I urge the Government therefore to consider <Col N="466" /> making arrangements and redefining departmental responsibilities along the lines suggested with a view to presenting a cohesive, co-ordinated and integrated programme to Brussels on 1 January 1994.  Transport is concerned with roads, ports, airports, public transport by rail and bus.  They are all interlinked and what I am suggesting would in no way interfere with the National Roads Authority. I am simply talking about the need to redefine ministerial and departmental responsibilities.  This can be done at no cost and without undue delay.  A new Department of Transport would oversee the work of the National Roads Authority and all the other areas I have referred to.</P>
    <P>At present legal responsibility for the various sections of the national road network is divided between 87 local authorities &mdash; county councils, county borough councils, borough corporations and urban district councils.  We now have an opportunity to co-ordinate the management of this network.  The National Roads Authority will have formal contacts with the local authorities and there will be two way dialogue.  It should be pointed out that, when built, roads will be taken in charge by the relevant local authorities who will then be the legal owners.  They will prepare programmes and other documentation for EC assistance in accordance with specific conditions and terms laid down by the Minister in question.  As I said earlier, I hope this will be the Minister for Transport by 1994.</P>
    <P>This is not to take away the magnificent contribution made to transport policy by the Department and successive Ministers for the Environment during the years.  I envisage all of the officials involved in the Department moving to a new Department. After all, the Department of the Environment is becoming more and more an environmental Department, dealing in particular with the green environment. I have no doubt that if my suggestion is taken on board, with the road section being shed and passed to a new Department of Transport, the Department of the Environment would surely flower and blossom and show their true colours.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate many <Col N="467" /> Deputies have referred to the condition of the roads in their constituencies. Because of time limits, I will not go into detail on this matter, even though it was my intention to do so.  Earlier Deputy Andrews referred to the need to make sure that the south eastern motorway is linked with the southern cross route.  I support that proposal because if this is not done there will be chaos in my constituency and the surrounding areas. Many fine projects have been completed, such as the Western Parkway and the Shankill bypass.  Parts of the traffic jigsaw are being put in place all over the country while the position in relation to traffic flow in Dublin has been dramatically changed for the better following the completion of the Western Parkway, even though short term problems have been cuased for the southern region of Dublin. I have no doubt that the Minister and the new National Roads Authority will make sure that the ring road will be completed without delay.</P>
    <P>We cannot debate roads without also debating public transport.  That brings me to the need for a proper strategy on bus and rail transport.  Because of time limits I make an appeal that we should concentrate on the next programme which will be submitted to Brussels &mdash; I hope that by 1994 the issue of roads will have been dealt with &mdash; on public transport, taking into account the need for a proper transport policy for Dublin and the possibility of re-opening the Harcourt Street railway line.  I would like to see those matters dealt with in our next submission when seeking EC moneys.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that another layer of bureaucracy will not be created, given that the National Roads Authority will assume responsibility for all the functions carried out by the Department of the Environment in relation to our network of national roads.</P>

      <P>Last Friday there was an announcement that the JA/Mont plant in Waterford was to close and that operations in Waterford are to be phased out between January and March 1992.  This will result in the loss of 58 jobs in Waterford; it is a devastating blow to the employees and their families and a further blow to the local economy.  Allied to this, there are persistent rumours that Waterford Crystal could be seeking as many as 800 redundancies in Waterford. There is a live register figure in the city of 6,500; the situation is fast approaching crisis proportions and it is imperative that the Government do everything possible to protect existing employment and create new employment in Waterford.</P>
      <P>Early in October the Taoiseach officially opened a £4 million extension to the JA/Mont plant in Finglas. The managing director, Mr. Des Scott, stated on that occasion the company will be investing a further £1 million which, it is hoped, will secure the future of the company's 240 employees in Finglas.  I state this in no spirit of begrudgery and want to make it clear that I wish the employees in Finglas well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is for Waterford.  Will the Minister say whether a way can be found to continue JA/Mont production in Waterford?  This particular operation has <Col N="469" /> been in the city &mdash; it was initially in Tramore &mdash; for 26 years during which time there were changes of name and ownership but their workforce always produced first-class products.  Some employees have been there for 25 years and in the present climate they will find it very difficult to obtain alternative employment.</P>
    <P>I have been in contact with the regional office of the IDA who assure me that the company are co-operating fully in finding an alternative use for the plant and, consequently, alternative employment for the workers.  I am seeking the Minister's assurance that all the resources of his Department will be made available to assist in achieving this objective.  I have asked the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, on more than one occasion to grant disadvantaged status to Waterford in terms of IDA grants.  I reiterate that request now because the situation in Waterford continues to deteriorate.  It must be given help to solve its problems.  The Government have cynically and dishonestly dealt with Waterford in terms of decentralisation of a Government Department; 150 to 200 jobs in Telecom are supposed to be decentralised to Waterford. However, Telecom Éireann are on record as saying they have no intention of decentralising to Waterford and indeed the Government do not have any powers to compel them to do so.  The Government must come clean on this issue and designate a Department for decentralisation to Waterford.  This will help the economy but the immediate problem is JA/Mont and I look forward to positive and helpful remarks from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Shea for sharing his time with me to express my concern about the deteriorating employment in Waterford city.  The imminent closure of the JA/Mont factory is just the latest episode, which will throw another 58 people on the dole queue over the next three or four months, despite the fact that the factory has been successful and operating profitably in Waterford. It is a victim of a corporate decision by the parent body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> Too often remedial action is not taken quickly enough by the IDA in such instances.  How will the Minister for Industry and Commerce ensure that action will be taken fairly quickly?  The latest figures I have for unemployment in Waterford city are to the end of October and stand at 6,792, which is well above the national average.  That includes a large slice of the workers from Waterford Crystal, and who is to say that more workers will not end up on the dole queue?  I realise that the Minister may refer to the success story at Bausch and Lomb where he recently opened a new extension.  However, this is not enough as there are nearly 7,000 people registered as unemployed.  I remember that when this situation arose in Cork a few years ago a task force was put into place by the Government.  The present position in Waterford is just as serious and I should like the Minister to establish a forum like that to give hope for the future, not just to the workers in JA/Mont but to all workers in Waterford.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputies O'Shea and Kenneally for raising this important matter for Waterford.  It is good to see the level of co-operation in the House in relation to that matter.</P>
      <P>Raytex Limited, the original company, were established some 30 years ago. Throughout the years they have been engaged in the manufacture of paper products and wrapping.  The company who were taken over by JA/Mont (formerly Nokia Limited) in 1979 have their Irish headquarters in Finglas, County Dublin.  The company have informed me that the recent decision taken with regard to the Waterford plant was taken as part of a total restructuring plan for the Europe-wide JA/Mont Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>JA/Mont are Ireland's largest manufacturer and distributor of disposable paper products sold through major supermarkets, grocery and distributor outlets nationwide.  The company recently made a substantial new investment in order to improve efficiency and overall performance at their headquarters in Finglas <Col N="471" /> and to ensure the survival of their Irish operations in a tough international business environment.  I understand that the firm's decision in regard to rationalisation and centralising production at Finglas is necessary in order to protect their future overall viability in this country.</P>
    <P>While the provision of alternative sources of employment is a matter for the day-to-day responsibility of the Industrial Development Authority, and is not something in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has a direct function, nevertheless he is very concerned at the expected loss of jobs and is keen to ensure that all possible steps are taken to minimise the impact of the closure on the workforce and on the surrounding area.</P>
    <P>The IDA have assured me that Waterford will continue to be actively promoted by them for industrial development and the provision of additional employment.  They have also informed me that JA/Mont have expressed their willingness to co-operate closely with the IDA to seek alternative industry for the site.</P>
    <P>I am heartened to note that even in the current very difficult investment climate internationally, Waterford city and county have seen a net increase in manufacturing employment in each of the last three years.  Forthcoming expansions and new start-ups are set to provide a further 300 jobs over the next three years:</P>
    <P>Among these are Bausch and Lomb, the worldwide healthcare and optics company, who only a few weeks ago provided Waterford with another chapter of an auspicious success story with the official opening of their new £17 million Ray Ban sunglass facility at the IDA's industrial park, situated at Old Kilmeaden Road.  The 120,000 sq ft. factory, which is the world's second largest sunglass manufacturing operation will be the sole production facility for the European and Middle Eastern markets.  The sunglass operation now employes over 330 permanent staff.  With the new expansion it is expected that fulltime employment will rise to 450 by the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>In addition the company's contact lens plant currently employs 350 permanent <Col N="472" /> staff and produces over eight million lenses a year, 50 per cent of which will be exported back to the US.  The two operations combined will employ 1,200 people by 1994, which will make Bausch and Lomb one of Waterford's largest employers and a key player in the development of the local economy.  They will become the third company in Waterford to employ over 1,000 people.  A further indication of the contribution made by Bausch and Lomb to the Waterford region is the fact that since establishing here in 1980 they have invested £35 million in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Fifty jobs will be created in a new IDA backed company, House of Redmond, which is setting up in Waterford city to manufacture upholstered three piece suites mainly for export.  Recruitment and training have already begun.  Twenty six jobs will be filled during the first year, and the remaining 24 within three years.</P>
    <P>The Dutch plastics manufacturer, United Industries Nederland BV &mdash; trading as Flair Plastics &mdash; are to set up a manufacturing plant in Tallow, with the support of the IDA.  The company have purchased the site and factory buildings for this purpose.  The company expect to create 40 jobs within three years rising to 60 over five years.</P>
    <P>A further 50 jobs are to be provided within the next three years by the Australian company, Michell Leather.  This company plan to invest £4 million, with IDA support, in wet blue leather operation at Killowen, County Waterford. While we are disappointed that JA/Mont have withdrawn from Waterford, the IDA are actively seeking alternative employment for that site and hopefully will be successful in that regard.</P>

      <P>Deputy John Connor gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter as to when the Minister for the Environment intends to sanction plans for the proposed new bridge on the River Suck at Athleague, County Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this <Col N="473" /> issue in the Dáil this evening.  A campaign has been in progress over the past 20 years for the construction of a new bridge on the River Suck in the village of Athleague. The exact age of the present bridge structure is not known but there is general agreement that it is over 150 years old.  Visually, it is an attractive six-arch stone structure which makes it quite unique.  It is also unique in the context of its age.  However, from a user's point of view &mdash; there are many users &mdash; Athleague bridge has very few attractions.</P>
      <P>Immediately, west of the bridge there is located two major agri-industries that generate between them hundreds of traffic movements in both directions across the bridge on a daily basis.  A large proportion of this traffic is very heavy consisting of 60ft and 40 ft, refrigerated containers bound for or returning from the country's main ports and long liquid bulk tankers which service Athleague creamery.  In addition, traffic is generated by the 150 workers in the meat plant and the creamery and this traffic must cross the bridge on a daily basis.  It goes without saying that there is the ordinary day to day flow of traffic going through the village of Athleague which has nothing to do with the industrial traffic across the bridge.</P>
      <P>The expert value of the meat product from Kepac Limited, situated immediately beside the bridge, is about £60 million in the current year &mdash; approximately 22 per cent of all lamb exports from this country is from that plant.  Every ounce of this product is transported across the bridge, within minutes of leaving the plant if conditions allow, on its way to the main ports.  Very frequently this traffic is delayed from 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the length of the queue, and more than once this company have suffered heavy penalties arising from late arrivals in port and delay in shipping, directly caused by delays on this bridge which is less than a quarter of a mile from the plant.  Athleague creamery have also suffered substantial loss arising from delays on the bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, delays are not the only problem as the bridge is also extremely hazardous. On both approach roads to the bridge there are acute bends and visibility <Col N="474" /> is reduced to a few metres.  The carriageway on the bridge if less than 16ft from one parapet wall to the other.  That is well below the standard acceptable width of a single carriageway on a national or main road.  I would also mention that the river area at the bridge is an area of high amenity and many children as well as adults use it in summertime for recreation and swimming which can also be hazardous.</P>
    <P>On 5 November I asked the then Minister for the Environment in a written question if he would sanction plans for the new bridge in Athleague, County Roscommon, which were submitted to his Department by Roscommon County Council and if he would fund the project in the 1992 road works programme.  The Minister replied that, as this bridge is on a non-national road, responsibility for its improvement and maintenance rests with Roscommon County Council and the costs of such works fall to be financed by that authority from their own resources, supplemented by the discretionary grant provided annually by his Department. He said that in these circumstances sanction for the plans is not required, but that is absolute rubbish.  Sanction for this project is required by the Department. The Minister asked Roscommon County Council to submit to him detailed plans for the bridge.  If sanction is not required why did the Minister ask for these plans?</P>
    <P>In 1990 the Department of the Environment provided £100,000 to carry out strengthening works on the bridge. Therefore I hope the Minister will not try to argue this evening that the Department have no responsibility for the funding of the bridge.  Responsibility rests with the Department and I plead with the Minister that, of the £781,000 which it will cost to build the bridge and realign the road at each end, at least half of that amount should be provided in 1992.  That is very necessary given the volume of traffic using the bridge every day of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's interest in this matter, which involves the improvement of the existing bridge over the River Suck <Col N="475" /> at Athleague.  The works proposed here are quite considerable.  They involve the construction of a six arch extension to the existing bridge with associated changes on the approaches to the bridge and at an estimated cost in excess of £600,000.</P>
      <P>This bridge is on a non-national road and responsibility for works on non-national roads rests with the local authority concerned, in this case Roscommon County Council.  As the former Minister stated in reply to a recent parliamentary question, the cost of such works would normally fall to be financed by Roscommon County Council from their own resources, supplemented by the discretionary grant provided annually by my Department.  Sometimes my Department give special grants to road authorities in respect of certain works which are required on non-national roads and which would be considered to be of special importance on account of their nature or strategic location.  Indeed special grants of £144,621 have already been paid to Roscommon County Council for strengthening this bridge over the period 1987-90.  Unfortunately the moneys available to me for such grants are limited &mdash; special grants amounted to only £5.67 million in 1991 and there is already a large number of meritorious projects, at an estimated cost of over £60 million awaiting funding from this source.</P>
      <P>We are looking at this matter afresh and, while no commitment can be given that a special grant will be made available towards the cost of the works proposed for Athleague, I can say that consideration will be given as to the possibility of providing such a grant to assist Roscommon County Council in carrying out these works.  The matter will have to be considered in the context of the road grant allocations for 1992, the amounts which can be provided for special grants and the competing demands of other projects for such grants.  We will keep the matter in mind and see what we can do with the funds available to us.  Many of the projects are very worthwhile, but there is a limit to the resources available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Dental Hospital is a fire hazard and the conditions for both patients and staff are appalling.  There is an urgent need to commence the long-promised building programme of a new hospital on a site in James's Street.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Dental Hospital was built in 1897.  It was a modern and progressive building in its time which could cope adequately with the 2,500 patients at that time each year.  In 1991, however, the dental hospital caters for between 70,000 and 80,000 patients.  The two buildings which make up the hospital are in such a bad state of repair that they are an affront to our educational and health services.</P>
      <P>In the past 23 to 25 years it has been accepted by all the State bodies concerned that the facilities at the dental hospital were inadequate and in need of replacement.  The situation is extremely serious and the fire officer has issued a number of warnings about the unacceptable fire safety standards.  The hospital administrators can no longer guarantee the safety of patients or staff who use these buildings.  It is simply intolerable that the State allows this to continue. The existing buildings have long outlived their usefulness, and are now quite unsuitable.  The buildings have been condemned after visits from competent UK authorities.  For example, a visit by a group from the British and Irish Specialist Administration Committee for higher training in dentistry described the laboratory facilities as &ldquo;barbaric&rdquo;, while other visitors have described the buildings as a &ldquo;slum&rdquo; and &ldquo;hazardous&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Dental Hospital is an integral part of the national education and health services.  A high proportion of the 70,000 to 80,000 patients who use the hospital are medical card holders.  They are already marginalised in our society and the dental hospital offers them their only means of receiving dental treatment. In the Eastern Health Board area alone, the existing waiting list for orthodontic treatment is approximately 9,000 and the average waiting time for treatment is around four years.  This is quite unacceptable <Col N="477" /> by any standards and reenforces my case for the building of a new dental hospital immediately.</P>
    <P>I compliment the staff and administrators of the hospital on their diligent and hard work and on the level of care they provide.  They have managed to develop a modern teacher-training programme to the highest European standards while being forced to work in horrid, dilapidated, Victorian slumlike conditions.  We should be ashamed at the manner in which these people have been treated by various Governments down through the years.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1.5 million has been spent already on the site and design plans for the new dental hospital at St. James's Hospital, Dubin, both the Departments of Health and Education have long ago accepted the need to build a new dental hospital.  To allow for the expansion of the number of dental patients being treated each year and to continue the excellent work of developing the dental teaching-training facilities in the country, both these Departments must get on with the job of making a start on the proposed new hospital.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and in the Joint Programme for Government, there are grand sentences of intent to develop the health and education services and to provide additional resources for them over a seven year period.  I call on the Government to make a choice in next year's Estimates and provide the necessary initial finance to commence work on building a new dental hospital.  At the end of the day it comes down to commitment and the Government wish either to build this new hospital or to continue talking about it and promising to do so at election time and at key times when programmes for Government are being negotiated.  The best possible present for the Dublin Dental Hospital on its 100th anniversary would be that they would be moving into a new and adequate building before 1997.  I will now quote from paragraph 43 of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> because it makes my point when it addresses the question of adequate levels of service in the public dental scheme:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> The provision of adequate levels of service in the public dental scheme will require the recruitment of additional staff and the training and development of existing staff.  It will also require the re-equipping of existing Health Board dental facilities and the commissioning of new facilities to provide such services.</P>
    <P>The key sentence is, of course, &ldquo;the commissioning of new facilities to provide such services&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 44 of the programme states:</P>
    <P>These structural issues are central to the long term development of the dental service and will be addressed over the seven-year programme.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for allowing me raise this important issue.  I hope the Minister will have some good news in regard to the dental services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Education, may I thank Deputy Byrne for providing me with the opportunity to outline the present situation.</P>
      <P>The need for a new dental hospital and school to replace the existing inadequate facilities has been accepted for over 20 years.  In terms of safety, the fire officer has warned that repeated promises to vacate the premises are not acceptable. On the advice of my Department the Dental School-Hospital Board engaged an independent fire consultant to report on the situation.  This report has been received by my Department and on-going discussions are taking place with Professor Shanley, Dean of the Dental School-Hospital, with a view to effecting certain interim safety measures. However, the proposed improvement measures would only result in a temporary solution and the premises would still not be clinically correct or adequate as a training environment.  The estimated cost of providing the new hospital-school on a site which has been made available at St. James's Hospital is £14 million at 1990 prices.  This figure includes furniture, equipment and fees but excludes £1.515 million already incurred on site development costs and design fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="479" /> Deputy Byrne will accept that it is not just a question of commitment, that resources come very much into play.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the Minister for Health was asked to report on the need for a dental hospital in Dublin.  I am pleased to say that the Department of Health have confirmed that they are satisfied that a dental hospital/school is needed in Dublin, both in relation to the range of the specialist services it provides and the extent of its patient needs.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Byrne said, the dental hospital/school also provides a very important service to about 80,000 patients who visit the hospital annually, most of whom are medical card holders. It satisfies the needs of those who require training, out-patients and those who have no other way of getting dental care.  The hospital also provides treatment for haemophiliacs, HIV positive patients, prisoners and other medically and socially disadvantaged people, many of whom, as the Deputy said, would not otherwise obtain treatment.  The number of patients treated could be increased to about 120,000 per year in a new building.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing training for about 200 undergraduates and postgraduate dentist students, the facility proposed for Dublin would also cater for 75 para-dentist students, while the library and lecture facilities would also be used by medical and nursing students in St. James's Hospital.  At this point, I take <Col N="480" /> the opportunity to place on record my congratulations to Trinity College for deciding to provide out of their own resources and with the support of the private sector a new medical and nursing school building on the site at James's Street, to be commenced in the next few weeks.  As I said, it is accepted that the case for a new dental hospital is well established and the Minister for Education proposes to take up this matter with his colleague the Minister for Health as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that that question of providing such a facility has to be in the context of available resources and overall need for infrastructural improvements in the third level sector generally to provide a very important facility.  Third level enrolments have increased from 42,000 in 1980-81 to almost 75,000 for the current academic year &mdash; an increase of 80 pe cent.  Having regard to the current third level major capital programme, which amounts to about £100 million, a capital provision of about £14 million for a single project must of necessity be subjected to a thorough scrutiny in the context of priorities. However, I assure Deputy Byrne that the Minister for Education proposed having discussions with the Minister for Health in connection with this development very shortly.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.35 p.m. until 10 30 a.m. on Friday, 6 December 1991.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 27 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>Most of the matters covered by Deputy Bruton's and Deputy Rabbitte's questions have already been answered by me in communications with both Deputies. However, in reply to Deputy Spring's question and for the benefit of the House I wish to place on the record a comprehensive account of inquiries I received and responses I issued on all matters covered by the three questions I am now answering.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday 25 September 1991 Deputy John Bruton telephoned my office and requested a meeting with me. I met Deputy Bruton and Deputy Yates within an hour in my office.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton stated that he had been informed that some time ago, Aer Lingus (ALT) commissioned National City Brokers (NCB) to conduct a study on Irish Helicopters.  It was alleged that a copy of the study, or of papers relevant to the study, were subsequently found in a briefcase at Dublin Airport, which allegedly belonged to a director of Certic Helicopters. It was further suggested that when no owner of the briefcase came forward, the case and its contents were given to Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton emphasised that while he could not guarantee the accuracy of the allegations, he had checked them to the best of his ability.  He requested me to investigate the matter and to inform him of the outcome by Friday 27 September.</P>
      <P>I undertook to make inquiries within my Department and through Aer Lingus and to come back to Deputy Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 27 September I replied to Deputy Bruton and copied him with the response <Col N="433" /> I had received from Aer Lingus in the matter.  This confirmed that Aer Lingus were not aware of any briefcase incident but that they had been concerned at information they received as a result of a postal misdelivery to Irish Helicopters. However, following the issue of legal proceedings by solicitors on behalf of Aer Lingus, the airline received assurances in the form sought and &ldquo;Aer Lingus were satisfied that it was unnecessary to take the matter further&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I also informed Deputy Bruton that the 1986 study to which Aer Lingus have referred in their reply was commissioned by the then Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, who engaged NCB to conduct a study into the future financing of Aer Lingus, including possible part privatisation of the company.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus had advised the Department of the dispute between Aer Lingus and NCB and of its outcome.  The Secretary of the Department replied to Aer Lingus stating that he was glad to note that the correspondence between lawyers had led to an outcome which was satisfactory to Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>My Department had no other communication, verbal or written with Irish Helicopters, NCB or Celtic Helicopters on this matter.</P>
    <P>On 27 September Deputy Bruton wrote to me with additional queries.  This correspondence was released on Friday evening September 27 and appeared in detail in all national daily newspapers on Saturday September 28, 1991.  On 28 September I replied to Deputy Bruton stating that the dispute between Aer Lingus and National City Brokers was settled between their lawyers during May 1988.  Aer Lingus then felt that &ldquo;they were satisfied that it was unnecessary to take the matter further&rdquo;.  The then Secretary of the Department noted that the dispute had an &ldquo;outcome which was satisfactory to Aer Lingus&rdquo;.  The Minister and the Secretary did not consider further action was required.  Therefore, neither the Cabinet nor other Departments were advised of the dispute or the settlement between Aer Lingus and National City Brokers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> I informed Deputy Bruton that I first became aware of the dispute at my meeting with him and Deputy Yates at my office in the Department on Wednesday evening 25 September 1991.  The matter of the 1988 dispute, therefore, did not arise during my consideration in 1990 of the chairmanship of Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>On 4 October Deputy Rabbitte wrote to me stating that he was advised that the information which had come into the public domain concerning the Celtic Helicopters affair was only partly true; that he had been informed that no postal misdelivery had taken place but that information had been found in a briefcase at Dublin Airport.  Deputy Rabbitte asked me if I would have the matter carefully investigated and let him know the outcome at my earliest convenience.</P>
    <P>I responded to Deputy Rabbitte on 7 October enclosing a copy of the letter dated 27 September 1991 to me from the Group Chief Executive, Aer Lingus.  I drew his attention to the last sentence of this letter in which the Group Chief Executive states that &ldquo;we are not aware of any incident relating to a briefcase, such as is alleged&rdquo;.  Despite this reply, Deputy Rabbitte immediately published these allegations.</P>
    <P>I therefore felt obliged to issue a press release on 8 October deploring the questioning of Deputy Rabbitte of the veracity of the state-owned national airline, Aer Lingus and the State airport authority, Aer Rianta.  Both companies had issued statements on 8 October &mdash; as Aer Lingus did some time ago &mdash; confirming that no briefcase incident, such as alleged by Deputy Rabbitte, took place.  In addition, a former senior executive of Aer Lingus, Mr. Denis Hanrahan, mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte as the executive who dealt with the matter, had also confirmed that no such incident took place.  I point out that I accepted these confirmations and that Deputy Rabbitte should also do so.</P>

      <P>Aer Lingus are currently engaged in a programme of fleet replacement in respect of their Europen fleet.  Since October 1987, a total of 12 B737 jet aircraft and six Fokker 50 aircraft have been delivered to Aer Lingus.  A further four B737s are due for delivery between now and April 1992. The total cost of these 22 aircraft amounts to approximately $602 million, and will be financed by the airline through a combination of their own resources and borrowing without recourse to the Government for equity or State guarantee of borrowing.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus recently signed an agreement for the lease of a further two B737s to be delivered in spring 1993.  This will bring to 18 the number of new B737 aircraft in the Aer Lingus fleet.  I have no proposals before me for any further development of the airline's European fleet.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus are also planning for the necessary replacement of the North Atlantic fleet during the 1990s.  I expect to receive the airline's proposals in this regard in due course.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to an Adjournment Debate on 17 October last in relation to an industrial dispute in An Post.  In the course of that reply I outlined the various initiatives which I had taken in relation to An Post's proposals to return the company to financial health. These initiatives included: a meeting with the unions representing An Post's staff; discussions involving the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, resulting in a formula for management/union negotiations; my request to An Post to rescind their decision to withddraw from the conciliation and arbitration scheme; and my request to the company to withdraw their viability plan and to replace it with a set of proposals designed to achieve break-even in 1992 and to meet their statutory financial targets.</P>
      <P>I also requested An Post and the unions to participate in discussions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission in relation to both the company's proposals for cost reduction and the question of the payment of outstanding pay awards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with proposals drawn up by the Labour Relations Commission, An Post and the unions have engaged in direct negotiations on measures designed <Col N="437" /> to resolve the company's financial problems. I understand that it has been found necessary to refer a number of priority measures for recommendation by a tribunal under a chairman appointed by the Labour Relations Commission and that the tribunal will have its first meeting on 16 December 1991.  Direct An Post/Union negotiations under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission on the full agenda of recovery proposals are continuing in the meantime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In April 1990 I announced a three-point action plan to assist persons with disabilities: first, in the context of future purchase of buses and trains strict priority will be given to those that suit the handicapped and mobility impaired; second, the programme for adapting both railway and DART stations will be accelerated; and finally, I have instructed the Government's special committee on accessibility and for mobility for handicapped persons to immediately prepare a three-year action programme fully costed and timed to be ready for 1 July to improve accessibility to all forms of transport including sea and air links.</P>
      <P>In furtherance of that plan, a three-year action programme covering all modes of transport was prepared and is being implemented as resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann are committed to acquiring improved vehicles as replacements fall due and already about one-sixth of Bus Átha Cliath's fleet of double deck buses has been replaced by improved vehicles with lower entry steps etc.  Substantial expenditure has been incurred by Iarnród Éireann in the major refurbishment of Tara Street railway station, with the addition of lifts and escalators to platforms, and in the provision of four new accessible suburban railway stations on the Dublin-Mullingar line.  Further improvements to DART and other railway stations will be pursued according as resources become available.  I regret that there are no additional funds at my disposal for the purpose.</P>
    <P>As indicated in paragraph 117 of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> it is Government policy that transport providers must, on an ongoing basis, give attention to improving accessibility to transport for persons with disabilities, as resources permit.  The InterDepartmental Transport Accessibility Committee, chaired by my Department, are charged with establishing priorities for attention and with advising transport providers as to the appropriate measures to be taken in their particular circumstances. In doing their work, the committee have maintained regular contact with action for mobility and other representative organisations concerned.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that in 1989 Teagasc estimated that 70,000 full-time farms had an average family farm income in excess of £15,000 per annum; how this compares with the Revenue Commissioners' own estimates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Statistics are not available to the Revenue Commissioners which would enable a direct comparison to be made with those quoted by the Deputy, which are taken from the Teagasc national farm survey.  There are fundamental differences involved in the family farm income concept and that of gross income for tax purposes of full-time farmers as used by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The Teagasc survey estimated that there was a total of 70,000 full-time farms, and that on these farms the average estimated family farm income in 1989 was £15,765 per farm.  It uses a definition of &ldquo;full-time farm&rdquo; which is basically related to the size of the farm and not to the existence or otherwise of another occupation held by the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey uses a concept of &ldquo;family farm income&rdquo;, the main measure of income used in the survey, which is broadly defined as the return to family labour, management input and farmers' own capital invested in the farm business. It should also be noted that it can be inclusive of the income, so defined, of more than one individual per farm.  Certain items, for example, such as depreciation and valuation of stock changes are treated differently than in the tax <Col N="440" /> code.  The concept is designed for farm management purposes and is not the same as that of gross income for tax purposes. Gross income for tax purposes is basically net profit, that is the profit figure which emerges after business interest and other outgoings are taken into account.</P>
    <P>The latest available Revenue statistics in respect of gross incomes of full-time farmers, which are based on returns received for the income tax year 1988-89, show that the average gross income declared by such full-time farmers for that year is estimated at £10,600.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy on the private sector is not available. Figures are, however, available for increases in average gross weekly earnings in manufacturing industries and these are as follows: 1981, 16.7 per cent; 1982, 12.9 per cent; 1983, 11.7 per cent; 1984, 12.2 per cent; 1985, 8.0 per cent; 1986, 7.5 per cent; 1987, 5.1 per cent; 1988, 4.7 per cent; 1989, 4.0 per cent; 1990, 3.9 per cent.</P>
      <P>Comparable data is not available for the direct public sector in the manner requested by the Deputy.  However, the following is a crude estimate of the gross cost <i>per capita</i> to the Exchequer of public servants and other groups, such as general practitioners in the general medical service, whose salaries, wages, fees, expenses and allowances were met by the Exchequer in the years in question.

    <P>Notes: For the purposes of this calculation, the pay element &mdash; excluding pensions &mdash; in the Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill has been divided by the average total numbers of staff employed.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill covers the actual cost to the Exchequer of the pay and pensions of civil servants, the Permanent Defence Forces, gardaí and teachers and varying amounts are included for pay in grants to health boards and other health agencies, noncommercial state-sponsored bodies and third level colleges.  In some cases, such as expenditure classified as pay in the general medical service, corresponding numbers are not readily available for the purpose of calculating an average.</P>
    <P>In order to have a consistent series, the pay expenditure for the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs has been excluded in the calculation of the above increases.</P>
    <P>Because of the impact of technical factors, i.e., factors other than increases <Col N="442" /> in numbers or pay rates, such as annual increments, on the size of the Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill, year on year comparisons of the Bill should be treated with caution.</P>

      <P>According to CSO data, the proportion of family farm income, i.e. income arising from self-employment and other trading income, arising from premia and headage payments made directly to farmers, ranged from 8 per cent to 15 per cent over the past five years.  Of the total paid under this heading in 1990, 16 per cent came from the Irish Exchequer and 84 per cent from Community funds.</P>
      <P>The EC market support system, which is almost entirely financed from Community funds, also makes a major contribution to family farm income but because that contribution is indirect it is not possible to quantify the percentage of family farm income which it represents.</P>

      <P>Although I have no function in the pricing of car-hire I am fully aware of the concern which has been expressed recently about increases in car hire prices for 1992.  These increases have been attributed to a number of factors including insurance costs, VAT, excise duties, and difficulties in disposing of vehicles due to competition from imported second hand cars.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that Bord Fáilte have had discussions with car-hire firms as to how increases can be minimised and the number of cars available for hire increases. Recent developments such as this year's reduction in VAT rates and the 1 per cent reduction in the insurance levy will go someway towards alleviating car hire costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are committed to maintaining low inflation and downward pressure on taxation levels which in the <Col N="452" /> long run constitutes the best way of keeping our car hire competitive.</P>
