      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices of motions under Standing Order 30.  I observe that the notices given by Deputies John Bruton and Dick Spring relate to the same subject matter and I am calling the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to me.  I now call on Deputy John Bruton to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration: the fact that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has now indicated that he may have to pull down the shutters on the initiative he has taken to establish a framework for talks between the political parties in Northern Ireland.  This requires urgent consideration as the initiative may be brought to an end at any time now.  It is a matter of public importance in that the peaceful development of Ireland depends on finding a political solution to the problems now existing in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I served notice this morning that I wish to raise the matter as follows: that this House views with extreme concern the possibility that the talks being conducted by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland may break down, and calls on the Governmment to facilitate a Dáil debate on the matter and to immediately make a full and comprehensive statement on the issues involved.  I submit this to you, a Cheann Comhairle, because I believe it is a matter of very urgent public business. Before you give your decision, I would say that I view with alarm and concern the fact that there is a special meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges today at the request of the Government Chief Whip to consider the possibility of changing Standing Order 30 procedure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been drawing together the threads of the Government programme for 1987-90 and indicating the progress that had been made under the programme we adopted for that period.</P>
      <P>New factors are now important with regard to the development of our economy. There is the problem with oil and, while the Minister for Energy told us that only 25 per cent of the total oil production comes from the Middle East, nevertheless we can expect pressure on oil prices as long as the war lasts.  The UK economy is faltering badly and the same applies to a lesser extent, to the US economy, so the circumstances which obtained for the first three years may not obtain for the next few years in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>We have been generous to social welfare recipients, particularly the long term ones.  It is heartening to realise that the debt-GNP ratio has been reduced to 111 per cent with the objective <i>pace</i> Deputy John Bruton of reaching 100 per cent in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government regard the Department of the Marine as a major resource based industry, hence the foundation of a new Department of State, Roinn na Mara, to develop that industry.  The new Minister for Defence, as the House knows, laid a very sound foundation for the new Department.  We have £155 million worth of exports in the fishing industry at the moment and an employment content of 15,600 between full and part-time.  The important part of the programme, of course, from the point of view of the Government has been that it <Col N="1688" /> has a very definite regional impact and provides industry and employment in areas where no other industry will set up. Progress was made from 1975 when 8,130 people were employed in the industry to 1990 when, as I just said, 15,600 people were employed.</P>
    <P>We are working under quota restrictions and our fishermen deserve great credit for the development of non-quota fishing, particularly in horse mackerel where they have made a substantial impact and, of course, we have been doing experimental fishing with regard to tuna.  Downstream developments from the actual fish catch are very important indeed.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> we set out objectives for the industry in the medium term, namely, to secure higher value added through improvements in quality and fish processing in Ireland, to increase supply of fish generally through higher take-up of existing fish quotas, additional catches of non-quota species and higher output from the aquaculture sector, to prepare the fish processing industry to compete successfully in the internal market and to increase the contribution of the inland fishery resource to the national economy, particularly through increased tourism.</P>
    <P>The European Community has approved a £7.5 million programme for the provision of facilities such as ice making plants, auction halls, syncrolifts, landing, water and electricity facilities. This programme will be grant-aided by the EC to the tune of 50 per cent.  I opened a major new ice plant at Dunmore East in July 1990 and ice is available to fishermen throughout the day and night.  This state of the art plant represents a total investment of £700,000 and has resulted in a substantial increase in ice production and storage capacity at the port.  Improvements involving smaller investments have been made at a large number of other ports.  Further major improvements are scheduled at a number of ports, among them Castletownbere, Rossaveal and Dingle.</P>
    <P>The exploitation of our fishery resource to maximise its contribution to <Col N="1689" /> the national economy is dependent on the development of our fish processing sector.  Concentrated as it is around our coast &mdash; I have made reference to this already &mdash; processing generates employment and income in the peripheral regions.  Full-time employment in processing stood at 2,160 at the end of 1990 while 1,460 were employed part-time.  It is estimated that almost 80 per cent of the total fish landed is processed in one form or another.  Most of this processing, unfortunately, is of a primary nature and our aim is to increase the amount of secondary and further processing.  Grants for processing, totalling over £4 million, were approved by the EC in 1990.  A Community support framework for the development of the sector has been finalised recently and is expected to result in investment of up to £30 million over the next three years.</P>
    <P>EC aid is also available for the construction and modernisation of our fishing fleet.  Grants towards construction are linked to the limits on gross registered tonnage.  Aid of £1 million towards the construction of five vessels and almost £1.5 million for the modernisation of 38 vessels was approved by the EC in 1990. We estimate that the implementation of these programmes will result in the creation of an additional 1,450 full-time jobs and 1,400 part-time jobs in the period to 1991-93.</P>
    <P>I am committed to a programme of substantial investment to provide adequate infrastructure at strategically located harbours around the country. This programme which complements the investment in harbour facilities already outlined takes full advantage of the EC Structural Fund aid available under the operational programme for rural development.  The programme concentrates on the fishery harbour centres at Killybegs, Rossaveal, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Howth which are owned and managed by my Department, a number of strategically placed secondary harbours such as Greencastle in County Donegal and Dingle in County Kerry and small harbours and piers which cater for needs which cannot be satisfied <Col N="1690" /> elsewhere and which require improvement works.  A sum of £4 million has been provided for these works in 1991.</P>
    <P>In the other areas of the marine significant progress is also being made.  Since 1986 a programme of Exchequer assistance has resulted in the addition of 14 vessels to the Irish merchant fleet.  A further £700,000 will be paid in grants in 1991-92.  The Verolme Dockyard in Cork has been sold and ship repair will begin soon.  Shipbuilding will recommence, in the medium term, employing up to 500 people by the end of 1995.</P>
    <P>Our commercial ports handle about 85 per cent of exports by volume and 65 per cent by value.  They handled over £17 billion of our total trade of £26 billion in 1989 and over £9 billion of total export trade in the same year.  The principal objective of policy in the area is to offset the effects of our peripherality on competitiveness in the run up to 1992.  Projects approved under the EC assisted operational programme on peripherality provide for the provision of new and improved handling equipment, extra berthage, docking facilities and access routes, both road and rail.  A total investment of around £69 million which is being channelled through this programme will assist the development of projects at Dundalk, Drogheda, Dublin, Rosslare, New Ross, Waterford, Cork, Kinsale, Foynes, Limerick and Galway.  Capital expenditures of some £21 million are planned for 1991, the majority of which will be eligible for EC assistance.</P>
    <P>As a parallel strategy to the port development work outlined above, I recently established a group to review the policy and legislation governing commercial harbours and pilotage with a view to updating both.  As the House will be aware, this move has been welcomed. The group which includes a broad representation of interested parties has sought submissions from members of the public and all agencies with an interest in the commercial harbours area.  I am keenly aware of the need to ensure that our ports are competitive in all respects, including their administration, and I am confident that the deliberations of the <Col N="1691" /> review group will help to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>The House will note the provision in my Department's estimate for improved search and rescue services.  It has been a consistent priority of my Department to improve safety and search and rescue services since its inception three years ago.  This is reflected in, for example, the new nationwide marine VHF chain, the sponsoring of significant funding for the RNLI from the Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust and most recently in the Doherty review of air sea rescue services.  In this latter regard there is provision of £1.7 million in 1991 towards the provision of a medium range search and rescue helicopter service at Shannon airport.  This facility has been long sought by the coastal communities, concerned as they are with the efficacy of the search and rescue facilities along our west coast.</P>
    <P>I have also ordered the first formal investigation or public inquiry into a maritime casualty in over 30 years.  It is always difficult in the event of tragedy to balance the anxiety for immediate answers with the time needed for full investigation of the circumstances.  I believe that this inquiry will serve two important functions.  It will enable the circumstances of this accident to be examined in an appropriate sympathetic public forum and it will increase public awareness of maritime safety practices with a view to obviating recurrence of such tragedies.</P>
    <P>A total of £6.75 million is provided for the development of our inland fisheries. This allocation shows the Government's commitment to the continued development of inland fisheries, a resource which is worth a great deal to the economy each year and which on estimate generates the equivalent of some 1,900 full-time jobs.</P>

      <P>The budget could best have been described as a dull, boring uneventful and unexciting news item, one that created only a subdued and muted audience for the first transmission on the national airwaves.  Like those at home, we listened to a lot of talk for a long time but heard very little.  Regrettably the budget will not provide any stimulus for an already slowing down economy.  It ignored not only the glaring need but the urgency to create employment and managed to keep the middle to lower income groups in the highest taxation bracket.  In this budget the Government forgot about our emigrants, and closed their eyes to the reality of a large number of emigrants who will return to our shores due to a slump in the British economy. Regrettably, the budget fails to make any worthwhile improvement in the position of the poorer and weaker sections of our community.  It will cause a deterioration in our health services and a decline in our tourism industry.</P>
      <P>To be fair, in making any assessment of the budget we must respond to and recognise the many external factors which must be taken into account but even when we make allowances for wars and recessions elsewhere the budget when assessed in this light is totally and absolutely disappointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reality the PAYE taxation relief will <Col N="1693" /> do very little to help people at work.  The bulk of middle class earners will get no positive benefit from the budget.  Reshuffling the taxation burden, by 1 per cent, is so immaterial that one may ask if it needs to be done at all.  I am sure the Minister will accept that the real problem with our income taxation system is the speed at which one gets into the 52 per cent income tax bracket.  To make a real and lasting impact on taxation reform, the Minister must at some stage have the courage to broaden the tax bands to allow workers have a realistic income before they reach the 52 per cent income tax bracket.  Last Wednesday's efforts in this regard could be classed as useless.  People with modest incomes will still be on the higher rate of taxation.  Sad to say, there is still no incentive for extra effort, no incentive to do overtime, as 52 per cent of their earnings will go to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are an enterprising party believing people must be rewarded for effort.  Unless people are rewarded for effort and unless there is an incentive to go out to work unemployment will continue to increase, as proved by recent figures.  On the other hand, and equally important, unless there are incentives for employers to create jobs and until the hassle and red tape are removed they will continue to pause and question the value of employing an extra person.  The budget failed to tackle the basic reason for the reluctance of employers to create extra jobs.  It simply costs too much to provide the jobs.  The budget allows this to continue. The budget showed little concern for equity and little willingness to remove the disincentive to work.  In this regard the budget was most disappointing.</P>
    <P>The problem of poverty, the greatest problem in our society which must be our greatest concern, was referred to rather than tackled.  Everyone would agree that the poor and disadvantaged, should benefit from economic progress but yet again in the budget the elimination of poverty remains an aspiration and was not tackled.  A 4 per cent increase in social welfare payments in the context of an <Col N="1694" /> estimated inflation rate of 3 per cent represents a miserly increase, less than £2 per person on unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>The Government must realise that in order to tackle poverty effectively it is not sufficient to go at it piecemeal year by year.  Such an approach may alter but never fundamentally change the structure which perpetuates poverty.  Worse still in the budget the scanty social welfare increases are countered by the increases in electricity and telephone charges due to the VAT increase from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  The construction of this budget indicates the Minister's right hand does not know what his left hand is doing.  Surely he must have realised that the increases in social welfare which he so proudly announced would be levelled off due to the VAT increases on the commodities essential for social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>I now come to what I believe is the greatest disappointment of the budget, the Minister's failure to change the guidelines for eligibility for the carer's allowance. As a result of last year's budget &mdash; I have tabled a question on this &mdash; only 22 per cent of all applicants are successful in receiving the full carer's allowance. This is absolutely disgraceful.  Even more disgraceful is the fact that nothing was done in the budget to make the carer's allowance a reality.  The only step taken, which I welcome, was to include the carers of recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance.  However, the result will not mean that more people will get the carer's allowance but that the number of people refused will double.</P>
    <P>It is hardly a courageous step for any Minister to extend an allowance that so few are entitled to.  It rather reflects an attitude of not caring.  This allowance was intended to be a recognition of the work a carer does in our society.  However, it has turned out to be a public rejection of the value of such a contribution.  It is pointless to introduce a carer's allowance which builds up the hopes and expectations of so many people but is based on guidelines so unrealistic that few can avail of it.  A person would need to be on the breadline to qualify for this allowance. <Col N="1695" /> As long as a carer is assessed as having half the family income this allowance is unworkable.  I cannot express sufficiently my disappointment that the Minister did not alter the income guidelines for eligibility. This must be changed and unless immediate steps are taken the work of the carers of our society, mainly women I might add, will continue to be ignored and unrecognised.</P>
    <P>The budget is a major disappointment too from an agricultural point of view.  A strong, dynamic agricultural sector is the backbone of the Irish nation.  It is regrettable that the Minister once again failed to extend to the farming community the PAYE allowance and PRSI allowance for income tax purposes.  At a time when agriculture is facing its severest and toughest assault, when incomes will be slashed from all sides, the retention of this inequality is most serious.  To allow this discrimination to continue is a serious omission in the budget.  When the PAYE allowance was introduced in 1980 the justification put forward by the Minister for Finance was that it would offset the disadvantage suffered by PAYE tax payers because they were taxed on a current year basis.  Now farmers, and the self employed, are taxed on a current year basis and that surely must justify the extension of the PAYE allowance to them.  Farmers are facing a difficult, competitive and uncertain future.  With falling incomes and increasing expenses due to VAT changes in heating, fuel, electricity and transport the survival of many will depend on a fair, equitable and reasonable system of taxation.</P>
    <P>The VAT imposition on veterinary services is yet another expense imposed on our farmers.  At a time when farmers are compelled to use veterinary services increasingly the cost will be an added burden on them and will diminish their already dwindling profit margins.  The problem of inheritance tax, which is crippling many young farmers today, was to a great extent ignored.  The increase in the rate of agricultural relief under capital acquisitions tax from 50 per cent to 55 per cent is a poor response in the context <Col N="1696" /> of the hardship, impoverishment and misery this imposes on individual farm families and the urgent need for earlier transfer of land to trained young farmers. The elimination of the top two rates may be helpful but it applies only to farms of more than 400 acres and I do not have to say that they are scarce.  Until the problem of capital acquisitions tax is addressed a great threat to many farmers' livelihoods will remain and the Government will be responsible for crippling Irish agriculture.  The budget ignored the many submissions by farming organisations in this regard.</P>
    <P>The increased allocation of £1.2 million to CBF for their promotional activities is welcome.  However, I believe CBF have a limited role in promotion and, therefore, it is difficult to measure how well they have performed.  For instance, CBF are quite inactive in encouraging consumption of beef, port and lamb.  They have made little or no use of local radio which is an effective means of promoting their objectives.  On the export market they have claimed to be a success, but are they?  CBF claim they sold increased quantities of lamb into the French market, but it was at a substantially reduced price.  In fact, some of our competitors would say it was merely dumped.</P>
    <P>I believe Teagasc deserve greater credit than CBF in regard to promotion. They have encouraged farmers to increase production and their biggest success was in the grading of lamb suitable for the French market.  Teagasc's role in promotion work must be emphasised and credit must be given where it is due. CBF's influence in the beef market could hardly be termed effective with so much beef going into intervention.  CBF have not been as effective as they might in promoting meat as part of a good stable diet.  Their reaction to critics of red meat has not been as sharp and incisive as it might be.  Nevertheless, they have a useful role to play.  This funding must be channelled into areas which will give the best return and will influence the health-conscious consumer to consume meat.  In a recent interview published in a daily <Col N="1697" /> newspaper Mr. Pat O'Neill, chief executive of Avonmore Co-Operative and former director of CBF, stated that he limits his consumption of red meat to once a week.  Such a comment on the part of a former director is hardly helpful. However, I wish CBF well but the effect of their promotional work is not as visible to the farmers as I would wish.</P>
    <P>I note that Teagasc have been allocated an extra £1.2 million in the budget.  With a deficit of £3 million already, surely inadequate funding of this proportion is the way to force such an organisation to die. How can they continue to operate with a deficit approaching £2 million?  The only option I foresee for them is to lay off yet more staff and sell more property leading to an even more reduced service to farmers at a time when they were never more urgently needed to help them cope with their financial difficulties, to undertake the necessary reduction in production and, more important, to cope with their threatened future.  I am amazed at how quiet their chairman, Mr. Rea, has been on this thorny issue of the funding of Teagasc.  It is my opinion that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, with the help of our Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. MacSharry, is allowing Teagasc die a slow, painful but silent death.  In fact, Commissioner MacSharry's proposals to cut production and put in place extensive farming methods spell the death of the future of Teagasc which has been a proud organisation.  The provision in this budget will keep Teagasc afloat for a time but with the dangerous prospect of their sinking into oblivion ultimately.</P>
    <P>The extension of stock relief for another two years is welcome.  Again, the Minister has failed to deal with the real problem obtaining, namely, that in the current year many farmers will be forced to sell stock to make up for falling incomes and clear debts incurred on financial investment to control pollution. Unfortunately, this will result in farmers being liable for an exceptionally high income tax bill if they sell stock.  The Minister in his budgetary provisions should have allowed stock be sold where <Col N="1698" /> a genuine financial problem existed and then allow a no stock relief clawback. Here, again, the budget ignored the underlying crisis in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The termination of the business expansion scheme to hotels, guesthouses and self-catering accommodation has been a massive shock to all involved in the tourist industry at a time when that industry is targeted as having the greatest potential for job creation.  It is nothing short of an assault on that industry that the Minister for Finance should have withdrawn such a major incentive.  While we all accept that the provisions of the scheme were abused, surely the way forward lay in tackling the causes of such abuse rather than indulging in the ultimate step of its total abolition resulting in genuine, worthy applicants being the real sufferers?</P>
    <P>In my constituency of South Tipperary one can cite many examples of preparations under the provisions of the business expansion scheme being well advanced with large sums of money having been invested by people who will now be forced to abandon their plans, losing out on their massive financial investment.  In one case I have in mind there are plans to develop a 15-bedroom, three-star hotel with the prospect of employing 24 people.  This will prove to be a real casualty of this budget.  At the time of the Minister's Budget Statement a detailed plan had been submitted to Bord Fáilte and endorsed by them, an architect having been engaged and detailed plans prepared.  Agreement had been reached with a neighbouring property holder to acquire a piece of land necessary to facilitate this development. Planning permission had been sought, detailed projections prepared, negotiations entered into with various financial institutions and a comprehensive submission made to the Revenue Commissioners in addition to detailed legal work being underway, the full cost of which was estimated to be in the region of £30,000.  I emphasise that such expenditure was incurred in good faith on the basis of the business expansion scheme then operating.  If this development does <Col N="1699" /> not proceed &mdash; and it cannot without resorting to the provisions of the business expansion scheme &mdash; effectively the costs incurred to date will have been wasted. Yet, commitments entered into will have to be honoured.  Indeed, it must be doubtful now whether the current business can be maintained, thereby putting existing jobs in jeopardy.  That is just one example in my constituency of the alarming effects of the proposed termination of the business expansion scheme.</P>
    <P>While I accept that the provisions of the scheme must be examined in their entirety with a view to eliminating their abuse, they must be retained for genuine, worthy applicants for whom there will be economic benefits to be derived.  To eliminate the business expansion scheme as abruptly as is proposed is too severe and will have detrimental effects in many areas.  I am glad that as a result of the arguments and objections voiced from this side of the House the Minister at least has agreed to review the scheme. It is my hope that such review will result in its retention for those applicants who have already initiated plans to benefit therefrom.</P>
    <P>The health aspects of the budget are particularly worrying.  For example, the proposals to extend hospital eligibility to top income earners &mdash; at a time when there are many overcrowded wards and long waiting lists &mdash; defies basic common sense and any economic logic.  Increasing demands on ever-reducing resources does not make sense.  It has become clear now that no health board will have any hope of operating within their proposed allocation unless they implement further health cuts.  I contend it was deceitful of the Minister to provide only £8 million to an area with an already accumulated deficit of £20 million.  It is my belief he thought he would get away with it but I warn him that the impending crisis will be worse than the hardships endured in the health sector over the past three years.</P>
    <P>This budget is not about reform; rather it is about survival.  This budget is about keeping a marriage together with no <Col N="1700" /> thought or concern being given to the extended family.  Indeed, this budget has an unstable foundation and uncertain future, ignoring the demands of our society, their achievements being considered unimportant.  The welfare and prosperity of our people have been sacrificed for the survival of one party locked in the past and that of yet another party lost somewhere between the past and the future.  Both parties have failed to provide any answers to the challenges of the future resulting in the welfare and prosperity of all out people and the future of the country being sadly ignored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition parties, predictably I suppose, have already severely criticised this year's budget.  Fine Gael in particular have criticised Fianna Fáil for going in the wrong direction, maintaining that our policies are headed in the wrong direction.  In fact, Fine Gael have now resorted to using cartoons to underline the wrong directon they claim Fianna Fáil are taking.   While those cartoons may be amusing, the problems that Fianna Fáil had to address in 1987 &mdash; after the dismal failures of the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition Government of 1982 to 1987 &mdash; were far from amusing. The facts are there all over the place, in jobs, inflation, interest rates and so on. For example, let us take unemployment. In 1981 the percentage of the labour force unemployed was 9 per cent which figure had risen to almost 18 per cent when the Coalition left office in 1987.  Under that Coalition Government business confidence collapsed, consumer demand stagnated and building activity was about half what it had been in the early eighties. Indeed, the men in white coats from the International Monetary Fund were at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>To make a further specific point, in August 1986 our currency was devalued by the Coalition Government to ensure that German investors in Irish pounds would receive up to 8 per cent more on their investment.  Talking of the wrong direction, the performance of the Government since 1987 has been quite remarkable under all headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" /> Turning to this year's budget I see it as being the first step in implementing the recently concluded <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  Its predecessor, the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> from 1987 to 1990, was the major contributor to the economic progress made in that period.  The present programme is based on consensus.  Goals have been worked out and agreed by Government and by the social partners, the trade unions, the employers and farmers.  The goals have been translated into policies in the programme with a clear understanding by all involved of the constraints and qualifications that apply in the implementation of the provisions of the programme.</P>
    <P>One can scarcely refer to these two programmes without paying tribute to the role played by NESC under the chairmanship of Pádraig Ó hUigínn.  The NESC reports have built up the capacity and the will among the social partners in addressing a range of national issues. Through their reports they have made a direct contribution to Government being able to build up a national consensus as reflected in this and in the previous programme.</P>
    <P>We are now more than able to pay our way in the international arena.  Up to 1987, document after official document underlined the problems of the young, the old and the disadvantaged but unless the debt was tackled as it was tackled by Fianna Fáil from 1987 onwards we would all by now be disadvantaged.  Take inflation &mdash; we have amongst the lowest rates in Europe.  This was done over the last three years side by side with an average annual growth rate of 4 per cent.  To November last the inflation rate was 2.7 per cent, among the lowest in the OECD countries and actually lower than in Germany which is a bastion of anti-inflationary policy.  Wage inflation over the last three years has been contained because wage constraint was built as an ingredient into the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The result is that Irish industry has <Col N="1702" /> become much more competitive, a competitiveness which was essential for success in the fiercely competitive markets of the UK and mainland Europe.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government from 1982 to 1987 talked a great deal, but did little about tackling the basic problems facing the country.  Borrowing as a percentage of GNP was 13 per cent in 1986.  This year it is 2 per cent and the Minister last week said that he aims to bring it below 2 per cent, so that our ratio of percentage of borrowing to GNP is now very respectable by international standards.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer obviously pays a lot of the interest to service the debt.  It is still too high but the debt is now falling and therefore the amount of interest paid is falling and the demand on the taxpayer, particularly the PAYE taxpayer is falling. There have been other achievements. Take-home pay in the last few years has gone up and it is seen to have increased. Confidence has been rediscovered and the building and motor industries, which were on their backs for the first half of the eighties under the Coalition, are now fighting again.  Jobs continue to remain a major challenge for the Government but from 1987 to 1990 40,000 new jobs were created.  Those at work increased by 40,000 at a time when the number of public sector workers was reduced by 15,000.  This net increase in employment applies across the board, in the building industry and in private services.  However much needs to be done.  It is true that the PAYE category in particular are paying too much interest to service the debt and it is important to reduce the debt further. Any housewife must work within a budget and it behoves our financial administrators to behave like housewives in controlling the national budget.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for the Marine suggested earlier in the debate, the international trading environment is more uncertain than it has been for the past few years.  The UK and the US are in a recession and added to that we have the Gulf conflict.  In addition to the human suffering brought on by the Gulf conflict there is the real threat that oil prices could shoot up again and this would <Col N="1703" /> adversely affect growth here and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is also the temptation to postpone investment at a time of uncertainty in relation to major investments like houses and cars and in the case of industrialists, they tend to be more cautious about investing in factories, machinery and plant.  We are, after all, a small vulnerable open economy.  This is the time to have cool heads.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing a progressive budget while at the same time maintaining financial discipline.  Despite the difficult environment the basics are sound.  Our financial base is right.  Our economy is sound and the nineties should offer more promise than the eighties.  I see the budget therefore as a strategic step in ensuring that the nineties will be better than the eighties.</P>
    <P>In relation to the details of the budget, the penal taxation levels imposed by the Coalition Government from 1982 to 1987 had to be tackled.  After all the key to growth, and that is the magic factor for prosperity, is incentive and enterprise. The Fianna Fáil Government since 1987 have succeeded not alone in reducing the debt but in reducing tax simultaneously. The standard rate of tax fell over the last few years from 35 per cent to 29 per cent. The highest rate has dropped from 58 per cent to 52 per cent.  VAT rates have been reduced from 25 per cent to 21 per cent and tax exemptions have been focused particularly to help the lower paid.  I appeal to the Minister to devote more resources in future to broadening the tax bands as there is still a major problem of earners reaching the high rate of tax too quickly.</P>
    <P>The basic philosophy behind the business expansion scheme was and is sound.  It was concerned with channelling funds into small enterprises.  We have a lot of savings but they are not being channelled specifically to small investments and small enterprises.  Our savings are in the long term financial institutions. The business expansion scheme therefore was designed to channel this risk capital into smaller enterprises.  Of course, there <Col N="1704" /> have been abuses, serious abuses, and something had to be done, restrictions had to be imposed.  Investors in the BES could get a return of 20 per cent without risk to themselves as investors.  The taxpayer should not and was never intended to be a bank manager to investors. Having said that, the Minister could look sympathetically at certain aspects of the scheme.  There may be transitional problems in the case of investors and they might need to be tackled between now and the implementation of the Finance Bill.  I would ask the Minister to look at that.  Furthermore, the lifetime restriction of £50,000 on one investor seems a bit excessive, and the Minister might also look at that.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker, among others, referred to social welfare payments.  Fine Gael have criticised the budget under all headings.  I have already dealt with the dismal performance of Fine Gael in office, but the parties of the Left, Labour and The Workers' Party do not have a monopoly on concern for the unemployed and the less well off in this country.  The reality is that Fianna Fáil have a consistent and honourable record in relation to catering for the weakest in our community.  This year's budget is one in a succession of budgets which have set out to help the less well off and the unemployed in particular.  For example, the 4 per cent increase this year for all social welfare recipients is ahead of inflation and increases of up to 11 per cent are provided for in the budget for those on lower incomes.  The reality is that 100,000 people will benefit from these special increases in the lower income category.</P>
    <P>I am particularly glad that the question of social benefits and social insurance for part-time workers has been addressed in the budget.  Many people, especially women, work fewer than 18 hours per week.  At present they have no unemployment benefit if they lose their jobs, no disability benefit if they become ill and no pension provision.  This is a most enlightened step in the welfare area taken in this year's budget.  About 21,000 part-time workers will now enjoy social <Col N="1705" /> insurance protection.  We will have the opportunity to discuss this matter at greater length when the part-time workers Bill is introduced shortly by the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>Part-time work is here to stay.  That is the European experience and it has to be faced up to in the context of statutory benefits for such workers.  Many women require the flexibility to work less than 18 hours a week because they must attend to household and family duties.  Many of them need the money for household and family commitments.  There is a case for giving protection to women in particular who need to work part-time for financial and other reasons.  Equally, employers need the flexibility in their workforce to combine permanent and part-time workers.  The budget rightly protects 21,000 part-time workers who work less than 18 hours a week.  This is a most imaginative and necessary step because there are examples of exploitation of part-time workers.  The very least they need is the statutory protection afforded by social insurance.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the education area.  Several imaginative steps have been articulated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and specifically addressed in the context of the budget for the coming year.  The budget addresses the vexed issue of excessively large classes in primary schools.  A deliberate policy is now underway to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools to 25:1.  This is most welcome.  There is provision to put in place the first group of primary teachers by September 1991. The balance will be appointed in the following year to meet the target pupil-teacher ratio of 25:1.</P>
    <P>Equally the secondary school area has been addressed and the intention here is to provide enough teachers over the next two years to reduce the ratio in second level schools to 19:1.  I am glad that the third level issue is again addressed.  As somebody who has been in academic life at UCD for many years, I am all too aware of the fiercely competitive entrance requirements to third level institutions.  In 1991, 1,200 additional <Col N="1706" /> places will be provided in third level institutions.  This is most welcome.  This follows the measures taken last year to permit further third level places in 1990 and it marginally eases the points requirement for entry.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the Government contribution, together with the contribution from the private sector, for the purchase of Carysfort College.  This purchase will assure the preservation and use of the college as an educational institution.  The main UCD activity there will be the post-graduate business school, but in addition UCD will take in an additional 600 under-graduate students as part of the package.</P>
    <P>If I were to summarise the budget, I would put it as follows.  I congratulate the Minister on the balance he has struck among differing needs at a time of uncertainty. In office one has a responsibility to discharge and any Minister for Finance is faced with an array of competing demands for a range of public services. A balance has been struck here, despite a range of competing demands, against the background of, uncertain international environment.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the maintenance of financial discipline in our budgetary affairs and in relation to the national debt.  The stranglehold which the debt level had on this country is being eased and it is the Government's intention to ease it further.  Tax rates have been seen to be reduced and incentives have been increased.  Incentive and entrepreneurship are the key to economic growth, which is an essential requirement in the provision of greater resources for the public services.</P>
    <P>The needs of the less well off have again been vigorously addressed.  Welfare rates are ahead of inflation.  Particular attention is paid to those on low incomes and the long term unemployed, educational services have been improved at all three levels and tax reliefs have been focussed on helping the lower paid.</P>
    <P>I welcome the budget and congratulate the Minister for Finance on a job well done.  It is a remarkable achievement in a difficult environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>At this time of the year the Government of the day allow us, through their budget proposals, a glimpse of the direction in which they intend to lead the nation.  We are given an opportunity to see who is to be taxed and by how much and what the various sectors will be paying.  We also see what sectors are to gain.</P>
      <P>Budgets provide the ideal opportunity for Governments to chart new courses, to tackle problems by redistributing and targeting resources, by taking taxes from those most able to pay and by spending this money in a a manner that will be of most value in the development of our society.</P>
      <P>Economic miracles have been performed by this Government, according to the shouts of the Taoiseach and his Cabinet.  The reply of the 250,000 unemployed is that this claim is balderdash. They know that for them the miracle of getting off the dole queue and into a job has not yet been performed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government and this budget are total failures.  What has been presented to us in this budget provides no remedy to the single most important issue affecting the nation &mdash; the issue of jobs.  Let us look at the jobs crisis in the Dublin area alone where there are 74,000 persons on the live register.  That is some record to be proud of.  In addition to this figure, over 40,000 people who would otherwise be part of the labour force have emigrated from Dublin since 1981.  Dublin, with 29 per cent of the population and 31 per cent of the labour force, has an incredible 32 per cent of national unemployment. This is leading to undue concentration of the nation's problems in the capital city, with the corresponding depressing effect both socially and commercially.  Unemployment, particularly long term unemployment, has been consistently higher in Dublin relative to other regions.  Despite this, Government policies have continued to move jobs away from Dublin.  For many Dublin people long term unemployment has become a fact of life.  The problem is so severe that it is disgraceful that this budget goes nowhere near alleviating the <Col N="1708" /> unemployment crisis in Dublin.  In fact projections show that by 1996 Dublin's labour force will have risen to 408,000 people, and although it is difficult at this stage to estimate unemployment in the city for 1996, if no new jobs are created the total unemployment in Dublin could rise to 120,000 people.  Even allowing for emigration we will still be left with an unemployment problem in Dublin of at least 105,000.  To achieve the job creation figures necessary the jobs rate has to be stepped up to a minimum of 8,000 net new jobs each year.</P>
    <P>Given that the 1991 <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for only 20,000 net new jobs for the entire country, it is therefore clear that the jobs challenge facing Dublin is particularly disturbing, and the dread of a life lived on State handouts will be the ever present testimony to the miserable performance of this Government on behalf of the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance spells out his Government's failure by audaciously stating that he is allowing in the budget sufficient funds to pay for the increases in the numbers of unemployed people when he speaks of a further 3,300 people being thrown onto the dole queues. Already we have seen the unemployment figures for January go up by a startling 4,900 people.  So much for economic miracles. Talking about miracles and all things religious, I could not help feeling that the Minister, Deputy Reynolds in his budget speech really wanted to believe that he was St. Vincent de Paul. His sanctimonious clap-trap that this budget is about achieving &ldquo;greater social equity&rdquo; and that his Government were intent on &ldquo;mitigating the extent and effects of social segregation in housing&rdquo; would make one laugh if it were not so serious.  This Government have the distinction of not building a single local authority housing unit in Dublin city in 1989. Since 1932 this is the only time that this has occurred.  That is one record for Fianna Fáil to be proud of.</P>
    <P>So much for saying that the Government have a strong commitment to the poor and the disadvantaged in our <Col N="1709" /> country.  Try getting the 4,000 people on Dublin Corporation's housing list to believe that, or the 600 or 700 officially homeless on Dublin Corporation's housing list.</P>
    <P>As I am on housing, it is outrageous and a contradiction of the stated intent in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> which is to mitigate the extent and effects of social segregation in housing, that the Government now intend to follow and implement one of the most discredited policies of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Coalition which is to give financial handouts to local authority tenants to get them to vacate their homes and entice them into the private house market.  Have they not learned anything from this former Coalition Government's disastrous policy?  How does one equate the policy of bribing and seducing those families in local authority housing schemes out of their communities and into the private house market with the aim of &ldquo;mitigating the extent and effects of social segregation in housing&rdquo;?  This will reinforce segregation.  It will further add to the marginalisation of local authority tenants.  It will create more ghettoes and concentrations of socially deprived people.  This has already been proven. Ask any of the housing authorities.  Ask any of the groups involved in public housing policy.  Ask the religious orders, both nuns and priests who, because of the disastrous housing policies of successive Governments are now themselves living among those marginalised communities as community activists and as tenants.</P>
    <P>This policy must be seen as a cheap attempt by the Government, first, to generate business for the private house builders who are having difficulties selling their houses at the moment and obviously agreed to after the Government had been lobbied by the CIF; second, to generate more vacancies in the local authority market in order to deplete the growing numbers of people on the housing lists; third, to put off the day that they must restart a serious public house building programme.  This discredited policy of providing financial inducements to tenants in local authority housing schemes <Col N="1710" /> must not be implemented.  The only people who will be eligible will be those in employment.  These people are often the community leaders and activists and the tenants providing the highest income to the local authorities through the differential rent scheme.  When one attracts these away from their communities one is, in the long term, providing for dangerous ghettoisation, marginalisation, and a consolidation of an ever-increasing and concentrated underclass.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to social welfare and look a little closer at what is on offer. Against the backdrop of the gorilla-like dances being performed by various Ministers who keep jumping up and down, beating their chests and shouting &ldquo;look what I am doing for the poor&rdquo;, we see that the majority of old age pensioners are getting only £2 per week increase. With inflation running at three or four per cent by the time this increase is due to be paid in July and with the increases and the cost of heating, electricity, clothes and footwear and the annual increase applied each year for those who are tenants of local authorities, it is likely that instead of being better off the poor will, in many cases, be poorer.</P>
    <P>Where is the commitment to a statutory minimum wage or a statutory minimum income?  Instead of reversing the gap between people with work and those without, this budget has widened the gap.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is committed to a four per cent increase for workers over the next year.  However, because of their much lower basic rate, four per cent as applied to social welfare recipients means that the gap will widen.  We in The Workers' Party do not want a deeply divided two-tier society with widespread social devisions.  That is why in 1983 we welcomed the Minister for Social Welfare establishing a commission on social welfare to &ldquo;review and report on the social welfare system and related social services and to make recommendations for the development having regard to the needs of modern Irish society&rdquo; which in 1986 reported its famous recommendations which were to lead us into this &ldquo;modern <Col N="1711" /> Irish society&rdquo;.  If, since that time back in 1986, successive Governments were to have implemented its recommendations, £62 per week, not £50 per week, would be the minimum payment for a single person and £100 for a couple, not £83 as proposed in this budget.  I hope that the Minister knows how much difference that £12 per week would make to the standard of living of a person in receipt of social welfare.  The recommendation to move by 1993 to the priority levels of rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare and now as proposed by the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is totally insufficient.  It is virtually meaningless as most people on social welfare would have reached the levels promised by 1993 in any case.</P>
    <P>Again the Minister ignores the fact that the commission recommended that a differential of the order of 10 per cent should be maintained between insurance and assistance payments.  He is now allowing an unemployed single worker with full insurance benefit or unemployment benefit only £50 per week.  This happens to be the same as for people on unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance.  The Minister is in fact penalising insured workers who must now be asking what is the point of paying insurance at all if insurance on the allowances they will get is only the same as unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare benefit.  He is, in fact, penalising insured workers who must now be asking, &ldquo;what is the point of paying insurance at all if the benefit we will get is only the same as people on unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance receive?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With all the shouting and self praise by the Minister, his backbenchers and the Taoiseach, about his care and concern for the children of the nation, nothing, not even a brass farthing, not even 2? per cent in line with inflation will go to the children of the nation under the child benefit scheme.  Families with one, two or three children will get nothing, and those with a fourth child will have to wait <Col N="1712" /> nine months, until October of this year, to get that increase.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance was heralded as a great breakthrough by the Minister last year.  The Minister said there would be in excess of 8,000 carers benefiting.  It is, therefore, disgraceful that at least 1,200 applicants have been refused the allowance. Instead of the projected figure of 8,000 people benefiting under the scheme, as forecast by the Minister, only 3,500 received the benefit.  That represents a shocking 55 per cent fewer than was anticipated and the allowance is made worthless to the vast bulk of carers in our society because of the strict means test regime being applied by the Minister. He is discriminating against the most honourable members of our society, people who sacrificed a better life in marriage, a career or career opportunities to devote themselves full-time to the care of an ailing parent, brother or sister, or family member.  They are not getting anything and that is a disgrace and a condemnation of the Government's position.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind Members of the question I asked the Minister for Social Welfare about the cost involved in organising a conference last summer in Galway.  I want to criticise the Minister for Social Welfare for spending more than £140,000 on a conference on poverty and the disadvantaged in Galway city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt Deputy Byrne merely to advise him that some five minutes now remain of the time available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, a Cheann Comhairle.  The conference appears to have achieved little or nothing and seems to have been designed primarily to promote the image of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, during Ireland's Presidency of the EC.  According to the reply to the question I tabled last week, the cost of organising the conference, excluding salary costs of the Department officials, ran to an incredible £140,000.  I understand that officials of the Department were involved in the planning of the conference over a period of several <Col N="1713" /> months and, when this is taken into account the final cost is likely to be closer to £200,000.</P>
      <P>While I fully agree that there is a need to bring voluntary organisations together to discuss problems of poverty and the disadvantaged, in this case the huge expenditure involved seems to be totally disproportionate to the results of the conference. Other than an announcement by the Minister that he planed to draw up a charter for voluntary social services activities in Ireland &mdash; something we are still waiting for six months later &mdash; nothing of any significance appears to have emerged from the conference. Some of my constituents are living in dire poverty, face an endless struggle to feed and clothe their children and are expected to live for a full week on amounts which are less than the nightly accommodation costs of some of the participants at the conference in Galway.</P>
      <P>I find it impossible to explain how the Government can justify the expenditure of public money on expensive hotel accommodation, lavish meals and expensive wines for delegates at this conference when at the same time my constituents are told there is no money for housing, no money to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare, no money to properly maintain local authority dwellings, no money to assist the plight of those with mentally handicapped dependants and no money to pay voluntary carers who are staying at home to look after aged parents.  The conference was primarily a very expensive public relations exercise for and on behalf of the Minister and as such was a scandalous misuse of public money, money that would have been better injected into, for example, services for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the reduction of the age limit for pre-retirement allowances from 60 years to 58 years announced in the budget.  The slogan of the Government clearly is, &ldquo;you are too old to work at 58 years of age&rdquo;.  Imagine providing unemployment pensions to people aged 58.  This will artificially reduce the <Col N="1714" /> number on the live register.  The Minister by introducing pre-retirement allowance schemes for persons over 60 years of age on long term unemployment assistance has artificially reduced the live register figures by in the region of 5,000 per annum.  Reducing the age limit to 58 years of age not only indicates a political sleight-of-hand but also indicates the Government's acceptance of their inability to create more jobs.</P>
    <P>When payments started in March 1990, 4,731 people transferred from unemployment assistance to pre-retirement pensions.  The total number now in receipt of the pension is 6,104, and, with the age limit being dropped from 60 to 58 years, the projected increase expected from those now qualifying at 1,000 per each year of age, that is 1,000 of those aged 58, and 1,000 of those aged 59, will bring the figure for those on pre-retirement pensions to 8,104 persons.  Doubtless, the Minister will herald this 8,104 drop in the number on the live register as an achievement.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us he has maintained the level of service for people with a mental handicap.  However, the parents and families of people with a mental handicap see the quality and level of services continue to deteriorate every day.</P>

      <P>They are paying the cost of years of successive Government's neglect and inadequate planning.  Why do so many of our children have little or no service?</P>
      <P>The Government may put a brave face on the £1 million that has been allocated in the budget but how is it to be spread around the country?  This £1 million must be seen in the context of the Eastern Health Board's figures requiring £11 million to care for those on the Eastern Health Board's priority waiting list.  I appreciate that my time has run out. There is a lot more I would like to have said but I will have many a day in other years to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget this year is in keeping with the responsible budgets that Governments have brought in since 1987.  I am not going to go over the improvements in the economy that have been brought about as a result of the responsible manner in which the Government have managed the affairs of the country.  In the time available to me I intend to deal with the health services.</P>
      <P>This year, as in previous years, the Government after very careful analysis decided on the amount of money that could be made available to each of the public services.  For the health services £1,426 million has been made available in the current year, the largest amount of money ever made available by any Government in Ireland for our health services since the foundation of the State. That includes £100 million extra than was in the Book of Estimates and a further £8 million to be targeted at certain community services.  It is also important to recognise that when I became Minister in 1987, 18 per cent of what the Government provided from the Exchequer was allocated to health services in 1987.  This year that is up to 22 per cent, which is an indication of the Government's commitment to ensuring that we maintain a very high level of service and develop the service where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Opposition parties complaining about health services and it is no harm to give one other statistic.  In the years 1982-86, there was a decrease of 0.5 per cent in the amount of money in real terms provided for the health services. From 1986-1991 there has been an increase of 5 per cent in real terms.  In the past two years there has been an increase of 18 per cent in real terms in the amount of money provided.  There has been an increase this year for health boards of 5.7 per cent which means that the Southern Health Board will receive an increase of £6 million over their original allocation last year, the Mid-Western Health Board will receive an increase of £4 million and the South-Eastern Health <Col N="1716" /> Board will receive an increase of £5 million.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to ask where Fine Gael stand, on the one hand they say we are spending too much money and, on the other, they come in here day after day and say we are not spending enough.  It is time they made up their minds and if they believe we should spend more money they should tell us where they want to impose the taxation to raise that money.</P>
    <P>The year 1990 was exceptional for the health services in a number of ways.  The number of beds in the health service increased by 1,000.  We now have 12,000 acute hospital beds in the health services and there has been an increase of 2,000 in the number of staff working in our health services over the last 18 months. This is not an indication of a service in decline.  Productivity increased during that time.  There has been an increased level of activity of the order of 4 per cent to 5 per cent.  For example, the number of hip replacement operations at Cappagh Hospital increased by 40 per cent in 1990. The waiting lists for tonsils and adenoids operations in Temple Street Hospital was reduced by a half in 1990.  The year 1990 was exceptional in another way.  For example, we had the major 'flu epidemic, something which we have every eight or nine years.  That had an impact on the service in the first quarter of the year.  If we cast our minds back to this time last year we will remember that the Opposition parties were complaining in exactly the same way as they are complaining at present and as they have done over the last three or four years.</P>
    <P>Another interesting feature worth recording is that the Garda clamp down on drink driving in December had a major impact on the level of activity in accident and emergency departments by reducing the level of activity significantly. That is something about which we can all be very pleased.</P>
    <P>Last year's budget provided £5 million to be specifically targeted towards the elderly and £2 million to be targeted towards those with mental handicap.  I am glad that similar stages have been <Col N="1717" /> included in the Estimate this year so that the new services provided out of that money are being retained this year.  A further £3 million for the elderly and £1 million for mental handicap have been provided in this year's budget so that we can bring about more improvements for these people.</P>
    <P>It is worth putting on record some of the improvements that have taken place as a result of the £5 million provided for the elderly last year.  In the Eastern Health Board area 20 separate beds were provided at Baggot Street Hospital and ten new occupational therapists, four physiotherapists, 42 community workers and 50 care attendants who will provide the new home help care in the area have also been provided. Similarly, the other health boards increased their services for the elderly. Services provided for the mentally handicapped include 149 new places half of which were in the Dublin area, respite places for 200 mentally handicapped persons, 442 new day places and 25 new staff.  It is important to recognise that this Government protected in a very real way the funding for mental handicap services. In 1986 £58 million was provided for these with a mental handicap; in 1991 that figure has been increased to £81.6 million to all the voluntary agencies who look after those with a mental handicap.  That is an increase of 40 per cent and is well ahead of inflation.</P>
    <P>As I said, the 1991 level of funding to the health boards has increased by 5.7 per cent.  Of course, I recognise that 1991 will be a difficult year.  Indeed, since the health boards were established &mdash; I was a member of a health board for 17 years &mdash; every year has been a difficult year. Health services internationally are facing exactly the same problem trying to deliver more and more services to meet the demand with a finite resource.  It does not matter what country you are in, that is a finite resource.  The United States were spending 12 per cent of GNP on this area and they too have their problems. Britain and other European countries also have problems.  These problems are worldwide.  Because of the expensive <Col N="1718" /> developing technology and new transplant operations of all descriptions, countries cannot meet the increased demand from a finite resource, and we are no different from the rest of them.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, as a result of the money provided this year by the Government, the health boards will be able to sustain their activity at the 1990 approved level.  As I said, the Government divided the money allocated among the various Departments.  They allocated money to my Department and it is my responsibility to ensure that that money is divided equitably and that it is well spent. When it comes to spending money there are, and always will be, competing priorities.  An ongoing debate over the past ten years has been whether to put any extra money which becomes available into the hospital service or the community service.</P>
    <P>In my view, there is a consensus that we should not continue to spend the extra money that becomes available in the Community rather than in our hospital services.  This is recognised and spelt out very clearly in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  If we continue to spend all the extra money on the hospital services, effectively we will choke the system because the logic of spending the money in hospitals and not developing our community services is that more and more people will find themselves in hospital beds when they might be more appropriately treated elsewhere.</P>
    <P>At present there are a number of elderly people in our acute hospitals who have completed their acute medical treatment and are waiting to be placed in a home for the elderly or in their own community with support services.  There are also a number of physically disabled people who are permanently in acute beds in hospitals.  David Kennedy, in his report, recognised these facts, and we have also recognised them.  We want to spend the extra money coming on stream in the community so that we will build up our community services and provide places in the community for those who need them.  The ideal is to be treated in the area most appropriate to your need. <Col N="1719" /> Apart altogether from the health economics, that is what we want in humane terms.  People do not want to go into hospital unless it is absolutely necessary. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> spells out very clearly the direction in which we should be going.  I believe there is a consensus to go in that direction, despite the fact that Opposition Deputies are saying that we should put more and more money into the acute hospital service.  We heard that again this morning from Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the use to which the 12,000 beds in the hospitals have been put.  My view is that more use should be made of day care beds and five day beds. I am informed that in the US if a person goes into hospital in the morning to have an appendix removed, he can return home in the evening.  I am not suggesting we should do that here, but that is the direction in which medicine is going.  If you look at the statistics for the hospitals in this country you will find that some hospitals have moved very far in establishing day care beds &mdash; and are doing an excellent job &mdash; while other hospitals have been a little behind.  That is one of the areas we must address.</P>
    <P>The Government are very concerned about getting value for money.  I compliment the health boards, the voluntary hospitals and the other voluntary agencies on what they have done over the last ten years in terms of getting better value for money and improved efficiency, but there is still room for improvement.</P>
    <P>The Foxe group, which we established, looked at the health services and identified a number of areas about which we are speaking to the agencies at present. I will give an example.  By combining purchasing of the implants used in hip operations the voluntary agencies &mdash; who provided these operations &mdash; were able to save 28 per cent on the cost.  I am satisfied that if the health boards control their expenditure carefully and maximise savings, they will be able to maintain the approved 1990 level of service throughout 1991.</P>
    <P>While I accept that every effort has to <Col N="1720" /> be made to control expenditure, I also accept that there are certain schemes in the health service which are very difficult to control and that one cannot put a finite figure on demand-led schemes, for example, the long term illness scheme and the drugs refund scheme.  I recognise that these schemes can put pressure on health boards and on the other services that health boards provide.  We are looking at what measures we can take this year to alleviate that particular difficulty for the health boards.</P>
    <P>I remain concerned, as I am sure every Deputy in the House does, at the cost of drugs, £150 million or about 10 per cent of what we spend on our public health service.  While the fundamental principle is that a patient is entitled to have available to him or her the medicine necessary for their illness, nevertheless I believe there is an obligation on the prescriber first, to ensure, that the correct volume of drugs is prescribed so that extra drugs are not left lying around people's houses and, secondly, if there is an equally efficient drug available which costs less, to prescribe that drug.  Within the coming weeks we will circulate a national formulary to doctors and general practitioners which will help them to make balanced decisions between the needs of the patient, which are paramount, and good economics.  I might also mention here that last year we achieved agreement with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries which will save approximately £10 million on the cost of drugs in the current year.</P>
    <P>As in previous years, a number of the health boards have requested a meeting with me and officials of my Department. Of course, I am always glad to meet with the chairmen and chief executive officers of the health boards.  I would have to say that such meetings have always been constructive and very useful from both our point of view and the point of view of the health boards involved.  It is wrong to suggest that something new has happened this year, as Deputy Ferris said on radio yesterday, and that health boards have rejected their budget for the first time ever this year.  I am glad to see <Col N="1721" /> Deputy Sherlock in the Chair as he is a member of a health board who have regularly rejected their budgets, and not just since we came into office.  It is not unusual for health boards to reject their budgets initially, to then come and discuss with us how they can live within their allocation and to look again at their budget.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  This programme is very important for the health service because it outlines the consensus which exists on the way our community care services should be developed.  I believe that when we develop further our community care services it will take pressure off hospital services.  I have already referred to people who have been placed in the hospital service and who might more appropriately have been placed in the community.  The programme spells out very clearly the direction in which we are going in the development of our community care services.</P>
    <P>I am sure every Member of the House agrees that every person is entitled to live and be supported in their own homes for as long as possible.  Fortunately people in Ireland receive great support from their own families, a practice which should be encouraged.  My colleague the Minister for Social Welfare took account of this support in the budget last year by providing for a carer's allowance, which he has extended in this year's budget.  We have also taken account of it in the provision of respite care facilities for the elderly and for those with mental handicap.</P>
    <P>The programme provides for the development of community services, day care facilities, home help facilities, public health nursing services and day hostels and for more respite and residental care for the elderly, those with mental handicap, those who are psychiatrically ill and the physically disabled in our society.  I would refer to the provision of £1 million in the budget for child care services which will lead to an improvement in those services. Hopefully the legislation on child care will be passed by the Seanad during <Col N="1722" /> the current session so that we can start to implement some of its provisions.  Last year £3 million extra was provided for the dental service.  A further £3 million is being provided in the current year to continue the improvements in the dental service.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to eligibility.  The present position is that the three million people resident in this State are entitled to a public bed in a public ward.  This will not change.  At present persons in receipt of over £16,700 pay their consultant but after 1 June they will not be obliged to do so.  At present there is no restriction on the number of beds a consultant may use in a public ward for private patients but after 1 June it will no longer be possible to have private patients in public wards.  Therefore, the new arrangement will free up a number of public beds for public patients.  This change was recommended by the Commission on Funding, NESC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The Government and the social partners also agreed that it would be in the best interests of the Irish people.  I do not believe this change which will be implemented from 1 June will have any impact on the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme.  As I have said, at present everybody in the State is entitled to a public bed in a public ward. However, ninety nine per cent of subscribers to VHI are paying for a bed even though they are entitled to it free.  I do not think there would be any major change in that regard.</P>
    <P>The management of health boards is important.  At present we are working on proposals to improve the structures in the Dublin area including all the major hospitals.  We propose to establish a performance audit unit within the Department which will help to improve the efficiency of the service.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would ask Deputies not to be alarmist and to think of the effect their scaremongering has on the public and the relatives of patients.  We have a good health service.  Tens of millions of items of service are delivered every year and there are very few complaints about <Col N="1723" /> them.  I have already referred to the massive amounts of money put into the service. We want to ensure that a caring, efficient and effective service will continue to be available to all who need it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> published prior to the budget, the Government recognise that more needs to be done in the areas of employment and taxation. However, on budget day it seemed everything changed.  While a televisual cosmetic presentation gave the appearance of a small nod in the direction of tax reform, once the broadcast ended and the make up was washed off it became clear that it was all an illusion, a sort of political &ldquo;Muppet Show&rdquo; in which Kermet the Frog, in the guise of the Minister for Finance, told interesting sounding stories which were sadly lacking in substance.</P>
      <P>The so-called tax reforms were nothing but a political mirage.  The hard-pressed Irish taxpayer, at the end of it all, was left lost and stranded in a labyrinthine maze of tax impositions and levies.  For those in employment the presentation of change and reform is no more credible than the imagined oasis in the mind of the deranged traveller wandering lost in the sun-baked heat of a distant desert.</P>
      <P>Our current tax system is a major disincentive to economic growth, investment and work.  In an economy which is crying out for enterprise and initiative, the Minister's approach in the budget further entrenches current problems that confront this country.  The Minister has failed to implement anything of real substance in the budget.  In the context of the budget's impact on the Government's financial projections, and its implications for current expenditure targets, I do not believe it will meet the Minister's announced expectations.  In human terms it failed entirely to focus on the need for jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowhere is the Government's failure seen greater than in the area of taxation. The Government have abysmally failed to implement the tax reform measures <Col N="1724" /> that are so badly needed.  The tax system stifles initiative for those in employment by denying them realistic rewards for additional hours worked.  For employers it makes the cost of creating badly needed extra jobs too high at a time of economic uncertainty and high bank interest rates.</P>
    <P>In the context of tax reform the focus on a percentage reduction in the standard rate or the highest rate as indicative of a commitment to reform is a nonsense. Indeed, the Progressive Democrats' chairperson this weekend confirmed that in his view equally it is a nonsense.  What sense is there in the Minister publicly congratulating himself on reducing the top rate of tax from 53 per cent to 52 per cent if in the same budget he imposes additional levies on those paying income tax, which result at the end of their day in their net take home pay being effectively reduced rather than increased?</P>
    <P>If tax rates are reduced but allowances are not increased in step with inflation the change effected is inconsequential. In this country too many tax payers on modest incomes by European standards pay tax at the higher rate.  Single workers begin to pay 48 per cent as soon as their income reaches £10,000.  The 48 per cent is in reality 56 per cent when PRSI and other levies are added.  The single worker hits the top rate of 60 per cent, taking into account PRSI and other levies on an income of £13,000 gross per annum.</P>
    <P>The problem with our income tax structure is not simply the tax rates but the low allowances and the narrow tax bands.  At too early a stage a worker slips out of the standard rate to find himself in the 48 per cent and then the 52 per cent rate.  If it is accepted that tax reform is an essential component of an employment strategy, the budget, in merely tinkering with the tax system, is a dismal failure. Not only does the budget do nothing to promote employment, it is anti-jobs.  It is in dealing with employment that the Minister appears at his most misleading and confusing.</P>
    <P>The budget arithmetic is based on a presumption that the overall number out of work during 1991 will be 228,000. Within two days that figure was blown <Col N="1725" /> apart with the announcement that as of 31 January of this year, the day on which the Minister delivered his budget speech, there were in excess of 241,000 people on the live register.  Did the Minister, when he delivered his speech on budget day, know that figure and conceal it or was he simply blissfully unaware of it, relying on employment projections that had no basis in reality?  The real number unemployed is, of course, not simply the 241,000 as shown on the live register on 31 January 1991 but is in reality 265,000 when one takes into account the large numbers currently involved in training schemes.  In the midst of a growing world recession it should have come as no surprise to the Government that many of those who had gone abroad in search of jobs had returned to these shores.  What is surprising is the Government's abject failure to address the crisis with which we are now confronted, either in the context of its impact on the Government's financial projections and its implications for current expenditure targets or in human terms on the focus needed to create jobs.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is the Government's confusion, and lack of coherence, more clearly seen than in their approach to tourism.  The Government's three year programme targets tourism as &ldquo;a sector identified by Government as a major axis for economic development&rdquo;.  The programme acknowledges that the tourist industry currently accounts for 6.5 per cent of GNP, almost 7 per cent of exports and sustains 6.8 per cent of total employment. It sets the following targets for 1991 to 1993: increase annual overseas visitor numbers by 1.4 million to 4.5 million; increase overseas revenue by £250 million and create 15,000 new jobs. The strategy for achieving this target is said to include the provision of a more attractive and wider product range.  The programme states that fundamental to this strategy will be an extra £270 million investment by the private sector to further expand tourist capacity by the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>It was to be expected that, having regard to the need to create jobs generally, the targeted new 15,000 jobs in <Col N="1726" /> tourism and the strategy stated in the programme, the budget would contain innovative positive proposals.  What one would not expect in the budget, is that specific steps would be taken to sabotage multi-million pound projects designed to create the new jobs and provide the wider and more attractive tourist product envisaged by the plan.</P>
    <P>In seeking to ensure that the business expansion scheme was not a tool of legalised tax evasion, the Minister took a sledge hammer to crack a nut and, in so doing, effectively jettisoned an essential part of the programme strategy for tourism. Just one week after the Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan, who now has had added to his portfolio the Communications brief, had at the headquarters of the Industrial Credit Corporation heaped praise on the impact of the business expansion scheme funds on the tourist industry and launched a new £6 million project for four hotels, his colleague, the Minister for Finance, pulled the hotel rug from under him.</P>
    <P>The question must be asked, why did the Minister for Tourism and Transport &mdash; so well documented in the <i>Irish Press</i> in which there is a picture of the Minister with those involved in the launch of a new BES £6 million project &mdash; launch that scheme, praise it, and exhort the general public to invest in it when a week later the Minister for Finance pulled the rug from under him and effectively said the scheme could not operate. Why did a State agency, the Industrial Credit Corporation, become involved in that way?  Who was misleading whom on 22 January when the Minister gave his ministerial approval to that scheme while one week later, like magic, the Minister for Finance in this House waved a wand and said that schemes of that nature were no longer permissible?  If such a decision was contemplated why did the Minister for Tourism and Transport appear at that launch and exhort the general public to invest in the scheme?  If the issue had not been discussed at Cabinet prior to 22 January when the hapless Minister delivered his speech, when was it discussed <Col N="1727" /> and what consideration was given to the consequences of the budget day announcement?  Apart altogether from the legality of the manner in which the scheme was curtailed by an order of this House on budget night, which is legally questionable, what future credibility can now attach to public policy pronouncements by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications? From where will now come the £270 million which the programme envisages will be invested by the private sector in the tourist industry?  In the current economic climate what sane hotelier will turn to the banks to raise money at high interest rates to provide the more wide-ranging, attractive facilities sought by tourists which the plan acknowledges we need?  Was the Minister's endorsement of this scheme simple incompetence or is there some other reason?</P>
    <P>The confused thinking of the Government in this area is further illustrated in the same section of the three-year programme which envisages other means of financing tourism development.  Under the programme the Department of Tourism and Transport &mdash; in conjunction with Bord Fáilte and the IDA &mdash; are &ldquo;to examine the question of extending incentives to internationally mobile tourism projects where Bord Fáilte certify that existing capacity in Ireland is inadequate and where there is clear market demand&rdquo;. What does that mean?  Will we give grants to foreign companies to undertake investment in Irish tourism while at the same time abolishing tax incentives that encourage those working in Ireland from investing in tourism?</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a more simple theory to explain the actions of the Minister for Finance.  At a time of political volatility within the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; a volatility which will, no doubt, increase as a result of the obvious disappointment on the faces of so many backbenchers when yesterday's Cabinet scuttle was announced &mdash; perhaps the Minister for Finance thought it prudent to dump my Dublin South ministerial colleague in the political manure and to put him off track <Col N="1728" /> in case the succession race starts in the Fianna Fáil Party in the not too distant future.  At a time when the political distaste of the Minister for the Environment for his Progressive Democrats junior Minister has evolved to such a degree that he fends off all other political enticements and informs the media &mdash; and indeed anyone else who would listen to him in the days preceding the scuttle &mdash; that the junior Minister and himself would be together until death parted them &mdash; no explanation is too implausible. Indeed, a less likely Romeo and Juliet, in the political sense, is difficult to envisage.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this budget to resolve our problems of unemployment. While it may be true that the Government cannot create the jobs that are needed it is also true that it is the duty of the Government to establish an environment that leads to the creation of jobs. While debt control is important, debt control and debt management of themselves are not sufficient.  In the context of this budget a major question mark also hangs over the credibility of the Minister's growth target and his announced borrowing requirements.</P>
    <P>Last Friday the Minister for Labour announced changes in the various existing training schemes.  The problem is that, no matter how many training schemes of a temporary nature the Government apply to the unemployed, training schemes are nothing but a political elastoplast to bind some of the cracks that exist in the context of our major unemployment problem.  All training schemes do is to hide the true level of unemployment.  Indeed, on the day when the live register figures are announced at the end of each month stating the numbers who, at that date, are registered as unemployed, there should also be an obligation on the Department of Labour to announce the numbers who, on that date, are on training schemes. While revamped and better training schemes can extend new skills to those on the live register, all the training schemes and all the good intentions in the world matter little if, at the end of <Col N="1729" /> such schemes, there are no jobs for those who have been retrained.  The experience of many who have been on such training schemes is that, while they are welcome, at the end of them they are back on the unemployment register and with little prospect of a job.</P>
    <P>If it were not for the possibilities of obtaining employment abroad, particularly in Europe and in America, we would have had in excess of 300,000 currently unemployed in this country.  The growing worldwide recession is now seriously diminishing the job opportunities abroad and will result in many young people who in recent years would have gone abroad in search of jobs remaining at home and many of those who have gone abroad and who are out of jobs returning home.  Unemployment is now at 18.5 per cent and I do not believe that the day, tragically, is too far away when unemployment will hit 20 per cent.  There is only one member state in the EC with worse unemployment figures than ours, that is Spain.  In the European employment league we are in 11th place in a league of 12.  If the Taoiseach was managing a football team as opposed to leading a Government, and if he had that sort of record, he would have been sacked long ago by the people who employed him.  I predict that if we remain 11th in the unemployment league in Europe &mdash; and we are rapidly heading into 12th place &mdash; it will not be too long before the people see through the public relations exercise of the Government and realise that their economic policy, which they pretend to be implementing in the context of tackling unemployment, is of no more substance than the emperor's clothes.  Eleventh in a league of 12, so much for the credibility of the Government's self-proclaimed success in the area of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>No one on this side of the House gains any pleasure from having to say that the tragedy is that the 1991 budget will go down in the political and economic history of this country as an opportunity tragically lost.  In the context of the lifetime of this Government it will go down as the start of its unravelling and decline. <Col N="1730" /> It will also be the start of the process which will result in finding a place on the Opposition Benches and I hope the Fine Gael Party will then have the opportunity in Government to tackle the fundamental problems which the Minister for Finance failed to address one short week ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1991 budget has received some rather sparkling press titles, from a Jack Charlton style budget to a boring, cautious or reassuring budget.  Given the difficult times in which we find ourselves and the most uncertain international climate, I would best describe the budget as a responsible one.</P>
      <P>For many years I have called into question the validity of the annual budget concept.  The concept of an annual budget is fast becoming outdated in modern times.  Annual budgets were perhaps valid in years gone by when communications were slow and the outcome of planning could be more predictable than today.  We live in a fast moving world of modern technology and computers with instant information.</P>
      <P>I often wonder if it is a valid exercise any more to focus our fiscal planning on one day in the calendar year.  Indeed, it has become a parliamentary theatrical experience where we have the Minister with his battered briefcase facing a battery of photographers and where we slavishly follow an archaic British system. As everyone in business realises, the organisational affairs of a business firm need to be monitored constantly, practically on a day to day basis, if they are to be operated successfully.  I wonder if what is required are more budgets during the year and constant monitoring of the situation.  As the House is aware, much of the groundwork is done in preparing the Estimates and in the case of the Estimates for 1991 much of that work was done in preparing the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which excellently binds together a three year pay pact and a ten year horizon plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to get back to the concept of focusing our attention on one day in the year as if this will be the panacea for all our economic ills.  We should grasp this <Col N="1731" /> opportunity, and the Minister should make no apology to the House, to state that if more budgets are needed, so be it. If a budget is needed in one or three months time, there should be one.  People should not fear budgetary planning; quite the reverse.  The old attitude, that the price of one or two items will be increased which in turn will lead to an increase in revenue, is archaic and no longer obtains. That is a matter we need to focus on in the future.</P>
    <P>I would now like to comment on those areas where this statement on our financial affairs could have been of practical assistance.  One of these &mdash; and this is becoming a bone of contention for me year after year but I must focus on it again &mdash; is our attitude towards the Third World.  This country provides 0.18 per cent of its GNP in overseas assistance. Our allocation this year is £43.7 million and a little over £10 million in bilateral aid.  These figures, in the context of United Nations' recommendations, are lamentable and we ought to be ashamed of ourselves so far as our attitude to the Third World is concerned.  It is not as if I am not conscious of where the money has to be found but we need to contribute something in the order of 0.7 per cent of GNP if we are to reach the United Nations target.</P>
    <P>Let us pause a moment to think about what is happening in the Third World. Those of us who have had the opportunity to work there and see at first hand the position on the ground find it extraordinary how out of touch we are when it comes to providing funds and assistance.  It has been projected that 15 million people are living at starvation levels.  To put this figure in context, because people get spaced out with figures and numbers, this represents 1,500 people starving to death each day for the next 30 years.  That is an enormous number of people.</P>
    <P>As a nation, we are very conscious of this problem and respond in a very generous manner when any appeals are made.  However, the Government should give a very strong lead in this area and I <Col N="1732" /> appeal to the Minister to take a very strong, practical look at ways of improving the position.  This is also an area where there is all-party support and no divergence of views between the parties in our attitude to the Third World.  We need to set in train immediately a committee to arrive at a consensus and decisions which could be put to the Government for approval.  It should no longer be considered as a charitable hand out.  A few years ago the Brandt report indicated that there is a duty and obligation on developed countries; and indeed on some less developed countries, to assist the Third World.  This is a primary obligation and should be addressed.</P>
    <P>The figure has been squeezed from a little over £20 million to £10 million; in other words, we are paying lip service to the needs of the Third World.  With regard to the bilateral aid programme our money is primarily going to Tanzania, Lesotho, Zambia and the Sudan but, in the context of what is needed, it is a very small amount.  I do not believe for one moment that we should make any apology if we were to request the people of Ireland to make a direct contribution by way of taxation.  While we may find it a little difficult to put this to the people I have no doubt that if it was explained to them that they would be contributing to the Third World, they would be willing to pay a little extra by way of taxation.</P>
    <P>There are many voluntary organisations, including Concern, GOAL and others, doing fine work abroad which I have seen at first hand.  The fund of goodwill in Third World countries towards Ireland is immeasurable.  Indeed, if one were to look upon it with a cynical eye, one would rapidly see that economic projects would be given to Ireland if we showed a more generous attitude towards the Third World, and I appeal to the Minister to bring about consensus with the political parties to do just this.  I am aware that the Minister with responsibility for this area is very anxious to ensure that a formal approach is put in train as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to address a number of other aspects of the budget.  Realistic <Col N="1733" /> economic growth of 2.25 per cent is achievable given our past record.  I realise that we will have to proceed with caution but that figure can be achieved.  If there is any possibility of a fall back in growth for certain reasons, such as this horrendous war in the Gulf, we will have to be prepared to cut our cloth to suit our measure and not lose the economic gains we have made in recent years.  Our country has been brought back from the brink of the very serious financial difficulties of four years ago to the present low levels of inflation which are very acceptable.  However, there is always a temptation to let go of the reins and the economy is at the stage now where we must be very cautious about that.  No matter how great the temptation to do otherwise we must hold very firmly and keep a strong attitude towards maintaining good financial management.</P>
    <P>In regard to VAT rates, anybody involved in the implementation of the tax figures &mdash; I am speaking about people operating them on a day to day basis &mdash; must find these very awkward.  We are talking in terms of a low based rate of 12.5 per cent and a higher rate of 21 per cent.  There is a need to harmonise VAT levels and the EC have demanded that we do so, nonetheless, I feel a more practical way of approaching that question is to bring the two figures into line immediately and work either up or down on a single figure, say 15 per cent VAT. That can be operated successfully without great difficulty but separate levels can be difficult to operate.  Certainly the 21 per cent level will be difficult to calculate. I put that thought to the Minister and perhaps he will do something to implement it and maybe consider it in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The upper limit of taxation has been reduced from 53 per cent to 52 per cent and that is an excellent indication.  I have always been firmly convinced that taxation should never go beyond 50 per cent which I feel is a psychological barrier.  A higher rate is beyond the level of ownership. At that level people may feel that their just reward for labour is not being returned to them.  Up to 49 per cent could <Col N="1734" /> have a tremendous catalytic effect on people's preparedness to invest more into this economy and so reach that rate as quickly as possible.  Overseas levels have been brought down and the upper limit was reduced to 40 per cent.  That has the opposite effect, the effect of encouraging greed, overheating the economy too quickly, and damaging it.  I have never thought that jobs can be purchased. Employment cannot be created by just pumping money into the economy and hoping jobs will come as a result of that. Job creation lies directly with investment. The incentive of an upper limit which is not too high and will not work against investment either overseas or within the country should be effective.  I have always held that view and I have spoken to people who are in a position to create jobs and they agree with that.  Therefore, I suggest that be examined.</P>
    <P>The section 23 provision referred to in the budget has been extended for another year to provide rent free and tax free incentives to build more apartments, flats, houses and so on.  The Minister should be very careful here.  Deputies who represent city constituencies know that a great deal of very bad development has taken place directly as a result of section 23.  Overcrowded, cluttered developments have taken place in congested areas.  This will be a bad legacy for the future.  Such homes appear very attractive at the start but when people have been living in them for a time they tend to become a little shabby, run down and worn out, particularly if their occupancy is increased by extended families and so on.  For the remaining year the Minister should set up some watchdog system to monitor this type of development. The standards should be examined. A quality index should obtain in respect of section 23 rather than the obsession we have with price.  These properties should be graded.  With the extension which is to take place in the inner city next year, 1992, the tax exemption will be a grave temptation to maximise profit and to build more of those awful duplex apartments, as they are <Col N="1735" /> called which are most unsuitable for families. These are the kinds of apartments which have led to builders maximising profits in the inner city.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to set a standard programme for section 23 exemptions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to reiterate my opening comments.  We should not slavishly follow a system of the annual budget.  I would like to see a system of monitoring the economy perhaps monthly as happens in many firms, and Ireland Incorporated is no different from any other system.  The 4 per cent increase in social welfare benefits is welcome given the fact that inflation is much lower than that.  I would like to see a greater amount, but what is provided is a step in the right direction.  I congratulate the Minister on preparing the budget, difficult as it was.  I am glad he held fast and took a reasonable attitude and did not fall into the old trap of giving away when the gain would be a Pyrrhic victory and the loss would be ultimately at the expense of the well-being of the country. Our investment is for the future and this was recognised in the budget.</P>

      <P>Let me commence by wishing my colleague, Deputy Chris Flood, every success in his new appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Health.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the cooperation of the social partners with the Government in producing an incomes policy.  I did so on the day that agreement was reached though it has not yet been ratified.  Since reading the complete document I have reservations I want to place on record today.  This document &mdash;<Col N="1736" /> the NESC Report, <i>A Strategy for the 1990s</i>&mdash; stressed the need for stability, continuity and consensus in the country if the environment for investment and economic recovery is to be harnessed. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> certainly provides this but goes much further.  The benefits for industry of an agreement of this kind can be significant. There have been comments about the arrangements for pay increases and how these will affect industry.  But if we compare the position of industry with that of our trading partners we find that this agreement &mdash; all going well and economic growth being in any way reasonable &mdash; is good for Irish industry.</P>
      <P>Incomes are forecast to grow by an annual average of 3.6 per cent though, with drift, it could be as high as 4.5 per cent, perhaps even 5 per cent annually over the period of the agreement.  If we set this against German forecasted rates of increase, of between 5 per cent and 7 per cent, and British rates of increases of perhaps 9 per cent to 11 per cent, then we see that the agreement, compared with the costs of labour of our trading partners, is a good deal for our industry. One forecaster estimates there will be a 3 per cent productivity gain so that, in effect, the cost to industry will be perhaps 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent in real unit wage cost terms, half as much as the German unit wage cost increase, perhaps as much as one-fifth of the British unit cost increase.  Therefore, on the industry side, this agreement would appear to offer a good deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern has been expressed at the rise in the public service pay bill which now accounts for 38 per cent of all current spending and approximately 53 per cent of current spending if debt charges are ignored.  The public service pay bill will increase by at least 8 per cent, perhaps as much as 11 per cent or 12 per cent, this year with further substantial increases next year.  Some contend that the way to deal with this problem is to buy out public servants, to render more redundant.  I am not too sure that that would be very wise.  It is a very expensive process.  For example, between the years <Col N="1737" /> 1987 and 1990 a figure of 9,680 public servants were bought out or made redundant at a cost of £127 million or £13,000 per person.</P>
    <P>We should at least examine the possibility of introducing here voluntary national service.  We have rates of unemployment which simply cannot be sustained and a potentially enormous growth in unemployment figures rather than any reduction therein.  Already there has been provision made in the Minister's Budget Statement for an average increase of the order of 8,000 this year. What is wrong with examining the possibility of voluntary national service? Could we not have used that £13,000 per public servant in order to buy them out of their jobs to create jobs in our national Defence Forces?  Have we examined the cost in terms of vandalism, of health care, in the area of drug abuse, in terms of running prisons, of people being left hanging around street corners in many of our flat complexes and residential areas, particularly in Dublin but in other parts of the country as well?  Where is our imagination?  Why are we not addressing these issues?  Why did the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> not address this issue?  That is one issue it did not address, while it did address others it should not have addressed.  Obviously, the public service pay bill increase is of grave concern at a time when the Government have been struggling to deal with the serious problem of public finances.  I say &ldquo;have been struggling&rdquo;, since it is clear that this year caution has been thrown to the wind to a great extent.</P>
    <P>In the recent budget, increases in line with inflation have been conceded with growth rates touching 5 per cent in three of the past four years.  Public expenditure was being controlled in absolute terms. Growth ensured that the debt/GNP ratio would be stabilised and gradually reduced from 129 per cent in 1986 to 112 per cent last year although the European average of 12 per cent is now 58.4 per cent.  Ireland is the second highest in that league just behind Belgium, just ahead of Italy and Greece.  But with growth this year of perhaps 1 per cent only &mdash;<Col N="1738" /> certainly not the 2.25 per cent allowed for in the Minister's Budget Statement &mdash; a further reduction cannot be expected from growth alone.  Yet public spending is set to rise at perhaps three times the rate of inflation.  This has resulted in an overall tax rise of 6 per cent in this year's budget, in a year in which inflation will be 3 per cent only.</P>
    <P>Public servants are entitled to be paid; incidentally I include in that TDs, elected public servants.  I make no apology for saying that all public servants are entitled to be paid.  But consideration must be given to abandoning the current arbitration system applicable to public servants, replacing it with the same labour relations and Labour Court procedures as pertain to the private sector.  I am not saying we should jettison that arbitration system tomorrow but that an alternative should be given consideration.  The arbitration system was introduced in the fifties when few public servants were unionised.  The public service, unlike the private sector, is now 100 per cent unionised. With the possible exception of TDs and Senators, almost everybody else in the public service, whether appointed or elected, is a member of one union or an other.  The special system which provides for arbitration within the public service &mdash; without any adequate appeals procedure for the employer, the Government &mdash; is antiquated and needs to be reviewed.  I see no reason that the normal labour relations and appeals procedures applicable to everybody else in the State should not apply to public servants.  If there were, then perhaps TDs could take a case to the Labour Court about their own pay and conditions.  However that is another day's work.</P>
    <P>What is the answer to the budget arithmetical conundrum?  The answer is to broaden the tax base and refine the process of public expenditure cuts which cannot be done by one or two political parties; it requires political consensus.</P>
    <P>The NESC report says that, for our economy to prosper, we require economic consensus among the Government and the governed.  In that whole process <Col N="1739" /> we must ask ourselves: who is being omitted? The answer is that this House has been omitted; we have not been involved in that process.  It is time and it is the Fine Gael position and policy, that this House was involved.  This can be achieved by all parties in the Dáil, together with the social partners, signing an economic accord, forming a national forum to address those difficulties.  The Fine Gael Party propose the creation of a Select Dáil Committee, including all the party leaders, which would meet representatives of the social partners, as a national forum, to once and for all break with petty party bickering and advantage in order to maximise the efficiency of our economy and create maximum employment.  This generous offer should be taken up by the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat Parties without further delay.  It should be grasped with both hands.  It is what the country needs and it is not only for economic development reasons that it should be seized.</P>
    <P>Earlier I expressed reservations about the PESP.  My reservations are that it is essentially undemocratic in that the deal was done largely by civil servants and trade unions not only without Dáil consent and participation but without 12, 13 or 15 members of the Government participating.  It is clear that the first most members of the Government knew about this was when they read the document at its launch.  This is not healthy, especially since commitments have gone beyond pay into the arena of health services, education, youth services and women's issues among other things.</P>
    <P>What role have employers or trade unions in signing an agreement of this kind without reference to this House? Who represented the poor, the emigrants or the unemployed at this meeting?  Who represented the people who will be affected by the housing crisis facing this country?  These items were not on the agenda, and they should not have been, but items akin to them were on the agenda.  If we had a national forum to include the leaders of the parties in this <Col N="1740" /> House and other Members as a select committee, joining with representatives of NESC, the social partners and so on, to introduce legislation to give effect to a consensus reached, just think of what we could do in terms of planning proper expenditure cuts, broadening the tax bands and so on.</P>
    <P>Due to the adversarial political system which operates, one or two parties operating on their own cannot deal with these problems.  We are making a generous offer.  It is not a Tallaght strategy, mark 2.  In the Tallaght strategy we had responsibility without authority.  We are offering to take our share of the responsibility if we have some authority in relation to where cuts will be made.</P>
    <P>All the macro economic statistics show that unemployment is frightening and that it has the potential to get worse. Without being in Government Fine Gael will take their share of the responsibility in dealing with the problem, even if it means making difficult choices on expenditure cuts and in relation to broadening tax bands, if we are around the table with everybody else and have some authority.  This generous offer, if taken up, would reduce party bickering which prevents this country from maximising its economic advantage, thereby increasing unemployment.  It is vital that it be taken up.</P>
    <P>There is only one body which represents the people as a whole and that is Dáil Éireann.  The Dáil must be involved in the process of social and economic progress so that all the people, however lowly in economic terms, have their views taken into account when economic and social accords are being reached.  We are nine years from the turn of the century and emigration is drying up and unemployment is rising or is stabilising at unacceptable high levels.  Let us get together to sort out the problems.  Is that not what we were elected to do?  Is it not a fact that as the party system operates, we are becoming irrelevant as parties and are playing off each other, saying that one will do something better than the other? What is wrong?  NESC sets it out.  With consensus, stability and continuity being <Col N="1741" /> extended into the political sphere, the best brains in this House can get together and isolate petty self interest groups outside of this House who play us off against each other to the national disadvantage. The two members of the Government present in the House should take this generous offer back to Cabinet with them.</P>
    <P>As public service spokesman for my party I protest at the slow progress being made in abandoning what I call the sliding hatch mentality in certain sections of the public service.  It is totally unacceptable that people should have to talk about personal affairs through a hatch with other people as observers.  That is taking voyeurism too far and it is a gross invasion of the privacy of citizens.  Fine Gael will proceed with a Private Members' Bill requiring all sectors of the public service to make provision for people to have their affairs dealt with in private.</P>
    <P>I also protest at the malpractice of the Department of Justice who are again referring representations and inquiries from Members to the Minister's office. No matter what Government are in power that is an abuse of the rights of Members and the public.  It is also a waste of public money and it should be of concern to this House for that reason.  A simple inquiry by my office as to the laws concerning citizenship was referred to the Minister's office when the Department realised the inquiry was from a Deputy. They said, &ldquo;we can deal with members of the public but not with a Deputy; sorry, I will put you back to the Minister's office&rdquo;.  The Minister's office, when contacted, ask one to hold on and they go to the citizens section, get the information and then give it to the Deputy.  That is a gross abuse of the rights of Members of this House and a waste of money.  Who do these mandarins in the Department of Justice think they are?  If this continues there will be a major row in this House.  I will look for explanations from the people whose job it is to ensure that money spent in the Department is spent wisely and well.  It is an abuse of public spending, an abuse of public servant's time and an <Col N="1742" /> abuse of TDs time.  I will also ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to ensure that the rights of Members are protected.</P>
    <P>We are facing very serious economic difficulties.  We got together in a national forum to consider the Northern Ireland problem and we were able to come up with some agreement.  We would have less difficulty in coming up with agreement in an economic forum, particularly if it included the social partners.  I commend that policy decision of Fine Gael to the House and I hope the offer will be taken up.</P>

      <P>At the outset I congratulate my colleague and very good friend Deputy Chris Flood on his elevation to office.  He has served his constituency and this House well.  I have no doubt that he will bring renewed vigour to the health portfolio.  My heartiest congratulations, good wishes and felicitations.</P>
      <P>There can seldom have been a budget which has excited such a variety of responses, sometimes contradictory, sometimes negative and sometimes positive, as has this budget.  We had characteristically what could most charitably have been described as a load of drivel from the main Opposition spokesperson, Deputy Michael Noonan of Fine Gael. He trotted out during the course of his response a tortuous script distinguished by some odd metaphors and quips which evidently passed in his mind as humour. Reading his script, as I did last night, I was reminded of the fact that his television producer was, in a previous existence, associated with Bosco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin stockbroking community also come in for some chastisement in this matter.  They have been extraordinarily diverse in their views.  &ldquo;The budget is deflationary at a time when the pace of economic activity has slowed significantly,&rdquo; mused one pundit.  Another refugee from the pressure-cooker world of high finance suggested that the budget was expansionary and added that &ldquo;the tax concessions and social welfare <Col N="1743" /> changes will lead to a small real rise in disposable income&rdquo;.  He is probably right on that.  The reality is that it is hard for any commentator to find something new and novel to say about the budget.</P>
    <P>The reality arises from two specific issues which have been touched on by previous speakers.  The first is that most of the budget's contents were forecastable. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> had set the parameters in key areas such as tax reform, social reform, employment and training, and agricultural development.  Against these parameters the budget was drafted. Some Members, most notably those belonging to Fine Gael, suggested that there is something wrong or sinister about this.  I commend Deputy Gay Mitchell for taking a more balanced view than did his party's spokesman on Finance.  Fine Gael as a party seem to feel that the budget should be decided in here.  Those who propose this myth &mdash; albeit a myth based on a close reading of Bunreacht na hÉireann &mdash; that the budget could be settled in the Dáil Chamber are trying to pursue a chimera which will never be realised.  Whatever the constitutional myth, the reality for many years has been that the budget in its details has been drafted in the recesses of the Department of Finance and after some tinkering by Government it has been endorsed by Dáil Éireann.  As budgets became more technical, the technocratic input in the budgetary process has outweighed and displaced the direct democratic input.  To the extent that this budget can be said to be a departure from the norm, it is a departure that should be welcomed rather than condemned.  It must surely be progress if the people who are to be affected by the economic changes brought about by a budget &mdash; workers, farmers, employers, the people of Ireland in their various socio-economic guises &mdash; are represented in some direct way in the pre-budget discussions and processes.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael spokesmen found fault with the role played in the programme and in the budget by the social partners.  I do <Col N="1744" /> not.  While I would not subscribe, as is frequently done in this House in other matters, to taking responsibility from this place, I feel that the greater involvement of the social partners in the whole process of policy formation is a good one which we should build upon and develop.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that two realities set the parameters against which the budget was cast.  If the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was one of those realities, the continued need for macro-economic stability was definitely and unequivocally the other.  It is fundamental to the national well being that we maintain a firm control on the public finances and work continually towards a reduction of the ratio of national debt to GNP.  This necessity is recognised in section 2 of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  It is recognised by the leaders of the trade union movement, by the leaders of the farm associations, by the employer associations and is recognised widely by most sane economic analysts. Sadly, the reality is not always recognised by the parties who oppose us in this House.  While they privately say other things, all too frequently of late they call for an expansion of State spending without identifying additional revenue sources or extra savings to pay for such expansion.  They have not the honesty to admit that their proposals would lead inevitably to more debt and would endanger the economic stability which has so painstakingly been constructed since Fianna Fáil took charge of national economic affairs again in 1987, nor are they prepared to admit that if we do not fund expansion by debt we must either fund it by cutbacks or by increases in taxation.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> I should like to congratulate all parties concerned in its preparation.  The programme is a very fine document which will serve this nation well as we move towards the next millenium.  It is worth reminding ourselves that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which preceded the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provided this nation with stability <Col N="1745" /> on which economic progress has been recorded since 1987.  It is also worth recalling that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was heavily criticised by the Opposition parties in 1987.  Deputy Spring referred to the programme as &ldquo;the con trick of the century&rdquo;.  Deputy Michael Noonan of Fine Gael in doom-laden tones spoke of the economic chaos which would flow from the programme, with dole queues growing beyond 300,000.  They were not alone.  One of our prestigious Sunday newspapers saw the programme as &ldquo;self-destructive&rdquo; and went on to describe it as being &ldquo;one that cannot possibly succeed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ever anxious to prove that economics is indeed the dismal science, an economist from one of our neighbouring institutions claimed that the programme and the Government strategy which underlay it had dealt &ldquo;a severe blow&rdquo; to the policy of reducing borrowing and went on to suggest that it would undo much of the progress on the public finances achieved by Fianna Fáil when they returned to power in 1987.  The commentators got it wrong.  One might expect that some at least would have the courage to admit that they got it wrong but rather than do so, the majority of the criticism we heard represents nothing more than cranking up the word processors to give us more of the same.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with two specific aspects of the budget, social welfare and taxation. The social welfare improvements will cost an additional £164 million in a full year.  That represents very significant progress and I, as a taxpayer, am quite willing to bear the cost of that progress. A number of the improvements are particularly welcome.  The Government's decision to grant a 4 per cent increase in social welfare benefits and in health board payments is well ahead of inflation.  It is a pity we are not in a better position to improve further on that.  The 11 per cent increase on the lowest level of payments is also well ahead of inflation.  This represents a just and equitable transfer of resources to the less well paid and less well off.  The improvements in child <Col N="1746" /> income support, in particular the minimum child allowance of £12 per week and the extension of the higher rate of child benefit from the fourth child onwards, is a very welcome development.  Like the tax changes, this can reasonably be portrayed as a further support of the family.</P>
    <P>Improvements in the family income supplement are particularly welcome. The Minister for Social Welfare has stated that these improvements arise in part because of the general improvement in social welfare payments.  The FIS has to be boosted to ensure that there is still an incentive to work for those stuck in the low pay brackets.  The change in pension payments signalled in the budget in the form of a <i>pro rata</i> pension for persons on mixed full rate and modified insurance contributions should be welcomed by every Member.  That social welfare anomaly has been one of the scandals in our social welfare code.  The Minister, to his great credit, set out in 1987 to remove anomalies and now he is addressing this one.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the House last Thursday in reply to a query from the Deputy on the Order of Business, I do not see the need for such a committee.  The many provisions in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which, as the Deputy says, require the consent of the Oireachtas can be dealt with in accordance with the legislative and financial procedures of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that many of the 66 specific items that are referred to in the programme requiring the direct and indirect involvement of the Oireachtas involve negotiation in which the social partners present, on occasion, conflicting points of view, and that an open forum such as a committee of the Oireachtas, which is subject to democratic scrutiny including the press, is the right place for such negotiations to take place?  In view of the widespread support for the idea of social partnership would the Taoiseach not give it some democratic underpinning by establishing such a committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy is getting at.  On the other hand Deputies did express some concern about the democratic process and the fact that these important social and economic issues should not be taken away from the <Col N="1749" /> ambit of the House.  Therefore I think to set up a special committee just to deal with the programme might be tending to isolate it from the normal democratic and parliamentary procedures here in the House.  Everything in the programme will in some shape or form have to come before this House either by way of financial provision or by way of legislation and it will be an ongoing process for some considerable time.  I think it is better to leave it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that legislation promised specifically in the programme and which is part of the programme's contract will ultimately involve the House and that such legislation will, as it has in the past, involve detailed negotiation tantamount to Committee Stage involvement of the social partners?  Would the Taoiseach also agree that such involvement would be entirely outside the ambit of this House and that that is, in effect, as we saw in the Industrial Relations Bill, a negation of the real function of this House?  It is precisely that kind of measure that should come under the ambit of this House.  Would the Taoiseach not therefore agree that in matters such as that there is a very central role for such a committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that legislation is the fundamental responsibility of this House and of nobody else. However, as the Deputy knows, in the case of long legislation the Minister in charge of the legislation enters into discussions and negotiations with vocational groups of all kinds.  That does not affect the quality of the legislation.  Nor indeed does it affect the validity of the input of this House into the legislation and that is the way it will be done on this occasion.</P>

Is the Taoiseach aware that in most European countries, Scandinavia for example, where consensus economic policies are successfully pursued, there exists a procedure for involving parliament prior to decisions being written in stone?  Is the Taoiseach further aware that it is undesirable and not actually democratic to present this House with a <i>fait accompli</i> which has to be voted through by a whipped Government majority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In view of these considerations would the Taoiseach agree to examine the former Fine Gael proposal on this matter which advocated an economic accord for 1992 and suggested, in January 1989, the establishment of exactly the type of committee envisaged by Deputy Quinn in his question which I most heartily welcome?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is misunderstanding, or perhaps misdirecting his attention here.  There are countless occasions on which a Government, as the Executive, negotiate with different persons, bodies, agencies and then bring the result of that negotiation here for confirmation.  Let us take for example the case where the Government would negotiate a treaty with another country &mdash; that is negotiated by the Government in detail with some foreign power, some other country or other administration and then when those negotiations are completed, the document or the treaty is brought here for discussion, debate and confirmation or otherwise.  There is nothing undemocratic about that.  It is the normal procedure. I think the function of this House contrary to what Deputies are saying, would be negated to some extent if there was political involvement in the original negotiations and discussions because political parties having participated in those original discussions and negotiations would then be prevented from having full scale discussion in this House and possible opposition to what was decided.

      <P>My first point is the same as Deputy Bruton's point which is to ask the Taoiseach if he would agree that comparing a domestic economic agreement with an international relations agreement with another country is patently absurd? Does the Taoiseach agree that since we are talking about a national long term strategy as well as a medium term strategy, this agreement is not the property of any one Government and that, therefore, it is necessary to involve, in a more formal structured way the parties in this House?  May I specifically ask the Taoiseach whether he agrees that the central review committee needs revision so as to allow for the more public appraisal of progress and for us to participate in monitoring the progress of the various objectives and targets under this agreement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.  I have no proposals at present for establishing a formal committee to review planning law and procedures generally.  However, the system is kept under continuous review to identify such changes and improvements as may be necessary from time to time.  Arising from this, I arranged last September for a group of officers of my Department and of the Department of <Col N="1758" /> Finance to carry out a specific examination of the systems and procedures of An Bord Pleanála and a report on this was submitted to me last month.  The group were asked to identify any changes that might be made to ensure the most expeditious disposal of appeals while ensuring that the board's procedures are adequate and fair for their purpose.</P>
      <P>I am now examining the group's report and will bring forward any legislative proposals which may be necessary on foot of it as a matter of urgency.  An Bord Pleanála have been asked to consider recommendations in the report which relate to matters within their control.</P>
      <P>I do not propose, at this stage, to comment on specific legislative or other changes that might be made.  I would point out, however, that the operation of section 4 falls to be considered in the context of the local government reform process which is the subject of subsequent questions today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is a good deal of well founded concern regarding the entire planning process?  First, there is the question of the quality of and justification for decisions made by some planning authorities and the planning appeals board. Second, in the case of the planning appeals board there is the question of long delays and seemingly unjustifiable delays, coming to decisions on planning appeals.  Third, there are concerns about the operation, in the relevant local authorities, of the building by-law procedures, including the delay in making decisions and the inability of people to appeal against by-law decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a significant improvement in the disposal of appeals before An Bord Pleanála, particularly in the last few months, and I would like to see that improved still further.  In fact, the review which is taking place indicates some areas of activity that will help to improve that situation.  I support the Deputy's view that we should do everything we can to improve on the procedures, and that will be done.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>if he has any plans for a national water authority; if, despite the high rainfall and low density of population in the Republic, he considers a water conservation campaign is necessary; if so, the reason, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans for a national water authority.  The Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990, provides for an integrated approach to the protection and management of the environment and a separate, sectoral, authority would not be in keeping with that approach.</P>
      <P>I am aware of difficulties which have arisen with water supplies in specific areas, notably Dublin, where effective local conservation measures are being taken.  In this regard, my Department are in close contact with the Dublin local authorities with a view to developing proposals that will provide a greater guarantee of supply to consumers.  Specific proposals for the provision of an interlink between the various sources of supply are also to be developed to reduce dependence in particular areas on any one source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to say that supplies from the Roundwood source have improved considerably following the replenishment of the reservoir.  However, because of <Col N="1762" /> the uncertainty of this source of supply during periods of low rainfall, the need to conserve supplies must always be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>While I do not consider a water conservation campaign to be necessary at national level, I am pleased that there is an increased national awareness of the value of our water resources.  The document &ldquo;Water and Sanitary Services in Ireland&rdquo; published in December 1990 and circulated to Deputies, should assist this greater awareness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that to ask Irish people to conserve water is like asking the Eskimos to conserve ice?  Would he not agree that when the whole country is paddling in floods and every farm is underwater it is a joke when the PRO of Dublin Corporation gets on the radio frequently and urges people in the middle of winter to conserve water?  Would he not accept that there is something fundamentally wrong with the planning of his Department and of the local authorities concerned in arranging for adequate water supplies, bearing in mind that in the island next to us, which has 20 times our population, they have no difficulty supplying water to meet the needs of their people?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that over a long number of years people took our water resources for granted but we had a rude shock last year.  There is considerable ongoing planning in place so far as providing adequate water supplies for Dublin, in particular, is concerned. Work is in progress on the Ballymore Eustace scheme which will provide an additional 15 million gallons of water per day.  That scheme is costing in the region of £13 million.  Other works are in place as well.  I can assure the Deputy that we are very conscious of the fact that we should be able to continue to provide an adequate source and supply of water for the metropolitan area in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear <Col N="1763" /> what the Minister said.  In relation to the campaign to conserve water, has the Minister planned to have a campaign similar to that in the Netherlands a few years ago?  I was a little surprised and shocked to see silhouettes of a naked man and a woman facing each other saying that, to save water, one should shower with a friend.  I hope the Minister has no such plans for Wilma and Fred of the &ldquo;Flintstones&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to learn that we do not have any similar conservation campaign in mind. However, I join with him in saying that people should be careful with this resource, a scarce resource when everything is taken into consideration.  We have mainly been using surface water resources for many years.  Of course, there is a great ground water resource and this is being examined at present with a view to supplying adequate water at all times to all our citizens.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7, 40, 43, 82 and 149 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's approach to local government reorganisation, including the terms of reference and timetable for reform, were outlined in a statement issued by the Government Information Services on 5 April 1990.  A copy of the statement is available in the Oireachtas Library.  I would also refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 13, 28 and 49, on 28 November 1990, regarding the timing of the report of the expert advisory committee.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee completed their report just before Christmas.  This is being considered by the Cabinet subcommittee who will complete their deliberations and report to the Government shortly.  Decisions in relation to reform proposals will then be a matter for the Government.  The question of publication of the report of the advisory committee will also be a matter for the Government to consider in the context of such decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1765" /> It would be premature to comment on possible proposals, including proposals in relation to existing sub-county authorities, before the review is completed. The implementation process will begin as soon as possible after the Government have finalised the reorganisation programme and the objective will be to bring forward appropriate legislative proposals in the present session.</P>

      <P>Ten of these questions, although put down by different Deputies, are identical.  There is a second group of eight identical questions, again put down by different Deputies.  The 20 remaining questions touch on related aspects of policy on social housing or on the housing position and prospects for 1991 in different areas.</P>
      <P>A review of policies in the housing area has been in progress for some time, taking account of the NESC report, <i>A Strategy for the Nineties,</i> and other relevant reports and submissions.  Arising from the review, I am finalising a document for action on housing matters which will, I hope, be ready for publication next week.  This will indicate the Government's proposals in relation to, <i>inter alia,</i> the various matters raised in these questions. It will elaborate on the references to housing included in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the measures referred to in the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance. Copies of the document will be placed in the Oireachtas Library and a copy will be supplied to each Deputy.  I do not propose to comment on particular aspects pending completion of the document as a whole and its publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document I have referred to will deal generally with the different elements <Col N="1775" /> of the local authority housing programme. I intend to determine shortly the 1991 capital allocations for the housing construction and refurbishment programmes of the individual local authorities, including the number of new starts to be authorised this year.  In making these allocations, I will have regard to the nature and extent of the relative needs of individual housing authorities. I will advise the authorities of their allocations as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has been reviewing the policy on social housing for quite some time now, is it not a gross insult to this House that he should come in and announce that he intends to make a substantive announcement on policy in this area one week after he replied to a large number of questions on the same topic? Will the Minister tell the House in detail whether there will be material relief for people who are waiting for houses this year, in other words, will they get houses, the number of houses which will be built in 1991 and whether he intends increasing the paltry allocation made in the 1991 Estimates for social housing in order to relieve the problems of homelessness?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say to Deputy Gilmore that all that information will be revealed when I make the announcement. The Deputy will have to understand that I indicated on a number of occasions in the recent past that I was going to do this.  The information is not ready today; if it was, I would have no hesitation in giving it to the Deputy.  It is a question of a week or, at most, ten days before it will be ready.  We can then discuss the matter at great length on any suitable occasion the Ceann Comhairle will allow.  I do not have all the facts the Deputy requires with me except to say <Col N="1776" /> there will be increases in so far as the housing allocation is concerned and there will be increased numbers to satisfy the Deputy's demands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this not a repeat of a previous practice on the part of the Minister of making all his major announcements of policy at press conferences rather than in this House?  Secondly, to what extent will the new measures he is talking about eat into the waiting lists for local authority houses on which there are now of the order of 20,000 people?  How many of those 20,000 people does the Minister anticipate will be housed in 1991?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I protest at the Minister grouping so many questions together.  Certainly in my time in the House it is without precedent that so many questions should be grouped together, especially in view of the fact that this virtually precludes questions on housing for another six months.  In those circumstances, would the Minister agree to refer these questions back to the next period of Environment questions so that they can be retabled, for which procedure there is ample precedent?</P>

      <P>I share the frustration of other Deputies in relation to the way this House is being abused by making announcements of major policy outside the House.  The Minister knows full well that he is required to answer questions here very rarely, once in a roster of 15 Ministers.  If there are any major announcements to be made they should be made in this House and be subject to the scrutiny of the House.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the last assessment of housing needs, which was completed only at the end of last year &mdash; although the Minister has requested that another one be completed before March &mdash; does the Minister know exactly how many houses are needed in the community and the paltry number he has provided since that review was completed?  Will he at least indicate the targets he has in relation to each of the categories: old folks' housing, family-type housing and special category housing?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that, in relation to the subject matter of Question No. 21, not all travelling families want to be settled in housing estates?  There is in this country at present a large number of travelling families who want to park in an area, usually on the outskirts of a city, for one, two or three months in the winter time and them move on to a fair or some other place.  In many <Col N="1779" /> cases these families cause acute problems for the settled community in their areas, with wandering horses, no proper sanitary services and totally in breach of every law in the land.  In that event would the Minister accept that local authorities must be required to make available some kind of parking facilities for those families so that they can be brought within the law, can park in properly serviced sites and no longer live side by side with settled communities?  That would help to restore the balance of natural justice between the rights of settled communities and the rights of travelling families?  That must be done in relation to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Basically, to follow the logic of what the Minister has done in this grouping of questions, it is similar to my putting down questions, when I had responsibility for health, on hospitals anywhere in the country and having them answered in a global way.  I would put it to the Minister that the announcement <Col N="1781" /> he intends to make next week has more to do with the date of the local elections than the proper assessment of the housing needs of this country, which has been underscored to him for three years in this House with little comment, little action and no houses being provided.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a brief response to Deputy Howlin.  I hardly think that what he has said is true in that I have signalled for some time that I was considering a new approach to the whole question of social housing and that I was working for some months on a totally new package that would address that matter. That has been signalled by me for the last six to nine months; it was indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and I have indicated it on a number of other occasions.  It has now come to fruition, and I sincerely hope I will have the support of all the Deputies in the House for the programme that I intend to launch in the next week or so. I hope that if any matter is brought to the attention of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, that committee might also reflect upon the fact that it is not proper for ten identical questions to be put on the Order Paper, for whatever reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the number of questions on the Order Paper is not a planned assault <Col N="1782" /> or attack on the Minister but reflects the concern of public representatives throughout the country and the number of deputations which have asked to meet the Minister to discuss housing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite readily accept that it is not a planned, personal assault on me as that is not the Deputy's style.  I can understand why he is expressing concern about housing as I have the same concern. I am taking the necessary steps to try to deal with the problem and I hope we will have a very good discussion on my new plan for housing when it is launched. Occasionally, Deputies put down questions in relation to meeting deputations but, on occasions, those deputations have not even been sought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the budget speech of the Minister for Finance, he said that full reliance would be placed on voluntary housing agencies to tackle the housing problem.  Will the Minister agree that that is a totally inappropriate response to the large numbers on the housing list? For example, in June 1990, 954 families in Dublin county were on the waiting list. In the estimate of the housing requirements document sent to all local authorities, will the Minister give an undertaking that he will review the figures on the basis of the assumption that net emigration would be 35,000 per year but that that figure has started to drop, thereby creating another group who will require housing?  I have the assumptions here and he is assuming that half his problems will be solved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the traditional way of meeting housing needs worked very satisfactorily up to about three or four years ago when his Government almost ceased providing local authority housing?  Will he also bear in mind that the last time a Government decided to experiment with the provision of local authority housing &mdash; I am talking about the so-called low cost housing scheme &mdash; it was a total disaster?  Why will the Minister not continue the traditional way of providing houses, which proved satisfactory?  The building of these houses is overdue and they are very badly needed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

It was to ask the Minister what level of local authority house building completions would be required to fulfil the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to maintaining the local authority housing programme at a level appropriate to the increasing needs having due regard to resources.  Will the Minister give us a figure &mdash; or even a ball park figure &mdash; of what that commitment means?  What is the level appropriate to the increasing needs?  What is the level appropriate to having due regard to resources?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the bridge in question does not form part of the network of national roads, primary responsibility for the proposed works rests with the local authority, Cork Corporation.  The cost of <Col N="1789" /> such works falls to be financed from local resources supplemented by the discretionary grants provided by my Department. In the case of Cork Corporation, these grants totalled £939,000 in 1990, including a supplementary grant of £250,000 for improvement works on non-national roads.  The determination of priorities in the expenditure of these grants is a matter for the local authority. I hope, within the next few weeks, to be in a position to notify all local authorities of the 1991 road grants.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a temporary bridge across the River Lee in this area has been in place for the last six months and that the bridge in question, Parliament Bridge, is of great importance?  While the Minister is obviously not a bridge builder with Cork Corporation I ask him to sanction finance for this bridge as it is on a main artery into the city from the southside and is urgently needed.  As we have been waiting for six months, would the Minister be more specific as to when Cork Corporation will receive an allocation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy understands that as it is not on one of the national primary routes it has consequently to be funded from the block grant and other moneys available to the local authority.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The average waiting time for a driving test in the country as a whole is now 25 weeks.  There are 7,808 applicants awaiting tests in the Cork area.  In Cork city and Mallow, the waiting period has been 38 weeks and in Skibbereen, 50 weeks, where added delay arose due to the closure of the old test premises.  New premises were opened on 8 January.</P>
      <P>In order to reduce the waiting time to an acceptable level, I arranged in the latter half of last year to have 39 additional driver testers recruited.  The number of testers has now been increased to 79 from a figure as low as 40 last year. Thirty-two of the new testers have been trained and are operational and the remaining seven are currently being trained and will be operational shortly.</P>
      <P>The situation with regard to testing in Cork, as in the country as a whole, is beginning to improve significantly due to the increased number of testers now operational.  Every applicant who was on the waiting list in Cork before Christmas will have been offered a driving test appointment before the end of March.</P>
      <P>I expect that, by September next, the waiting time will have been reduced to six to eight weeks in all areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that to be the case.  Indeed, the Minister may even make a profit by hiring 39 extra people. Given that the Minister has been in the Department of the Environment for the past three years and we have 241,000 people on the unemployment register, why did he not see the sense in hiring extra driver testers before now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1987, the Garda Síochána carried out a roadside survey of the insurance and tax status of about 24,000 motor vehicles &mdash; equivalent to about 2.5 per cent of the total licensed vehicle fleet. The survey disclosed that between 10 per cent and 14 per cent of vehicles were untaxed, as compared with between 20 per cent and 25 per cent in a 1979 survey. The Garda propose to carry out a further survey this year.</P>
      <P>The loss of tax revenue disclosed by the 1987 survey is totally unacceptable and steps are being taken to reduce it substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commencing next month, my Department's Vehicle Registration Unit will issue final notices to motorists who fail to renew road tax.  Secondly, I will be bringing forward legislative proposals to <Col N="1793" /> deal with the problem of evasion.  In addition, the Garda will continue widespread roadside checks of tax discs, including checks carried out as part of the intensified &ldquo;drunk driving&rdquo; campaign.</P>
    <P>In 1989, the Garda instituted a total of 146,000 prosecutions for motor tax offences.  The Garda and traffic wardens also issued 53,000 &ldquo;on the spot fine&rdquo; (£50) notices for non-display of a tax disc in 1989.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the figures he has just given the House are alarming in that as many as 14 per cent of cars remain untaxed? Will he not agree further that if he was more successful in collecting the road tax his colleague would have been able to announce in the budget a reduction, and not an increase, in that tax?  Will the Minister not agree also that if he hired the necessary extra staff in this case as in the driving test case he might make a profit?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 73, 100 and 160 together.</P>
      <P>Since 1981 the fire service has been developed and improved with the consistent support and backing of successive Governments.  Improvements have been carried out on a comprehensive basis, covering such areas as the financing and equipping of the service, its organisation and staffing, the legislative framework and emergency planning.  In the implementation of these developments, all the recommendations of the Stardust Tribunal's report have received full and careful consideration and they have been of significant assistance to successive Governments in furthering their policies concerning fire safety and the fire services generally.  I am satisfied that the improvements which have been effected have significantly strengthened the capacity of the fire service to respond to fires and other emergencies and to engage in fire prevention activities.</P>
      <P>The following is a brief indication of the progress made.  Some £60 million has been provided from State funds since 1981 for capital investment in the fire service.  This has financed work which has been completed or which is in progress on 75 new or reconstructed fire stations, the purchase of 238 new fire appliances and major improvements in telecommunications, emergency equipment and so on.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1982, there were only 30 professional posts &mdash; chief fire officer &mdash; in the fire service; now there are 142 such posts, of which 71 are specifically for fire prevention work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fire Services Act, 1981 up-dated and reinforced the existing legislation. The Act particularly strengthened the powers of fire authorities to enforce fire safety.  The Fire Safety in Places of <Col N="1797" /> Assembly (Ease of Escape) Regulations, 1985, make the locking of exits and blocking of escape routes from places of assembly an offence with fines for breaches of up to £10,000 and/or up to two years in prison.  The passing of the Building Control Act, 1990, has enabled drafting work on the new building regulations, which will incorporate fire safety requirements for new buildings, to proceed to an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>In regard to existing buildings, priority has been given to the production of detailed fire safety advice in respect of priority areas such as places of assembly, hotels and guesthouses, and community-based residences for mentally-handicapped or mentally-ill people.  Work is continuing on the preparation of further advice and guidelines.</P>
    <P>While I have no proposals for amendment of the Fire Services Act, 1981 the identification of specific legislative steps which might be taken to strengthen fire safety, such as the making of further fire safety regulations under section 37 of the Act, is going ahead in the light of experience of the working of the various comprehensive measures already taken towards improving fire safety.</P>
    <P>Operational guidelines covering aspects of training, design of fire stations, uniforms and rank markings, drills, etc., have been issued as aids to fire authorities in improving the efficiency of the fire service.  Work is continuing on the preparation of further codes and guidelines.</P>
    <P>Since they were set up in 1983, the Fire Services Council have run 105 training courses at central level for 1,730 fire service personnel, to supplement the training carried out locally by the fire authorities themselves.  I have asked the Fire Services Council for a report on the need, and possible arrangements, for a national training centre, the establishment of which was recommended in the report of the Stardust Tribunal.  The council are considering this matter in the context of current training needs and progress achieved, and the range of facilities now available.  In the meantime, there has been a massive improvement in the level of fire service training carried out <Col N="1798" /> by the fire authorities themselves and by the Fire Services Council, with extensive use being made of the new and improved training facilities available in Dublin and in other areas and with use of facilities available abroad for specialised courses where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Local authorities now have well-developed plans for dealing with major accidents and emergencies.  Twenty local authorities have installed computer-based information systems to assist in dealing with incidents involving dangerous substances.   I have agreed arrangements with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries which provide for advice and assistance by the industry to fire authorities when responding to chemical emergencies.</P>
    <P>Three fire service mobilisation and communications systems are being developed, to cover the entire country on a regional basis.  These developments are designed to provide fire authorities with the most modern, up to date, telecommunications systems.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to continue to foster and assist the development and improvement of the fire service as comprehensively as possible.  While fire authorities are responsible for fire fighting and fire prevention in their own administrative areas I am kept adequately advised by my Department's officers, through their visits to, and normal ongoing contacts with, the local authorities fire services, and, through the information submitted generally and in support of particular proposals for developments requiring capital funding, of the overall state of the local authority fire services.</P>

Secondly, why are there no statutory minimum requirements relating to furnishings, fittings, etc. in existing places of assembly?

I have no reason to change that decision at this time.

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the comments made yesterday by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mr. Peter Brooke, in which he indicated that he may have to abandon his attempts to initiate dialogue between the democratic political parties in Northern Ireland; if he will outline the current position of the Government in regard to the initiative; if the matter was discussed at the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference in Dublin last week and the outcome of any such talks; if he intends to seek a meeting with Mr. Brooke or to take any other steps to try and assist the initiative; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make an urgent and comprehensive statement to Dáil Éireann in connection with the statement made yesterday by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland which suggested that the future for dialogue within the North of Ireland is bleak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the recent pessimistic statement of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, he will outline in detail the obstacles standing in the way of the proposed talks between the parties in Northern Ireland, with particular reference to the timetable and nature of the involvement of the Irish Government in discussions on matters arising in these talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated in the Dáil last week that the initiative of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland continued to be the subject of ongoing discussions <Col N="1801" /> between all the parties involved and that the Government support the initiative and would like to see it succeed.  That remains the position.</P>
      <P>In the joint statement issued following the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in Dublin last Thursday, both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the value of substantive political talks embracing the three sets of relationships: within Northern Ireland; between both parts of Ireland; and between the Irish and British Governments.</P>
      <P>Both sides considered that the gap between the participants had diminished. The Conference noted that further exchanges with the political parties would now take place in the hope of resolving outstanding issues.</P>
      <P>In view of the further talks being undertaken by the Secretary of State the next of which will be his meeting tomorrow with the Unionist parties, and the great sensitivity of the entire process I do not consider it advisable to go into further elaboration at this stage of the confidential discussions which have taken place.  I would like to say, however, that the Irish Government have not recently raised any new points.  While we must be fully involved in any process that might lead to a new agreement or structure to transcend the existing agreement, we have not sought at any stage involvement from the outset in the internal talks.  I remain hopeful about a successful outcome and, for our part, Deputies may be assured that we will continue to show as much flexibility as possible in the interests of ensuring peace and stability on this island.  I would like to quote with approval something Secretary of State Brooke said last week:</P>
      <P>We are more likely to build a structure which would stand the test of time if we actually pay proper attention to the foundations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that the collapse of this initiative would cause severe difficulties in Northern Ireland, indeed perhaps <Col N="1802" /> drive people into even further entrenched positions.  Therefore it is important that we take a stance which is seen to be helpful in having the talks get under way. The Taoiseach will be aware that there are reports that the two issues causing greatest problems are the timing of the Irish Government's involvement in talks and the question of whether the Unionists should attend meetings with the Irish Government, as representing simply the Unionist Party, or as part of the United Kingdom delegation.</P>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach indicate whether the Irish Government have put forward proposals which would help to overcome these perceived obstacles?  Can he also indicate what occurred at the Intergovernmental Conference on Thursday last which seems to have created a change in attitude by Mr. Brooke?  I am aware there was high optimism on Wednesday last that things were looking good for talks getting under way.  Yet, since the meeting on Thursday last this optimism seems to have evaporated very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should just like to say by way of comment that I do not think people should be too pessimistic or misrepresent what Secretary of State Brooke said.  Let us recall that, in journalistic parlance, he was door-stepped when he made these comments. Whereas one of them might appear to be pessimistic in implication, a lot of the other things he said are not.  I might refer to some of them here.  I might quote from another statement in which he said:</P>
      <P>No game is over until the last ball is bowled.</P>
      <P>I suppose we are not all cricket aficiondos in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It sounds more like Mrs. Thatcher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we know what he means.</P>
      <P>Again, on Thursday last the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1803" /> I am absolutely clear in my mind the Irish Government would wish to see talks commence on a basis which was in fact acceptable to everybody and that they are striving sensibly and constructively towards that end.</P>
    <P>In reply specifically to Deputy de Rossa I should just like to say: yes, we are, have been doing so continuously and are still exploring and putting forward proposals informally to enable things to happen.  I do not want to go into detail.  Deputy De Rossa is not quite right in his analysis of the position but I do not think that is important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On a lighter note it might be more useful if the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland would refer to putting the odd ball in the net as opposed to bowling in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am very aware of the sensitivity of this topic and also of the Government's efforts in recent years to promote dialogue and discussion. Would the Taoiseach give us some clarification of the change in attitude.  It is fine to minimise the doorstep statement of the Secretary of State but, at the same time, he did say it may be time to pull down the shutters in relation to the talks about talks which sounds to me to be a fairly pessimistic tone and conclusion on his part.  Last week the Taoiseach himself was quietly optimistic.  The joint statement on Thursday last, after the Intergovernmental Conference, certainly gave no immediate indication that there were any difficulties on the horizon but the tone seems to have changed yesterday in advance of the meeting between the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Unionist leaders.  Can the Taoiseach offer any indication why that happened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I would broadly agree with what Deputy Spring is saying, except on one account.  I do not go along with the idea that the atmosphere or situation has suddenly become much more pessimistic in outlook.  If the Deputy <Col N="1804" /> takes what Secretary Brooke said in its totality, that would not be the conclusion one would come to.  Deputy Spring is quite right with regard to the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference.  As I said in my reply, both sides said that the gap between the participants diminished. The Irish Government, as a party to this process, have not adopted any attitude or taken any action that would contribute to a worsening of the situation.  As far as we are concerned there is not a worsening of the situation.  The Secretary of State will meet with the Unionists tomorrow. We will have to wait to see what comes out of that.  I assure Deputies that we have been flexible all along and have taken a number of different steps and made a number of proposals and concessions to try to get the thing brought to finality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that if this initiative fails, it is likely that the Unionists will then try to proceed in the direction of integration in the UK, which is a cul-de-sac, thereby driving the SDLP into the opposite direction and driving the two groups in Northern Ireland further apart?  Will the Taoiseach further agree, while accepting the need for discretion, that if this initiative has failed, it will be too late then to discuss the obstacles that caused that failure, and that it is important that there should be some public understanding of the obstacles so that whatever pressure or enlightenment can be brought to bear to remove those obstacles can be discussed publicly here?  Would the Taoiseach agree that the specific modalities for the involvement of the Irish Government in the results of these discussions should not be an obstacle to the commencement of these discussions?  In view of the fact that the SDLP are free at any time, if the discussions are going badly, to withdraw from them, thereby bringing the Irish Government back into play immediately through the Anglo-Irish Conference, would the Taoiseach not agree that the involvement of the Irish Government should not be an obstacle, that sufficient safeguards exist to bring the Irish <Col N="1805" /> Government back into play if the talks commence, and that it is of grave importance that the talks should commence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to remain calm about this.  The last point made by Deputy Bruton has disturbed me.  There should not be a question that the attitude of the Irish Government is in anyway responsible for impeding this process.  No party in the proceedings has been more oncoming, forthcoming or accommodating Taoiseach, that this initiative does not us not jump to any conclusion that the first people to blame in these matters are the Irish Government.  I hope that was not inherent in what Deputy Bruton was saying, because exactly the opposite is the case.  Modalities are not important or significant from our point of view.  The essence of the discussion is important, and again I would draw attention to what Secretary Peter Brooke said, that we should build on sound foundations.  That is very important.  With regard to the other points made by Deputy Bruton, I would not necessarily accept that if this initiative fails the inevitable outcome is integration.  I do not think it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Things have moved too far now and people have come too close together for us ever to go back to some totally sterile and futile situation.  Even if the outcome of failure were to be integration, that is not the main consideration. We should not contemplate failure, because the result of failure would be very catastrophic in other ways. It is not really that the final outcome would be integration that is the problem, it is the fact that the process would fail. We should not contemplate failure but we should keep on and on.  President Bush's phrase has become popular now &mdash; we should go the last mile to ensure success.</P>

      <P>It will be as short as I can make it.  I hope, as does the Taoiseach, that this initiative does not fail, but I am afraid that I do not take the same benign view of the outcome, if it does.  Integration will become a very real option if the initiative fails.  Apart from that, the Taoiseach indicated in his reply to my first question that my analysis was wrong.  I am not too sure whether the Taoiseach means my analysis with regard to the obstacles or my view that the high optimism that was there last week has declined.  Could the Taoiseach explain?  It is important that the public should know what are precisely the obstacles if they are not the two which I have outlined.  It is important that the public know precisely what process is under way.  Public opinion can play a part in assisting people to reach a considered conclusion, and perhaps can exert pressure on the various parties involved, to come to their senses and sit down and talk.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The talks are confidential and therefore it is not possible for any side to give a complete detailed indication of what is taking place.  That would jeopardise the whole process.  I have been as oncoming as I can, subject to that general embargo, with the Dáil. Timing, in the strict sense of timing, as weeks versus months, is not an issue as far as we are concerned.  We do not and never did, despite some popular misconceptions on the point, expect to be involved in the preliminary discussions between the parties in Northern Ireland. Subject to those two points, I do not want to go any further, but the essence of the thing is that there are four different sets of people involved and they all have to agree.  The House may be attributing too much significance to what Secretary Brooke said, bearing in mind the other things he said as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the Taoiseach's acceptance of the fact that the results of these talks would be horrendous and would play right into the hands of the paramilitaries who are destroying any prospect for peaceful co-existence in Northern Ireland, it is difficult not to be pessimistic since yesterday's statement. What fall back position do the Government have if the present attempts to have talks breaks down in the interest of ensuring that political dialogue is maintained in Northern Ireland between the British and Irish Governments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a difficult question for me to answer because I do not wish to contemplate the talks breaking down or to be put in the position of saying that if these talks break down there are other things we can do.  I would certainly not contemplate anything like a cessation of all activity if this initiative fails.  I would be glad to give the Deputy an undertaking that we will immediately explore other ways of keeping dialogue going, now that it has got so far with regard to this initiative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that his statement that he does not <Col N="1808" /> contemplate the failure of these talks is at direct variance with the statement yesterday by the Secretary of State when he quite clearly did contemplate the imminent failure of these talks?  Would the Taoiseach confirm that the main sticking point in these discussions is an insistence by the Unionists that there be some progress in the internal talks before the Irish Government become involved in discussion with the parties, whereas on the other hand the Irish Government want a cast iron guarantee as to the timing of their involvement, regardless of whether progress has been made?  Would the Taoiseach not agree that in the event of no progress being made, it is open to the SDLP to withdraw from the talks anyway and that this in itself would bring the Irish Government in, and furthermore, that there is a ten-week limit at the end of which the Irish Government will become involved, regardless of what has happened in the meantime?  In view of the fact that there are quite substantial safeguards already agreed as far as the interests of the Irish Government are concerned, would the Taoiseach agree to make one last effort to get these talks going?  Would he agree that his reference to President Bush's going one further mile might well be instructive because although President Bush did go one further mile he did not reach his destination? The Taoiseach might learn from that and seek to make whatever concessions can be made now rather than after the talks have failed.</P>

The Irish Government are not categoric about timing.  I have made that point again and again.  We are not categoric in the sense of weeks or months or dates or anything of that kind.  Timing is not the basic issue.  On the other points Deputy Bruton made, I fail to understand fully what he was at.  I do not think we <Col N="1809" /> should go into these talks on the basis that if something does not happen people can withdraw and we can start all over again.</P>
      <P>We should try to get as much as possible settled and have, as Secretary Brooke said, a firm foundation for everybody going into the talks so that nobody will feel short-changed when the talks begin.  There should be fairly clear understanding of what is involved.

      <P>When the debate was adjourned I was touching on some social welfare changes in the budget which I felt were commendable.  I was referring specifically to the change in the pension payments signalled in the budget in the form of the <i>pro rata</i> pensions for persons on mixed full rate and modified insurance contributions.  I am sure many Deputies feel that the social welfare anomaly is a scandal, it has always been a scandal and is one which should never have been allowed to happen.  It causes great pain and hardship to a declining group of people.  I commend the Minister for his <Col N="1885" /> efforts to end it and I hope we will see a conclusion on this matter now.</P>
      <P>Before moving away from social welfare payments I would like to be a little parochial and thank the Minister for Social Welfare for specific decisions relating to two resource centres operating in my constituency.  The Minister has again decided to fund the Little Bray Family Resource and Development Centre this year to the tune of £11,000 and this is on top of an additional generous grant made last year of £10,000.  For that I am profoundly grateful.  The Minister has also made a decision that the St. Fergal's Ballywaltrim centre which operates from Oldcourt in Bray is to receive funding this year, next year and the year after and I am even more grateful for that.</P>
      <P>I want to turn to the taxation matters dealt with in the budget.  Over the last three years there have been significant improvements in our taxation system.  It is worth recording yet again that the levels of personal taxation were at their highest when Fine Gael were in command of the Department of Finance or, perhaps, when the Department of Finance was in command of Fine Gael.  Since Fianna Fáil Ministers returned to Merrion Street in 1987 both the top rate and the standard rate of taxation have been cut by 6 percentage points.  That, by any standard, is welcome.  In the budget there have been other improvements in personal taxation.  They, too are welcome. Major reforms have been introduced throughout the tax administration system over the last three years, most notably the extension of self-assessment to companies, the self-employed, farmers and, now, on the capital side.  The incidence of tax evasion has been cut back and evasion measures now, for the first time in many years, have the fullest political backing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax base has been widened successfully over the last few years.  Some would argue that the tax base has not been widened fast enough.  This criticism has been around for a number of years and it certainly has some element of truth in it.  The charge that the taxation base has not been widened sufficiently quickly <Col N="1886" /> comes most frequently from our friends on the left.  It is instructive, therefore, to remind ourselves as to what happened when the left had an influence in the shaping of budgets.  When Fine Gael and Labour were in Government the yield from capital taxes increased by a mere £13 million.  Between 1987 and 1991, under Fianna Fáil Ministers, the yield from such taxes is projected to grow to a total of £87 million, £54 million more than when the left were in office, a more than 400 per cent improvement.  Some would say that we still do not have enough levied on the capital taxation side.  I would not necessarily disagree with that, but I am merely making the point that when those who most frequently push forward the argument about expanding the tax net were in a position to influence these matters they did considerably less well on the issue than we have done over the last three and a half years.</P>
    <P>The figures are even more dramatic on the corporation tax side.  While Labour and Fine Gael were in office corporation tax increased by £26 million.  Between 1987 and the end of this fiscal year, under Fianna Fáil, the corporation tax yield will have increased by £270 million, ten times greater than the previous four years and way ahead of the rate of inflation.  Again, I would accept the proposition that is very frequently put forward that corporations in this State are still relatively lightly taxed and I would also accept the proposition that there is much room for improvement.  I would like to underscore the point again that in the last three and a half years more has been done in this area than was done in the preceding four years.</P>
    <P>I wish very strongly that there should be a continuing broadening of the tax base because it is only by broadening it that we can achieve the kind of tax equity we all want and lessen the burden in particular on PAYE payers and, at the same time, retain and improve expenditure particularly on social services and transfer payments to the less well off.  I find it difficult, however, to accept finger-wagging admonitions from Labour and Fine Gael in this regard when they were <Col N="1887" /> so impotent when they were in Government.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party, of course, have never been in Government and, therefore, can preach at all three of the main parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the last decade The Workers' Party in particular have continuously called for increases in expenditure while failing to support local authority budgets.  This indicates something of their attitude in general to the whole process of Government.  In my own area, for example, The Workers' Party are the second largest party on one of our local urban councils and councillors have been instructed to oppose modest increases in Bray UDC local revenues.  The yield from those increases has been put into worthwhile social expenditures such as the improvement of playing facilities in Oldcourt and Fassaroe estates and grants to local youth clubs such as the Wolfe Tone and District Youth Club.  The point I make here is that while Fianna Fáil, and in fact Labour and, more reluctantly in recent times, Fine Gael have been willing to support extensions of the tax base even at local level, that willingness has not come from The Workers' Party who are most loud on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to finish on the taxation side by turning to one measure which the Minister announced in the budget and which I hope he can now re-examine.  I refer specifically to the proposition regarding <Col N="1888" /> the business expansion scheme.  I agree with many commentators that this scheme has attracted a degree of abuse. I agree also with the Minister's philosophy of husbanding his tax resources and concentrating any tax concessions on the PAYE workers.  If revenue is to be handed back or foregone, then the lion's share of that benefit should most correctly go to the PAYE payers.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said in his budget speech the business expansion scheme is costly.  Benefits under the scheme cost the Exchequer £40 million in 1989-90 and there have been many blatant abuses. The most notable use of the scheme was to provide tax relief on secure asset-backed investments.  This was never the intention of the BES.  The measures the Minister is taking in the budget are aimed at focusing the scheme at smaller companies, which is right.  The Minister is also extending the modified scheme for a further two years.  Both measures are welcome.</P>
    <P>I would, however, ask the Minister to look again at the way the changes are being introduced.  Over the last few days I have received calls from quite a number of hotels in my constituency.  These are small family businesses.  Their plight should be put on the record here and I hope it will be borne in mind by the Minister.  For example, the La Touche Hotel in Greystones recently changed hands.  It is now a family business in the process of expansion.  A considerable amount of money has been invested under the BES.  Land for a project has been bought.  All in all, a £750,000 project is under way and that project will be in danger if the shutters come down dramatically on the BES scheme.  As that project was in process when the announcement was made it would be worthwhile giving some consideration to a means of alleviating the hardship that will be caused.  The Grand Hotel in Wicklow is another case.  I have a letter from Declan Roche, its manager &mdash; no relation, I hasten to add&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and he makes a very similar case.  Land was bought and major investment made.  The BES project brochure has been printed.  It would be a great tragedy if some way could not be found to ameliorate the hardship that will be caused to schemes such as this.  I accept the Minister's wisdom in curtailing the BES projects but I feel as the announcement was made, some allowance has to be made for schemes that are in process.</P>
      <P>Generally this is very fine budget.  It comes at a very difficult time and it is a budget that has a great deal to commend it.  It helps to continue the good policies which have been in place for the past three years.  It helps also to alleviate social hardship and I have no doubts at all that it will receive from the community and from the House the support that it deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Needless to say, I will be saying some things that are quite opposite to those said by Deputy Roche, particularly in his final remarks.  Let me say with regard to the curtailment of the BES scheme to which he referred, that the lack of notice and the manner in which it was executed seems to display an amazing degree of lack of co-ordination between Cabinet Ministers, where one Minister who is charged with the promotion of tourism is launching the schemes the week before the budget and his colleague, the Minister for Finance puts paid in the budget to the effort being made by those small companies looking for funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the points made by Deputy Roche on the increases in corporation tax and property tax I would like to check the figures in relation to the percentage of overall taxation, but where the Government set out to increase the tax take from those areas which I believe is very necessary, I can assure Deputy Roche that I will be publicly grateful to the Government and I will give them my support, which will be in direct contrast to the efforts of the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="1890" /> when they were in Opposition between 1982 and 1987.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Deputy was not here on that occasion let me tell him that his colleagues led by Deputy Haughey could not attempt to give any support to any increase in taxation on any area.  It was one of the major difficulties and frustrations of that period that the Fianna Fáil Party went into opposition for the sake of opposition irrespective of the merits or demerits of the issues put before the House, and that was regrettable from the point of view of politics.</P>
      <P>One wonders why one would bother speaking on this budget because the general conclusions of the populace and the commentators is that the budget was a sham and a charade, little more than a holding exercise, an operation in marking time while we wait to see what effect external influences are going to have.  The Government could be forgiven if they had come out and just said that the budget was a holding operation.  If the Minister for Finance had come into the House and explained that he was under tremendous constaint and that he was not going to make any significant changes, then I believe one could have more respect than having had to sit through one hour and a half of nothingness.</P>
      <P>What is most offensive about the budget is the pretence that this exercise in book-keeping is going to have profound, social and economic consequences.  The reality is that the Minister has approached this task as if he were trying to decorate a room with only one old newspaper as his raw material.  He has stuck scraps all over the wall, and then stood back in admiration as if he painted the roof of the Sistine Chapel.  If he had eyes to see, he would know that all he has is an untidy mess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone knows that this is the case and I would have to say that I have found it somewhat disappointing that the trade union movement, in particular, have felt constrained to be so muted in their <Col N="1891" /> response to this budget.  Individual trade unionists to whom I have spoken are deeply disappointed, particularly at the measures announced for the long term unemployed.  I know the trade union movement as a whole are clinging to the longer agenda implicit in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> but I would have to say there is an awful lot of ground to be made up in the wake of last week's budget if the aspirations in that document are to become a reality.  I will not pass any comment on the pay aspects of the programme, as that is primarily a matter for judgment by the trade unions, but the other aspects of the programme, if they are real at all, are primarily a matter for comment and evaluation in this House.</P>
    <P>As for the budget itself, would it not have been better all round if the Minister had come into the House and said, &ldquo;look, this is not a year where there is money to throw around.  Instead of spreading the few resources available so thinly over the entire community, I am going to concentrate on just two priorities, one economic and one social priority.&rdquo;  If he had done that, he would be able to defend his budget on grounds of a commitment to justice in the face of scarce social resources.  Obviously, there would be still be offended interest groups and individuals, but if he picked the priority areas carefully I believe he would have been able to engender a broad base of support particularly among people &mdash; and they are the great majority &mdash; who recognise that things are difficult but who have not stopped caring about the needs of others.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's position, I would have chosen to concentrate the resources available on finding real and significant measures to help to create a pathway back to work for the 100,000 people who are long-tern unemployed.  I would have added to that the imperative need to address the crisis facing people with mental handicap.</P>
    <P>Instead of picking a couple of priorities, and concentrating on them the Minister has, as I have said, made a highly <Col N="1892" /> unsuccessful effort to fool people that this budget is going to mean something in their lives.  There are many examples of meaningless and petty changes within the budget; I could spend a lot longer than 20 minutes in listing them but some of them are very obvious, the income tax reliefs that the backbenchers on the Government side have been speaking about.  According to the Government's own figures income tax yields would have gone up by about £250 million this year, if no changes had been made in the budget.  As a result of the changes the income tax yield will still go up by about £200 million.  In other words the PAYE community as a whole will end up paying substantially more tax anyway after this budget.  I do not know how anybody in their right minds could call that tax relief? While it may look good to pay increases in basic social welfare slightly above the rate of inflation, those increases will not come into effect until the middle half of the year.  By then increased VAT rates will already have begun to bite and they will bite more deeply at lower ends of the income spectrum.  Local authority rent increases, already mooted by the local authorities in the past ten days, will take care of any benefits left over for many thousands of families.</P>
    <P>In every year that Fianna Fáil have been in office except one the child benefit has been frozen so that its purchasing power today is considerably less than it was in 1986.  This year they did nothing more than apply the higher rate of child benefit, at present applicable to the fifth child and beyond, to the fourth child. That represents, on average, an increase of 40p per child per week.  That is only for mothers of four children.  Mothers of three children will see no increase in their child benefit and the larger the family the smaller the increase will be on average. In the case of six children, for example, the increase is as low as 27p per week.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Development</i> the Government admitted for the first time that there is a growing housing crisis and identified 19,000 families as being in need of housing at present.  In the view of any Member <Col N="1893" /> of this House who has experienced the hardship being suffered by families at first hand this is a very conservative assessment. What is the Government's response?  They are going to do all sorts of things, take all sorts of initiatives except build houses.  For the fourth year in a row they are not going to build any new houses.  Meanwhile the queues grow and the existing public housing stock is ageing and inadequate.  We will soon have protest on the streets about this issue, an issue that we had thought we had seen the last of in the mid seventies and eighties.</P>
    <P>Perhaps nowhere is the meaninglessness of the budget more apparent than in relation to the issue of health. This falls under two headings which need to be addressed separately.  They must be addressed against the background of perhaps the worst crisis ever in the health services.  Health services have been pared to the bone in the past three years.  The hardship that the cutbacks in health have caused have been recited too often in this House for me to repeat them, but I would like to convey to the Government the anger that is in our community at the scale and extent of the health cutbacks. That anger arises not just from the inconvenience of queuing or the hardship of pain suffered on a waiting list, or the frustration of having to pay, often from very small incomes for essential services that we have all become accustomed to as a right, but also from the loss of dignity involved in seeking access to services to which people no longer feel entitled.</P>
    <P>In Victorian times, charity was inflicted on the poor &mdash; that is to say people who had nothing were made to feel like part of a lower order by the way in which charity was doled out.  There was no concept of rights in those days.  No feeling that decent shelter, good education, basic health care were part of the citizen's entitlement and the community's obligation. We are rapidly approaching that concept again in Ireland and have already reached it in the area of health care.  I never thought that in my time in politics I would see the day when I would have to argue for the right of access to health care.  I thought that time was long past. <Col N="1894" /> But as I work in my constituency, as I come in contact every day with people who are hoping that their turn in the queue will come for some basic treatment, as I see the way in which people are becoming resigned to the fact that they have no right to treatment because their income does not warrant it &mdash; as I see what is happening, as every other Member of this House can see what is happening if they care to look &mdash; the anger that I feel at a Government who have deliberately chosen to undermine that right of every citizen grows.</P>
    <P>How have the Government chosen to respond to the health crisis, and to the anger that surfaced again after publication of the Estimates?  What is the bottom line?  The bottom line is that after the budget, there will be £2,300,000 less in the Estimates than there was before the budget.</P>
    <P>That is the first figure that gives the lie to what the Minister for Health said in this debate earlier today.  It gives me no pleasure to say that the Minister for Health seriously misled this House in his contribution to this debate only an hour or two ago.  His own Government's figures, published annually in the revised Book of Estimates, show that his claims of real increases in health spending under his administration, as opposed to reductions under the previous Government, are false and misleading.  Health spending was maintained under the previous Government at 7 per cent of our national wealth, and it has been falling steadily ever since this Minister came into office.  I would recommend to him, that before he makes false and spurious claims to the House about health spending, he should stop to examine the Government's own figures on the matter.</P>
    <P>Against that background, the changes in health eligibility announced in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> have to be regarded as a joke, and, unfortunately, a sick joke at that.  To announce something on the basis that it is going to be broadly welcome in principle, and then to expect it to happen without any negotiation, and above all without <Col N="1895" /> any resources, makes a nonsense of the principle.</P>
    <P>The changes in health eligibility have to be looked at in the light of the following facts.  The number of people entitled to a free hospital bed will be exactly the same after the extension of entitlement as it was before.  That means that the shortage of beds will be, at the very least, as acute as it has been for the past three years.  The measures proposed are being taken without any consultation with the legitimate interests involved, including consultants.  Consultants are perfectly entitled to object to such fundamental changes in their conditions of employment being imposed without any consultation whatsoever &mdash; they are essential public servants as well.  Doctors &mdash; and they are many &mdash; who believe in treating all of their patients on the same site, to the highest possible standards, fully backed by their junior doctors in training, have effectively been told that they are no longer to be encouraged to see paying patients in public facilities.  As a result, these measures, as they are outlined, will drive many consultants who now see patients in public hospitals to do more and more of their work in private hospitals. If that does not happen, the only other possibility will be that more private beds are allocated to consultants within public hospitals but they will have to come from within the existing overall allocation of beds, thereby leaving even fewer beds available for public patients. Either way, the net result will be that the separation of medicine into public and private will become a permanent feature of our health service, a classic two-tier situation.</P>
    <P>If the top echelon of income earners take up the entitlements that are now being extended to them, and for which they will be paying an extra health levy, without any extra resources being put into the system, the only possible result will be longer queues.  If, on the other hand, the top income earners maintain their position in the VHI in addition to paying the extra health levy, the only reason can be that they want to retain <Col N="1896" /> their capacity to jump the health queues. If this happens, the Government will be formally sanctioning and subsidising the practice of queue jumping in the health services.  Undermining the morale of the providers of any service will reduce the quality of that service.  Medicine is no different.  The net effect is that the Government are further underwriting private health care in private hospitals by these measures, discriminating in favour of the owners of such buildings and the doctors who work in them.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly, this plan must fail.  When it does the Minister is going to try to come back into this House at some time in the near future and make a scapegoat out of the consultants.  I want to say here and now &mdash; and I say it as one who carries no brief for any interest group &mdash; that consultants are not the problem here. The problem is a Minister who is living in a world where nobody suffers, where nobody has to wait, and where charity will do as a substitute for rights.  In other words, he is living in a world that the rest of us have left behind, and he has ceased to be a representative of the people who elected him.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Health were to do nothing else, he should surely be committed to ensuring that by the time he leaves office, there will be no person with a mental handicap in need of residential accommodation who does not have that accommodation immediately available to him.  Even that most basic of humanitarian motivations seems to have passed him by.  Last year he provided, he says, an additional 140 residential places, and this year, on the same calculations, there will be another 70 places.  I have to say again that it is difficult to believe the Minister.  Every agency, every voluntary organisation, every health board, are reporting a major gap between the places available on the one hand, and the need on the other.</P>
    <P>Let us not just think about that need in terms of statistics.  At a recent public meeting in Dublin, one parent told 500 others about her child, her 22 year old severely handicapped child, who had not stopped screaming once in the 22 years <Col N="1897" /> she had lived.  That mother was resigned to the suffering of her child and herself, but told of her worry that her husband would not be able to bear it much longer. How can we as a society turn to a mother like that and tell her that there is nothing to be done?  How can we say to the mother of another child I met recently &mdash; the mother of a quadriplegic, brain-damaged, doubly incontinent child with acute stomach ulcers &mdash; that we are working on a seven-year plan to address her problems?  That is what the Government have been offering.</P>
    <P>One of the great clichès of Government in the last few years &mdash; first introduced, I have to say, by Fine Gael &mdash; is that we cannot solve problems by &ldquo;throwing money at them.&rdquo;  The Minister repeated that clichè half a dozen times here this morning.  Of course, nobody can ever challenge a clichè of that sort.  But I say, why not?  When are we going to recognise that the right of people with a mental handicap, and their families, to live full lives as equal citizens of Ireland can only be met if the community applies resources to the task.  The greatest irony of all is that our community is ready, and willing, to deal with the issue of the rights of people with a mental handicap.  If the Minister does not believe he has to mandate to put money into this area, he is fooling himself, and us, again.</P>
    <P>The creative accounting he has done to create some &ldquo;funny money&rdquo; in this area is one of the most meaningless aspects of this budget.  A sum of £8 million pounds has been provided for a range of community services, all of which are in urgent need, £1 million of that for the area in the most desperate need.  Only 10 per cent of the total is extra money. Half of the total must come from the national lottery, thereby depriving other areas of resources, and the remaining 40 per cent must come from other cutbacks in the health areas, cutbacks the Minister conveniently forgot to mention in the course of his address here today.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I want to refer to one piece of good news for some people in the Estimates and the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>One group of hard-pressed and deserving citizens at least are going to do well out of public expenditure next year.  I refer to that unfortunate group known as &ldquo;consultants&rdquo;&mdash; and I am not referring now to medical consultants, but to the rather more amorphous group of people who offer expert advice on every subject under the sun to Government who already employ highly-paid expertise of their own.</P>
      <P>There are times, I readily admit, when independent advice is necessary for the proper conduct of the decision-making process in Government.  I think many members of this House would be surprised to realise the extent to which this has become a growth area.  In the current Book of Estimates, for example, no less than £15.5 million is set aside to provide consultancy services to the Government. In a year in which we cannot afford more than £1 million for services for people with a mental handicap, this figure deserves close scrutiny.</P>
      <P>There is another, more disturbing, aspect to this money as well.  There are increasing signs that the money available for consultancy services is being increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few individuals &mdash; and indeed that is becoming a form of political patronage, increasingly open to abuse.  In the case of one company in particular &mdash; NCB &mdash; there are serious questions to be answered.</P>
      <P>The allocation for the Department of Tourism and Transport under the heading of consultancy services this year will be £360,000.  In 1987, it was £315,000.  In that year, NCB was engaged to advise the Department on the strategic options in relation to Aer Lingus.  No report was ever published and no fee was disclosed.</P>
      <P>The allocation for the Department of Energy this year is £216,000.  Between 1988 and 1989 the amount allocated was about £640,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude in about 30 seconds.  The vast bulk of that was paid to NCB for a report in relation to Tara Mines &mdash; again, a report that was never published.</P>
      <P>NCB, in association with Goodman Sachs, advised the Government on the restructuring of Irish Life &mdash; and has now been appointed by the Government as adviser in relation to the sale of their holding in Irish Life.  No fee has ever been disclosed, but the amount allocated to the Minister for Finance to hire companies like NCB is now in excess of £10 million.  I understand that NCB, for additional fees, have advised the Department of Finance on the transfer of various holdings within the Department.</P>
      <P>In addition, the principals involved in this company are either a member or, in one case, chairman, of some of the most prestigious State bodies &mdash; Aer Rianta, Bord Gáis and the Custom House Docks Development Authority.  Finally, I understand that NCB will shortly be appointed as brokers to the Irish Sugar Company.  I am not alleging any wrongdoing here but what I am saying is that in the first place, it appears that a very large amount of money is being made available and is being concentrated in the hands of a small number of influential and wealthy individuals.  This is happening at a time when the resources for other essential areas are being squeezed and, more to the point, it is happening without any accountability.  The money involved in these contracts is too great to allow that lack of any accountability to continue any longer.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, we are now engaged in a meaningless debate about a meaningless budget.  The time of this House will be taken up for weeks on a debate which will serve little useful purpose.  I strongly suggest that we should now agree to confine this budget to the dust bin in which it belongs by winding up this debate, at the earliest opportunity and beginning again to address the serious economic and social problems facing this country and which were not addressed in last week's budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Spring wants the budget debate to be wound up now that he has had his say.  That is very commendable.</P>
      <P>In the normal course of events the Government must, in preparing the budget take into consideration all aspects of the domestic, social and economic situation while at the same time bearing in mind those external elements which may influence the destiny of our country and people.  These external elements have taken on a totally new dimension this year.  As a small country Ireland is immediately vulnerable to influences outside our control.  Therefore, major global events must be uppermost in the minds of those responsible for planning our social and economic future.  While the Gulf War is not the only factor about which the Government must be mindful it is, of course, the major one and potentially the most dangerous one.  A large part of the world is at war.  Our partners in the United Nations are at war and those countries which constitute our major markets are at war.  It is in that context that the Minister for Finance and the Government had to consider the contents of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently negotiated <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has rightly been a major influence on the budget.  Its forerunner, the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> was hugely successful in spite of the criticism of it, which I vividly remember, by those on the opposite side of the House and those in other fora when the programme was put together some three years ago.  Thankfully and happily the prophets of doom have been proven very wrong.  I have every confidence that the Government will be successful in achieving the targets set out in the new programme, which hopefully will be ratified shortly.  The most important and meritorious target in the programme is the creation of 80,000 jobs.  Even though our major macro-economic efforts have proven so successful and are working extremely well, it is regrettable that more jobs have not been created.  This is very distressing. Therefore, I wish the Government well <Col N="1901" /> in achieving the job creation target set out in the programme.</P>
    <P>The programme is dependent on an ambitious level of growth in the economy. I agree with being ambitious in this regard.  We must approach the future ambitiously and with a positive attitude. We must never again go down the road of borrowing.  We have learnt to our great cost that this is the road to ruin.  Debt means slavery and is a millstone around the necks of our people and will continue to be a millstone around the necks of their children and their children's children.  Therefore, I was greatly encouraged by the Taoiseach's statement when he presented the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that there would be no question of ever again allowing public spending to increase as a percentage of GNP.</P>
    <P>Economic growth since 1987, when Fianna Fáil came into office, has been excellent, averaging 4 per cent over the period 1987-90.  This reflects the economic management expertise of the Taoiseach and his Government.  Lossmaking, tired and worn out institutions were cast aside.  The innovative and realistic approach adopted by the Government has paid good dividends.  Inflation at 2.7 per cent at year's end reflects a performance which is superior to that of the major economic forces in Europe.  For example, the inflation rate in France was 3 per cent while that in Germany was 3.1 per cent.  Our performance in this area has been magnificent.</P>
    <P>The budget emphasises the importance Fianna Fáil have traditionally afforded to the care of the old, unemployed and needy in general.  General increases of 4 per cent in weekly rates keeps recipients ahead of inflation.  Increases of up to 11 per cent have been provided for people on the lowest rates.  Among the improvements in the social welfare area with which I am most enamoured are those relating to the family income supplement and the carer's allowance.  The increase in the rate of the carer's allowance to £50 and its extension to incorporate the recipients of DPMA represents a major improvement.  I am glad the scheme is <Col N="1902" /> being extended to include the recipients of DPMA as this was one of the main reasons why applicants could not qualify for the carer's allowance.  In fact, 27 per cent of the applicants who were not eligible for the carer's allowance were recipients of DPMA.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring spoke in a rather derogatory way about the treatment of children in the budget.  All I can say to him is that he must not have examined the budget carefully.  There has been a major emphasis on children in the budget.  If the Deputy takes the various improvements into consideration he will see, by doing a simple sum, that £40 million has been provided for children.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, on his continuing efforts to streamline the entire social welfare system.  When the Minister took office four years ago the social welfare system was like a maze and there was extreme confusion.  The Minister has ironed out the anomalies in the system and streamlined it.  For instance, when he took office four years ago there were 36 different rates in the child income support system but now there are only three rates.  He has kept up with the times and simplified the system so that the people who need to be looked after have been provided for.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is going through a particularly difficult time at present.  The value of gross agricultural output is around £5.5 billion or about one-third of our total manufacturing output.  Employment in the food processing sector represents nearly 25 per cent of all those employed in manufacturing industry.  That puts into perspective the absolute importance of agriculture to this country and the vital necessity not only to preserve but to improve the industry.  The uncertainty generated by the ongoing GATT negotiations and by the impending changes in the Common Agricultural Policy has given rise to very low morale in all sectors of the industry.</P>
    <P>I listened attentively to Commissioner Ray MacSharry on the radio last Sunday. He said in the context of the proposed changes in the Common Agricultural <Col N="1903" /> Policy that Ireland can emerge a net gainer.  I have every confidence in Commissioner MacSharry and our able Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy and I believe they will continue to use their considerable expertise to uphold the interests of Irish farmers, Irish agriculture and our food industry in general.  I have a particular interest in striving to ensure that the lot of young farmers is improved and that all possible assistance is put in place to give them every motivation.</P>
    <P>In this context I welcome the improvements outlined in the budget concerning the capital acquisitions tax and the installation aid scheme.  However, I would urge the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance to continue to monitor and seek to improve all relevant mechanisms and avenues so that our young farmers in particular have the proper motivation and incentive. Such action has never been more important than it is at present.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the submission on the extension and reclassification of the disadvantaged areas which was sent to Brussels has not yet been returned and finalised.  While I understand that my constituency of County Wicklow will fare very well from this review, I emphasise to the Minister that there is great anxiety about the delay involved.  I am heartened, however, by the fact that the improvements in the disadvantaged areas situation will be retrospective to 1 January 1991.  It is also of the utmost importance that the appeals mechanism be secured as an integral part of the new situation and that the retrospection factor also applies to successful appeals.</P>
    <P>We have set a target of doubling tourism in this country over a five-year period and great progress has been made to date in achieving that target.  It is regrettable, however, that while Structural Funds are available for tourism-related projects &mdash; and this is very welcome &mdash; the fund does not provide marketing support.  Ultimately, it is on its marketing that the success of the industry depends.  In this <Col N="1904" /> context I welcome the provision in the budget to allocate £1 million to Bord Fáilte for the express purpose of marketing and promotion.  Because of the Gulf War our North American tourist market will most probably be affected this year.  We must, therefore, look to the UK and to Europe.</P>
    <P>This may be a blessing in disguise as it is my firm conviction that the British and continental tourist can be substantially more lucrative than his North American counterpart.  It is vital, however, that we substantially increase these markets. Revenue from overseas tourism is estimated at £1.14 billion for 1990.  The Government target is to double tourism by 1993.  If that target is achieved, overseas tourism will be worth some £1.5 billion by 1993.  The outlook for tourism in Ireland is very bright and the industry can continue to improve right into the next century.</P>
    <P>Excellent work is being done by the catering training agency, CERT, in preparing young people in the most professional way for this industry.  Graduates of all types coming out of CERT training course are having no difficulty in finding employment.  Indeed these skilled, highly-trained young people will be the lifeblood of the industry in the future. However, it was interesting to hear the clear warning recently issued by the chairman of CERT, Mr. Jim Nugent, in relation to the pay and conditions of employment being afforded to the graduates of his training agency.  This warning should be carefully heeded.  The incentives of decent pay and conditions must be there for these people who are vital to the future of tourism.  They must be allowed to share in the benefits of growth in the industry.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency of Wicklow great efforts are being made in the promotion of tourism.  We have in recent years realised the value of the God-given natural beauty of our county which is deservedly called the Garden of Ireland. In this year of 1991 we will be acknowledging the centenary of the death of Charles Stuart Parnell whose ancestral <Col N="1905" /> home is in the magnificent Avondale Estate adjacent to my own home town of Rathdrum.  Many events, cultural, sporting etc, are planned to mark this centenary year.  We in Wicklow feel that this is of national and indeed international significance and consequently it is hoped to attract many tourists to our county and to our country.  It is further hoped that sufficient interest will be generated this year to ensure that Irish and Wicklow tourism will benefit in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In Wicklow while there are some excellent hotels, these are too few and too limited to cope with the escalation in tourism business that lies ahead. However, there are some excellent people who are in the very throes of improving this situation.  A number of hoteliers have incurred considerable expenditure in planning and are preparing to effect major improvements to their establishments, thereby providing improved facilities for our tourists and increased employment for our people. These plans have been delivered a severe blow with the announcement in this budget of changes in the business expansion scheme.  I can fully appreciate the need for making such changes.  The ordinary taxpayer, the PAYE taxpayer, should certainly not have to contribute to large public companies.  I know that is not the intention of the Minister in making these changes.  However, in legislating to exclude parties who do not deserve to qualify, sometimes the genuine people are precluded also, and that is what has happened in this case.  I would appeal to the Minister that provision be made to ensure that meritorious projects such as those I have mentioned, which are up and running and on which substantial amounts have been spent, are facilitated.  I have instances of three such hotels in Wicklow, about which representations have been made to me, the Glenview Hotel, Tinakilly House Hotel in Rathnew and the Grand Hotel in Wicklow. These are meritorious projects of the type of which I have been speaking. I have passed very comprehensive details <Col N="1906" /> of these projects to the Minister for Finance, and again I appeal to him to examine the matter very carefully with a view to these people being accommodated.</P>
    <P>I would like to address the matter of our need to provide infrastructural developments in order that we as a small country on the periphery of Europe are adequately geared to meet the challenges of the Single Market.  Modern sea port facilities are essential as are first class road systems.  I am satisfied that major investment is going into the primary road network and that the Government fully realise the importance of this.  However, only a handful of ports &mdash; the major ones &mdash; are being treated with the same level of urgency.  Irish ports particularly on the east coast require substantial assistance to ready themselves to provide the facilities necessary to support industry.  These ports have declined as traditional export industries declined and, apart from one or two major ports, have not regained the state of development compatible with the new requirements of the Community market.</P>
    <P>I am particularly heartened by the efforts of the various port authorities and local effort to revitalise these ports.  I would compliment the ports of Arklow and Wicklow in particular.  Their gallant efforts mirror those of similar ports around the country.  However, a port such as Arklow or Wicklow, in the aftermath of a recessionary period, cannot possibly maintain its standards much less effect improvement without substantial financial assistance.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that our peripheral location in which we are unique, now that the Channel Tunnel has joined the UK with mainland Europe, entitles us to special treatment by the European Community to enable us to reach the competitive standards that are required.  I would ask the Minister for the Marine to consider this matter.  In so doing I would like to thank that Minister most sincerely for coming to Arklow last year when we experienced major difficulties after the storm.  He examined the harbour there and saw what was needed.  At the same time he examined the position with <Col N="1907" /> regard to the north beach at Arklow where £8 million worth of private dwelling and commercial property was at risk. The Minister was good enough to provide almost £1 million to address that problem and work has now been carried out in that area.  That is a credit to the Minister and I thank him most sincerely for it.</P>
    <P>I would like briefly to address the question of law and order.  While crime seems to be under control in the cities it has extended to rural Ireland where the problem has escalated.  In my constituency of Wicklow I receive constant complaints in this regard.  I realise the Minister has done good work up to now in reducing the levels of crime and I would ask him to continue to monitor the situation.  I have received complaints about the western area of my county, the Baltinglass area, the Blessington area which is on the periphery of Dublin and my own area of Rathdrum where a major crime was committed last year with the killing of a clergyman.  Such crimes should not be allowed continue.  We must tackle the problem.  I thank the Minister for the measures he has implemented thus far and I would ask him to continue to monitor the position with a view to further reducing the levels of crime.  The measures he has taken include recruiting an extra 1,000 gardaí over a three year period.  I would ask him to ensure that a fair share of those resources are directed at counties such as Wicklow which have particular difficulties in view of their close proximity to the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I want to say a brief word about forestry and to compliment the Minister sitting in front of me for overseeing the setting up of Coillte Teoranta.  I repeatedly asked the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, when he had responsibility for that area &mdash; and I ask the Minister who now has responsibility &mdash; to bear in mind the importance of looking after the small timber men.  I spoke about this in the House and other fora and they must not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation of Government Departments is proceeding well.  As I said before, we do not have to be 100 or 200 <Col N="1908" /> miles from Dublin to decentralise.  We are not 100 miles from Dublin but, when Coillte Teoranta decide to decentralise, we should like to welcome them to Wicklow to set up their offices within the premier forestry county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is underprivileged and needed assistance.  With regard to the disadvantaged areas scheme, there is some disturbing news emanating this afternoon from Brussels about the Commission's approach to the scheme put forward by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I hope it will not cause any problems and will not reduce the area of land which will, ultimately, be accepted by the Commission.  I am sure we will learn more about that over the next couple of days.  I was one of the advocates over the years, since my last submission in February 1987, that all Ireland should be classified as disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons for this, as mentioned by Deputy Jacob, is that we are the only island nation in the EC and we suffer a distinct disadvantage nationally because of our isolation, additional transport costs and our distance from the <Col N="1909" /> marketplace.  We have a case for requesting that the whole island be declared disadvantaged, seriously or moderately.</P>
    <P>Another matter referred to by Deputy Jacob is an outside influence which could affect us internally to a considerable degree, the tourist industry.  We are dependent on people coming from abroad to visit Ireland on holidays or on business.  The budget calculations could well be upset if there is another international crisis &mdash; as is the case in the Gulf at the moment &mdash; continuing throughout 1991.  The war may be concluded within a matter of weeks or months but the repercussions of events in the Middle East may linger for not just months but years.  They could have a most depressing effect &mdash; as they are having immediately &mdash; on our tourist trade.  All we need is another couple of Lockerbies or similar air disasters to make us very isolated. Our calculations for revenue coming in would be seriously distorted.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another element, external and internal, the evolving situation in agriculture.  We depend primarily for our income from agriculture on the European Community and in the last few weeks the most frightening proposals have come from the EC Commission which, if implemented in full or in part, will damage our economy out of all proportion. I am amazed that the reception in this country for those proposals has been so muted.  If those proposals had been put forward by a Commissioner who had previously belonged to the Fine Gael Party, if they had been received by a Minister for Agriculture from the Fine Gael Party or, if a Fine Gael Government were in power, we would either have been lynched or run out of the country. Instead of a national outcry from all sectors there is a kind of half welcome for the proposals in certain quarters.  Certainly we do not have the kind of resistance or criticisms which the proposals should have received.  It is astonishing that people can be cowed into so little &mdash; or no &mdash; reaction.  &ldquo;Cowed&rdquo; is the word to use.  I find it difficult to believe that we are now witnessing the dismantling of the Common Agricultural Policy before our <Col N="1910" /> very eyes, brought about by our Commissioner in Europe, without a whimper from the Government.  It is quite unbelieveable, but true.  However, I will not let it happen without expressing my disapproval and my total resistance &mdash; and that of my party &mdash; to these pretty awful proposals.</P>
    <P>Remember that this country depends on agriculture for 10 per cent of its gross national product, way in excess of any other industry.  This country also depends for its employment content to the extent of 20 per cent of the total labour force employed or working in the agricultural sector or in allied industries.  As I said, the proposals from Brussels, if implemented in full or in part, will seriously damage the economy of the State.  This timid approach cannot be allowed to continue.  We must put up a fight.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Agriculture and represented this country in Europe for four years, I was constantly goaded and harassed and told that if anything affected the interests of Irish farmers or the economy I should not hesitate to use the veto.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that our agricultural industry, which is central to the economy and the budget, is endangered by decisions being taken in Brussels. What this House should be most concerned about is that these decisions contravene our vital national interests.  If we, as Members of this House, cannot advocate the defence of our vital national interests we should not be Members of this House and what we will end up with is a dictatorship.  We must resist anything which will damage our vital national interests and must use the veto to protect ourselves from irreparable damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If such damage occurs we will discuss a different kind of budget next year.  We joined the European Community in the belief that we would gain considerably from our agricultural activities and in the knowledge that we would lose a sizeable number of jobs in traditional industries such as textiles, clothing and footwear and in not so traditional industries such as car assembly.  We joined with our eyes open but now the very reason we joined, to benefit from the Common Agricultural Policy, the benefits of which would accrue to agriculture and associated <Col N="1912" /> industries, is being undermined.  I defy anyone on this island to tell me to stop speaking about the imminent danger.</P>
    <P>If the price structures of commodities such as beef, milk, cereals and sheep are undermined then our economy will be grievously undermined.  We must see to it that those price structures are protected. However, it is being advocated in Brussels at present that the supporters for those typically Irish products, which account for over 90 per cent of our agricultural production, be eroded.  I should point out that last year, when the proposals made were quite modest, the agricultural sector suffered a drop in income of 16 per cent.  However, this year the proposals are far more severe.  Not alone do we have the Commissioner's severe proposals but also those deriving from the GATT negotiations.  We can be sure that as a result of the two the agricultural sector will suffer a considerable drop in income.  This may be of the order of 16 per cent or 26 per cent, yet people are being told not to talk about it, that it is not to be discussed, that we are to take it lying down.  Others may be prepared to do that but I am not.  I want to see some action, some resistance, public debate and the nation getting up to say we are not prepared to accept proposals which will damage our economy and we want to protect our vital national interests.  We do not have the industrial riches that the Germans, the French and the British have.</P>
    <P>This is the only country in northern Europe which has a high component of its gross national product tied up in agriculture. The Greeks and the Portuguese do not mind if the proposals from Brussels are severe so far as our products are concerned because there are no severe proposals to reduce the price of wine, olive oil, fruit and vegetables.  They are laughing up their sleeves because the proposals are aimed specifically at us. Farming is the backbone of our society and it is our job to defend that structure. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, will give me his full support on this seeing that he is a member of the <Col N="1913" /> farming community.  We must resist draconian proposals if they are going to affect our people, economy and country. Tens of thousands of jobs are at stake.</P>
    <P>Let us do a simple equation and take the figure for the number of people at work as being in the region of one million people and take 20 per cent of those as being employed in agriculture and ancillary industries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The budget tinkered with the problems confronting the agricultural industry.  The amount of money allocated to agriculture in the budget is minute compared with the amount of money that comes to our economy through agriculture from the European Community which is enormous.  We cannot discuss one budget in isolation as, the national and EC budgets are enmeshed, as was quite clearly stated in the Budget Statement. It seems that we are trying to evade the central issue which is the potential damage to the economy.  It was most disturbing to read in yesterday's newspapers that following the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers on Monday the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, stated that he was uncommitted in <Col N="1914" /> so far as the Agriculture Commissioner's proposals are concerned.  I have never come across such disloyalty on the part of any Minister in my years as a Member of this House.  We must be committed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I congratulate Deputy Deasy on his recent appointment as spokesman on agriculture for the Fine Gael Party.  I would like to congratulate him also, before he goes, on the stance he adopted on the Larry Goodman affair. Larry Goodman is a county man of mine and I must say Deputy Deasy adopted an attitude which was very reasonable in all the circumstances.  I compliment him on that.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Spring's contribution and I think he found it very difficult to hide his disappointment that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> had been put together quite recently.  He mentioned that the unions had been dormant in regard to this budget and he referred to it as a holding budget. I make no apologies for the fact that this budget is a holding budget.  It is a holding budget because the ground was laid since 1987 to put the economy back in order. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was an amazing achievement in that it agreed a ten year programme in a very short time.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions proposed that the Government enter into an agreement, or a set of agreements, over a ten year period and the Government freely accepted.  That put paid to many of the arguments the Labour Party and The Workers' Party could dictate to the people outside this Chamber over the next few years, and is one very important element of future stability for the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Spring said that while he had no truck with consultants and particular bodies, consultants are not the problem <Col N="1915" /> in the health area.  If there is any problem in the health area, consultants are a major part of that problem.  The consultants have allegedly asked for £100,000 salary each.  No one, particularly Deputy Spring if he espouses socialist principles, could stand for such a salary given the salaries paid elsewhere. If you go to a consultant the first question he asks is whether you are a member of the VHI.</P>
    <P>This budget is a continuation of what is set down in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which came to an end quite recently.  Since 1987 we have had economic growth of about 4 per cent.  Compare that with the early eighties when there was absolutely no growth in the economy.  We had a 10 per cent increase in investment in the last few years, while in the early eighties we had no increase in investment; in fact, this was not the country in the EC to invest money at all. Since 1987 we have had a huge balance of trade because of the sound financial state of our economy over the last couple of years.  The EMS has stabilised because we have aligned the IR£ with the German mark, and the fact that we have a stable IR£ has been of benefit to the area Deputy McGahon and I come from.  We have the lowest inflation in the EC; in the early eighties we had the highest inflation rate.</P>
    <P>The people on the far side cannot accuse us of making a mess of the economy. Their contributions so far in this debate have shown that they want to talk about everything but the budget &mdash; Deputy Deasy is a classic case in point. They want to digress.  We saw that when we were debating the reduction in the higher VAT rate.  The Deputies on the far side of the House were particularly eloquent about the slight increase in the lower rate of VAT which applies to far fewer goods and services than the higher rate of 23 per cent, which is now down to 21 per cent.</P>
    <P>We have an unprecedented level of peace in the workplace.  We have had very few strikes in the last couple of years.  Compare that with the years of the <Col N="1916" /> Fine Gael-Labour Coalition when there were strikes every day.  Our Exchequer borrowing was very high, now it is the lowest for 40 years.  Compare that with the dark years of the early and middle eighties.  Our foreign debt has been reduced as has our foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 employment has risen by about 40,000.  Compare that with 1982-86 when 50,000 people fell unemployed, and there was a reduction in employment; between 1988 and 1989 redundancies fell by about 13,000 compared with 30,000 in 1983-84; and emigration has fallen yet again.  Some may say that is because opportunities in England and America are fewer than they were, but the younger people are staying here because there are more job opportunities for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with this budget first which initiates the implemention of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It also targets the lower paid and less well off.  Despite what certain people outside this House would say, it continues to reform the taxation system and, of course, in the budget there is extra spending for health, education and housing.</P>
      <P>As I said, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is a ten year programme.  The fact that it has been put to bed so easily by the social partners and the Government shows the level of commitment of employers, unions and the Government to ensure we have stability on the financial and industrial scene, over the next few years.  It goes without saying that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which came to an end recently increased our competitiveness in the foreign markets, and that, ultimately will lead to more job opportunities on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last number of years social welfare benefits have increased well ahead of inflation.  The general 4 per cent increase in social welfare given in this budget &mdash; and in some areas an 11 per cent increase in the very low paid social <Col N="1917" /> welfare areas &mdash; brings us in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  We have tried over a number of years to achieve the level suggested in the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement started in a very small way.  That is being developed and increased in this budget and shows the commitment of the Minister for Social Welfare and the Cabinet to home in on the less well off who are taking home a low wage.  The fact that the FIS leaflet will be issued with the tax free allowance certificate to every earner is good because it will alert more people who are low paid to the fact that the FIS is there and they can take it up.</P>
    <P>Child benefit has been increased and this is targeted particularly at larger families. The carer's allowance which was initiated last year has been a very good scheme.  While I accept there may be teething problems, it is a very good scheme that Deputies on both sides of the House asked for.  I have no doubt but that, as the years progress, that scheme will be of much greater benefit and will be extended, as it has been in this budget.</P>
    <P>Most Members will be aware of the problems of mixed insurance.  A number of people have approached me who were becoming ineligible for social insurance because they were involved in this mixed insurance cover.  I note that the Minister for Finance has given a commitment that the Minister for Social Welfare will be introducing legislation in this respect &mdash; on which I compliment him and the Government.  The fact that social insurance hence forth will be applicable to part-time workers is to be applauded. If ever there was a party who were good to workers I have to say it has been the Fianna Fáil Party.  We are introducing progressive legislation in this area ahead of a number of our counterparts on the European Continent.  I refer to the legislation dealing with part-time workers introduced by the Minister for Labour. In his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance indicated that his colleague, the <Col N="1918" /> Minister for Social Welfare, will be introducing social insurance for these part-time workers so that henceforth they will receive all the benefits full-time workers have enjoyed to date.</P>
    <P>Taxation has been reformed in a big way.  We began in 1987 with the tax amnesty which was an unmitigated success. Since then self-assessment has been introduced which has been extended under the provisions of this budget.  It is a wonderful system which means that more people avail of self-assessment because they want to do so.  Indeed, it is a system which lends itself to much less abuse.  Perhaps Deputy McGahon might think of self-assessment on the betting side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has continued to reduce the top and standard rates of income tax and has widened the tax base.  Therefore, to maintain that the taxation scene has not been reformed is not true.  The Government must be given credit for reducing the income tax bands in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this budget the Minister has also extended the self-assessment procedure to capital gains tax.  I do agree with previous speakers that there is a way in which more money could be obtained by way of capital taxation if only we examined the possibilities more thoroughly.  The Minister said it was intended to introduce an amnesty with regard to capital acquisitions tax on which I compliment him.  I do not know whether his officials have examined the possibility of allowing people avail of the amnesty in that area. Something that has not been noticed by many people in this budget is the fact that the Minister abolished the two top rates of capital acquisitions tax, leaving the top <Col N="1919" /> rate at 40 per cent, constituting a realistic approach to inheritance and gift tax.</P>
    <P>In his Budget Statement the Minister referred to 1992, the various problems that the Single Market will entail for this country but also the opportunities it will present.  He mentioned that there were left 700 days between now and 1 January 1993.  Deputy McGahon and I are aware of the problems that will be encountered by the Customs and Excise officials and Customs clearance agents on the implementation of that Single Market in 1993.  Thereafter there will be no need for a Customs post in and around the town of Dundalk or on the Border.  This means that the people who now work, as State employees, as Customs and Excise officials, will have to be redeployed, either by accepting redundancy or in a decentralised office which had been proposed but has taken some time to come to Dundalk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should leave that one to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows only too well, his Government cast aside the decentralisation programme in 1982. Had that programme been implemented at that time we would have had that office in Dundalk long ago.  Unfortunately Customs clearance agents are not in as advantageous a position as Customs and Excise officials, State employees, who will have an opportunity of redeployment, redundancies or whatever.  Customs clearance agents are private employees.  When the Border restrictions no longer apply those Customs clearance agents will become redundant.  We should remember that Customs clearance is one of the larger employers in the Border area in and around Dundalk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to health I was pleased to note that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has stipulated a seven year programme, and allocated a sum of £8 million for community care in this budget.  Much more money needs to be allocated for that purpose.  The Government's priority is right in allocating <Col N="1920" /> money to that area because not sufficient has been done for our elderly, mentally handicapped or physically handicapped.</P>
    <P>The elimination of category II to hospital entitlement will be accepted by most people as being a good decision.  The scaremongering engaged in, particularly on the part of hospital consultants &mdash; that it will create an enormous strain on our hospitals &mdash; is a falsity.  The Minister has said that private patients requiring non-emergency operations will have to occupy private or semi-private beds in hospitals and not use public hospital beds.  That is something we would all wish to see happen.</P>
    <P>We have encountered enormous problems on the education scene over the years so that the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and begun under the provisions of this budget is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme has been of particular interest to me because, as Deputy McGahon will know, the Cooley alcohol factory in County Louth has been reopened with 70 employees, people who would otherwise not have had jobs.  By and large it was reopened by moneys made available under the provisions of the business expansion scheme. People had been contending that the business expansion scheme was a bad one, but that is one example of a factory that is up and running as a consequence of its provisions, something that should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>With regard to the contention that the provisions of the business expansion scheme should be abolished with regard to hotels, I accept what the Minister has done and what a number of speakers have said here earlier.  The Minister might limit the provisions of that scheme with regard to hotels.  He might re-examine its provisions and reintroduce them in areas not of major tourist potential.  There are areas with hotels that do not warrant the provisions of the business expansion scheme whereas along the Border and other areas outside Dublin, in the southwest, additional help is needed and the provisions of that scheme might be of some benefit to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1921" /> I was disappointed that the Minister imposed another 10p on the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes.  The Carrols cigarette factory is one of the major employers in the town of Dundalk.  This latest increase has put the squeeze on them. There has been a take-over of that company and, hopefully, their future will be rosy.  However, if this price trend continues budget after budget I am not too sure that that will be a good thing for that company.</P>
    <P>I must compliment Deputy McGahon on his role as spokesperson on Border areas.  He has done a lot of shouting about Border areas in recent years.  I listened to Deputy Dukes with interest debate the budget on the first day in regard to excise duties and so on, when he continued to comment on Border areas.  I well recall Deputy Dukes, as Minister for Finance, coming and having a cup of tea in the Lisdoo Arms Hotel saying what he would do for Border areas.  Yet he went off and forgot about them.  The Deputy will have to acknowledge that.</P>

All the Deputy has to do is look at the budget speech.  It mentions the fact that the PAYE allowance has been given to cross-frontier workers &mdash; something for which I have lobbied over the last number of years.</P>

      <P>In this budget we can see proof that the Government can no longer tackle the twin problems of unemployment and emigration.  The latest unemployment figures show a dramatic increase with over 241,000 people on the live register.  When one includes over 25,000 people who are training or who are on social employment schemes in order to keep them off the live register, the magnitude of the problem can be seen.  The ongoing monthly increase in the numbers unemployed show the necessity for radical measures to tackle long term unemployment.  Over 100,000 people have been out of work for a year. A Central Statistics Office analysis of these 100,000 show that 47,000 people were unemployed for more than three years, another 20,000 for one to two years and a further 33,000 for two to three years.  Of the 100,000 about 75,000 are men.  When one adds on dependants, about 150,000 people the total numbers affected by long term unemployment increase to about 250,000.  The implications of this are frightening.</P>
      <P>Unemployment impacts on the opportunities of children.  In recognition of these children the social welfare increases in the budget are derisory.  The highest rate of monthly child benefit applying only to the fourth child is a minor concession. The proposed social welfare allowances will help to feed the children, but other needs will be given through sacrifices by the parents and it is usually the mother who has to make those sacrifices. Some small initiatives announced in the recent budget will do nothing to redress the current situation and it is about time this problem was analysed on a more serious basis and remedial action taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government have projected a yearly increase of 20,000 jobs.  Of course, these job projections are based on gross numbers without an <Col N="1923" /> allowance for redundancies.  Now, because of the faltering economies of both the USA and the UK many of our emigrants have returned home and are looking for jobs.  I am sure all Deputies have had visits from these to their advice clinics.  Indeed, the number of emigrants who stayed on at Christmas is symptomatic of that decline.  Many of those returned emigrants are in the unskilled category and job opportunities for them are scarce.</P>
    <P>It is time that we had innovative thinking on our industrial policy.  That innovation is not to be seen in the latest budget where the job-creating bodies under the Minister for Industry and Commerce have experienced cuts.  SFADCo experienced a cut of over £1 million, the IDA, £1.3 million and Science and Technology £1.65 million.  Indeed, in my own area, the mid-west region where the Minister lives we had the ludicrous situation over a short time when the present Minister for Finance when he was in Industry and Commerce extended the remit for overseas marketing for industries to SFADCo.  Subsequently the present Minister withdrew that responsibility and handed it back to the IDA.  Now we have a fragmented approach in the area to overseas job creation with no proper functional regional office of the IDA.</P>
    <P>The recent NESC report published in September last promoted the necessity for a change in strategy.  There is no commitment for change by the Government if the recent programme and the budget is any indication.</P>
    <P>In the area of taxation the Government are long in aspiration but lacking the commitment to taxation reform.  We continue to tinker with the present system.  The minimalist effects in the changes of the rates of tax will be quickly eroded by pay increases and many will lose out.  Indeed, an overall analysis of the budget gives credence to the statement &ldquo;What the Minister giveth the Minister taketh away&rdquo;.  The Minister has pulled a very slick one in abolishing the upper income limit of £16,700 where the health contribution of 1.25 per cent applies.  This <Col N="1924" /> has been done, as he states, to provide funds for all free consultant treatment and free public beds in public hospitals. We all know that the present health boards cannot cope with their current demands due to severe financial constraints. Does the Minister think that members are going to desert the VHI to avail of a service which is already creaking at the seams?  Already one third of current VHI subscribers, opt for private consultant care, even though they are eligible for free consultants.  All that this change will mean for those over this salary level is increased deductions, and the present waiting list for the public hospitals will not be extended further, we hope.</P>
    <P>I will refer also to the deposit interest retention tax introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour Government and which was, at the time vilified by the Fianna Fáil Party.  In Government they have seen that the DIRT tax generates a lot of revenue.  There is one area that causes concern to me and that is the DIRT tax as it applies to old age pensioners.  We all know that it is possible to get a tax refund if one claims in the subsequent tax year but many pensioners are fearful of claiming the DIRT tax back because they are afraid it will interfere with their current pension allowances.  This is brought to my attention by accountants and banking interests.  In an effort to establish how many old age pensioners were eligible for this DIRT tax, and how many claimed it back, the Minister in a reply which I received today said it was not possible to quantify that.  There must be a simpler mechanism of implementing this DIRT tax in relation to old age pensioners.  In many cases old age pensioners pay accountants to attend to the paper work. There is a lot of finance in the Exchequer as a result of old age pensioners not retrieving this allowance.  It is an area which the Government should address.</P>
    <P>The present housing policy of the Government is disastrous due to the drastic cutback of finance.  The waiting list for houses has increased to over 19,000 and therefore, more of our population have to rely on mortgages.  It would have been <Col N="1925" /> a retrograde step to have reduced the mortgage interest relief further and I am glad the Minister did not do that.  The Government have progressively reduced mortgage interest relief from 1987, from £4,000 to £3,200, a reduction of 25 per cent.  Ten years ago that relief was at £4,800.  This has been happening even though there has been an escalating cost in the prices of houses.  Now that many people are taking our endowment mortgages which have a life assurance element, what do the Government do? They reduce from 50 per cent to 25 per cent the life assurance tax relief, thus penalising those families who have taken the initiative to house themselves.  In so doing he could also penalise further the insurance industry which has a total employment content of over 9,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister justifies the VAT changes by stating they were to bring us into line with our EC partners. Therefore, there is a reduction from 23 per cent to 21 per cent, which is to be welcomed. However, there is an increase from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent on a wide range of goods.  These increases will especially hit the old and the lower income groupings as items such as fuel for heating, light and power will be affected along with other items.  When VAT is increased it reduces the purchasing power of households. It would be beneficial if the Government had indicated what VAT harmonisation target was their objective. The EC Commission, in their most recent document on the economic consequences of fiscal harmonisation in Europe, state that in principle there should operate only two rates, a standard rate between 14 per cent and 20 per cent and a reduced rate between 4 and 9 per cent.  Therefore, the increase from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent is surprising unless the Minister is striving for one rate only.  It would have been helpful if the Minister had fully clarified his long term intentions. Because of the lack of policing to ensure previous VAT reductions were passed on, what safeguards does the Minister intend to introduce to ensure the latest <Col N="1926" /> VAT reductions are passed on to the consumer?</P>
    <P>In order to help the lower paid the Minister has made minor adjustments.  It is difficult and understandable that the motivation of those who are working in the low income group is often affected when they compare the social welfare entitlements of those who are unemployed. There is an urgent necessity for a detailed study of the linkage between social welfare concessions and taxation at work to ensure that those at work are adequately compensated for their endeavour and not caught in a poverty trap where fear of overtime may often be a deterrent to earning pay as they may lose out on their medical card and other concessions.  There is no incentive for a person on social welfare to move into lower paid employment.  There is an urgent necessity to integrate the tax and social welfare systems and to analyse the poverty traps.</P>
    <P>The cruellest disappointment in this budget has been reserved for farmers. They are already frustrated due to what is happening with GATT and, more recently, the recommended draconian CAP proposals.  President Bush would certainly say that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a bully boy.  He is, of course, but the Americans have also used bully boy tactics in relation to the GATT talks. We should not accept this.  In all areas outside agriculture they stand to benefit considerably.</P>
    <P>When one considers these changes are being advocated by an Irish EC Commissioner and a former Minister for Agriculture, their annoyance is understandable.  It is widely known that these changes will have a recessionary effect on the industry.  The Government's aspirations on the importance of agriculture have a hollow ring.  The minor change in the adjustment from 50 per cent to 55 per cent on agricultural relief in the capital acquisition tax was derisory as this is an area which has caused a lot of concern to young farmers.  Now that farmers are paying tax in the current year there is justification for extending the <Col N="1927" /> PAYE-PRSI allowance to them, but this is still denied to them.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly for farmers and other self employed occurred when PRSI was introduced.  Those of them in the 56-65 age bracket on 6 April 1988 would not qualify for contributory pension as they could not adhere to the ten-year period. The injustice of this is that they will have to pay PRSI contributions to old age at 66.  They will then qualify for a much lesser non-contributory pension but the sting is that this will be means tested. Surely an effective mechanism can be found to ensure these farmers and self employed are entitled to contributory pension.</P>
    <P>The ongoing delay in the funding of the extension and reclassification of Ireland's disadvantaged areas is a scandal.  The survey of the areas was started in January 1989 and now in February 1991 we are still awaiting EC approval.  With a little more effort and understanding by the Government there is no reason farmers should not have received their headage payments during 1990.  The ongoing delay is deplorable and one hopes the Minister will ensure an early finalisation of the submission.</P>
    <P>The introduction of veterinary charges from zero to 12.5 per cent will increase the average farmer's expenses from £80 to £100.  Instead of increasing the confidence of farmers by our Government being sympathetic to their plight, they have shown a complete lack of sensitivity to the farming crisis.</P>
    <P>The Government since 1987 have made great play over the fall in Exchequer borrowing.  It is worthwhile analysing this.  The fall in Exchequer borrowing has been mainly achieved by public sector pay restraint, increased tax revenue and a slight decrease in unemployment during that period.  This decrease in unemployment has been mainly achieved due to more people being on training and social employment schemes.  About 8,000 people were put on pre-retirement pension to remove them from the live register.</P>
    <P>Many special pay increases have been <Col N="1928" /> deferred.  The folly of staying off the payment of these increases over the 1987-90 period has come to haunt the Government. Was it sensible in previous budgets not to have provided for this situation?  I contend that it was not, as now these constitute increases which the public service are entitled to and they will have a new impact on the finances this year.</P>
    <P>Independent economists feel this borrowing requirement will be considerably increased and the Minister in the budget would appear to have inflated some of the projected revenue returns for 1991. The Minister referred to the privatisation of Irish Life this year and stated that the sale proceeds will be used to reduce borrowing and thus help ease the burden of the national debt and of debt servicing costs.  It is interesting that economists project he could possibly have an overrun of £200 million.  Regarding the privatisation of Irish Life a figure of £60 million has been mentioned.</P>
    <P>Surely it is apparent that in order to get to the successful conclusion of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government were prepared to promise anything to the social partners. This budget has been framed within the parameters of this programme.  Are the Government serious about the long term implementation of this programme? After all, enshrined in the agreement is the statement that implementation is, &ldquo;subject to the overriding consideration that the final parameters continue to be observed&rdquo;.  It is difficult to see this being achieved as the budget is deceptive on analysis.  It is framed to act as a small palliative to the Progressive Democrats, their partners in Government.  Most of the measures within the budget had already been pre-announced so the people were conditioned to it.  However, the Government have shown in the budget that they lack ideas and imagination and have displayed their inability to respond to the serious problems which confront us.  They have failed especially to respond to unemployment and taxation reform and the many other important issues which needed to be addressed.</P>

      <P>I listened with wry amusement to Deputy Michael Noonan, the spokesman on finance for the main Opposition party, when he spoke about old hangers.  He referred to the Taoiseach sitting in an old banger with the windows closed while the Minister for Finance tinkered away with the engine.  Of course, when one thinks about it, it is not very remarkable that Deputy Noonan should have spoken about old bangers because nobody should know more about old bangers than the same Deputy Noonan.  He was the chief mechanic under the greatest old banger in the history of the State when it was driven by that daredevil himself, Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  Well, that old banger blew up leaving a trail of destruction in its wake, but not before the petrol attendants, Deputy Spring and his colleagues had retired from the pit. Deputy Spring today, and of course Deputy De Rossa, would know that their old banger blew up somewhere in Eastern Europe in the middle of 1989 and they have been running around the country looking for used cars ever since.</P>
      <P>A certain weekly radio programme has recently been entertaining us with light hearted impressions of a variety of public figures.  It is a healthy thing, of course, to pause occasionally and laugh at ourselves, and even at our most sacred institutions.  In our profession, politics, we are perhaps inclined to take ourselves a little too seriously at times.  However, I am certain that the initiaters of the &ldquo;Scrap Saturday&rdquo; programme never visualised for a moment that one of their creations would actually become incarnate, but they reckoned without Deputy Michael Noonan, the Fine Gael spokesman on Finance.  They should have left him alone because, lo and behold, with the sight of the television cameras he has become an outstanding comedian and is now coming to rival Bugs Bunny nationally. The programme makers have only to use the Deputy's scripts from his budget speech and his subsequent party political broadcasts as something not to be taken seriously and, accordingly, ideal for their next show.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1930" /> Just in case somebody may not have a sense of humour I find it necessary to refer to some of the things that Deputy Noonan said when he had access to the nation via radio and TV.  He referred to this year's borrowing requirement as if it were a brand new type of monster created for the first time by this Government. The effect of it, he said, would be to add £7,660 to the national debt for every child born in 1991, a nice birthday present, he observed.  This was a shattering revelation indeed, calculated to strike terror into the heart of every couple expecting a happy event this year.  Can you imagine the unfortunate people wringing their hands and exclaiming, &ldquo;where are we going to get £7,660?&rdquo; As a cheap political gimmick, this one certainly took the biscuit.</P>
    <P>However, let us adopt this ridiculous criterion for a moment and ask, by the same token, what kind of birthday present the Fine Gael Party were offering just four years ago.  You will recall that early that year, for a merciful short few weeks, we had the rare phenomenon of an undiluted Fine Gael Government, born when the Labour Party finally decided to desert the sinking ship or, as I said earlier, when the petrol attendants left the pit to leave the old banger to go on its own.  After four years of their stewardship they presented what was to be the budget for 1987.  Their opening borrowing requirement was no less than £2,028 million or, to use Deputy Noonan's type of reasoning, more than £33,700 for every child to be born in that year.  If we were to continue with this ridiculous scenario, and there is no reason we should not, if only those parents had waited four more years, look at what they would have saved.  Deputy Noonan's party political broadcast was tremendous radio comedy.  He suggested that the only hope for Ireland was to put Fine Gael in the driving seat.  Can anyone imagine a more horrific nightmare when one recalls the last time they occupied the position?  They only had a provisional licence and it would appear that they are never likely to pass the driving test no matter how many licences they have.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1931" /> After more than four years in power they had driven so far off the road that by the time the old banger blew up the front wheels were already over the precipice of bankruptcy and we were on the verge of putting ourselves at the mercy of the International Monetary Fund.  So much for old hangers.  They presented us with an opening budget deficit for that year of £1,294 million, or seven per cent of GNP and, as I have already said, an opening borrowing requirement of £2,028 million or 11.7 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey took over the driving seat we were to witness what was, by any standards, a miracle of economic management. Presented as he was with the Fine Gael Estimates, the then Finance Minister, Deputy MacSharry, immediately set about tackling these appalling figures by cutting the deficit and borrowing requirement by close on £300 million.  The lesson here is, of course, that it was extremely fortunate that the chief mechanic was changed.</P>
    <P>After 12 months of prudent and courageous management the figures under these two headings came in £20 million and £70 million under target respectively. When the present Minister, Deputy Albert Reynolds took office, the astonishing recovery continued without pause, and we have now reached the stage where the current deficit has dropped from 7.4 per cent of GNP to one per cent and borrowing from 11.2 per cent to two per cent.  This dramatic change in our fortunes has been brought about by a combination of factors.  First we had a Government who had the courage to take a succession of sometimes unpopular decisions, in contrast to the Fine Gaelled Coalition who talked endlessly about courage and then acted spinelessly.  Then we had the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in which the social partners, comprising many people of vision and patriotism became involved with the Government in democracy at what I would describe as its most effective.  Finally, <Col N="1932" /> and most important, we had the recognition by the majority of our people that what we were doing was right, even though it demanded many sacrifices.</P>
    <P>Coming up to the 1991 budget we read and listened to the gloomy forecasts from various commentators.  They reckoned that the combined effects of the Gulf War, the new political situation in Germany, and the prospects of deepening recession in Britain and the United States would force the Minister to either make further draconian cuts in expenditure or resume borrowing on a massively increased scale, or even both.  Let it be said that there were political parties in this country, major political parties, who were hoping that would occur.  This, of course, has not been the case.  The prudent and skilful management of our economy for the past four years has resulted in our being able to withstand these external pressures to a much greater degree than we would have visualised a few short years ago.  Despite all the present difficulties the tax and social welfare elements of this budget are quite remarkable. In four years we have reduced the standard and higher income tax rates by 6 per cent as well as reducing the top rate of VAT by 4 per cent.  In addition we have managed to maintain the practice of increasing social welfare payments at rates higher than inflation.</P>
    <P>Despite all the posturing by Deputy Noonan and others on the Opposition benches the fact remains that these things have been done while at the same time reducing borrowing and current deficits on a massive scale.  The recently negotiated <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> means that the climate for further development in all areas can be maintained.  My own earnest hope &mdash; shared I am sure by every Member of the House &mdash; is that the most significant part of this progress will be the generation of much greater levels of employment. Many thousands more people are at work now than four years ago.  However, I am convinced that the vast increase in company profits have not been matched by anything like a similar growth in jobs. <Col N="1933" /> This is something which has to be addressed.  It is up to many employers to realise that in the long run a shorter dole queue will be to their advantage.</P>
    <P>In general terms it was a budget that any Labour Minister in any part of Europe would be proud to present because it addressed the plight of those people most in need in Irish society.  It is rather ironic then that the Labour Party and The Workers' Party saw fit to criticise virtually every element of it.</P>
    <P>The fact that the social welfare increases are 4 per cent means that social welfare payments remain ahead of inflation.  This in turn means that those at the bottom of the scale, those who are disadvantaged and those who are needy, are increasingly becoming better off under this Government.  That is an excellent achievement against the backdrop of the desperate state of the national finances.</P>
    <P>If I were to have a criticism, and of course I have some, it would be that I am very concerned about the situation facing non-contributory widow and widower pensioners.  While the budget introduced provisions for tax relief for working widows and widowers it did not give a matching benefit to widows and widowers who are not in a position to work.  While these people received an increase, there is very little doubt that the disparity between working widows and widowers and non-working widows and widowers has broadened and I think the question of widows and widowers with non-contributory pensions should be looked at again.</P>
    <P>Let us be perfectly honest.  We have a housing problem at present which has to be addressed in the context of the finances available.  If I were to venture to make a suggestion on it within the constraints facing us it would be that of those on the public housing list there would be at least 20 per cent, if not 30 per cent, living in homes which could be made habitable. In particular, the homes of the elderly could be done up to advantage.  I strongly urge that the housing list be looked at nationally with a view to ascertaining what percentage of those on the public <Col N="1934" /> housing list are living in accommodation that could be made habitable.  It is possible without any doubt &mdash; and the assistant county manager in County Kerry confirmed this recently at a meeting &mdash; that a grant in the region of £10,000 for a house in such a category as I have mentioned would, in the long term, save the Exchequer further funding.  The housing problem has to be addressed because it will not go away.  In my opinion it has to be solved now.</P>
    <P>I often wonder how bureaucrats in Brussels and officials in the Department of the Environment define &ldquo;peripherality&rdquo;. For example, would they consider that a person living on Valentia Island or the Great Blasket Islands is living in a peripheral region?  Is it their view that to be living on the periphery one has to be living on the east coast?  I ask this question because the programme on peripherality was published recently and, from reading that dramatic document, one could not but be led to believe that these people consider peripheral regions to be anywhere in this country which is not a peripheral region within the ordinary and accepted meaning of that term.</P>
    <P>Out of the national primary roads fund, for example, contained in the Operational Programme on Peripherality, the princely sum of £5 million out of a total of several hundred million pounds was given to County Kerry for major road improvements, even though we have 64 miles of national primary route.  Do the people in the Department of the Environment and the people in Brussels consider the Ring of Kerry to be a peripheral region?  Clearly not; they think &ldquo;peripherality&rdquo; means that you are classified as peripheral provided you live within 50 or 60 miles of Dublin city.  I would like to inform them from this House this evening that they have got their definitions wrong and I would strongly advise them to buy a copy of the Oxford Dictionary and read it extremely carefully before they get around to making the next allocation of road moneys or any other moneys in this <Col N="1935" /> country.  I say that without fear or favour because everything I say is true and anybody who would disbelieve such a ridiculous scenario need only read their comments in the programme on peripherality.</P>
    <P>We have a problem in the health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be quite clear that no matter which Government are in power in the future we will have trouble financing the national health service. Since 1988 the amount of funding that has been made available for the health service has increased by 20 per cent, and the net increase is believed to be in the region of 6 per cent.  What is wrong?  Why do the Southern Health Board and other health boards complain that their allocations are down so many millions of pounds again in 1991?  I think the problem is that we have become more sophisticated in the treatment of patients.</P>
      <P>Technology has improved beyond our wildest expectations; of course, our expectations have matched the advances in technology which have been achieved. It seems to me that we will have a continuing problem with the health service. This problem has to be addressed.  Five, or certainly six, years ago the question of a knee joint replacement or an elbow joint replacement was not common place; in fact, it was not heard of in this country.  I could give further examples. Ten or 15 years ago open heart surgery such as by-passes, etc. were not common place or perhaps even heard of in this country.  In my opinion this technology and expertise will continue to improve &mdash; and I sincerely hope it does &mdash; but it means that each successive Government for the foreseeable future will have an Achilles' heel &mdash; the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the frustration of people such as my old friend Deputy Michael Higgins, and others on the left <Col N="1936" /> of centre of Irish political life, although I consider myself to be left of centre though not extremely left of centre.  It occurs to me that the Labour Party and The Workers' Party &mdash; we will leave aside Fine Gael and the old banger machine for a while &mdash; oppose every budget.  They remind me of a sadist at a boxing fight egging on the fighters to beat one another to death when it is clear that both, or at least one, should throw in the towel. False dreams and Utopian ideology ignore the practicalities of life and only serve to injure further, and inflict further suffering on those whom the same ideology and dreams are purported to assist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with very great interest to what the last speaker had to say as I have listened to other speakers on this budget so far.  I can assure the Deputy who has just spoken that Labour's concern is not one of a spectator at a boxing match.  It is very interesting to note that at the foundation of the State, and before, the social and democratic programme of the First Dáil was written by the Labour Party in the vain hope that the independence that this country had secured would lead to the creation of a society and a State which was caring and which had aspects of egalitarianism as its constituent principles and so forth.  Again, on the occasion of the first Fianna Fáil Government in 1932, which was supported by the Labour Party, Mr. de Valera decided to steal some of their programme and tried to throw a social cloak over his political ambitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the history of this country Labour, and the parties of the left, have given expression to a simple fundamental principle, that our independence should be used to raise the living standards of every person here.  That was an aim of citizenship, something to which one might aspire.  It was of course, Mr. de Valera who said quite early in his political life &ldquo;I am afraid that the majority will have to do with primary education&rdquo;, while his own family were educated to third level.  It is a pity the last speaker has <Col N="1937" /> disappeared from the Chamber because I would love to talk to him in detail about the betrayal of the Republic over which Mr. de Valera presided.</P>
    <P>There were people here who believed in an independent Ireland that could be characterised by social equity, by a sense of principle, by a sense of opportunity and by something that might be celebrated. Ireland of the limited opportunities, of the class divisions, the class-based access to health, education and housing and of emigration was one to which the party opposite made a unique contribution between 1932 and 1948, and afterwards.</P>
    <P>We are here to discuss the budget and I want to raise a few questions about it. This debate is regarded by many of the people who speak here as a grey period in parliamentary life &mdash; rather like the weather &mdash; with one budget speech after another.  I have some sympathy for this view because in many ways parliaments all over Europe, and particularly this one being the pale shadow of the House of Commons in many people's view, lived with the mystique of the budget for a long time.  The Lord Chancellor in Britain gets a peck on the cheek from his partner in life and holds up his brief case for photographs.  We almost do the same thing in Ireland though we have stopped holding up the brief case and I notice it has become thinner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not gone into that because I am not sure whether we are a more restrained society than the neighbouring island who would be that bit more repressed.  There will be another day Deputy McGahon, so the Deputy should restrain himself.  One might say that the mystique that surrounds the budget has long disappeared.  The budgets in recent times are of less significance in relation to the economy than they were in the past.  This has been so for a number of reasons.  At different times in the past <Col N="1938" /> when one talked about excise and revenue it was of much more significance whether one increased the price of the pint, cigarettes or whatever or whether one imposed tax on commodities.  In the period between those traditional type budgets when a Government could fall or go out of office on a half-a-crown for the older people, the PAYE system was introduced.  The PAYE sector carry the burden of 90 per cent of the taxation that is paid here.  The taxation they pay is distributed.  We distribute about the same amount in industrial promotion grants as we do to education.  The public are interested in that.  What is in the budget for such people?  There were other people who were interested also.</P>
      <P>I would like to keep my comments short about this rather farcical event we had on 30 January.  It brought the fading mystique of budget day to a nadir.  After the Minister's long speech, which was seen on television &mdash; I, like others, welcome the fact that the public can scrutinise our proceedings &mdash; a few pennies were gathered here and scattered there but nothing fundamental had happened or changed.  One would have imagined one was not living in a country with 18 per cent unemployment or where there is such a high degree of poverty and child poverty in particular.  One would have imagined one was not living in a country that had housing lists that accumulate to 20,000, and in which there had been a massive retreat from the provision of public housing.  One would not imagine one was living in a country where the waiting lists for every basic kind of surgical operation had extended.  The suggestion was that there was something admirable about doing nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a few fundamental questions to put to the Minister, and his financial advisers, in the light of the major press conference the Minister gave after his budget presentation.  At that press briefing he said it was not the business of the State to create jobs.  I regard that statement as one of the most historically significant political statements ever made by a Minister for Finance.  For years we have been told by the Confederation of <Col N="1939" /> Irish Industry, the Federation of Irish Employers, and the representatives of the private sector, that they are not in the business of creating jobs.  Now we have the Government saying, through the mouth of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, at a press conference immediately after the budget, &ldquo;we are not in the business of creating jobs; what we create is a climate of investment.&rdquo; Any one of the 220,000 and 250,000 people who are unemployed might well ask the question when they see the first televised budget, &ldquo;who then is responsible for creating jobs here&rdquo;? Back will come the tired old answers we get year after year from the parties of the right, the ultra conservative party on this side of the House and the quasi-party of the right, the Progressive Democrats, who, like a chameleon can change their colours and, of course, the populous who were converted to stringency in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Who is responsible for creating jobs? The answer comes back, &ldquo;we create a climate of investment&rdquo;.  I invented the term for that school of economics that was called the climatological school. They are the people who do not have the discipline to do the work in relation to economic planning and fiscal management but who come out with shibboleths and cliches.</P>
    <P>I will translate into real economic terms what they are saying.  They are saying, &ldquo;give us low interest rates, good export growth and low inflation and automatically jobs will be created.&rdquo;  The Government got low inflation, lower interest rates and good export growth but they did not get the jobs because there is no directive principle of job creation at work in their strategy.  It is as if they are tidying the house up for a visitor and the job creation principle, which should be at the heart of any Government concerned about employment, has been relegated to the position of one of the characters in <i>Waiting for Godot</i>&mdash; when we have set it all right something will happen. That is the significant point, and let everyone mark it, of the suggestion by Minister <Col N="1940" /> Reynolds &mdash; the Government are not in the business of creating jobs.  I want to refer to the implications of that for our industrial policy.  We on the Left are often accused of being impractical but I will be very practical.  I expect that after 1992 many companies in Ireland will be in danger of being taken over by European companies.  Indeed I would go so far as to say that this will affect some of our major banking institutions.  What strategy does the Minister have for developing indigenous companies, something I argued for in years gone by?  If we want to have linkages and to spend taxpayers money where it will have the maximum multiplier effect, and create the greatest number of jobs, we should try to develop strong, indigenous companies which have the ability to research, produce a product, market effectively and establish niches in the external traded economy. How will the Minister protect such industries after 1992?</P>
    <P>Where has he discriminated, even in his taxation policy which is directed at that sector, between the speculative and productive aspects of investment?  If one is to be taken seriously, one should welcome certain aspects of the budget.  I welcome the fact that social welfare increases will be kept above the rate of inflation but clearly they are not anywhere near the levels recommended in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  I welcome the extension of partial protection to part-time workers.  I certainly welcome the fact that there will be more teachers in the classrooms. However, in regard to the key issue of employment creation and investment, which is at the back of it, where is there evidence of any strategy?  It is not only I who have noted this aspect of the Irish economy.  It was in fact the distinguished former Senator and public servant, Dr. Ken Whitaker, who noted some years ago that the rot set in in the seventies, that is, it became more rewarding for Irish investors to speculate than to invest in productive activity and get a return from their capital.</P>
    <P>I will stick to the question to which I want a reply: when will the favourable <Col N="1941" /> conditions be right and where will the jobs be?  What directive principle will the Government use to translate their favourable climate into actual jobs and where will those jobs be?  The money from Europe, just over £3 billion, which will be invested here between now and 1994 will create 10,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>I listened to the previous speaker talking about peripherality as if he did not know what it was.  He knows very well that the reality is that there is not anything like the semblance of a regional policy in Ireland.  I am not a bit confused about questions on peripherality.  The reason the Deputy was confused is because it will work like this.  He referred to the recently circulated report on roads investment in this country where for every £3 put up nationally we will get £7 from Europe.  What was beginning to bite into the Fianna Fáil backbencher's heart is that to get the £7 and spend the £3 the county roads would have to be allowed deteriorate so that the national road network could be improved, thus giving the people who want to build toll roads a heyday.  This is upsetting some of the cockles in the hearts of the rural Fianna Fáil backbenchers.</P>
    <P>What is marvellous about this affected naivety is that people do not know what is happening.  When the Minister goes to Europe &mdash; the previous speaker made many references to this &mdash; he will be asked what he is doing about unemployment. I am sure the Spaniards will be very anxious to listen to what we have to say.  Spain is the only other country in the EC which has a higher rate of unemployment than Ireland.  If the people in Brussels tell the Minister they want to help him, what proposals does the Minister have?  A very watered down EC Council Resolution of 29 May contained this reference to unemployment:</P>
    <P>Whereas, in its Resolution of 19 December 1984 on action to combat long term unemployment, the Council considered that specific measures should be employed to take account of the serious problem of long term <Col N="1942" /> unemployment, requiring both individual and joint action by governments and both sides of industry at local, regional and national levels, which should be supported at Community level...</P>
    <P>Where are the Irish proposals for the long term unemployed which would be supported by the Community?  What initiatives have we taken to discriminate in favour of the long term unemployed? How are we to get such people back into the workforce?  The same EC Resolution stated:</P>
    <P>...a response is called for at Community, national and local level, involving the Commission, governments, employers and trade unions, in order to make actions in favour of the long term unemployed more effective.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister going to say: &ldquo;our employers have long said it is not their duty to create employment and as I said at a recent press conference after my budget, it is not my duty either&rdquo;?  What would the Europeans think of such a statement by a Minister from a country which has the second highest unemployment rate in Europe?</P>
    <P>For those who might have expected some relief in taxation, this budget can hardly have been an ecstatic experience with its little dribble of concession in direct taxation for some people, which is more than compensated for by the clawback in the extension of VAT and indirect taxation.  There are two basic principles at stake in the reform of taxation.  One is that the Government must have the courage to extend the tax net.  This would mean thinking of including those who are not paying tax at present.  That could have been done but the parties in this House support the view that we in Ireland should never have a wealth tax, a source that could be yielding £20 million now.  A wealth tax was supposed to be a massive disincentive, something that would discourage people from investing or working in Ireland.  In their January newsletter <Col N="1943" /> the Confederation of Irish Industry said, &ldquo;Corporation tax rise poses threat to investment&rdquo;.  They need not have worried. It did not come.  There was no extending the tax net into capital or corporate areas.  There was no rising of those two taxes and therefore no significant relief in relation to the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>I will finish by saying &mdash; this is not the least important but perhaps the most important point &mdash; that we are living at a time of what might be called tripartism in relation to planning the economy.  There has been a great deal of talk about inviting the social partners in, but there is a representative group about whom we should be concerned, that is those who are unemployed, those who are dependent on State benefits in one form or another.  When are they going to sit at the table and contribute to social planning?  Is it not time that they did?  It is they who would make the case for public housing, low income, fundamental tax reform and assisting to combat poverty.</P>
    <P>I want to make a very interesting point, not an ideological point but an immensely practical one.  It is said that in the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> there are a certain number of values that are shared.  The social democracies that have low rates of unemployment, whatever political parties are in power &mdash; if one is talking about Austria, Finland and Sweden, which had an economy ridden with unemployment in the thirties &mdash; have one significant feature irrespective of changes in Government, that is, they have put unemployment as their major single problem and they have placed job creation and job sharing as the primary target of social and economic policy, realising that with job creation and access to income, come the far wider forms of participation that are important in society.  Every one of those social democracies had that transcendental aim, but in the Irish case, the reason this budget has been such a disastrous and hopeless experience is that it has not been accepted yet by the parties of the right <Col N="1944" /> that unemployment should be considered our No. 1 problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister's budget speech has been described by various commentators as a non-event and a very boring budget.  I do not think the Minister has been given full credit for bringing in this budget against the backdrop of war in the Gulf and the fact that economies particularly in the USA and in many major western countries, are in recession.  The Minister has made a considerable achievement in increasing social welfare benefits and reducing income tax while at the same time reducing the projected borrowing requirement as a percentage of GNP and making a further reduction in the standard rate of VAT.  That is a considerable achievement, and I am sure Deputy Higgins would not mind too much if the Minister got some photocalls for it: Deputy Higgins is Mayor of Galway and I am sure he gets his share of photocalls.</P>
      <P>The most welcome measure in the budget is the 4 per cent increase in social welfare benefits &mdash; a similar increase is being provided for health boards &mdash; putting them ahead of inflation.  The Minister for Social Welfare has been very successful in getting increased expenditure for his Department.  Over £3 billion in a full year has been allocated to the Department of Social Welfare: that is the first time the £3 billion barrier has been broken.  The Minister for Social Welfare has also brought in a very good package for children costing £41 million.  The minimum rate of child benefit has been increased to £12, an increase of 9 per cent, and from October next the higher rate will be payable to the fourth and subsequent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider retirement pensions.  Many small farmers have benefited from this scheme but they have to pay into the scheme for ten years before they qualify for the contributory pension.  The Minister has an option of allowing those farmers to buy extra years to make up the ten years or, alternatively, to give a fraction of the pension to those <Col N="1945" /> who have not contributed for ten years. For example, if a farmer has seven years contributions he could be given seven-tenths of his pension.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will also look at the operation of the free schemes and the qualifying conditions for those schemes. I cannot understand why similar criteria should not be introduced for all these schemes.  Some pensioners may receive free electricity and television allowances but are not entitled to free telephone rental.  I hope that a common standard of assessment will be brought in for eligibility for these schemes.  I am not saying that free schemes are the answer to all the problems of the elderly.  I know many elderly people have financial and housing problems, but where the free schemes are available I hope the conditions for eligibility will be standardised.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the improvements in the family income supplement. This scheme gives practical help to families. The Minister has increased the income limits and extended the scheme to cover children between 18 and 21 years of age where the children are in full-time education.  This budget is orientated towards helping the family and will help people all over the country.</P>
    <P>Some of our semi-State bodies cause problems, particularly for people in rural Ireland.  Only today we heard an announcement by An Post about the proposed closure of post offices and changes in the delivery of mail in rural Ireland.  I understand that what is envisaged is 1,000 job losses and the closure of over 500 sub-post offices.  This has been tried on a pilot basis in my county of Galway.  The idea of a letter box or a number of letter boxes at the head of a road where a number of families live is not a good idea. Many families including elderly people may have to travel up to a mile to collect their post.  All kinds of problems arise, for example, letters are put into the wrong letter boxes and letters are stolen.  If An Post want to speed up the delivery of mail, I would not object, to having a letter box outside a house, with the consent of the householder, where the <Col N="1946" /> person can see the postman delivering the mail.  However, I strongly object to this proposed massive closure of sub-post offices not only in terms of job losses but also because we will be losing a vital service in rural Ireland.  It is ironic that at a time when we have a very successful national lottery and post offices are doing extra business as a result, this proposal is made for the closure of over 500 sub-post offices.</P>
    <P>I would make a similar point in relation to Telecom Éireann.  We have been talking in this House and elsewhere about telephone charges.  We want competition to help the business community and yet all these changes are taking place by stealth in Telecom Éireann.  In the west dial codes cover a very small area and there is discrimination against the people who have to pay much more than the local charge if they want to ring Galway city from the western parts of Connemara.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said during the debate last evening, there has been, over the past year or so, a significant reduction in the number of co-operatives, and many more amalgamations of various co-operatives throughout the country are in the pipeline.  However, I want to sound a note of warning in relation to these developments.  It is the objective of the Irish Co-Operative Organisation Society and the Government to rationalise the food industry and the co-operative movement with the object of making it more efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1947" /> The extension of the public limited company concept to the co-operative movement in recent times slightly worries me.  I am disturbed that financial institutions will eventually take control of these public companies and that the influence of the producer of the food will rapidly diminish.  I am concerned that at least one merger will occur among the quoted food companies, prompted by institutional investment and pointing to obvious cost advantages for them.  It is acknowledged that farmer control of milk supplies will dwindle from about 85 per cent at present to about 30 per cent by 1994.  It is important that these facts in regard to development for the future are made known to the producer of the commodity and, through the co-operative movement, to the food producers.  This development could remove much of the decision-making process from this country to ones based on the financial and economic viability of firms outside the country.  I make this point on the basis that so much money was spent in recent years by various food companies, particularly public limited companies in this country, outside the jurisdiction of the Republic.</P>
    <P>Avonmore Foods, plc., the IAWS and various other food companies have spent enormous resources in developing the food industry and their food portfolio in the UK and in the United States in particular.  It is estimated that, within the next five years, at least two of the food companies will have less than 10 per cent of their turnover based in this country. That is a measure of the enormous reduction in influence which the present board members of many of our food companies and co-operatives have and which will continue in the context of the global, international and more competitive food companies after 1992.  I hope that the overriding concern to satisfy institutional investors will not be achieved at the expense of the food producer and that the existing balance will continue to play a significant role in the future development of the food industry.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that the Minister for <Col N="1948" /> Industry and Commerce launched a stinging attack on the efforts of Fine Gael in bringing forward the Bill which we are debating this evening, particularly relating to one sector of the economy.  The Minister should recognise &mdash; as everybody else does &mdash; that the food industry makes a very important contribution to the overall well-being of the country.  It affects many people, producers, processors and consumers.  The Progressive Democrats published the Enterprise (Competition and Consumer Protection) Bill, 1989, which was debated in Private Members' time.  Section 2 of that Bill dealt with the abuse of a dominant position in relation to competitive practices. I have no doubt that, with all the publicity and heat which Deputy O'Malley generated at that time in respect of one food company and individuals in relation to a dominant position.  He was referring to the Goodman Group who were receiving much publicity at the time.  He is now Minister for Industry and Commerce but at that time, as Deputy O'Malley, leader of the Progressive Democrats, he was obsessed with this matter.  It is galling to hear the Minister in this House chiding another political party about seeking publicity, although the national interest is at stake.</P>
    <P>The Irish food industry is facing an enormous challenge in the context of the Single Market and we are unprepared, as a nation, to tackle the problems of meeting the demands of the 300 million consumers in the enlarged market after 1992.  We are not prepared to adequately meet this challenge.  Therefore, it is important that the significant developments which have taken place continue to expand to ensure that we have a lean, fit and efficient food industry to make the rapid expansion which is needed to further our export drive and to make our economic situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> our exports even better than it has been over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, Fine Gael are motivated in the publication of this Bill by the desire to take an initial step to outlaw anti-competitive practices in an important sector of our economy.  I realise &mdash;<Col N="1949" /> and I would be the first to admit &mdash; that it does not cover all aspects of the national scene, including the professional, business or other very important anti-competitive practices which are evident in the economy.  However, it deals with a fundamental and important sector and I would love to see the Minister for Industry and Commerce publishing a Bill as soon as possible to deal with all the other aspects of anti-competitive practices which are so evident.  His bona fide attitude in relation to the food industry would be demonstrated if he declared that he was in favour of allowing this Bill to go to a further stage of debate.  He could introduce his own amendments if he feels there are inadequacies in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As long ago as 1975 the Restrictive Practices Commission called for this type of legislation, yet, 14 years later, very little legislation in that regard has been introduced in the House.  I suppose it is an indication of the slow process by which reports are brought to the legislature.  In a small, open economy we cannot rely on this approach in the context of 1992 and the development of the Single Market. The legislation we are discussing this evening is important and necessary to deal with many of the anti-competitive practices in a small open economy like Ireland.  The willy-nilly development of legislation in this House over the last 20 years has tended to protect restrictive practices and anti-competitive conduct in many sectors of industry, trade and the professional services.  The best example to date is in the very sector about which we are speaking this evening, the food industry.</P>
    <P>There are wholesale, anti-competitive practices inherent in the food industry in terms of restrictive trade cartel agreements, particularly in prices being paid to producers.  How often do Deputies in this House hear of their constituents, particularly producers of food, recalling that they have sold cattle to meat factories &mdash; or looked for quotations to sell their produce to meat factories &mdash; but, because of the dominance of one individual in the entire beef trade, they <Col N="1950" /> find that there is an informal and anti-competitive cartel arrangement for reducing and artificially suppressing the price of their product to the producer of the food?</P>

      <P>I know there are not too many people around east Cork who would meet those criteria; they get good prices for their product in Cork.  Deputy Ahern knows what I am talking about but Deputy Roche does not.  Because of the dominant position of someone in a sector of the food industry the individual &mdash; or company &mdash; assumes very wide powers and when that individual &mdash; or company &mdash; runs into financial difficulties, which happened in 1990, other small companies who depend on 90 days' credit terms and because of a deliberate suppression of price to the producer, whether they are producers or supplying the dominant company or individual, will run into financial difficulties themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>A dominant individual in a particular segment of the market has huge purchasing power and because of this anti-competitive and unfair advantage can put smaller firms out of business. The Bill before the House this evening incorporates Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome which prohibit the abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the Community.  The control of trade practices in Ireland is covered by the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972 which was amended in 1987.  In relation to mergers and take-overs, the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies Control Act, 1978 permits the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to carry out investigations into trading practices which are deemed to be unfair.  Such an investigation was carried out into the Goodman Group by the director but nothing much has been heard about that report since it was laid on the desk of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley.  Why does he not <Col N="1951" /> publish the report and have it debated in the House if it is only a myth that the Government are protecting a company which holds a dominant position?  I challenge the Minister to publish it.</P>
      <P>The existing cumbersome procedures under which complaints regarding anti-competitive practices can be taken to the Restrictive Practices Commission are indeed lengthy and unwieldy.  I hope that as a result of this Bill being introduced in the House progress can be made in the food industry.  Like every other Member in this House, I would be satisfied if it was extended to cover other areas but the Government should acknowledge the difficulties facing that industry and have regard to the difficulties the rescue package, which has been widely acclaimed, will create.  If they continue to support an individual who controls over 40 per cent of the beef and processing sector we will run into difficulties with the price to the producer and the consumer being affected.</P>
      <P>Irish food firms will have to face up to fundamental requirements in the context of 1992 and they must be prepared to examine their performance in terms of price, quality, marketing and service. They will have to become more international either through the purchase of companies or through joint ventures and partnerships and undertake more research and development.  Indeed, the Minister of State present in the House is very much aware of this.  Having regard to the vast amount of money which will be made available by Europe under the national development plan we will have an opportunity to improve our marketing and processing facilities which at present are inadequate and will not allow food companies to meet the challenges which will face them from 1992 onwards.  There is a need for greater co-ordination in the food industry to ensure that companies do not diversify at the expense of the taxpayer and displace other products being manufactured by other food companies in this country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barrett further stated that the rescue package was a bad one as far as the beef industry was concerned.  However, I would contend that if the package was not accepted the industry would have gone to the floor.  It has been claimed, since the Bill was introduced in the middle of December, that prices have improved.  The question that needs to be asked therefore is what would have happened if there had been no rescue package.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that prices would have fallen further as organisations such as the one being attacked by this Bill would not have been there to pay prices up front and to ensure that the farmers had a market.</P>
      <P>One major flaw in the Bill is that it deals only with one aspect of agriculture, that is, the meat industry.  No mention is made of the dairy industry, the fruit and vegetable business or bread.  It is quite clear, as we have pointed out right throughout this debate, that this Bill was introduced with one aim in mind and that was to attack one person.  We contend that there is a need for a Bill dealing with restrictive practices in many areas including the fruit, vegetable, dairy, banking, insurance and legal sectors.  It would be far more sensible to deal with each of those areas in a comprehensive Bill rather than to introduce piecemeal legislation for purely political purposes. The members of the Fine Gael Front Bench have not bothered to come in to listen to this debate as they are aware there is nothing to be gained politically from it.  What they should do now of course is withdraw the Bill and not call a vote on it as they would only be making fools of themselves in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the years we have seen how large multi-national companies, which <Col N="1954" /> we do not have to name, have been able to control prices, tell suppliers that they would pay them so much and then six months later tell them that they wanted to change the price, usually downwards. As a result of such activity they have put thousands of people out of work which is what happened during the bread war of a few years ago.  A new bread war looms on the horizon.</P>
    <P>We have seen over the years that the reduction in prices at the farm gate is not passed on to the consumer.  This must be examined and that can be done only in the context of a comprehensive Bill.  The price of milk a year ago was £1.05p a gallon, it is now 85p.  It took the best part of a year for any little reduction to percolate to the consumer and that happened only in the last couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>The Bill is flawed.  It is too restrictive. Its <i>raison d'tre</i> is infantile.  A serious political party would withdraw it immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Sean Barrett introduced this legislation last December he made it clear that not only had the legislation been prepared in a few days, but it had been done to demonstrate fears about the possible consequences of the Goodman rescue package which was being considered by the High Court.</P>
      <P>Throughout the Goodman controversy and particularly since the collapse of the group last summer, the Progressive Democrats, and the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, in particular, have worked to safeguard and protect the interests of the farming sector which was placed in such jeopardy.  As soon as news of Goodman's difficulties emerged last summer the Minister moved in swiftly to introduce special legislation to ensure that the group would be able to continue trading during the peak cattle feeding season.  If these actions had not been taken there would have been a major disaster throughout the beef sector which would have put countless farmers out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important now that we learn from the lessons of last year and act to ensure proper development of the beef sector <Col N="1955" /> rather than desperately throwing our eggs into one basket and becoming totally dependent on the success or failure of any one operator.  The Progressive Democrats have always been determined that neither the taxpayer nor the farmer would be left picking up the bill for the Goodman Group.  Major companies in this country have collapsed before now and the taxpayer is still paying for some of those collapses.  The taxpayer has reason to be grateful that he has not been forced to pay for this collapse.  Equally we must ensure that the cost is not imposed on the farmers who were the real victims of the collapse last summer. Unfortunately, that prospect cannot be dismissed out of hand.  The rescue package which has now been approved by the High Court and is awaiting the approval of the Department of Industry and Commerce is designed to refloat the Goodman Group and return them to profitability. That profitability must not be won at the expense of Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>However, I do not believe this Bill is the correct way to protect the farmer. The key to protecting the farmer from any dangers of abuse or misuse of the dominant position of a player in the meat or any other sector is to have proper competition legislation in place which will regulate the conduct of players within the sector and will outlaw practices which would threaten producers or any other players in this industry.  This Bill is only a hurried attempt to deal with the issue.  It is not comprehensive.  It includes possibly dangerous provisions that would at best add confusion to the whole area of competition policy.  Even the title of the Bill and its specific aims are in conflict.  The Bill is entitled &ldquo;Competition in Food Processing Bill, 1990&rdquo; but the definition of food in the Bill is very narrow and excludes whole areas that would normally be regarded as the food industry.  Therefore, not only is this Bill legislating for only one sector of the economy, it is legislating for only one area within that sector.  The Bill confuses the legitimate attempts to prevent monopolies endangering the industry with measures <Col N="1956" /> which would forever prevent the emergence of the type of large scale industries which are vital if Irish industry is to compete properly in post-1992 Europe.</P>
    <P>The Bill limits a company to reaching 30 per cent of the market capacity.  I presume this is done to prevent enterprises reaching such a scale that they might pose a threat to the rest of the sector.  However, this risks throwing out the baby with the bath water.  We should be legislating not against large industries but against bad industries.  If we are to succeed in 1992 we will need good, large industries.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that legitimate concerns led Fine Gael to introduce the Bill. However, that is not a good enough reason for accepting it.  The Minister responsible, my party leader Deputy O'Malley, has demonstrated repeatedly his concern on this whole issue and his determination to ensure that the farmers do not become the losers in this mess.  He is on the verge of introducing his own legislation in this area which will more than adequately address all the concerns raised.  I think the House will agree that we would be better off waiting to deal with the matter on that occasion in the near future.</P>

      <P>The debate on this Bill and many of the contributions have me a little at a loss.  The Bill is entitled, &ldquo;Competition in Food Processing Bill, 1990&rdquo;, yet many of the people who have contributed to this debate have been speaking specifically about an individual case, that of the Goodman Group, undoubtedly an important case and instructive as to what may happen when a large player begins to collapse or finds he has foolishly and imprudently over-extended himself, but it is not the purpose of the Bill.  I agree with the Minister that the introduction of this Bill was nothing more or less than a cheap political shot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incorporating Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome into Irish law would be a very noble purpose indeed.  Our present laws are, beyond a shadow of doubt, piecemeal and require reform.  However, those of us who took time to listen to <Col N="1957" /> Deputy Barrett's contribution on this Bill on 18 December could with no difficulty discern a quite different purpose in his introduction of the Bill.  His motivation was not noble; it was cheap, partisan, it was a waste of parliamentary time.  When he introduced the Bill Deputy Barrett of Fine Gael attempted to put forward a view that the Bill would help us to move towards the incorporation into Irish law of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  If that were the aim or, indeed, the effect of the Bill, then the Bill would have much to commend it, but the reality is different.  This Bill is poorly focused, fundamentally flawed and ill conceived and in essence amounts to little more than a political jibe.  If this is the best our main political Opposition party can do, it will be low in public esteem for a long time.  The Bill is poorly focused.</P>

Let me point out that while I was an official of the Department of Finance and the Department of Economic Planning and Development we achieved the highest rate of employment and growth in the history of this State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am to be blamed for something in that period I must surely also claim the credits.  As I said, the Bill is poorly focused in that it applies to only one part of one sector of the economy, food processing as defined in the Bill.  It takes no account of activities upstream or downstream from the processing area. The Bill and its proposers fail to explain why there should be control of any one sector of the community's operations and not of others.</P>
      <P>Clearly, competition policy issues can and do arise in other areas as Deputy Ahern suggested a few moments ago.  For example, they apply in the legal area, they apply to coal distribution and the collusion between bank and other financial institutions.  While the Bill purports to apply to the food processing industry as a whole, it does not cover the entire industry.  The Bill is fundamentally flawed within its terms of reference because of the laziness, if not incompetence, illustrated in its drafting.</P>
      <P>From time to time spokespersons of the Fine Gael Party have belaboured us about the importance of definitional paragraphs in Bills.  I absolve all those present in the Fine Gael Party of blame for this Bill &mdash; for which they should feel reasonably grateful &mdash; because neither Deputy Seán Barrett nor Deputy John Bruton, its author, is present.  As has been pointed out already, rather than establish a working definition for food processing, the drafters of this Bill have borrowed a definition from the Finance Act, 1987.  The Finance Act, 1987, has many things to commend it, but one thing it does not purport to do is to deal with the whole area of competition, nor does it deal with the definition of the food processing industry to the nth degree.  It does neither of those things because that was not its purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary, if the main Opposition Party support that this Bill be a fundamental piece of legislation dealing with the food processing industry, they did not actually take the time to define <Col N="1959" /> the term &ldquo;food processing industry&rdquo;.  As a result the Bill appears to omit activities such as liquid milk processing, packaging and retail sales, just to mention some specific areas that could be defined as being encompassed within food processing. It is far from clear whether that is intentional.  It may be that there is an intention on the part of the drafters of the Bill to exclude those specific activities but the motive for such exclusion is not at all clear.  Perhaps when somebody in the Fine Gael Party who is well briefed on the issue, speaks later this evening they will tell us why they have excluded those things.  The rationale, if rationale be the correct word, for the exclusion of two or three important sectors of food processing has not been explained at all.</P>
    <P>Assuming, for charity sake, that the Bill's drafters intend the Bill not to deal with the food processing industry, as it states, but rather to deal with a part of that industry, we are left with another conundrum, another set of totally unanswered questions.  Those questions will remain unanswered because my belief is that, throughout the debate, the party who proposed this Bill have not spoken about the Bill but rather about another issue.  I accept that while that is an important issue, it is not supposed to be the basis of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I was and I read Deputy Seán Barrett's contribution in great detail.  I would have to say this: it is quite extraordinary because very seldom have I come across a Second Stage speech that actually did not deal with the Bill under consideration.  But the drafters of this Bill, Fine Gael, to date and here again this evening, do not tell us why they focus on one link in the chain or, more precisely, why they focus on one part of one link in the whole chain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, deals with the processors of some commodities but ignores the part played by primary producers. It ignores the part played by <Col N="1960" /> importers of raw materials who would certainly have something to do with the food processing industry.  It ignores the part played by commodity dealers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers and it ignores any number of middlemen who intervene in the process of producing or converting food from its raw material state to placing it on the table of the consumer.</P>
    <P>If this Bill was a comprehensive piece of legislation dealing with an important industry it would deal with that industry in a comprehensive way.  It does not; it is flawed at least in that regard.  There may be some logical reason for that.  It may be that legislators elsewhere who have grappled with the complex issue of competition policy have been deficient.  For example, it may be that Deputy Seán Barrett is more enlightened than the legislators of the United States who have dealt with competition policy for a long time, or it may be that there resides in his dome temple a greater degree of knowledge than those people who drafted the Treaty of Rome, those people who operate within the EC Directorate who handle competition policy or all of those people who occupy the benches of the European Court of Justice.  With all due respect to Deputy Seán Barrett, he is a man whose energies, wit and debating energies I admire but I do not think that, by any stretch of the imagination, his wildest fans &mdash; and there are a couple present &mdash; could actually suggest that he is more <i>au fait</i> with the issue of competition policy than the people who occupy the Directorate dealing with competition policy, the people who drafted the Treaty of Rome, those who deal with competition policy in the European Court of Justice or indeed the people who dealt with competition policy in the United States for the past 30 or 40 years.</P>
    <P>The reality is that competition policy is a very complex area.  The other unassailable and indisputable reality is that competition policy cannot be dealt with on a piecemeal basis.  It is not an area dealt with in any country on a sectoral basis; it is not one which is dealt with in any country on an industry basis.  There <Col N="1961" /> are a number of Fine Gael Members present and if some of them speak on this Bill later I would challenge them to give the House one example of any OECD member state, any European nation, any nation worldwide, that handles competition policy on a piecemeal basis or on the basis of dealing with part of one sector or a part of one industry.  That is a fundamentally wrong-headed way to deal with a complicated issue.  Competition policy is dealt with on a broad, global basis, not just in Europe but in any other nation one cares to mention.</P>
    <P>The third fundamental flaw in this Bill is that on an apparently arbitrary basis, it places, without any explanation a 30 per cent limit on the growth of any company within the beef or dairying industry. Setting aside the observation that food processing goes beyond beef or dairying, the limiting of any company, or group of companies, to an artifical and arbitrary share of production capacity of 30 per cent has no justification whatsoever. Indeed, no justification has been produced by a single Member of the Fine Gael Party who has contributed to this debate.</P>
    <P>Focusing on production capacity takes no account of imports or exports.  It also ignores the fact that an Irish company, or group of companies, might well have to grow beyond the 30 per cent limit in order to become a significant player in the European market of 1993 and beyond.  That is an indisputable fact. There are many sectors within the food processing industry in which, if an Irish company is to grow, prosper, become profitable and give employment, inevitably must grow beyond 30 per cent of the domestic market capacity.  I might give a couple of examples.  One could imagine circumstances in which a company operating a niche market strategy could exceed more than 30 per cent of its market share.  There are many small operators who operate efficiently who can be seen, within a niche market strategy position, to go beyond 30 per cent of the market.  For example, if a craft cheese processor decides to specialise in, say, cheese produced from sheep milk &mdash; and <Col N="1962" /> there are a couple in County Wicklow &mdash; it could be that such a producer would account for 100 per cent of such processing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is where the vitality comes from.  On the face of it, that type of operation could find itself in difficulties.  In fact this Bill would actually criminalise such an operator; that is the extraordinary thing about this Bill.  Even if an operator was not breaking the law, doing no harm to the common good, this Bill would criminalise him simply because he wanted to do, what successive generations of politicans and Ministers have encouraged him to do, which is go out, grow and become significant in the European market.</P>
      <P>Another problem arises when a company, or group of companies, could find themselves exceeding the 30 per cent level without taking any action on their own behalf.  For example, if there were a number of small operators operating in a part of a market and if, say two, three or even one operator withdrew, it is conceivable that a processor could find himself with 30 per cent of the market.  What would such a processor do in those circumstances? Would he or she go knocking on the doors of all the neighbouring competitive firms and say: please come in and compete with us because somebody up in Dáil Éireann was silly enough to enact what is fundamentally a stupid Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be clear to anybody &mdash; and it is clear to the Fine Gael Party &mdash; that the way forward in terms of regulating competition is to follow the line set out in the Treaty of Rome and introduce measures applicable globally.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to the introduction of legislation which will apply the principles of Articles 85 and 86 to domestic trade.  That would be comprehensive legislation as distinct from the piecemeal approach adopted under current legislation and would be <Col N="1963" /> comprehensive as opposed to the piecemeal approach put forward in this Bill. This Bill has very little to recommend it and on that basis it should be rejected by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is probably the best example of the worst kind of legislation that comes before the House.  It appears to be a knee-jerk reaction to an immediate problem.  It was prompted by the high profile nature of the problem when it was introduced in early December and by the desire of Deputy Bruton who introduced it, to generate the maximum publicity.  It was a cynical exercise as pointed out by a number of speakers on the Government side and nobody has been fooled by it.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Hogan's contribution and curiously enough, I thought at one stage that he was making the best case against the legislation that I have heard, except for Deputy Roche's recent contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned that Irish industry generally and the food sector in particular is facing major challenges and that the food industry must be prepared to meet those challenges.  The Deputy pointed out that we are not yet prepared to meet the challenges and that we have a long way to go to meet the challenge of the integrated market.  The Deputy mentioned that the food industry specifically should be lean, fit and efficient.  However, the legislation proposed by his party would have the opposite effect.  The basic philosophy underlying the legislation is that big is bad.  The ludicrous situation in which we would find ourselves if this ceiling of 30 per cent of the market share were to be adopted by the House was well and truly underlined by Deputy Roche so I will not go over that again.  This is foolish and ludicrous legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems we have had in this area over the last 20 or 30 years, also referred to by Deputy Hogan, relates to <Col N="1964" /> willy-nilly legislation.  This legislation is another sort of stop gap measure, a particularly bad example of willy-nilly legislation, one that would cause major problems if implemented.  The faults in the legislation were pointed out by previous speakers.  It applies only to part of one sector of the food industry.  If Fine Gael were worried about this sector they would have gone to a little more trouble in preparing the legislation.  They would have at least gone to the trouble of defining the food processing sector rather than drawing on the limited definition contained in the Finance Act.  What we need in this area is comprehensive legislation that will cover competition in general.  It need not be very complicated.  Our basic philosophy should be to try to eliminate any practice that would be seen to be anti-competitive, rather than adopting this legislation which only refers to particular parts of the industry.</P>

      <P>Listening to the speakers on the other side one would think that everything was rosy in food production. They are as far removed from food production as they ever were.  They do not realise how serious are the implications for this sector.  Hundreds of millions of pounds worth of food is imported every <Col N="1965" /> year although we have one of the best food producing climates in the world.  We have a clean atmosphere, good soil and an ideal climate.  We could actually be the kitchen garden of Europe if the food industry were handled properly.  For too long it has been neglected and treated as the Cinderella section of the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>We have a Minister of State in my constituency with responsibility for food. The Minister of State is completely muzzled because he has no input at the Cabinet table.  If the Taoiseach was genuine in his approach to the food industry he would have made that portfolio a Cabinet post or he would have given the Deputy in question a say at the Cabinet table to ensure that something would be done for this valuable industry.  This only shows what the Taoiseach thinks of the food industry.  Even as late as 24 hours ago the Taoiseach failed to recognise the importance of this industry and did not give a seat at the Cabinet table to the Minister of State with responsibility for Food, so that he could bring anomalies to the attention of the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree that cartels and monopolies are the right approach to the food industry.  They are a menace to the small processor and the small exporter.  Cartels and monopolies are squeezing out the small producer and the small exporter. On the continent, particularly in Holland and Germany, the small producer is playing a vital role in the economy because he has the right to survive due to proper planning for the food industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the junior Minister for Food were loud in their praise of the Goodman Group during a television programme early in 1990.  They portrayed this group and its Chairman, Larry Goodman, as the be-all and end-all of the beef and dairy industry.  A short time afterwards the scene changed dramatically.  The all-powerful tycoon foundered and the banks rallied quickly to bail him out.  Would the banks rally so quickly to bail out the countless thousands of Irish farmers who are on the verge of bankruptcy because there is no policy for food production on the part of <Col N="1966" /> the Minister for Agriculture and Food? Are Deputies opposite aware that the banks' deal to rescue the Goodman cartel will be paid back to the banks, not by the Government or by the Minister for Agriculture and food but by every individual farmer?  They are the people who will have to foot the bill and they should be in a position to call the tune. Unfortunately they are not.</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations about this Government.  They seem to be naive and uncaring.  They do not even think about the farmers.  All they understand are monopolies and cartels and creating exorbitant monsters of industry which founder when they get into difficulties and bring down with them countless other small industries.  Surely the Taoiseach and his Ministers must see the danger of putting all their eggs in one basket. Monopolies and cartels are a menace and I reckon they are a cancer in any industry. Opposition is the spice of life and if we have no opposition in the food industry we will not have a viable industry.</P>
    <P>I was at Bandon mart on Monday last where cattle were being sold at give away prices.  The future of agriculture is very grim.  The morale of farmers was never lower.  They do not know whether to buy cattle, since there could be a further collapse in prices.  Should they have a chance and let the land or do something other than stocking it?  They are afraid to borrow money from the banks to buy stock in case the bank manager will have to send the county sheriff to collect any decrees against them.  Where was the sheriff when this huge monopoly was being bailed out?  Every facility was offered in that case.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with the co-operative movement?  The co-operative movement was an asset, bringing the first breath of fresh air to Irish agriculture.  Co-operatives were responsible for the first bit of prosperity in that industry.  They are now being stifled and bought out.  A helicopter flew all over the country to meetings of shareholders, telling them they would never again see a poor day if they joined this group.</P>
    <P>In my constituency Erin Foods, more <Col N="1967" /> than a decade and a half ago, gained a monopoly of food processing and closed the best factory in west Cork, the Fastnet co-operative.  The short sightedness of the directors of that company brought about the downfall and closure of that plant because of their reluctance to change from dehydration production to fresh and frozen production.  That was the kernel of the problem.  They were producing a product that was not saleable in any part of Europe or the world.  Had they changed their method of processing to fresh and frozen production the factory would still be in operation, giving employment to hundreds of people in my constituency.  Erin Foods withdrew their support and the factory was closed.  That was the end of food production in west Cork.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy McGahon.  I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for referring to us as young gentlemen.  I support everything my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, has said.  Fianna Fáil have criticised this Bill and criticised us as a party for bringing it into the House.  This legislation is necessary.  When people say something negative they should try to be constructive as well.  The Government have failed to do so since the Bill's introduction. I heard Deputy Roche giving absolution to members of Fine Gael.  It might be more appropriate for Deputy Roche to give absolution to members of <Col N="1968" /> his own party, especially in the higher echelons.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced by Fine Gael to stop the near total collapse of the agriculture and food industry, which was threatened with the collapse of the Goodman group.  The Fianna Fáil Government of 1987 gave a commitment to one individual to run our food industry. The economic folly of allowing a monopoly to develop in an industry with such potential can only be described as political expediency.  At the time of this announcement the beef industry had 60 per cent surplus killing capacity and the Government were proposing to invest an extra £250 million into the beef industry. Many people remember that Ministers were rounded up and brought to the Press conference to hear the Taoiseach make his announcement regarding the investment of £250 million.  We were told this would create major employment in the economy and be the saviour of a very depressed agriculture sector.  I have no doubt that this investment was a means of building up the Goodman company's credibility with international bankers. We saw what happened afterwards.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil committed taxpayers' money to fund a company whose only desire at the time was to amass a fortune for themselves.  I would have no objection to this if every company or person in the same industry were given an equal opportunity.  This did not happen and, unfortunately, a lot of damage was inflicted on the image of our food industry abroad.</P>
      <P>This Bill would put the onus on companies to market their goods abroad rather than tying up their financial resources in acquiring similar companies within the State.  If the type of aggressive marketing that was used within the State some years ago regarding takeover bids was put into acquiring new markets internationally, not alone would the food industry have prospered but there would have been growth in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill which do not allow any company or group of companies to control more than 30 per cent <Col N="1969" /> of the total processing capacity in either the beef or dairy processing sectors would cut out any likelihood of near total collapse of an industry within the State.  It would also encourage greater competition in the industry and companies involved would be more determined to open up new markets abroad so that the whole food processing industry would flourish and, more important, the producers would be protected.  When the Goodman group collapsed it was the producers who were most vulnerable.  With the introduction of this Bill I have no doubt this would not occur.</P>
    <P>We should also remember the unique potential of the food and dairy processing industries in Ireland.  Throughout the world Ireland is seen as a country with a pollution free environment and this image should be enhanced and used to our advantage.  I wish to take this opportunity to condemn the use of illegal hormones in the Irish beef industry today. The continuous use of illegal hormones will only lead to the deterioration of our food and agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>With the GATT proposals it is now obvious that intervention is no longer a soft option for markets and producers. Fine Gael believe that the opening up of new markets or increasing existing markets is the only way to develop an export based competitive food industry.  The emergence of the Single Market in 1993 indicates that Ireland needs special incentives as we are the only island on the periphery of the European Community. With the extra transport costs that our exporters will come up against, it is imperative, if we wish our food industry to grow, that exporters are given special initiatives and incentives.  I call on the Government to give grant assistance to companies who are willing to increase their sales in markets they have already established and who will open up markets.</P>
    <P>This Bill may not have all the solutions but I urge the Government to accept its Second Stage reading, as legislation is urgently required to deal with competition within industries.</P>

In the 70 years that we have had a Dáil I do not think any man has been pilloried to the extent that Larry Goodman has.

Larry Goodman is the biggest employer here, giving employment to 2,600 people.  His success has been phenomenal. He is the biggest achiever here in my lifetime and is the biggest achiever in the beef industry in the world.  We need more people like Larry Goodman and, indeed, the begrudgery that is very evident in every contribution from the left is just simmering below the surface. If Michael Smurfit or Tony O'Reilly some day get into trouble, these same people will be crawling out of the woodwork to criticise them.</P>

    <P>The Labour Party and The Workers' Party never created employment.  We need more people like Larry Goodman. The fact that he got into trouble due to a combination of circumstances, heavily influenced by the Gulf War, should be of concern to us all.  Larry Goodman rose from nothing.  He went out and sourced markets in unheard of and undreamt of places in the world and he sold cattle, and Irish farmers benefited enormously. Most of the farmers now continue to support him and Larry Goodman will rise again.  In the thirties Frank Sinatra was chased out of Hollywood and he came back to go right to the top.  In the thirties and forties Charlie Chaplin was chased <Col N="1971" /> out of America and he came back to win an Oscar.  Larry Goodman is the best thing that ever happened to Irish industry and just because he is down I certainly will not kick him or do him any injury.  As a Dundalk man I am proud of the success Larry Goodman has achieved here and in the world, and I believe Larry will rise again to the top.  It is in the interest of Irish agriculture that he continue to be at the helm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me. I have but a few points to make with regard to the Bill.  Listening to the contributions from the other side of the House, one has to conclude that the criticisms of the Bill are faint indeed.  They criticised it because they said it was not all encompassing and did not go far enough. We have never claimed that the Bill is absolutely what is required but we believe it could be the blueprint for the final document which would ensure that competitiveness is maintained in the food industry.  The fact that Fianna Fáil will troop into the House to oppose this Bill purely for party political reasons rather than for logical reasons signals the sort of reactionary politics we have become accustomed to and an end to the concensus type politics that the House should engage in more often.</P>
      <P>We have never denied that the Goodman affair was the stimulus for the Bill. When a player becomes too big in an industry and is capable of controlling the market to the detriment of other competitors and producers then we must learn lessons from that.  Deputy Dempsey seemed to suggest that the ethos on this side of the House is that big is bad.  That is not so but one has to conclude from the contributions from the other side of the House, and their reactionary defence of Larry Goodman that their ethos is that bad is beautiful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the expected outcome of the vote on the Bill we must ask what we have achieved by introducing it.  From what Deputy Clohessy told us, we can take some credit.  If this Bill was allowed <Col N="1972" /> to go to Committee Stage it could form the basis of a more comprehensive Bill. We at least can claim credit on this side of the House for speeding up the introduction of such a Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that my time is very brief.  However, initially I have to remark on what I can sadly describe as the very dismissive and arrogant performance of the Fianna Fáil speakers tonight and the performance of the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, when he responded to the Bill last night.  It was a sharp reminder that the Fianna Fáil tradition still appears to be that they strongly believe they should have a monopoly on legislation.  They seem totally incapable of believing that anyone bar themselves can bring forward any constructive legislation in this House.  That is a negative attitude.  When one looks at the contribution of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, to the debate before Christmas one certainly has to think of the possibility that he has returned to the ethos of Fianna Fáil.  While it was very pleasing to hear Deputy Clohessy from the Progressive Democrats giving some praise to the Fine Gael Party for bringing this legislation before the House, Deputy O'Malley was exceptionally dismissive when he spoke on the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Barrett introduced this Bill he made it plain that as far as we were concerned this was not the be-all and end-all of competition law.  It was but a small step but certainly a step in the right direction.  If the Bill is allowed to move on to Committee Stage by the House and if the Progressive Democrats are as brave as they have always claimed to be, if they believe in open politics, and if they believe that Dail Éireann is a Chamber where legislation is brought forward, discussed and developed we could sort out the difficulties that still remain and make the necessary corrections on Committee Stage.  The Minister, Deputy <Col N="1973" /> O'Malley, has been very active over the past 12 months in amending the Companies Bill and he could do the very same with this Bill, making the changes where he feels they are necessary.</P>
    <P>The other point which came across strongly was that Fianna Fáil members saw this Bill as nothing but a bash Larry Goodman campaign.  I think they are very wrong in that respect.  As far as we on this side of the House are concerned we hold no personal grudge against Mr. Larry Goodman.  Many of us come from areas of rural Ireland where Mr. Goodman's name was held in high regard for many years.  Many members of the farming community had confidence in him and in his beef enterprise, but I am afraid that Mr. Goodman's Fianna Fáil associates have almost killed him by the kindness they have demonstrated towards him, and many of the debts he has incurred would not have arisen if the sort of legislation being brought forward by Deputy Bruton had been introduced a number of years ago.  When a business gets too big and gets out of control the directors and management of the company can forget there are limits and if they are unable to sort out their difficulties, the banks will sort them out for them.  That is the tragedy of the situation. This scenario would not have occurred if proper competition law had been in place.  To those who say we are part of the bash Goodman campaign, the bash farming campaign or the bash business campaign, I would say that the legislation being proposed by the Fine Gael Party is the type of legislation urgently needed in order to ensure that competition and business will thrive and that producers and consumers can advance together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the fourth attempt in the past three years to introduce competition legislation to implement in Irish law Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  The first attempt was in the form of an amendment proposed by Fine Gael to the Restrictive Practices Bill introduced by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy <Col N="1974" /> Albert Reynolds.  At that time we proposed a comprehensive amendment which would have incorporated these two Articles of the Treaty of Rome which banned outright unfair practices, unfair trading right across all commercial sectors and made them a criminal offence. We proposed that as an amendment to the Restrictive Practices Bill then before the House.  At that time, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was not disposed to accept the amendment but he agreed to ask the Fair Trade Commission to prepare a report setting out the case for the implementation of such an outright ban.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, in 1988, the Progressive Democrats who were then, if I may remind the House, a party in Opposition produced a Bill of their own doing precisely the same thing that the Fine Gael amendment had sought to do.  I think it was called the competition Bill.  Fine Gael supported that Bill which was proposed by their spokesperson, the former Deputy Martin Cullen, and voted for by Deputy Des O'Malley, who is now the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Fianna Fáil objected to it and it was not passed.  Subsequent to that, Fine Gael introduced a comprehensive economic development Bill one of the sections of which was a proposal again to implement a comprehensive ban on unfair practices. Again, Fine Gael voted for the Bill and the Progressive Democrats supported it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, therefore, on record already three draft proposals to ban unfair practices, all of which have been supported in the past by the Progressive Democrats, whose leader now occupies the position of Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In fact one of the Bills was actually drafted by his party.  However, now he is 18 months in office as Minister for Industry and Commerce and is committed to a Programme for Government which specifically provides for the enacting of this type of legislation.  He is the Minister responsible within the Cabinet for introducing the legislation but he has not introduced it.  He is asking the House to vote against a proposal which is exactly the same as the proposal his party made <Col N="1975" /> when in Opposition two years ago, and which his party supported on three occasions in this House when it was introduced either by his own party or by our party.  He supported it in Opposition but now as a member of Government he is asking the House to vote against the very proposals that he supported.</P>
    <P>That is Deputy Des O'Malley, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the man who wishes to break moulds in Irish politics.  It certainly can be said that he is breaking the moulds of consistency as regards maintaining some connection between one's words and one's deeds. I am very disappointed at his attitude. Indeed the attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in replying to this Bill was marked by pettiness and scathing comments which suggested indeed that he was in a particularly weak position which required a defence of that distractive kind.</P>
    <P>The Bill is confined to the food sector because previous attempts to introduce Bills of a more general nature have not been successful.  There was also a particular problem arising in regard to the dominant position supported by the banks which might arise in the food sector as a result of the Goodman rescue package, and we felt that while the legislation was urgent in general terms it was particularly urgent in regard to the food sector because of the prospects of that package being brought into being.  That is the reason the Bill is confined to the food processing sector but its confinement to the food processing sector in no way takes from the case for having such legislation right across all sectors.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about the actual provisions in the Bill.  The Bill proposes to make it a criminal offence, punishable by a fine of up to £100,000 or six months in prison, for any group of enterprises in any food processing sector to get together to agree to fix the price they will pay for certain goods; in other words, to ensure that somebody who is selling something gets less than their value is worth because all those who might buy those goods have got together <Col N="1976" /> and said: we will not compete, we will not pay more than a certain figure.  Something which can and probably does happen quite frequently under this legislation would become a criminal offence; in other words the small businessman, the small enterprise would be protected against the large enterprise under this Bill.  We also propose to make it a criminal offence for people in the food sector to get together and say, for example, &ldquo;we will look after this section of the market and, we promise we will buy milk only in Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Louth as long as you agree only to buy milk in Counties Kildare, Wicklow and Dublin&rdquo;. The farmers, or the suppliers in that area, would not have competition because there would be a market sharing arrangement, an arrangement where people would not get a fair price for their goods because the deck had been stacked in advance.  That happens frequently at present but under this legislation it would become a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>Likewise, this Bill proposes to make it a criminal offence for people to apply dissimilar terms and conditions to equivalent transactions.  For example, a group of large businesses may decide to put a particular person out of business and they all agree not to pay him the same price for what he is producing as they will pay his competitors, in other words, they set out in a discriminatory fashion to cut off the lifeblood of that particular business. To use the terms of the Bill they will apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions, an inherently unfair anti-competitive and discriminatory practice. That practice would be banned under this Fine Gael Bill in the food sector.</P>
    <P>We would also propose to make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by other parties of supplementary obligations, which by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts; in other words, to force people to make concessions in one area which has no relationship to the matter in which they are dealing with a business person at present, in order to get the business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" /> We have seen examples in the supermarket area where people are required to contribute towards the cost of advertising in order to get space on the shelves. That is unfair and it is something that will be banned under this legislation.</P>
    <P>It may be said that this legislation would be costly to implement, that the Department of Industry and Commerce would have to recruit large numbers of civil servants to go around checking on whether particular companies had engaged in any of these practices which would be the subject of criminal sanctions under this legislation.  The Fine Gael Party have thought of that problem and have provided an answer.  We have said that any breach of any of the principles set out in this Bill would not be just a criminal offence but would also be a civil wrong.  Any businessman or consumer who felt they were the victim of a price fixing arrangement, a market sharing arrangement, an arrangement to apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions or an arrangement to make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance of supplementary obligations, would be entitled, under this legislation to sue in the courts, privately, the people who were committing that wrong against them and to get damages.  Individuals who felt they were being attacked in an unfair fashion could take civil proceedings to have that stopped.  The legislation would become effectively self-policing and self-enforcing because it would be capable of being enforced by civil proceedings as well as by criminal proceedings.  It is likely that the Minister and the Department of Industry and Commerce would not have to intervene in the overwhelming majority of cases because there would be more than adequate protection available, through the civil courts, where people could take action to defend their rights under this legislation.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Progressive Democrats introduced legislation, almost word for word the same as this, in 1988.  They <Col N="1978" /> insisted that legislation along these lines be included in the Programme for Government more than 18 months ago. They obtained two Ministries in the present Government where statistics would only have entitled them to one. One of the Ministries they obtained was the very Ministry responsible for the introduction of this legislation &mdash; legislation which they, in Opposition, were able to draft three years ago and which they, in Opposition, supported the three times it was introduced in this House first, by themselves and subsequently by the Fine Gael Party.  They have now been in charge of the Department responsible for this legislation for 18 months.  Their leader the Minister personally responsible for this legislation, has issued press statements and made speeches on any occasion to which he is invited, repeating time and again, his resolute intention, his determined intention, his vigorous intention, not to speak of his aggresive intention, to introduce legislation along these lines but he has not introduced it.  He has failed to introduce it.  His sermons have not been matched by his deeds.  It is the height of hypocrisy that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have come in here to oppose legislation which he had proposed three years ago when he was in Opposition.  The only reason he could give for his opposition was that he would produce his legislation immediately &mdash; that was last December, but it has not been produced yet.  We were assured it would be produced before the Dáil reassembled after Christmas.  It has not been produced.</P>
    <P>I believe we have, in this case, an example of inefficiency by a Minister of few comparisons in recent legislative history. We have had repeated promises &mdash; in Opposition and in Government &mdash; and no performance.  Ultimately, Ministers are not paid to make speeches, they are not paid to make promises, they are paid to deliver.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has failed the test of delivery <Col N="1979" /> in the case of legislation to ban anti-competitive practices in the Irish food sector or in any sector of the Irish economy. It is for that reason we in Fine Gael believe this Bill should be passed by the <Col N="1980" /> House.  It is legislation which the Government, and particularly the Minister concerned, have proven themselves incapable of implementing.</P>

      <P>Deputy Joe Doyle has given me notice of his intention to raise the matter as to whether the Minister for the Marine will make representations to Sealink in order to prevent the closure of the container terminals at Dublin and Holyhead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter tonight.  Sealink hold the lease from the port board of just over seven acres which constitutes the lift-on lift-off freight terminal in the ferry port in Dublin Port.  The lease on the land expires on 31 March 1991 and the company have formally requested a renewal of the lease.  Sealink operated a lo-lo service between Dublin and Holyhead up until December 1989 and since then it has been run by Rail Freight Distributors, RFD, a division of British Rail. RFD obtained stevedoring and terminal services under contract with Sealink at Dublin and Holyhead terminals.</P>
      <P>Sealink, in a press release on 23 January of this year, announced that the container terminals at Dublin and Holyhead would close by 31 March 1991.  The only reason given by Sealink is that they were unable to obtain a long term contract with RFD.  There were no prior consultations with Dublin Port nor apparently with the Government.  The arbitrary decision by Sealink will have serious cost repercussions for the Irish trade and will result in an annual net loss of £1 million to Dublin Port.</P>
      <P>This service is the only lo-lo service between Dublin and the UK and is of vital strategic importance to Irish importers and exporters.  It is quite unacceptable that Sealink should unilaterally make such a decision without consultation with the Irish Government or with Dublin Port who have responsibility for the administration of port facilities. Sealink's handling of this matter is particularly unacceptable having regard to the fact that the Irish Government provide them with terminal facilities on a continual basis at Dún Laoghaire for their freight and passenger services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Belfast port is now being considered for the trade and that Mr. John Needham, the Northern Ireland Minister of State, has taken a personal interest in this matter.  He has visited the proposed Belfast terminal and has said he would welcome the new <Col N="1983" /> business to Belfast.  Has any Irish Minister, especially the Minister for the Marine, taken such an interest?  Already, traffic has started ebbing from Dublin terminal with regular customers making alternative arrangements.  I understand that some customers have already transferred their business to Belfast.</P>
    <P>My purpose in raising this matter tonight is to ask the Minister for the Marine to make urgent representations to Sealink in order to keep open to Irish exporters and importers the container terminals at Dublin and Holyhead.  I should like to give the remainder of my time to Deputy Stafford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>I share, with my colleague Deputy Doyle, the shock of hearing of the proposed closure by Sealink which will cause the loss of approximately 40 jobs.  It will affect not only those employed directly by Sealink but those who operate the tugs, importers, those who work for importers and those who operate the customs clearance.  All these people are in danger of losing their jobs in a port which was doing extremely well and which gave very good employment to a large number of people.  It greatly worries me that we in Dublin were so shabbily treated by this company and I urge the Minister to keep a very close eye on this matter.  Because of our peripherality the whole of Ireland is in danger because of this.  I thank Deputy Doyle for raising this matter and giving me one minute to speak on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West) Michael J. (Limerick West) Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West</i>): I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  The operation to which the Deputy refers is the lift-on/lift-off container service provided by Sealink between Holyhead and Dublin port.  My Department first became aware of Sealink's intention to close its lo-lo container terminal at 11.00 a.m. on 24 January, <Col N="1984" /> when they received a copy of Sealink's press release.</P>
      <P>The Sealink Dublin container terminal opened in 1970.  At that time, Sealink were the shipping subsidiary of British Rail, and in that capacity they provided the shipping and shore handling elements of a lo-lo service operated by Freightliner, a separate freight subsidiary of British Rail.  Freightliner's main business was in moving containerised traffic around Britain, using the British Rail's rail and freight terminal network.  The service to Ireland was, and is, a relatively small element of the overall business. The Irish Sea service at that time was a triangular service, operating between Holyhead, Belfast and Dublin Port.</P>
      <P>In 1984, Sealink was privatised, and was purchased by the multinational company, Sea Containers.  After privatisation, Sealink continued to supply the shipping and shore handling facilities for Freightliner's lo-lo operation.</P>
      <P>In 1988, after a rationalisation of British Rail's freight divisions, Freight-liner were subsumed into Railfreight Distribution (RFD), another division of British Rail, which provided the cargo for the Sealink operation between Holyhead and Dublin.</P>
      <P>I understand that Sealink made extensive efforts over the past six years to secure the future of the lo-lo service at Dublin and Holyhead.  Despite this, Sealink were unable to secure a long term contract from Railfreight Distribution for the continuation of a lo-lo container operation at Dublin Port and Holyhead. Consequently, Sealink decided to cease lo-lo activities at Dublin and Holyhead.</P>
      <P>Clearly, I am very concerned about the possible loss of a lo-lo container terminal located in Dublin Port.  The removal of a key trade involving 500,000 tonnes of unitised cargo which generates almost £1 million income each year for Dublin Port, is a very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This sea route has strategic importance to Irish importers and exporters.  Cessation of the operation of the terminal will <Col N="1985" /> have repercussions for Irish trade at a critical juncture in the implementation of the EC Operational Programme on Peripherality, of which the Dublin Port unitised trade is an important part.</P>
    <P>Since Sealink's announcement, senior officials of my Department have been in continuous contact with senior management of both Dublin Port and Sealink. I have asked them to make every effort to ensure a continuation of lo-lo operations at the Sealink terminal in Dublin Port, whether it is carried on by Sealink or by another operator.  In this regard my officials will also be meeting Rail Freight Distributors next week.</P>
    <P>My officials and I will continue to do our utmost to facilitate matters in a way which will ensure that this important sea route for lo-lo freight will be maintained. Sufficient lo-lo capability at Dublin Port is a critical feature of our harbours policy, endorsed by the European Commission in the Operational Programme on Peripherality.</P>
    <P>I assure the House of my continued commitment to the resolution of the difficulties referred to by the Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to express my sincere thanks to you for allowing me to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment of the House.  Everybody in the country has been well aware of the proposals of the Government, Coillte Teoranta and the IDA with regard to the establishment within the country of a wood-pulp mill.  It is an aim which has been thwarted for a number of years due to lack of supplies.  However, it is now <Col N="1986" /> evident that sufficient supplies will become available in this country within the next two to three years to sustain a viable wood-pulp mill.</P>
      <P>The need for its provision is unquestionable but, in recent times, very serious questions arose with regard to the possibility of this being a viable operation.  I refer especially to the recent announcement by a company in Northern Ireland that they propose to set up a wood-pulp mill in Derry.  This would make a mill within this country available.  We are told that there are only sufficient supplies to maintain one pulp-mill within the country.</P>
      <P>It is important that we should know the exact position in this regard.  I assume that Coillte Teoranta have not entered into any commitment to supply the Northern Ireland plant with timber at any level, whether by means of waste from sawmills, wood thinnings or other sources. I also have grave concerns about the fact that a member of the European Parliament recently made a statement that the wood-pulp plant proposed for Derry had been cleared for EC Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Energy two questions.  Have commitments been given &mdash; I assume that they have not &mdash; in regard to supplies being made available to the Derry plant? What efforts have been made with regard to getting EC Structural Funds and EC funding for the proposed mill which has been talked about for quite a number of years here?  I hope that the Minister will be able to give us the up-to-date position, that he will assure the House that the Government are continuing their efforts and that his Department, Coillte Teoranta and the IDA are making the necessary progress for the establishment of a mill in this country.  Regrettably, when I talk about &ldquo;within this country&rdquo; I must talk about the 26 Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also hope that the Department and Coillte Teoranta are as committed as ever to the establishment of such a project in <Col N="1987" /> the north west, and to Leitrim, which has been earmarked for quite a number of years due to the supplies which will become available there.</P>
    <P>Once again, I thank you for giving me the opportunity of raising this very important matter because we all know that, without supplies from Southern Ireland, the Derry mill is unviable.  Therefore, I presume the Minister can assure me that it will not be supplied from State forests or from private forests which have been grant-aided by the EC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of recent developments I am happy to take this opportunity to outline to the House the present position as regards the establishment of a pulp mill in Ireland.</P>
      <P>A third pulpwood industry is regarded as a strategic cog in the development of the Irish forest products industry.  Since its establishment in January 1989, Coillte Teoranta have made tremendous strides and considerable progress in putting commercially orientated structures and systems in place.  They have ambitious targets for planting which will see the achievement of Government planting targets of 30,000 hectares per annum shared by Coillte Teoranta and the private sector.  They are affording particular attention to marketing to ensure that Irish timber is competitively exported; and that value added is created in the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a large and developing market for timber products which offers exciting prospects.  The EC meets only about half of its timber requirements.  Its import bill for timber and timber products is some £15 billion, second only to that for oil.  Britain, our nearest market, is only 10 per cent sufficient in its timber need. The timber produced in Ireland can help reduce the £400 million import bill we have each year for imports of timber and timber products, thus helping to improve our balance of payments and provide much needed jobs at home and the EC <Col N="1988" /> estimates that demand for timber will continue to outstrip supply.</P>
    <P>Part and parcel of developing a coherent and long term export marketing programme for Irish timber is the need for the establishment of a third pulp mill. The need for such a mill will be evident from the fact that timber supplies here will double between 1989 and the year 2000 from 1.5 million cubic metres to three million cubic metres.  The pulp mill will be necessary to absorb the increasing roundwood and residue supplies coming in line with this doubling of output.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the full benefits of this increasesd output is derived here at home, Coillte Teoranta and the IDA have been in negotiation with a number of potential investors for over two years. They have agreed that the preferred process is CTMP &mdash; chemi-thermo mechanical pulp &mdash; for the following reasons: it provides an opportunity to develop a new high added value industry sector; chemi-thermo mechanical pulp is an advanced technology with expanding market and new uses are being developed all the time; there is the potential to develop a paper manufacturing industry downstream; chemi-thermo mechanical pulp is environmentally benign <i>vis-à-vis</i> other pulp processes; the economies of scale involved closely match the availability of raw material; and chemi-thermo mechanical pulp has the best potential to pay sustained good prices for pulpwood and timber chips.</P>
    <P>In September 1990, Coillte Teoranta and Stora Kopparsberg AB of Sweden announced their decision to participate in two joint ventures: a joint forestry company establishing 2,000 ha. each year in Ireland over the next 15 years; and a joint chemi-thermo mechanical pulp mill to be established in the mid-nineties.</P>
    <P>In December 1990 Stora announced that due primarily to market reasons they would delay the commencement of the final feasibility-engineering study necessary to progress the project at this stage.</P>
    <P>In January of this year, Coillte Teoranta indicated to Stora that, in view of <Col N="1989" /> the importance of having a pulp mill in operation for the second half of the nineties, they would actively seek out other potential partners.  This process is ongoing, in conjunction with the IDA.  In the meantime plans for the joint Stora-Coillte Teoranta forestry project which was established for the pulp mill are not affected by the postponement of the feasibility-engineering study.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the announcement by the Lees Group and Rauma Repola that plans for a chemi-thermo mechanical pulp mill in Derry have been formally submitted to the Industrial Development Board in Northern Ireland and that financing for the project, which is dependent on IDB and EC grant-aid, has yet to be finalised.  However, I see no reason why that announcement should affect plans for a pulp mill in Ireland.  I am confident that the work now underway between Coillte Teoranta and the IDA, in close consultation with my Department, will bear fruit and that the planned pulp mill will be in place by the mid-nineties. I can assure Deputy Ellis that Coillte Teoranta have not entered into any arrangement to supply raw materials to the Derry plant.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Illegal Moneylending.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Two recent court cases highlighted the continuing scourge of illegal moneylending and the appalling problems it can create for low income families when they fall into the clutches of the moneylending sharks.  Only last week an unlicensed moneylender was convicted in a Limerick court on six counts of unlicensed moneylending, fined only £450 and bound to the peace for two years after the district justice heard evidence that he had charged an unmarried mother, as well as other disadvantaged and vulnerable people, interest rates of up to 1,300 per cent.  The district justice said that if the law had so prescribed he would have imposed a maximum prison sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1990" /> Shortly before Christmas a Dundalk licensed moneylender, who, the court was told, charged an interest rate of 728 per cent, was fined £1,000 for what the district justice described as &ldquo;taking most wicked advantage of other people&rdquo;.  In this case the moneylender was not prosecuted under moneylending legislation and was only before the court because he had illegally taken an unmarried mother's allowance book as security for the loan.</P>
    <P>The few cases which come before the courts represent just the tip of the iceberg. As anyone who has experience of dealing with the unemployed and low income families in general would know, illegal moneylending is extensive but it is one of those social abuses on which it is extremely difficult to get specific information because of the social stigma attached to moneylending and the aura of fear which surrounds it, especially in its illegal form.  In many cases a husband or wife borrow money without the knowledge of their spouse and then face the terrible ordeal of trying to make the repayments on their own.</P>
    <P>While moneylending has always existed in one form or another there has been a resurgence of it in the past decade due to the huge increase in unemployment and the numbers dependent on social welfare.  There have been expressions of concern on the part of some Government Ministers but precious little action.  For example, the loan guarantee fund announced by the Minister for Social Welfare in November 1989 amid much publicity has not dealt with the problem.  For instance, only 430 families had availed of the scheme and taken out loans through their credit unions up to November 1990.</P>
    <P>In the long term the problem of moneylending will only be dealt with when all people, those on social welfare and at work, receive a decent income which can adequately sustain them and their dependants.  However, there are a number of steps which should be taken in the short term by the Government <Col N="1991" /> to end illegal moneylending and ensure legal lending and interest rates are subject to the strictest controls.  There have been repeated promises from the Government that moneylending legislation will be updated but nothing has been done.  The 1933 Act is inadequate and it should be updated to take account of modern conditions.  Greater penalties should be introduced for illegal moneylending and the various loopholes which allow licensed moneylenders to boost their interest rates through the use of service or collection charges must be closed off.  One very effective amendment would allow any loan given at a rate above the permitted level to be declared null and void with the borrower being absolved of any obligation to repay it.</P>
    <P>The traditional Garda response, that they can only investigate specific cases where complaints have been made, is no longer adequate.  For example, it is quite clear that the person involved in illegal moneylending is very often dangerous and has a criminal record.  The Minister for Justice, after consultations with the Minister for Social Welfare, should ask the Garda authorities to establish a special Garda squad to investigate moneylending and there should be a more thorough investigation before moneylending licences are granted or renewed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to point out that, following the report on moneylending and low income families prepared by the Combat Poverty Agency, the Government, in their action plan on moneylending, decided to approach the issue of moneylending on two levels, first, intervention through legal and financial measures and, secondly, intervention through the provision of advice, information and education on debt and money management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1992" /> The measures to be undertaken by various Ministers were outlined in the action plan.  Basically, responsibility for the provision of advice, education and information rests with the Minister for Social Welfare; and it is the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to review the legislation of moneylending and its implementation with a view to countering disreputable practices through improving the regulation and control of moneylending.</P>
    <P>The review of the legislation is being conducted in the context of the EC Directive on Consumer Credit, implementation of which falls within the competence of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I am informed that preparation of the measures necessary to give effect to this directive is well advanced in the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that the main impact which the EC Directive on Consumer Credit will have on the Moneylenders Act is in relation to licensing arrangements and to the information and terms to be set out by the lender and to be provided to the borrower, in respect of all moneylending agreements.  I think that all sides of the House will agree that every borrower should be aware of all of the terms and conditions attached to a loan and its full repayment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second level, the provision of the advice, information and education on debt management, I would refer the House to details on progress in relation to the financial and educational aspects of the Government's action plan, which were set out by the Minister for Social Welfare in his answer to a Dáil question by Deputy Michael Bell on 22 November 1990.</P>
    <P>With regard to the particular case outlined by Deputy Byrne, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the defendant in this case pleaded guilty, under the provisions of the Moneylenders Act, 1933, to six charges of carrying on the <Col N="1993" /> business of a moneylender without a licence.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that they actively pursue all alleged breaches of the law in relation to moneylending coming to their notice. The Garda do, however, frequently encounter difficulties in investigating moneylending cases.  In many instances the borrowers or other persons making allegations against moneylenders are either unable or unwilling to give substantive information to the Garda.  Most of what may be described as irregularities in the matter of moneylending are not criminal offences.  There is no power vested in the Garda to prosecute for excessive charges.</P>
    <P>The charging of more than 39 per cent interest by a moneylender is not a criminal offence.  That figure is mentioned in the 1933 Act in the context of a provision which allows a court, where proceedings are brought by a moneylender for the recovery of money loaned, to re-open the transaction and give equitable relief to the borrower, if the transaction is harsh and unconscionable.  The court must conclusively assume that it is such a transaction if the interest exceeds 39 per cent simple interest, but can give relief, even where the interest rate is less.  Charging more than 39 per cent interest could also be significant in the context of moneylenders applying for renewal of certificates of fitness.  This aspect was raised by a district justice in Cork District Court in July 1990, when issuing certificates of fitness to a number of moneylenders in that city.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise to the House that the law, as it stands, is being enforced by the Garda, the successful prosecution in this case being just one example of their vigilance.  The legislation with regard to moneylenders is being reviewed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in consultation with my Department, as I already indicated, this review is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>In regard to what Deputy Byrne said, <Col N="1994" /> since 1987 we as a Government have taken major steps to create a level playing field in the whole financial services sector. We have brought forward major legislation within the various sectors in the financial industry with the Building Societies Act, the Agricultural Credit Corporation Act, and the Trustee Savings Bank Act, and we have taken various other measures within various Departments particularly through the Department of Social Welfare.  Coupled with this is our management of the economy bringing stability to interest rates to ensure that there will be ample opportunity for people to borrow money at reasonable rates.  I suggest to people that they deal with the many reputable institutions in the country rather than dealing with these people who do not want to operate within the law.</P>

      <P>The Olympic Council of Ireland made a special submission to the Government in 1989 for a commitment of £1.75 per annum for each Olympic four year cycle.  They receive £500,000 at the moment.  After extensive lobbying of Government Ministers for the past six months, including the Taoiseach, expectations were high that the <Col N="1995" /> Government would respond positively and make a substantial contribution in the budget towards the preparation of potential Olympic participations. However, they were disappointed.  There was no reference to the Olympics or, indeed, to sport in the Budget Statement. To add insult to injury, the Olympic Council of Ireland were informed that the £200,000 which was always made available on the third year of the Olympic cycle will not now be forthcoming from the Government.  At the moment the 21 sporting organisations affiliated to the Olympic Council of Ireland are preparing training schemes for their potential Olympic participants in Barcelona.  Their programme will be greatly restricted without the necessary finance.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government to make £500,000 available immediately to the Irish Olympic Council so that our athletes are given every chance in Barcelona to win a medal.</P>

      <P>I am making a special appeal on behalf of an exceptional national school in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire.  This school, located at Blackrock, is Carysfort national school. This national school has an exceptional school manager with an outstanding parent association.  I ask the Minister for Education through her contacts with the new owners of the Carysfort College education complex to concede two things to this national school, (1) a gymnasium or possibly through the good offices of the authorities the use of the gymnasium there and (2) more particularly the additional use of land by the national school children.  It is very important that these children have additional land within the land already there and now owned by the UCD authorities.  I believe that with goodwill on both sides there can be little doubt that the wishes of the school authorities of Carysfort national school may be granted in respect of those two requests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government and Dublin Corporation have given a commitment to the people of the Sheriff Street flats complex to rehouse them as far as possible in their own North Wall parish.  Corporation architects have drawn up a detailed redevelopment plan based largely on derelict, disused land and buildings in the Seville Place-Spencer Dock area.  Much of that land is in the process of being acquired by Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>The difficulty is that Irish Rail have refused to sell a site that stretches along the Royal Canal.  This strip of land is crucial to the corporation architect's rehousing plan both in terms of the number of houses that could be built on it and the fact that its location would maximise the use of adjoining sites which the corporation are acquiring.</P>
      <P>This land has been disused, derelict, a dump and an eyesore for decades.  CIE never had use for it during that time yet Irish Rail admit they still have no short term or long term proposal on the drawing board for it.  It is wide enough for a single line.  The excuse given by Irish Rail is they might need a commuter rail link to the proposed national sports centre some time in the future, yet, Connolly Station is less than two minutes walk from that site.  There are also numerous rail lines across the Royal Canal leading to the goods yard at the North Wall.  A new single line seems unnecessary and wasteful in the extreme or would appear to be merely a red herring to allow Irish Rail to retain a site so that they can dispose of it at a speculative price at a later date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1990 the Olympic Council of Ireland received £505,000 from the Department of Education.  That grant was paid as follows: £475,000 for the preparation and training of Olympic sports persons for the 1992 Olympic Games to be held in <Col N="1997" /> Barcelona and £30,000 towards the provision of medical equipment for testing and assessment of those sports persons by medical specialists at the Blackrock Clinic on behalf of the medical commission of the Olympic Council of Ireland.</P>
      <P>It can be confirmed that the grant to the Olympic Council of Ireland for 1991 will not be less than £505,000 which will be allocated in the same ratio as last year and will be for the same purposes.</P>
      <P>We recognise that 1991 is the penultimate year in the current four-year Olympic cycle.  Certainly a very strong case has been made for extra funding by the Olympic Council of Ireland.  My difficulty is that the same amount of money made available in 1990 for the current development of sport will be made available again in 1991.  Consequently it will not be possible for me to effect any major increase in the amount of money being made available to the Olympic Council of Ireland.</P>
      <P>However, I want to assure the House that the proper presentation and preparation of our Olympic athletes will not be neglected and that, in our discussions with the Olympic Council, we will endeavour to ensure that the needs of our athletes are catered for.  Of course, I should say this is in addition to very significant amounts of money being given to the governing bodies of sport and to the athletes themselves under the elite sportspersons grants and now to the various coaching schemes, such as the National Coaching Centre, all of which are geared to the best possible preparation of our athletes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Andrews's question I should say the Carysfort complex, as he said, was acquired recently by University College Dublin.  Therefore the availability of facilities is a matter which should be dealt with by the UCD authorities.  However, the Department are aware that the UCD authorities would be pleased to discuss the matters <Col N="1998" /> raised by Deputy Andrews with the relevant school authorities.  We will be most anxious to see the school authorities facilitated in a mutually acceptable manner.</P>
    <P>In regard to the extra land required, again Deputy Andrews on a number of occasions advanced a forceful case that such land be made available.  We would like to see an accommodation arrived at between the UCD authorities and the school authorities which would be acceptable to the school.  I want to assure the Deputy that my Department are quite happy to be supportive of an initiative of this kind.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate the need to rehouse the tenants of Sheriff Street Flats, and I will lend my support, where practicable, to ensure that everything is done to accommodate their requirements.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has already been in touch with me to ensure that the tenants are rehoused in the locality on a phased basis and to the greatest extent possible in the parish of St. Laurence O'Toole.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation, in consultation with the tenants of the flats, prepared a plan which identified a number of sites which could be utilised for a housing development for the displaced tenants. The plan identified three possible sites in the ownership of CIE, the largest of which was the Spencer Dock site referred to by the Deputy.  My Department have been in contact with CIE about having land owned by CIE at Spencer Dock made available to Dublin Corporation to rehouse the tenants.  In this context I understand that the CIE Board recently agreed terms with Dublin Corporation for the sale of a site at Spencer Avenue near the Spencer Dock which will accommodate approximately 25 houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the legal formalities in connection with the sale of the property at Spencer Avenue will be finalised <Col N="1999" /> shortly.  I hope that work on the construction of the new housing accommodation at this site will commence soon.</P>
    <P>At my request, CIE examined the possibility of providing other sites to Dublin Corporation for the required housing.  However, the outcome of the investigation revealed that the properties were required by the CIE Board for operational purposes.  Further discussions between Dublin Corporation and CIE are continuing with a view to identifying other possibilities to satisfy Dublin Corporation's requirements in this case.</P>
    <P>With regard to the site at Spencer Dock, CIE have indicated that they wish to retain this land for possible future rail development to cater for anticipated <Col N="2000" /> traffic in the Custom House Docks development area.</P>
    <P>It is the view of the board of CIE that the trend of commercial development established by the Customs House development site is likely to extend eastward and that the Spencer Dock site is ideally suited for CIE to exploit the passenger traffic opportunities that will be associated with this development.</P>
    <P>Finally I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy and the House that, in consultation with CIE, I will be examining all the various issues with a view to establishing whether anything further can be done to facilitate Dublin Corporation in accommodating the tenants of the Sheriff Street Flats.</P>

      <Col N="1812" /> In August 1989, I approved a preliminary report for the provision of a new tertiary treatment plant to serve Ballinrobe and requested the county council to prepare contract documents as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In August 1990, I approved contract documents for the site investigations contract, the results of which would allow contract documents for the overall scheme to be developed.  Tenders in relation to the site investigations contract have yet to be submitted to my Department for approval.</P>
    <P>The need for a modern sewage treatment plant to serve Ballinrobe has been established and I can assure the Deputy that there will be no delay on the part of my Department in dealing with all matters relating to this priority scheme.</P>

Consultations are taking place between my Department and the Department of Energy regarding the content of the guidelines.

    <P>Having regard to proposals already existing for a hazardous waste incinerator facility here, and to the unlikelihood of the whole of Ireland being able economically to support more than one such facility, I had discussions on this matter within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Conference on 31 January with the Northern Ireland Minister with responsibility for the Environment, Mr. Richard Needham, M.P. I intend to allow time for the situation to clarify further before deciding to support any particular proposal.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 114 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tentative estimate of £50 million <Col N="1816" /> mentioned in the operational programme on peripherality was related to three major improvement projects identified as potentially suitable for toll-based private investment.  The position on each of them is as follows.  Dublin Ring Road: I have written to Dublin County Council in response to the resolution passed by them on 5 October 1990 asking them to consider in depth the case for the tolling of the Dublin ring road, in whole or in part, having regard to a range of factors, including the point that it has been long standing Government policy to encourage toll-based private investment and to use any additional funding from that source to accelerate the road development programme.</P>
    <P>Leixlip/Maynooth/Kilcock: On the recommendation of the National Roads Authority, it is not now proposed to invite proposals for toll-based private investment in this route.  Downstream crossing of the River Lee: Any consideration of tolling in this case will have to await a decision on Cork Corporation's application for a bridge order.</P>
    <P>Pending the presentation to the House of the roads Bill it would be inappropriate to give details of its provisions.</P>
    <P>In my replies to Questions Nos. 200 of 19 June 1990 and 15 and 49 of 10 July 1990, I set out in some details the circumstances in which it was decided that certain preliminary works should be undertaken to facilitate further tolling of the Dublin ring road in the event of such a decision being made by the local authority. To date £2.2 million has been certified and paid in respect of these works. Elements of the cost of the works have still to be agreed by the parties concerned, and in the circumstances, it is not possible at this stage to indicate the overall cost.</P>

A vital part of that campaign is the general action plan for increased Garda attention to traffic law enforcement which was announced by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, on 11 October last.</P>
      <P>The special anti-drink and driving Christmas campaign mounted by the Garda Síochána was the most successful campaign of its type ever undertaken.  I am pleased that drink and driving campaigns will continue in 1991 and that the Garda authorities intend to maintain a very high profile in this respect throughout the coming year.</P>
      <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, that a total of almost 1,000 motorists face the prospect of prosecution for drink related offences during the month of December.</P>
      <P>The success of the campaign will ultimately be measured by a sustained reduction in road accidents with fewer people being killed and injured.  The figures in this regard which have emerged for the month of December last are an encouraging indication of what can be achieved.</P>

      <P>Under arrangements agreed ministerially in 1985, meetings at official level are held periodically between Ireland and the United Kingdom to exchange information and compare policies on the Irish Sea.  These arrangements facilitated the production in 1988 by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea of a status report on the Irish Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been recently agreed to build on these existing consultation arrangements by establishing a co-ordination group to <Col N="1829" /> review existing monitoring and research programmes for the Irish Sea, to advise on the scope for better integration of present activities and to identify new areas for attention.  A full-time scientific co-ordinator will be appointed to assist this group.  Apart from the costs of the co-ordinator, which will be shared by the Irish and UK authorities, no additional expenditure will arise from this new arrangement.</P>
    <P>Details of the new agreement are receiving attention here and in the UK and should be finalised shortly.</P>

      <P>In 1984, the Government approved a common framework for coordinated response to major emergencies and decided that responsibility for emergency planning at national level should rest with individual Government Departments within their own areas of responsibility and with the bodies responsible for emergency services &mdash; including local authorities &mdash; under their aegis.</P>
      <P>The relevant local authorities have all prepared appropriate emergency plans and are required to review them annually in consultation with other emergency agencies.  In June 1989 my Department issued detailed advice to local authorities in regard to the holding of exercises to test their plans and, while details are not required to be submitted to my Department, I am aware that several such exercises have taken place.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the important role that Castletownbere fishery port is to the fishing industry, he will take immediate steps towards providing sufficient funds in 1991 to enable Cork County Council to reconstruct all bridges on the main road from Glengarriff to Castletownbere.</Quest>

      <P>As the road in question is a regional road, primary responsibility for the bridges on it rests with the local authority, Cork County Council.  The cost of any works required falls to be financed from local resources supplemented by the discretionary grants provided by my Department for such roads.  In the case of Cork County Council, those grants totalled £8.094 million in 1990 compared with £6.619 million in 1989.  The determination of priorities in the expenditure of these grants is a matter for the local authority.</P>
      <P>In addition to the payments referred to above, a sum of £895,000 was paid over the years 1986 to 1989, inclusive, to Cork County Council by way of special grants for works on the Glengarriff-Castletownbere road.</P>
      <P>I will notify local authorities of their 1991 road grants shortly.</P>

      <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwellings are matters for the local authority to be funded <Col N="1831" /> from their own resources.  Under the remedial works scheme, capital allocations are made to enable local authorities to carry out major refurbishment projects to designated estates.  The corporation have to date sought approval under the scheme for 13 of their estates and the seven to which they are attached the highest priority have been designated for funding.  Due to the outstanding commitments on the designated projects, the overall high level of demands under the scheme and the priority rating afforded to St. Jospeh's Mansions by Dublin Corporation, it has not, to date, been possible to designate this estate for funding under the remedial works scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>Information of the type requested by the Deputies is available in my Department only in respect of charges for domestic water, refuse and sewerage services and I refer the Deputies to replies to Question No. 69 of 12 February 1986 in respect of 1984 and 1985; Question No. 181 of 24 June 1987 in respect of 1986 and 1987; Question No. 200 of 13 December 1988 and Question No. 115 of 26 October 1989 in respect of 1989.</P>
      <P>The amounts levied in 1983, 1990 and 1991 are set out in the tabular statement which I propose to have circulated in the Official Report.  The total receipts from domestic service charges in so far as it can be identified in local authority estimates are estimated to have been approximately 68 per cent in 1988 and 74 per cent in 1989 of the amounts collectable excluding arrears.  Information on the percentage collection in 1990 is not yet available in my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 116 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1840" /> On 17 January I asked all county councils to submit reports on the damage caused, and the estimated cost of remedial works, to public roads and bridges as a result of the severe weather conditions in the early part of the month. Reports have been received from all county councils and are being assessed in my Department.  When this is completed, I hope to be in a position to make grants available as a contribution towards the cost of remedial works to public roads and bridges.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for dealing with the problem of snow and ice on roads rests with the local road authorities as part of their road maintenance programme.  My Department issue advice to all local authorities on an annual basis about the steps to be taken to prepare for and deal with severe weather conditions.  In addition, the Department have made special road grants available for the purchase of specialised snow clearance and gritting machinery.</P>
    <P>During the period in January when roads were affected by snow and ice, the Department became aware of particular problems in Laois in keeping roads open to traffic.  The local authority were given clearance, at the time, to order additional specialist equipment which will be financed from road grants this year.  In <Col N="1841" /> addition, arrangements were made by the Department for the immediate delivery of some of that equipment to the local authority.</P>

      <P>The estimated total volume of toxic and dangerous waste in this country coming within the EC definition was 54,000 tonnes in 1988.  Approximately two-thirds of this waste is disposed of in-house by the producing firms.  A relatively small percentage is disposed of either by local authorities or by waste disposal firms on their own sites and the balance is exported for treatment and disposal abroad.  I am not in a position to give details of the private sector interests concerned. No waste is shipped to Sellafield.</P>
      <P>Existing arrangements in this country for control and disposal of toxic and dangerous wastes derive from the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1982; these are implemented by the local authorities concerned. The recently introduced Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990, provides however, for an integrated pollution control licensing system which will include waste disposal aspects to be operated by the agency.  In addition, preliminary work on the preparation of a comprehensive new waste Bill is in hands in my Department.</P>

      <P>Travelling families may be accommodated by housing authorities in standard local authority housing through casual vacancies occurring therein, in group housing specially constructed for travelling families or in newly constructed standard local authority housing.  As the letting of local authority houses is a matter for the individual authority in accordance with their approved scheme of letting priorities, information on the numbers of such letting to travelling families in 1990 is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>Preliminary figures from the 1990 count of travelling families carried out by local authorities in November 1990 show that, at that date, 1,696 families were accommodated in local authority standard and group housing while another 1,136 families were on the roadside. Some of the families on the roadside would wish to be accommodated in housing while others might wish to be accommodated on serviced sites.  It is not possible to indicate when all travelling families who are seeking accommodation on serviced sites will be so accommodated as this is affected by the rate at which local authorities provide such sites and other factors, such as the rate of new family formation among travellers.  Local authorities will, however, continue to be encouraged to provide such accommodation as quickly as possible and sufficient capital to finance their proposals will continue to be made available to authorities.</P>

      <P>The increase in the 1990 provisional outturn &mdash; £732,000 &mdash; compared to the original provision &mdash; £590,000 &mdash; was mainly due to the transfer of responsibility for the cost of printing, publications, stationery, etc. from the Government Supplies Agency to the Department.</P>

      <P>The human rights situation in Sudan is a source of serious preoccupation to the Government and our partners in the Twelve, and our concerns in this respect have been made known to the Sudanese authorities on a number of occasions.  In addition, and as a measure of the concerns of the Community and its member states at the continuing violations of human rights in that country, work on drawing up the programme of <Col N="1855" /> assistance for Sudan under the Fourth Lomé Convention has been postponed.</P>
      <P>The detention without charge or trial of large numbers of people in Sudan, including lawyers, politicians, doctors, academics and journalists, has been specifically highlighted by the Twelve and only serves to underscore the need for the Sudanese Government to take concrete action to improve its overall record on human rights.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the answer I gave in the House on Wednesday, 12 December on the subject of the staffing of the fishery boards.</P>
      <P>In that answer I pointed out that the staffing levels of all the fishery boards have fallen significantly in recent years due to general restrictions on recruitment.</P>
      <P>I added however, that it would, in present financial circumstances, be totally unrealistic to expect that there would be any general relaxation of these restrictions or any general increase in the staffing of the fishery boards.</P>
      <P>I nevertheless stated that I was very conscious of the need to maintain a balance in the staffing of the boards and to ensure that a limited number of priority posts were filled.  I also mentioned that I have ordered my Department to carry out an assessment of all the boards.  I would not comment on any individual cases until such time as the assessment has been completed and I had had the chance to study it.</P>
      <P>I have now received that assessment which includes a review of the position of the Dundalk area and am pursuing the matter further.  As of now, however, no decision has been taken.</P>

      <Quest>the number of persons who are currently eligible for the contributory pension scheme for the self-employed; the number of contributors who are paying into this scheme and are debarred from payment of a contributory pension because of age and contribution criteria; and the plans or proposals he has to redress this situation.</Quest>

      <P>Self-employed people between the ages of 16 and 66 with reckonable income of £2,500 per year or more are insurable as self-employed contributors for old age and widows and orphans contributory pensions.  There are some 143,000 people registered as self-employed contributors.</P>
      <P>Insured people will generally be eligible for widows and orphans pension on the basis of three or more years contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has applied to all contributors since the scheme was introduced in 1961.  It is designed to ensure a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's working life for entitlement to pension.  Accordingly, those who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over will not qualify for the old age contributory pension.  However, people in that age group who have been insured as employed persons for any period prior to age 56 could qualify for <Col N="1866" /> pension as their previous insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for pension purposes. It is not possible at this stage to estimate the total number of contributors who will not qualify for pension as a result of this condition or because of a deficiency of contributions generally.</P>
    <P>One of the commitments which the Government has given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is to examine the possibility, in the context of structural reform in agriculture, of providing a retirement income to older farmers who transfer or lease their holdings. The question of farmers over 56 who will not qualify for old age contributory pension will be considered in this context.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board are currently examining all the conditions for entitlement to pensions for employees and the self-employed in the course of the preparation of their final report which is due to be completed by end June.  I will take full account of the board's recommendations in considering further change to social welfare pension schemes.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance scheme was launched on 1 November 1990.  The total number of people in receipt of the allowances for carers at the end of December was 2,534.  This figure includes those who transferred to carer's allowance having previously been in receipt of prescribed relative's allowance and those who retained their previous entitlement. The numbers in receipt of carer's allowance at the maximum weekly rate of £45 was 918 at the end of December.

      <P>The Garda Divisional Headquarters building in Dún Laoghaire is in a very poor condition and in urgent need of replacement. It has been necessary to try to find an alternative site as the existing station site could not accommodate the proposed new station.  My Department examined a number of sites in central Dún Laoghaire and identified the site, which the Deputy refers to, as the most suitable site for the new station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This site is held by the Department of the Marine and is, at present, being used <Col N="1869" /> by that Department in the running of Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  The view of the interim Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board is that the site is likely to be crucial to the future operation and development of the harbour and, on that basis, it is intended to retain it in the ownership of the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>Efforts to secure a suitable alternative, centrally-located site have, so far, been unsuccessful but are ongoing.  In the absence of a more central site, a site on Kill Avenue, adjacent to the new fire station, has now been made available.</P>

      <P>It is not possible at this stage to set out the final expenditure position for 1990 in respect of any agency.  The original allocation for the year will be adjusted for example by the cost of approved pay awards for health service staff.  These adjustments are being finalised with the agencies and will be notified to them in due course.</P>
