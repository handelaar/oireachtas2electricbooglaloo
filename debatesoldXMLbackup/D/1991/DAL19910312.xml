      <P>Each member of the Government is responsible for job creation in the sectors for which he/she has departmental responsibility, e.g. the Minister for Industry and Commerce for manufacturing and international services, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications for tourism, transport and communications, the Minister for the Environment for construction, the Minister for the Marine for the marine, the Minister for Energy for forestry, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food for agriculture, food and horticulture.</P>

    <P>The Central Review Committee, established in December 1987 by the Government and the social partners <Col N="498" /> under the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> and continued under the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> to review and monitor the progress in implementing the programme and in particular the achievement of its targets and objectives, monitors progress in job creation areas on an going basis. The committee published a progress report on job creation in December 1988, and a further progress report, which included job creation, in February 1990. Section V of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> outlined the progress achieved in relation to job creation under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and set out targets and objectives to be achieved under the new programme.  Paragraph 4 of section X of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides that the Central Review Committee mechanism will continue to operate to monitor the achievement of the targets and objectives including those for job creation of the new programme.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is clear that what is everybody's job in Government is nobody's job.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he is aware that the live register at present stands at 244,000 persons and that this is 16,000 higher than was estimated by his Minister for Finance when he introduced the budget six weeks ago?  Will he also agree that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is really a programme for unemployment as it, in effect, provides for no new jobs either in the next three years or in its underlying strategy over the next ten years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree, first, with the last point.  The programme does provide for the creation of 20,000 jobs a year.  On the basis of the success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which produced about 21,000 jobs a year we can be confident that that target will be reached under the new programme. Second, with regard to the overall level of the unemployment figures at present it is quite clear that the recent increase <Col N="499" /> in the total live register is due primarily to two factors: that emigration has declined very considerably and, in addition, a very large number of emigrants have returned.  Of course, the present situation contrasts quite favourably with the situation when the Deputy in question left office as a Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is the Taoiseach not aware that his Government now say that there are 275,000 people unemployed when we allow for those on training courses, some of which are spurious?  Will he also agree that the Government are now not only not solving the unemployment problem but that Government policy is actually causing a loss of jobs by removing incentives and creating poverty traps?  Will he further agree that his Government have neither a national policy, a sectoral policy or a taxation policy which will do anything about the unemployment problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that one significant difference between the <i>Programme for National <Col N="502" /> Recovery,</i> which is just finished, and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> which the Government have recently published, is that the former document contains specific targets for job creation in individual sectors, whereas the present document has abandoned any targets for job creation in any individual sector?  Would the Taoiseach further agree that it would make good sense to establish a ministerial task force of all the Ministers responsible for employment particularly with a view to making a concerted attack on the poverty traps in social welfare and taxation which do not make it worthwhile for people to increase their income or work harder under the present system?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The EUROPEN campaign which was co-ordinated by my Department was concentrated in 1988 and 1989, with some run-over into 1990. As had always been intended, the Government's continuing activities designed to promote preparation for the completion of the Single European Market are now being carried out by the Government Departments and State agencies appropriate in each case.  If the Deputy has a specific query in regard to <Col N="504" /> any area, I suggest he table a question to the appropriate Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in medium-sized enterprises where jobs will be threatened by the completion of the internal market the employers are aware of neither the potential threats nor the potential benefits facing them and, more to the point, the employees whose jobs will be at risk are not being kept informed at all?  Can the Taoiseach indicate which Minister of the various Ministers will have responsibility for ensuring that employees who legitimately want to find out if their employer is availing of all the aids provided by the State can get this information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Deputy should say that that is the situation because the whole purpose of the EUROPEN campaign was to give all that sort of information.  In fact, there was a major participation by the trade unions in EUROPEN to deal with the very situation the Deputy has spoken about, namely, the trade unions were to have the function of keeping employees in firms fully informed by means of seminars, discussions and so on.  Of course, there is also an obligation on management to keep them fully informed.  I could not accept what the Deputy has said.  Indeed, so much effort has been put into this campaign now that I would be surprised if any employer is not aware of what is facing him or her in 1992.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put it to the Taoiseach that, if he were to visit any of the medium-sized organisations representing employers at present and to ask them to identify the directives, draft or completed, which will directly impact upon them after 1992 they would not be able to answer that question.  Neither would they be able to answer where the likely source of competition will come from after the completion of the internal market.  Those are the two bottom line questions which need to be answered. Unfortunately, the campaign to which <Col N="505" /> the Taoiseach referred has not got down to that specific level yet.</P>

They regard this as a specific area which needs to be tackled urgently by way of job creation, training for new technology and the taking-up of new jobs.</P>

      <P>The programme makes specific provision for exactly that situation. There is a whole new initiative included in the programme for tackling long term unemployment in black spot areas.  The Central Review Committee are now working out the details of that initiative.  A number of areas will be selected around the country which are areas of high, long term, unemployment and a special company will be set up to take charge of the programme in that area.  There will be a partnership between the local community, Government agencies, trade unions and employers who will all work together in these pilot areas to specifically use the resources of the local community in providing employment.</P>

Can the Taoiseach give some indication when, if ever, the scheme will be extended nationally? Secondly, can the Taoiseach indicate, in regard to the other matters discussed at the meeting &mdash; the GATT negotiations &mdash; if it has been agreed yet by the Government that there should be a study by an independent body, such as the Economic and Social Research Institute, on the total damage to the entire Irish economy, including the PAYE sector, as a result of the proposals of Commissioner MacSharry in regard to agriculture?</P>

Why have the Government not decided to carry out a comprehensive economic study of the effects of Commissioner MacSharry's proposals to reform the Common Agricultural Policy, in terms of lost jobs in the PAYE sector?

The experience of a pilot project of the type referred to has worked quite successfully in Ballymun in locating jobs for a number of people who are long term unemployed, but it has not, by a long chalk, solved the unemployment problem in Ballymun, and that is my concern. Pilot projects on their own will not solve the problem.  There are 100,000 long term unemployed who need jobs urgently. How long does the Taoiseach expect that the pilot projects he has referred to will continue, and at what stage will they be extended in a way which, hopefully, will <Col N="511" /> absorb the 100,000 people who are already long term unemployed and the increasing numbers now appearing on the live register?</P>

      <P>There are no plans to commemorate the formation of the societies of United Irishmen which were founded in 1791 and 1792.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I raised this question because there has been so <Col N="513" /> much hype about the 75th Anniversary of 1916 and because of my belief that the establishment of the United Irishmen had perhaps a far more profound effect on the subsequent development of Irish politics. In that regard &mdash; and as the objective of the United Irishmen was to unite our people regardless of religious persuasion &mdash; would it not be appropriate to mark the foundation of the society in some way this year to at least counterbalance the undue hype in relation to the 75th anniversary of 1916?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the statement in the last part of the Deputy's supplementary.  What we propose for the 75th anniversary of 1916 is dignified and simple.  Of course, I fully accept the role which the United Irishmen played in our history and they are entitled to be honoured.  However, there must be a limit on the number of official commemorations and I suggest that, in cases like the formation of the United Irishmen, it would be more appropriate for people who are interested in that event &mdash; enthusiasts &mdash; to organise some sort of commemoration of their own on a private basis; I do not mean on a private individual basis but outside Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the suggestion from Deputy De Rossa that there should be a commemoration of the establishment of the United Irishmen.  Is the Taoiseach aware that they were one of the first Irish movements which were clearly seen as part of an overall European radical and non-sectarian tradition? In view of the relevance of such ideas to the solution of our problems in the latter half of the 20th century, will the Taoiseach not agree that commemorating such an event in Ireland, which was part of the general European trend, would be highly appropriate and would help us in solving our problems in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with that but it is more appropriate to a privately organised commemoration outside Government.  I do not think that the <Col N="514" /> Government should have official commemorations for every possible and conceiveable event; the official Government commemoration should be confined to major events because, in that way, they probably carry more weight and are of more significance.  There is no need for any confrontation about this; I would encourage groups of enthusiasts, historians or people of that kind, to commemorate the foundation of the United Irishmen.</P>

      <P>As the House knows, the Government entrusted the task of organising the celebration of Dublin as cultural capital of Europe in 1991 to Dublin Promotions Organisations Ltd. They have prepared a brochure setting out an impressive programme of events planned for the year.  I have arranged for the brochure to be circulated to Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Restoration works with cultural connotations are being carried out primarily by the Office of Public Works and these are described in a brochure prepared by that office which I have also arranged to have circulated to Deputies.  In addition, the Irish Museum of Modern Art will be <Col N="515" /> opened in May in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham and, of course, the College of Science complex restored as Government Buildings was recently opened as the first in this series of restoration projects for Dublin 1991.</P>
    <P>As I have already reported to the House, most recently on 27 February, the Temple Bar area will be developed as a Government flagship project as part of the city of culture programme.  The property holdings of CIE and Dublin Corporation in the Temple Bar area will be acquired.  Loan financing of £5 million has been provided for the development of the area by the European Investment Bank and the European Community has made a grant of £3.6 million for certain aspects of the development.  The Government will shortly consider tax and other incentives related specifically to the development.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation are reopening the refurbished Hugh Lane Gallery in Parnell Square after a substantial restoration project to which the Government have also contributed £100,000.  Nearby in Parnell Square, the Writers' Centre and the Writers' Museum will shortly open.  This project is being funded by the Government, Dublin Tourism and the European Regional Development Fund at a cost of £1.8 million.</P>
    <P>In addition, I allocated £1.25 million to the Dublin Promotions Organisation for their various activities.  They have raised considerably more than this in sponsorship and in contributions from the cultural institutes of various embassies. The European Commission has given a grant in the region of £130,000.</P>
    <P>At the National Museum and National Library, further works of improvement will be carried out this year, including the provision of an exhibition room at the National Library and work to facilitate the mounting of special exhibitions during the year.  The National Concert Hall will inaugurate a new concert organ and will be the venue for concerts in celebration of the year.  Many of the bodies and groups funded by the Arts <Col N="516" /> Council will also participate in events throughout the year.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the overall result will be a very vibrant celebration in 1991 of Dublin as a worthy cultural capital coupled with the long term benefits of continuing cultural renewal from the restoration and reconstruction projects which we have undertaken.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his very long and detailed reply, indeed the list of things he intends to do is very impressive.  Nevertheless, there is one other project to which he should give serious consideration, the restoration of St. Catherine's Church, Thomas Street, one of Dublin's most historic churches built in the mid-18th century.  It would be a very suitable project, especially as it is at present owned by Dublin Corporation and is up for sale.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that this would be an excellent, and lasting, project to commemorate our year as the cultural capital of Europe and the anniversary of 1916 because of the church's direct connection with another patriotic Irishman, Robert Emmet, who was beheaded outside the church in 1803.  I note that the General Post Office in O'Connell Street is being restored with the use of lottery funds and perhaps the Taoiseach might consider this as a suitable vehicle for renovating this historic building.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Deputy's interest in that part of our Dublin heritage but, as he pointed out, the church is in the possession of Dublin Corporation so it is primarily a matter for them to initiate some action in regard to it.  I am sure what the Deputy said will be taken note of.</P>

      <P>In respect of St. Catherine's Church, will the Taoiseach not agree his reply indicates that, in a sense, there is nobody in overall charge of the Dublin preparation for the cultural year?  The Taoiseach has had to admit that it is for someone else &mdash; maybe Dublin Corporation &mdash; to deal with this problem. Will he agree that this indicates a lack <Col N="517" /> of central direction in local government generally in the Dublin area?  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether there is any proposal to invite the Cultural and Education Committee of the Council of Europe, the joint sponsors of the cities of culture projects in Europe, to meet in Dublin as they did in Glasgow during its term as the European City of Culture?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with what the Deputy said about the general approach to the organisation of cultural capital year.  There is a central body specifically in charge, as I outlined in answer to the question.  I am merely pointing out to Deputy Garland that St. Catherine's Church, is owned by and in the possession of Dublin Corporation and if anything was to be done about it it would be primarily a matter for Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>The year will be launched on 16 March and the EC Ministers of Culture will be here for that launch.  I will consider the question of inviting the cultural committee here but the first item on the agenda is the attendance of the Ministers of Culture at the launch on 16 March.</P>

      <Quest>the number of occasions to date on which the powers in section 8 (4) of the National Archives Act, 1986 have been used to certify records which are over 30 years old, as ones which should not be available to the public for inspection.</Quest>

      <P>To date, 292 retention certificates have been made under the terms of section 8 (4) of the National Archives Act in respect of 3,991 files. The files thereby retained represent less than 1 per cent of the archival material transferred to the National Archives from Departments over the past year under the terms of the National Archives Act, 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The files in question contain very little of archival value since the majority of <Col N="518" /> them contain confidential, personal information on past and present public servants which, as provided for in the Act, should not be made available for public inspection in the National Archives.  The balance would constitute files withheld as also provided for in the Act, on grounds of public interest, on grounds of breaching a statutory duty or good faith where information was supplied in confidence, or where the disclosure of information would or might cause distress or danger to living persons.</P>

      <P>There are a number of considerations.  The objective of the whole exercise is to place all possible records of information at the disposal of the public and particularly at the disposal of scholars, but there is some material which I think in the interests of decency and honour on the part of the State to its citizens should not be disclosed.  At what point these records will become history as distinct from personal records it is difficult to say, but I think the main purpose of the legislation is being achieved and that everything worthwhile and necessary is being put on record for the public to see.</P>

      <P>The reservations which remain in respect of Ireland's accession to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women relate to&mdash;Articles 11 (i) and 13 (a) concerning the field of employment and the right to family benefits; Article 13 (b) and 13 (c), concerning financial credit and other services and recreational facilities; Article 15, concerning the legal capacity of women, and Article 16 (d) and (f) concerning guardianship, adoption and custody of children born out of wedlock.</P>
      <P>Ireland's position is that legislation is not required for three of the four reservations I have outlined as our constitutional and legislative provisions already ensure equality.  It may be that legislation is required in order to withdraw the fourth reservation dealing with access to financial credit and recreational facilities.  However, the Government are not convinced that the guarantee of equality contained in the Irish Constitution needs to be supplemented by such legislation.

Will he agree that this reservation to Article 13 regarding the extension of anti-discrimination legislation to deal with access to financial credit services and recreational facilities, which were mentioned, is a fundamental requirement, one on which a very serious view is taken by the Council for the Status of Women, the Employment Equality Agency and people like Women in Golf because there is no legislative provision for women to pursue their rights through the courts?

      <P>As I already announced in a statement arising from the alleged leak of the November consumer price index, in order to avoid the risk of any future leakage of economically sensitive information which could affect dealings on the Stock Exchange, it has been arranged that the consumer price index, the monthly live register and the trade figures, will be calculated and published only after the Stock Exchange has closed at 5 p.m.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office have now decided that they will maintain the traditional practice of issuing the live register totals on the first Friday of each month.  The Summary Release will appear on that Friday with the detailed release being published on the following Monday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the question relates to the change relating to how in February, in particular, the figures were sneaked out surreptitiously a day in advance, was this conditioned by how bad the figures were which shows the continued terrible trend in unemployment, or will it be the case permanently in future that the figures will be released one day in advance, but after 5 p.m. as the Taoiseach has suggested?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is casting aspersions on the integrity of the Central Statistics Office because it is they and not the Government who decide these matters.  The Central Statistics Office are a relatively independent authority who decide when figures should be issued and what the figures issued should be.  What happened on the last occasion was that the Central Statistics Office considered going over to Thursday for the release of unemployment figures.  They have now revised their decision in that regard and intend to go back to the old system of publishing on a Friday.</P>

      <P>I resent that.  The Deputy should withdraw that comment. It is a reflection on the Central Statistics Office and their professional integrity and it is not justified.  They were not sneaked out; they were published on a Thursday by the Central Statistics Office.  The Central Statistics Office within their own competence decided that these figures should be published on a Thursday.  They have since revised that and have returned to the old system of publishing on a Friday.  They have also decided to adhere to the old date for the cost of living index figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 95 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>The principle underlying the availability of public hospital services has, until now, been that admission should be based entirely on the criterion of medical need, irrespective of whether public or private care was required.  I am satisfied that this principle has always operated in respect of emergency cases, which must be admitted to whatever bed is available, and this will continue to be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there has been a growing concern that the admission arrangements for non-emergency procedures, particularly where there is a significant waiting list, may have been operating to the disadvantage of the public patient.  The modifications to these arrangements, which have been agreed by the social partners in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> are designed to improve equity of access to public hospital services by removing those elements of the present arrangements which may, in practice, be unfair to the public patient.  I am glad to have the opportunity to explain in detail why <Col N="527" /> this is the case, and why the concept of a common waiting list for all beds, public and private alike, while attractive in theory, may in practice make it harder rather than easier to achieve equity of access.</P>
    <P>At present, every person in the country is entitled to a public bed, but those above a certain income are required to make private arrangements with their consultants. The consultant is, of course, responsible for deciding which patients should be admitted to the available beds. This inevitably gives rise to a perception that a consultant's private patient may be able to jump the queue for a public bed. Deputies will appreciate that it would be very difficult to devise any administrative mechanism to prevent this since the decision as to which patient should be admitted must remain a clinical one.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements, any person who wishes to be a public patient will be entitled to avail of public consultant care.  This will enable us to phase in a requirement that consultants' private patients must use private or semi-private beds if they have been admitted for non-emergency treatment.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements will not lead to any reduction in the number of public beds; there will, therefore, be shorter waiting lists for public patients since private non-emergency patients will no longer be treated in these beds.  The programme also includes a commitment to monitor the operation of the new arrangements to ensure that they are operating fairly.</P>
    <P>The public hospital system will also continue to cater adequately for the private patient.  The Government have made it clear that our public hospitals benefit greatly from having a balanced mix of public and private practice, and that the role of private medicine and of voluntary health insurance will not be diminished.</P>
    <P>If the new arrangements lead to an increased demand for private and semi-private beds in the public hospitals, this demand can be met on a self-funding basis &mdash; it will have no effect on either <Col N="528" /> the number of public beds or the improvements in the position of public patients.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask Deputies to accept that the Government and the other social partners would have had no reason to discuss and agree these new arrangements unless they were specifically designed to increase, rather than reduce the equity of the system.  They address the difficulties with the present arrangements which have been highlighted in the analysis of both the Commission on Health Funding and of NESC both of which recommended a change in eligibility on the lines of that now proposed. They arise from the sincere belief that equity and, in particular, the interests of the public patient, will be best served by ensuring that a guaranteed number of beds are available to public patients and by monitoring the operation of the arrangements to make sure that the public patient gets a fair deal.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me in the light of the discussions with the social partners and the reports of the Commission on Health Funding and NESC that there is a wide measure of support for the course action which the Government now propose to take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is dismaying that, for the first time, the Minister is admitting that the common waiting list concept would not work fairly.  However, would it not be very foolish to throw out the common waiting list idea at this stage given that, at section 2.61 of their report, the Commission on Health Funding recommended that the key need in regard to bringing equity into the system is the establishment of a properly working common waiting list?  Would the Minister not agree that he is being very selective in citing just one aspect of those recommendations and that his statement that there will be more public beds available for public patients is based entirely on an assumption that people will not take up their entitlements?  Is it not the case that that will only happen if the public system is so bad that people will opt not to take up their entitlements?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be brief but the Deputy did ask three or four supplementary questions.  First, this is not the first time I have made the point relating to what the Commission on Health Funding recommended.  They recommended the establishment of a common waiting list but we did not accept it because, as I said, while it looks very good in theory it just would not work in practice.  The commission's recommendation was based on admissions being monitored to ensure that private patients would not be admitted to available beds ahead of public patients.  As I have stated already, it would be almost impossible to do this administratively because the right to decide on which patients should be admitted to hospital must always remain with the consultant who makes the clinical decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a cop out.  The Minister is afraid to take on the consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, if we were to go for the common waiting list it could lead to private practice being taken out of our public hospitals.  As I have often stated in this House, the private-public mix has served the nation very well since the foundation of the State.  It is not new.  It ensures that the very top consultants in their disciplines are available on campus to their public patients when they need them and are not practicing, say, four or five miles away or an hour's drive away, in some private hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my view that there will be more public beds available for public patients as a result of this change and this assumption is well based.  As I stated in the House before, less than 1 per cent of those who subscribe to Voluntary Health Insurance subscribe to avail of category II treatment, as it were.  I see no reason this should change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 84 and 100 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to locate all neurosurgical services in Dublin at Beaumont Hospital was taken on the advice of Comhairle na nOspidéal who comprehensively reviewed these services recently.  Their report followed the widest possible consultations. I therefore considered that the most effective and efficient way in which to establish a centre of excellence was to <Col N="531" /> accept the comhairle's report and Beaumont Hospital was informed of my decision on 28 September 1990.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department have of course been in touch with the hospital on a regular basis regarding the provision of neurosurgical services.</P>
    <P>Beaumont Hospital is proceeding to fill the complement of six consultant neurosurgeon posts as recommened by Comhairle na nOspidéal.  One consultant neurosurgeon has already transferred from St. Vincent's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital has recently advertised two consultant neurosurgeon posts &mdash; one to replace a post formerly located at St. Vincent's Hospital and the other to fill the vacant post with a special interest in paediatric neurosurgery at Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>With regard to complaints referred by the Board of Beaumont Hospital to the Medical Council, these matters have been referred directly to the Medical Council by Beaumont Hospital Board, and my Department have not contacted the Medical Council on the matter.  As the Medical Council are the statutory regulatory authority for the medical profession, I consider that it would be inappropriate for me to interfere in any way with the execution of the council's statutory responsibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister two brief supplementaries?  Would he not agree that it is highly unsatisfactory that the cases which have been referred to the Medical Council have been left hanging around for well over 12 months and that this must prove damaging for the national neurosurgical unit?  Further would he not accept that there is a major gap in the area of paediatric neurosurgery which must be addressed urgently and the way to do this in the short term is to take advantage of the private care which is available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, nobody likes to see cases going before the Medical Council but, as I have pointed out, the Medical Council are the statutory body <Col N="532" /> who deal with complaints in an appropriate manner.  We do not interfere with that statutory function.  As I pointed out in reply to the question on paediatric neurosurgery, the neurosurgeons at Beaumont Hospital performed paediatric neurosurgery until 1986 and assured me that they were competent to continue to do so.  As I said, we advertised again on 24 February for another neurosurgeon with a specific interest in paediatrics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the continuing dispute about medical practice in the hospital calls into question the Minister's assurances to the House that we have a satisfactory service?  Why has he let it drag on for so long before making an attempt to resolve the issue?</P>

      <P>As I have pointed out to the Deputy, this is a matter for the Beaumont Hospital board and the Medical Council.  I see Deputy Bruton's colleague, Deputy Cosgrave, who is a member of the Beaumont Hospital Board sitting behind him and I am sure he will bear me out when I say that they are providing an excellent service in Beaumont Hospital.</P>

      <P>The statistical information sought by the Deputy is set out in the tabular statement which I am circulating in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1970 Health Act, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  While annual income is of obvious relevance, other factors such as family size, capital available and so on must also be taken into account.  Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility but these guidelines are not statutorily binding and, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be <Col N="534" /> awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer feels that this is necessary in the light of the individual's circumstances.</P>
    <P>In view of the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers to issue medical cards, I am satisfied that no one is denied essential health services due to inability to pay.</P>
    <P>I have already announced that a statutory medical card appeals system is being introduced.  When this system is in place any person who feels aggrieved in relation to a decision not to grant a medical card can have the problem addressed under the appeals procedures.  Regulations are also being made to provide that a person who would otherwise be eligible for a medical card cannot lose this entitlement solely as a result of availing of the family income supplement and the social employment scheme.</P>

      <P>Why could the Minister not take the trouble in replying to the question to give the number of people who have full eligibility for health services given that such figures are being given out at different centres?  I contend the figure is now below 35 per cent of the national average, whereas in 1987 it was 37.8 per cent?  In my health board area it was 37.27 per cent in 1987 and is now down to about 33 per cent.  Why is the Minister not giving this information in reply to my question?  Will he consider having eligibility assessed on the basis of net income?

      <P>There is a wide variation from one part of the country to another.  In Dublin 22 per cent of the population have medical cards, while the figure in Donegal is 62 per cent.  That is understandable, having regard to the income of people in various counties. Regarding Deputy O'Keeffe's point, an independent medical card appeals system will shortly be in place which will allow an aggrieved person to have a case examined. A medical card will be allocated if that person is entitled to it.  There has been a reduction in the percentage covered by medical cards between 1988 and 1989.</P>

(7) Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan &mdash; the closure of Rathduff cheese factory with the loss of 80 jobs and the effect this closure will have on the community; (8) Deputy Pat McCartan &mdash; the restoration of walkie talkie radios to mobile patrol members of an Garda Síochána while on duty in the Dublin area; (9) Deputy Eric Byrne &mdash; the need for a new dental teaching hospital in Dublin; (10) Deputy Pat Rabbitte &mdash; the serious crisis facing voluntary and community projects which are operating social employment schemes because of the uncertainty over the ability of these important and worthwhile schemes to continue, due to the failure of FÁS to allow any new recruitment or to give any commitment to renew existing schemes; (11) Deputy Eamon Gilmore &mdash; the problem of the rising number of incidences of crime in the Dún Laoghaire constituency; (12) Deputy Proinsias De Rossa &mdash; the failure of the Minister for the Environment to carry out an environmental impact survey, on the effects on the people of Collins Avenue/Ballymun/ Glasnevin areas of Dublin, of the Sillogue interchange on the northern cross route, Dublin; (13) Deputy Seán Ryan &mdash; the new formula being used by <Col N="643" /> the valuation office in assessing the rateable valuation of properties, which is having such a devastating effect on businesses in Swords, and which will be introduced nationwide and (14) Deputy Roger Garland &mdash; the continued delay of the Minister for Education in publishing the report on Dublin Zoo which is now nearly a year overdue.</P>

The urgent matter requiring immediate discussion is the failure of the Government to set out clearly their foreign policy objectives on European political union and in particular on common foreign security and defence policies, and the urgent need of the Government now to do so in the light of the statement last night by Mr. Jacques Delors, President of the EC Commission, that a decision will have to be made this year on political unity, &ldquo;including a common foreign policy and military co-operation leading before 1995 to multilateral forces and a joint rapid deployment force&rdquo;; and whether Ireland supports this approach, and if not, Government policy on the issue.</P>

      <P>On the proposal to apply a guillotine to the Committee Stage of No. 10 at 9.30 p.m., while it may well be that the Committee Stage will be concluded by that time, I believe the Bill is so important that it is not correct to apply a guillotine to it.  Of more serious concern is the proposal to take the Report Stage tomorrow, which will leave Deputies with very little time to consider what amendments may, in fact, be submitted. I ask if the Taoiseach would indicate that the taking of Report Stage could be delayed for a couple of days in order to enable the parties in opposition to consider whatever Report Stage amendments are proposed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;All employees of Siúicre Eireann c.p.t. and its subsidiaries shall become members of the staff of the Holding company upon the transfer of <Col N="653" /> undertaking from Siúicre Éireann c.p.t. to the Holding Company.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendment No. 28 I have posed two questions to the Minister.  One was in regard to the inadequacy of the pension fund the proposed for the employees of the Sugar Company and the situation of that fund in the new company.  There was some doubt as to the size of the deficit. the Minister was making arrangements for £4.3 million to be included in the new company's funds to meet some of the inadequacies of the fund and the remainder, something like £5.7 million, would be paid into the fund over a period of five years.</P>
      <P>The question I put to the Minister was: what exactly was the extent of the deficit in the pension fund and were the arrangements being made adequate?  I had also asked whether workers of a new company, under new direction and administration over the period of five years, could be assured that the fund to which they had contributed always would be adequate over that same period.  On the assumption that the company are privatised I was endeavouring to establish that there will always be sufficient funds within the company for that purpose over that five-year period.</P>
      <P>My second question is in relation to the arrangements for redundancy payments to employees of the company &mdash; during the period of establishment of the new company and thereafter &mdash; whether the arrangements which had applied since 1981 would continue in the ensuing period and form part of an agreement being made between the unions, the company and the Minister to be filed with the Labour Court.  I gave an example of something like five weeks salary for every year of service, plus statutory redundancy. I sought confirmation that those, the best redundancy terms in the period since 1981, would continue to apply.</P>
      <P>In the course of his introductory remarks on Second Stage the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> However, in order to reassure workers on this point I intend moving, on Committee Stage, an amendment underlying the rights of employees. This will specifically provide that the rights which employees of Siúicre Éireann, or its subsidiaries, hold before the date on which the Minister for Finance transfers his shares in Siúicre Éireann to the new holding company will consider to be held by them on and from that transfer date.</P>
    <P>We are endeavouring to assure this House, and more importantly workers in the industry, that the arrangements in place before the transfer will remain and, as the Minister said, be lodged as part of an agreement to be drawn up between the company, the Minister and the employees representatives, Congress, with the Labour Court.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Would the Minister confirm that the meeting which took place on the last occasion we discussed this Bill &mdash; that between the unions and the company &mdash; agreed terms of redundancy payments acceptable to both sides?  If such is the case will he confirm that everybody is happy with those arrangements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two points I want to raise.  My amendment No. 12 reads:</P>
      <P>Each employee on being transferred to the Holding Company shall hold his/her office or employment on the same terms and under the same conditions as applied to his/her contract of employment immediately prior to the transfer and while in the service of the Holding Company the said terms and conditions shall not be less favourable to him/her than those prevailing immediately prior to the transfer save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with the trade unions or staff associations representing such employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister confirm that acceptance of that amendment will ensure <Col N="655" /> absolutely that the conditions applying at present to company employees will apply after the transfer?  For instance, there is a reference in the document from which the Minister quoted in the matter of redundancy terms that the current redundancy terms being paid by the company are those which emanated from the 1981 conciliation conference; that the company acknowledge that that is the correct position and have no plans to change those terms.  In this respect I contend it is not good enough for the company to say that they have no plans to change those terms particularly bearing in mind the haste with which it is proposed to enact this Bill &mdash; by the end of this week &mdash; when the Irish Sugar Company will be no more.  After all, if we repeal the legislation that set up the company then how can the company have any say in such matters as redundancy payments?  I view that as a most important issue for the employees and submit that it could be dealt with adequately by acceptance of my amendment No. 12.  I should like to revert later to the question of pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sherlock says he would like to intervene later on the question of pensions.  I have been asked to clarify the matter of the pensions.  Perhaps, if Deputy Sherlock made his point in this regard I could deal with all together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I have several points to make in that regard.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to clarify the very strange position &mdash; as I see it &mdash; in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, would the Minister say by what actuarial appraisal the figure of £10 million was arrived at?  I was a member of the committee that negotiated the 1984 pension scheme which provided for the dissolution of the then existing sugar industry workers gratuity and pension scheme &mdash; from which members were being paid a pension &mdash; which, under the deed and rules, was transferred to the 1984 pension scheme.  After some time a <Col N="656" /> report was submitted to the members of the scheme which stated that the scheme had commenced on 18 December 1984 on the dissolution of the Sugar Industry Workers Gratuities Society and the transfer of its assets to the scheme.  The trustees of the scheme are named in this document &mdash; dated 1 March 1988 &mdash; as is the actuary.  It states that the actuary recommended that the company contribute 12.5 per cent of members pensionable earnings to the scheme.  Further, it is stated that that amount has been contributed by the company since that date.  It is further stated that membership of the scheme stood at 919 on 31 March 1986 with 86 pensioner members and that members in service should contribute to the scheme at the rate of 3 per cent per annum.  The investment funds of the scheme are managed by Allied Irish Investment Bank, the secretary being located at an address at St. Stephen's Green House, Dublin 2, the auditors being Coopers and Lybrand, Fitzwilton House, Dublin 2.  Those terms were submitted to the employees.</P>
    <P>There was no reference whatsoever at any time to any deficit in any of the documents supplied.  In fact, it was shown in the accounts for the period from 18 December, 1984 to 31 March 1986 that company contributions amounted to £1,644,370, members contributions to £409,614, with investment income amounting to £479,057, contributions in respect of transfer from pension reserve amounting to £822,817 and contributions in respect of pension augmentation costs amounting to £664,853 with sundry income of £11,881.  Between all that and the expenses, which were the payments of pensions, gratuities, refunds and so forth, the excess income over expenditure was £3,133,790.  Investments transferred from the Sugar Industry Workers Gratuities Society was £1,880,177 and cash transferred from SIWGS was £103,000, leaving, £4,324,990 in that fund.  On 1 March 1988 the annual contribution of the company was £1,333,000 and the Members contributed £331,000; the number of active members was 821 and the pension payroll per annum was <Col N="657" /> £562,000; the number of pensioners was reduced; the book value of the scheme was £7,637,899 and the market value of the fund at 31 December 1987 was £7,936,830.</P>
    <P>In 1989 the book value of the fund was £10,030,831 and the market value was £11,429,000.  Again there was a reduction in the numbers on the payroll because of what happened in Thurles.  Up to 27 March 1990 the contribution from the company was £351,000 and the members contributed £87,000.  At 24 March 1990 the book value of the fund was £11,528,000 and the market value was £13,300,000.  There was no reference anywhere to any deficit.  I make this point because this was debated annually by the members' representatives of the Irish Transport and General workers' Union, now SIPTU, of which I am a member.  I have no doubt that the investments are very wisely made and that the interest accruing is reflected in the increased amount in that fund over the period.</P>
    <P>A figure was mentioned in correspondence between the company and SIPTU.  It was said that in relation to the shortfall in the present funding, the management position was that the proposed company flotation would make sufficient funds available to cover the £4.57 million required for the pre-1984 service. Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point and the fact that the remaining £5.3 million would be transferred.  The Minister gave the figure as £4.7 million and the balance as £3.5 million over a period of five years.  The main point on which I want to elicit information is why, over the years, there was no reference to that deficit.  I should like to say, loud and clear, that the company that withheld that £10 million was absolutely wrong because the members' contributions were put into the fund and we can see that the money that was there in 1984 was transferred.  If the amount now stated to be outstanding had been transferred, one can see what a difference that would have made to the investment and the benefits accruing.</P>
    <P>There are many questions to be clarified but I will leave it at that for the <Col N="658" /> present.  Having given those figures I hope the Minister will get an up to date actuary's report to give us the exact details of the pension scheme.  In his reply, perhaps the Minister would tell us whether the Pension Act, 1990, applies. I do not say that Act has been breached in any way, but it will certainly apply to the pensions scheme for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to report that since we last met agreement has been registered between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the company and the Labour Relations Commission, which I had indicated was the intention. The agreement covers all the points dealt with.  I have a copy of the agreement from the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission in which he indicated that following a series of conciliation conferences the parties have agreed to recommend the agreement and both parties also agreed to advise the Minister for Agriculture and Food of this agreement.  I hope Deputy Sherlock takes note of the fact that both parties have reached agreement, have registered it with the Labour Relations Commission and have undertaken to make me aware of the agreement and the terms of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because Deputy Browne and Deputy Kavanagh have raised this issue it would be helpful if I indicated the terms of the agreement that has been entered into and registered, and then I will deal with some of the other points that follow from this agreement.  It was on this basis that the company and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions entered into the agreement: there will be no interruption in continuity of employment.  Current rates of pay and conditions of employment will continue to apply.  The company will continue to recognise the existing trade unions. Existing procedures for determining rates of pay and conditions of employment will continue to apply.  The current redundancy terms being paid by the company are those which emanated from the 1981 conciliation conference.  The company acknowledge that this is the current position and they have no plans to change these terms.  The restructuring will not <Col N="659" /> give rise to changes in continuity of employment in subsidiary companies or to existing procedures for determining rates of pay and conditions of employment in those companies.  Finally, within 30 days of vesting date, moneys will be transferred into the manual pension scheme to cover pre-1984 pensions, as determined by the scheme's actuary.  Pre-1984 service in the manual scheme will be funded on a phased basis over a five-year period from 1991 in accordance with the advice of the scheme's actuary.  This agreement will be registered with the Labour Court under section 27 of the 1946 Industrial Relations Act and both parties formally agreed to lodge a copy of this agreement with the Labour Relations Commission and to request the commission to consider itself the guardian of the agreement &mdash; the parties are the labour relations committee, the Irish Sugar Company and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>I hope that will confirm to the House that the discussions we indicated were taking place, and which I had promoted, have now taken place and that those issues have been concluded satisfactorily from the point of view of both the company and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is quite clear from the company accounts of 1990 &mdash; I presume Deputy Sherlock will have had an opportunity to see the January report and accounts of 1990 &mdash; that the group operate two separately externally funded pension schemes for their employees.  These funds were last assessed by independent actuaries on 31 March 1990 and 31 March 1989.</P>
    <P>In the light of what I have said already, I want to give the lie to any suggestion by Deputy Sherlock that there is any deficit or under-funding in these pension schemes.  The company have provided in their accounts for the necessary funding for the pre-1984 pension schemes.  This provision was made in the company's accounts and there was effectively no deficit.  I hope Deputy Sherlock will not try to imply that there is some deficit when one does not exist, and particularly <Col N="660" /> when the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the supreme body representing the interests of the workers, have made no such implication.  The company who hold these funds did not pay them to the pension schemes at that time as they regarded them as part of an internally operated scheme.  I want to make it clear that there never was a deficit.  The company held the necessary funds and made provision for interest on them.  As will be evident, the position changed in 1984 when an externally operated scheme was brought in.  That is the first point I want to make clear.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I undertook the last day to deal again in detail with the points raised in regard to the pension scheme and redundancies.  With regard to the pension scheme, I can confirm &mdash; the unions are aware of this and have agreed to it &mdash; the Sugar Company have now agreed to provide £4.7 million within 30 days of the transfer of shares to the new holding company and to fund the balance of £5.3 million over a five year period from 1991. In addition, the Minister for Finance will confirm this agreement in writing to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>The current redundancy terms being paid by the Sugar Company are those which emanated from the 1981 conciliation conferences.  They range from three and a half to five weeks pay per year of reckonable service, depending on pension entitlements.  Statutory redundancy payments are, of course, paid in accordance with the Redundancy Payments Act and are an addition to the above mentioned.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated many times during the course of discussions on earlier Stages of this legislation, the details of any pension fund or redundancy scheme are not matters for legislation: they are essentially matters for the unions and the company on which to reach agreement. That agreement has been reached and concluded and registered with the Labour Relations Commission.  I hope the information I have conveyed to the House &mdash; I do not think there are any other questions Deputies can raise on this issue &mdash; indicates that this matter has been <Col N="661" /> resolved satisfactorily.  Any implication that it has not been would be a reflection not just on the company but also on the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, an implication I would find unacceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the information I sought from the Minister. Therefore, I can only conclude he has very little information to give me.  I asked the Minister why it is necessary to put £10 million into the pension scheme, as has been agreed by the company &mdash; an initial payment of £4.7 million and £5.3 million to be paid over a five year period. Why is it necessary to put that money into the pension fund if the company contributed to the fund since 1984 which, according to the auditors and actuaries, they did?  Where does the figure of £10 million come from?  Why was it not put into the fund by the company at an earlier date?  Can the Minister say if that £10 million will be added to the present £13 million book value of the scheme?</P>
      <P>Irrespective of what the Irish Congress of Trade Unions may think, the reason I am making this case is because I know what I am talking about.  Even if the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have done a U-turn on the issue of the privatisation of the Irish Sugar Company, The Workers' Party will certainly not do so.  This is exactly what has happened.  The document to which the Minister referred is not worth the paper it is written on.  If we are going to repeal the Act which set up the company, how can the company give any guarantees to workers under that document, no matter where it is lodged or by who it is signed?  Workers want these guarantees to be written into legislation, they want their rights to be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why was no reference made to Statutory Instrument 306 of 1980, the instrument which governs the takeover of companies, protects workers' rights and so forth?  Even though I concede I have not studied this instrument very well, I do not think drawing up a document which will be handed to the new holding company will adequately protect the rights or contract of employment an <Col N="662" /> individual employee will have with that company.  Each employee will have a new contract of employment with the holding company, Greencore.  My amendment No. 12 would protect the rights of employees.</P>
    <P>I conclude by asking the Minister, who represents the Government, to present to me before the debate concludes tomorrow an actuary's report of the amount of the deficit &mdash; if the fund was set up in 1984 and it is necessary to put in £10 million now &mdash; there has to be a deficit.  The figures given by the auditors or actuaries in earlier times must have just been figures on paper and the actual money must not have been put into the fund.  Is that what happened?  Will the Minister present an up-to-date actuary's report to us before the legislation is enacted?</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister is now in possession of more facts than he had last Wednesday when we discussed this section and my amendment and that he can give us the terms of the redundancy scheme which will be included in this agreement which he said will be lodged with the Labour Relations Commission.</P>

      <P>It is evident that there is great urgency about the privatisation of this company.  Our Whip had argued for a longer Report Stage tomorrow so that not only would we have an opportunity to check out the facts of the agreement with the unions but so that we could also ascertain whether the workers were fully aware of what has been agreed on their behalf.  Having listened to Deputy Sherlock, I think I have more respect for my colleagues in the trade union movement. If he thinks about it, I am sure the Deputy will accept that this Bill will be passed by the House tomorrow because of the number supporting it.  These people, too, obviously want to see as many guarantees as possible established in the Labour Court.  However, as a member of a previous Government I know that such guarantees sometimes, unfortunately, are not <Col N="663" /> enough.  In 1983 when An Post were set up as a semi-State company we were aware of the legislation covering workers' rights in that case.  What has happened in the last week gives me the impression that the unilateral action taken by the board of An Post is totally in breach of the 1983 Act, under which An Post were set up.  I deplore that.  The Minister should accept that even the unions cannot ensure that something is watertight and that on occasion even semi-State companies go back on what has been agreed in legislation.  In taking account of our concern for workers' rights the Minister should understand that at the end of the day the legislation put through this House is the only guarantee people can fall back on.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's assurances that an agreement has been reached and that his amendment goes some way towards guaranteeing workers' rights.  Obviously I am just as concerned as Deputy Sherlock to ensure that all these issues are tied up when we are discussing this Bill. Some progress has been made since we discussed the Bill last Wednesday.  I was not convinced then with the Minister's replies nor by the document he read out then &mdash; I am glad the Minister has laid down what the redundancy terms will be for current members of Siúicre Éireann.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the pension scheme which the Minister for Finance will confirm &mdash; it is very important that he, as well as the Minister for Agriculture and Food, confirms it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As Deputy Sherlock has worked in this industry and has a lot of contacts in that area, his concerns should be taken into account.  My concern is that this Bill will have gone through all Stages by Thursday morning and we want to be satisfied that we have done our job as best we can for the people who have given their services to this company and made it a success, <Col N="664" /> people who have worked in the company when it was not as attractive as it is now. The company is now so attractive to the private sector that they are very anxious to get their hands on part of it in the immediate future.  As I have said, we accept that agreement has been reached with the unions.  I have not spoken to anybody in Congress since last week but I accept the assurances of the Minister that since last Wednesday the concerns we expressed here have been discussed and that agreement has been arrived at. That is a long way from the position we were in just under a week ago.  As I have said, Deputy Sherlock is more familiar than many of us with the position in the company.  He has expressed very genuine concerns and they should be taken into account.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> All of us here are concerned for the workers of this company as well as for the beet producers.  On Second Stage we emphasised the importance of looking after the workers.  In using the phrase &ldquo;fools rush in where angels fear to tread&rdquo; I do not wish to cast aspersions on anyone.  I find it consoling that SIPTU can spend a very tough afternoon drawing up regulations. They were in the process of doing so the last day we discussed this Bill.  I know some of these people personally and they are as tough as nails.  I would have no concern regarding the workers in the company if this proposal has been accepted by their union negotiators.  I know it is very easy to predict doom and gloom.  Hanrahan predicted many years ago that we would all be ruined &mdash; that was long before privatisation was introduced. I do not know if it does any good to talk about all the things that might happen.  Nobody knows what is going to happen.  Under EC regulations, perhaps the sugar industry will be closed down worldwide and we will use some other product instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy that the proposal in question has been accepted by the Labour Relations Commission.  I raised a question the last day as to whether that could be withdrawn, but I am happy that the <Col N="665" /> unions are satisfied because they are dealing with this matter directly.  I accept that it is something everybody concerned is apprehensive about but I am happy at this stage that the workers are being looked after.</P>

I gave the information to the House as I then had it, but I made it quite clear that it would be a matter for Congress and for the company at all times.  I have now conveyed to the House that an agreement was reached after we concluded here, and I received a copy of that agreement, on either Thursday or Friday, from the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission.  I have read to the House the terms of the agreement which was signed on behalf of the commission, the Irish Sugar Company and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy Sherlock make an unwarranted attack on the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and I did not interrupt him at that point.  The least I owe to Congress, as partners in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> and indeed to the workers on whose behalf they negotiated is to totally and utterly condemn the attack made by The Workers' Party on Congress.  It has been very clear from the beginning of this debate that The Workers' Party would not accept what we are trying to do, through the democratic process in the House, to create a framework for agreement between the unions and the company. The Workers' Party will never accept an agreement made through the democratic process between the company and the unions to an established procedure registered in the Labour Court.  They are subject to the democratic will of the people and to the proper procedures established between unions and companies.  No Member of the House &mdash; apart from The Workers' Party &mdash; is prepared to say that, while it may be a democratic process and an agreement between workers, trade unions and companies and registered with the Labour Court, they will not accept it.  The Workers' Party acceptance or rejection in the face of that is not a matter of any consequence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sherlock is now going on a different tack but I will not be drawn because I gave many indications the last day we debated this matter &mdash; and again today &mdash; as to why the details of pensions, redundancies and so on between any group of workers and an employer are not an issue to be put into legislation.  I appreciate what Deputy Kavanagh said, although I do not think he intended every single detail to be registered. However, I accept that on occasions it is important to give the maximum strongest framework for agreements entered into.  I cannot recall the event to which Deputy Kavanagh referred when he was Minister for Labour in 1983 or 1984 but, perhaps as a result of lessons learned from that time, what is now being done is being put in the most solemn possible form, registered as an agreement between them in the Labour Relations Commission and, by agreement between them, formally notified to me as Minister for Agriculture and Food on behalf of the Government, at their request.  Deputy Sherlock should look at the agreements and at the accounts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In that case, he should have seen the funding arrangements and the provisions made by the company in that regard.  If he is not interested enough to read it, that is his problem.  An additional guarantee &mdash; if such were required &mdash; by the Minister for Finance will be forthcoming.  It is reprehensible for a party in this House to try to create the impression that they alone are concerned for the rights of the workers and that they can protect them when the very opposite is the case.  Since the debate started, The Workers' Party have tried to create worry, anxiety, distrust and doubt, not in the interest of the workers but to serve their own petty political means.</P>

      <P>I wish to remind the Minister that last week I sat with 100 ordinary general workers in Mallow Sugar Factory.  I am a SIPTU representative in Mallow and it was from those people I took my brief in regard to this matter.  The Workers' Party are opposed to selling the Irish Sugar Company when it is now profitable.

      <P>The Minister has failed to tell this House where the deficit about which the company talked has arisen.  He also failed to state that he will bring in an actuary's report to show the true figures; he failed to say whether the £10 million will be added to the £13 million value of the pension scheme.  Those are issues of major concern.  When talking about the rights of the workers, one must be further concerned that these issues are not written into the legislation.  I contend &mdash; although I am not legally qualified &mdash; that when we repeal the Sugar Manufacturing Act, 1933, which was amended by the Sugar Manufacturing (Amendment) Act, 1973, any agreement made by the company is not worth the paper on which it is written because the company would then become a subsidiary of the holding company just in the same way as the Ballybeg Limeworks or others are subsidiaries of the Sugar Company at present.  The workers demand to have these issues written into legislation as requested in amendment No. 12.  Instead of trying to lecture me, will the Minister please answer the questions?</P>

I have the greatest admiration for them and we have a worker-director from that factory on the board of the Sugar Company.  There is no great anxiety on the part of the workers of Mallow because the assurances given by the Minister in his Second Stage speech and again on Committee Stage up to now <Col N="669" /> are quite acceptable.  My colleague in the constituency, Deputy Sherlock, is mischievous in attacking the Congress of Trade Unions; it is proof of where he stands.  I am well aware of the balance sheet and the annual report; indeed, Deputy Sherlock is obviously questioning the auditor's report, a statutory signed document.  In page 46 of the annual report there is a report by the independent actuaries.  If Deputy Sherlock has any further difficulty in this regard, I am sure the report is available in the Library.  I was taken aback by Deputy Sherlock's attack because I have no doubt that the party which I and the Minister represent are fully committed to supporting the workers and seeing that their pension rights are upgraded.  I visit Mallow on a regular basis and I do not hear the same things as Deputy Sherlock. Perhaps he would like to see Cuban sugar in the country.</P>

All the other guarantees which I have given on the basis of the agreement between the unions and the workers are also contained in the report.  The matter has been satisfactorily concluded, with one exception, Deputy Sherlock and The Workers' Party have made an unfounded, unwarranted attack on the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and I will not regard this business as concluded in the House until The Workers' Party withdraw that unfounded allegation and apologise for it.  They should also indicate to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that it was an unwarranted attack.  I hope Deputy Sherlock has the grace to do that.</P>

I am anxious to know that the document that has been <Col N="670" /> lodged with the Labour Relations Commission is adequate and watertight and, therefore, I want to question the Minister in one respect on this.  Subsection (2) of his amendment provides that, &ldquo;Company includes any subsidiary of the Company&rdquo;. When the Minister is talking about the company, is he talking about the Sugar Company, Greencore or something else? Not everybody who is in Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann will necessarily go into the new Greencore company.  Persons could be allocated to subsidiary companies.

      <P>I am glad to confirm to Deputy Kavanagh, who reasonably and understandably asks for confirmation of that point, that that is the case.  It would apply to the existing Sugar Company, to subsidiaries and any subsidiaries of Greencore that are established.  It is clear from the legislation that these terms relate to the existing Sugar Company and the funding from pension and other points of view has been totally and utterly confirmed so that the subsidiaries are covered by it.</P>

      <P>That is the document on which the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have deliberated and decided must be the bottom line for the Bill which is being enacted.  I want to quote from page 3 what is required or requested by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and I challenge the Minister to say why he has not accepted that if he has so much regard for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. It states that each employee on being transferred to the holding company shall hold his or her office or employment on the same terms and under the same conditions as applied to his or her contract of employment immediately prior to the transfer, and while in the service of the holding company the said terms and conditions shall not be less favourable to him or her than those prevailing immediately prior to the transfer save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated between the trade unions or staff associations representing such employee.</P>
      <P>I challenge the Minister to tell the House why he has not accepted that, which appears to be very reasonable to put into legislation rather than to rescind this document with its points 1, 2, 3 and 4 and say the agreement is registered. The point I made was that the Irish Sugar Company would be merely a subsidiary of the new holding company and, consequently, any agreement they would have made would be null and void.  The basic bottom line for the workers employed in the Irish sugar industry is to have built into that legislation what I submit is that reasonable demand by the ICTU on behalf of the workers.  I challenge the Minister to state why he does not accept it as an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can accept that challenge not only willingly but enthusiastically but I accept it on the basis that <Col N="672" /> Deputy Sherlock is now indulging in what has been the stock in trade of his party and their origins and associates, namely the big lie, and he challenges me to reply to the big lie, which I have no trouble in doing.  First, he said what is on the record here, this agreement between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the company, and I quote: &ldquo;was not worth the paper it was written on&rdquo;.  I think that is an outrageous assertion and I still tell him that if he had any sense of honesty, integrity and fair play he would withdraw it and apologise for it.  I quote him again: &ldquo;Any agreement of this nature would be null and void&rdquo;.  That is an outrageous falsehood and should not be allowed to stay on the record here unless The Workers' Party want to have it recognised &mdash; and maybe it is time the Irish people knew exactly the kind of thing The Workers' Party want to have it recognised &mdash; that the big lie is more appropriate to their approach than the facts and the truth.  I want to tell him it is not null and void.  It covers a subsidiary company and the Sugar Company and it is a binding agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want at this stage to make one other comment.  The Deputy who, as I have indicated, is fairly practised in the big lie, was reading from a document a little while ago without indicating to us exactly the date of that document and he was purporting to convey to this House the impression that this was an up-to-date document he had received from Congress. He should at least have the honesty to say that document was circulated before this debate took place in this House, that long after that document was circulated a whole range of discussions took place between officials of my Department and the ICTU and representatives of the Beet Growers' Association but I can also say between the Minister for Labour, myself, the Congress and SIPTU and, as a consequence of those discussions, because we recognise that the workers' interests here are of primary, fundamental importance, I introduced in this House amendments which incorporate almost all the points made <Col N="673" /> and the others are recorded in the agreement I have just registered.  For what it is worth, I would also remind the Deputy who likes to indulge in the big lie that there are not just four points in this agreement; there are six and each one is equally important.  As to points that may not be in the agreement, they are covered in the amendments I have introduced here.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this debate is over.  Far from it, but at this point on the issue we have been dealing with I would like to express my appreciation to other Deputies in this House who have asked questions and who asked for clarification and when they got it they were honourable enough to accept it.  I say to them that I hoped when we started this Bill that was the way we would approach it and perhaps we could improve the guarantees for workers.  We have done that.  However, it is regrettable there is one exception, one party who have taken a totally different view, but the Irish people will not be surprised at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not surprising. Let me say the document I quoted from had the reference 2038, 28 January 1991 and was addressed to Mr. Michael O'Kennedy, T.D., Minister for Agriculture and Food, Department of Agriculture and Food, Kildare Street, Dublin 2, and I took the paragraph which I thought the most relevant.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a further point.  The Minister is smiling&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I can see plainly also that he is very worried.  This is the point I want to make, to prove beyond a shadow of doubt that what I am saying is correct.  In 1981 the ITGWU negotiated a redundancy package for the Irish Sugar <Col N="674" /> Company.  That applied from the early eighties until the company said in 1986 that no such agreement existed.  The matter went to conciliation at a time when the company were pleading inability to pay the terms of that agreement. The conciliation officer recommended that both parties should go back again and iron out the difficulties.  The company could not, of course, unilaterally withdraw from the agreement.</P>
      <P>This document says that the redundancy terms being paid by the company are those which emanated from the 1981 conciliation conference and that the company acknowledges that this is the current position and that they have no plans to change those terms.  The difference is that the union which represents the vast majority of the workforce in the Irish Sugar Company, SIPTU formerly the ITGWU, contended that what they had negotiated was an agreement but the company refuse to acknowledge that there is an agreement.  The difference relates to terms as distinct from an agreement. The terms are there but the question is whether there is an agreement.  If there is an agreement and the agreement is embodied in new legislation, the workers would be reasonably happy that their rights are protected.</P>
      <P>The workers are seeking to have that redundancy agreement retained because over the years they saw what happened to their colleagues in Midleton, East Cork Foods, Erin Foods and in Thurles and Tuam.  They do not know what the future holds for them.  There will be a new company and there are many question marks. Consequently in this debate on redundancy, what is demanded is recognition of the redundancy agreement, and that is where I differ from the Minister.  If the Minister would consider introducing an amendment to cover that point I would accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's amendment is very weak indeed and has little to do with what is being sought by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The amendment says that &ldquo;Every person who immediately before the transfer date was an employee of the Company, shall, on the transfer <Col N="675" /> date enjoy the same rights (including rights under a pension or superannuation scheme of the Company) and be subject to the same obligations....&rdquo;.  It is a different thing to put in an amendment which says according to the trade union demand that each employee on transfer shall hold his office of employment on the same terms and under the same conditions as apply to those prevailing immediately prior to the transfer.  There is a difference, a vast difference, there.  If the Minister is sincere about what he wants to do in the interests of the workers, he should accept that amendment.</P>

      <P>On Wednesday last when we discussed this, it was said the terms and conditions that were being lodged with the Labour Relations Commission were defective in two areas, the redundancy terms and the pension scheme.  The Minister said he has had discussions with congress and with members of SIPTU, and that these points have been clarified.  I accept that that has happened and that the new agreement has been lodged.</P>
      <P>The Minister also cleared a major point about which I was concerned, that is, that these terms would apply to any subsidiary set up when the new company is set up. If I find in the course of the next few hours or the next few days that that is not the position, I will resubmit the amendments I have tabled here.  I am just clarifying that in case the Minister or anybody else views my silence in the last few minutes as being anything other than an agreement with The Workers' Party on this.  I have tried to achieve what the representatives of the trade union movement have been trying to achieve, and since last week the Minister has moved as close to my view in these areas as I can get him to move.  I accept what the Minister has done and I withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>All I have done is to record specifically in the House the formal agreement that has been entered into because I felt the House was entitled to know that fact, although it was not a condition of the agreement that it would be made known to the House.  The parties to the agreement left that to my discretion.  They made it clear that they agreed to advise the Minister for Agriculture and Food of the agreement and I, in my capacity as Minister, have advised the House.  I confidently expect that Deputy Kavanagh will not find occasion to come back with his amendments to change an interpretation because I have not given an interpretation. I have quoted a document.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been prompted to stick my nose into this debate because I happened to pass a monitor and hear the Minister's indignant tones rising again and challenging the right of Deputy Sherlock and my party to press this amendment. That was extraordinary.  The House should not be allowed at any stage to forget the scale and significance of the legislation we are passing here.  The precedent it sets, the implications for commercial State companies and their workers generally, and specifically the implications for Sugar Company workers, are great.  With all due respects to the Minister, my colleague Deputy Sherlock is closer to or at least as close as the Minister, to Irish Sugar Company workers and he knows a great deal more from his practical experience than the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock's amendment is inspired by the decision taken up by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and it is perfectly legitimate that he should continue to press that amendment without his motives and the motives of my party being called into question.  As anyone can confirm, in a post-privatisation situation the workers concerned will or could get scant hearing in such changed circumstances. There have been plenty of examples of that in the UK where a whole new <Col N="677" /> régime applies and the workers conditions are no better than the union that represents them, or that they are capable of reinforcing in that new situation.</P>
    <P>Therefore it makes good sense for Deputy Sherlock to seek to have enshrined in this Bill the terms of amendment No. 12 in his name which does no more than that.  Quite frankly, I resent enormously the imputation that my party are not arguing a legitimate position here.  I am not asking the Minister to agree with it, and I accept that, in parliamentary terms he is perfectly entitled to take up a different point of view.  Nor do I mind Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, who had an eminent record of support for the trade union movement locally when an employer, coming into the House to advance his position or challenge his reason for doing so which the Minister appears to be doing.  He sent his party Whip whinging to a Whips meeting where he argued that The Workers' Party are filibustering the legislation.  We are not filibustering it.  It is an important measure and, as the Minister has said, it is the first measure on which we are being asked to make this kind of decision in respect of a major company with the possible exception of the debate on Irish Life.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between the amendment that Deputy Sherlock has advanced, No. 12, and the Minister's amendment, No. 27, which has been considerably watered down.  This is not my own brief and I am sorry I did not have the opportunity to check this but on the question of the agreement with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions I do know that representations were made to me by my members of my own union &mdash; I am quite sure that this is what Deputy Sherlock was talking about &mdash; concerning their fears for the future.  I would ask the Minister, if he has decided to sell off the family silver, to at least appreciate the real concerns of workers about their future and to ensure that their rights and entitlements are not diminished in any fashion. It is perfectly reasonable for any group of trade unionists to want to do this and that is all that Deputy Sherlock is seeking <Col N="678" /> to do here.  We are not seeking to filibuster. It is a legitimate point of view and if the Minister is not accustomed to meeting it in this House he had better get accustomed to it.</P>

It is for that reason that I along with my colleague, the Minister for Labour, and my officials have for some considerable time, for weeks and months on end, been in constant and regular contact with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Deputy Rabbitte said that I should not be so sensitive with regard to what has been said by Deputy Sherlock because he too has a right to come into the House to say what he wants to say.  I agree but when I remind Deputy Rabbitte of what Deputy Sherlock said I wonder will he still want to be associated fully and vigorously with what his colleague in The Workers' Party has said about the agreement entered into by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on behalf of workers in the trade union movement. He said that this agreement is null and void and, to quote him, &ldquo;is not worth the paper it is written on&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It would be illuminating in more ways than one &mdash; indeed not too long before 1982 either.  In reply to the question he put to me, his problem is, unlike Deputy Sherlock and myself, he has no knowledge of the trade union movement.  To be posing, along with Deputy O'Keeffe, as a friend of the trade union movement is laughable and does not fool me for a moment.  What Deputy Sherlock is trying to give effect to here is the original amendment argued by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is true that the Minister's amendment goes some way towards achieving the objectives of that amendment but the problem is &mdash; and this is what Deputy Sherlock has identified &mdash; what will happen when the Sugar Company as we know it is no more. The Minister knows very well that words exchanged across the floor of this House between himself and Deputy Sherlock will have no effect once the Bill is enacted.  The terms of this legislation will be interpreted and the Minister's intentions will count for nothing.  Deputy Sherlock is merely articulating the concerns and apprehensions of workers in a new regime and seeking to copperfasten their rights in a better amendment than the one the Minister is offering.  It has been said that Deputy Sherlock is attacking the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Deputy Sherlock is perfectly entitled to give his views about any agreement entered into. The Minister must appreciate the manner in which trade unions do their business. When any member of a trade union is asked to give his opinion on the merits of an agreement, it is not like the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis.  Different opinions are articulated and then a decision is made.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3)  All sums paid to the Minister as mentioned in this section shall be used to reduce the national debt.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment would have been better placed in section 2 but as it has been placed in section 3 we will have to deal with it here.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the massaging of figures.  If the Exchequer is in receipt of money as a result of the privatisation proceeding, will this money be used as a device to reduce the budget deficit for this year &mdash; a massaging of the figures, creative bookkeeping or whatever you like to call it?  The fact of the matter is that the money realised by the sale of these shares, if it proceeds, is clearly a capital receipt and should be shown as such.  It should be used and should be seen to be used by the Minister to reduce our national debt, which God knows is high enough.</P>
      <P>I commend this amendment to the House and I hope it will be supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I do not support the principle of this Bill I find it very difficult to accept this type of amendment. It was stated clearly in the course of the Budget Statement that &ldquo;the sale proceeds will be used to reduce borrowing and thus help to ease the burden of the national debt and of debt-servicing costs.&rdquo;  This is the issue.  The purpose of enacting this legislation is to get in a sum in the region of £50 million to £60 million. <Col N="684" /> We are talking about disposing of the Irish Sugar Company which is now a profitable company and could make a great contribution to our economy.  In the past few years the company have made efforts to broaden their base by buying into other companies, such as Odlums and so forth.  Perhaps Deputy Garland was voicing his worst fears that the money raised by the sale of the company would not alone be used to reduce the national debt but would be used for day-to-day spending by the Government.  I think that would be a disastrous thing to happen.</P>
      <P>As I and others have said, selling the Irish Sugar Company for £50 million or £60 million is like selling the family silver, but it is selling the family silver to pay the mortgage instead of using the money to generate wealth and boost our economy. It has been stated that this is a good Government, but under Government policy there are 243,000 people unemployed. To use the proceeds of a sale of this company to private enterprise which in a few short years could be disposed of by private enterprise is a very negative thing.  Government policy is the attainment of a debt-GNP ratio of 100 per cent by 1993, which has a lot to do with privatisation.  Consequently, to agree to use the proceeds of the sale of the Irish Sugar Company to reduce the national debt is something I would not agree with.</P>
      <P>If it happens that this legislation is enacted and the company is privatised, I would like to see any benefit accruing from the sale being put into development to create jobs and relieve the poverty we have as a consequence of 243,000 people being unemployed.</P>

      <P>I will not be supporting this amendment.  In my budget contribution I suggested that the economics of the budget would be found wanting by the end of the year.  The basis on which the figures were arrived at was certainly flawed because the Government were depending on a number of areas for a return.  They were trying to ensure that the Exchequer borrowing requirement would be held at the level stated in the budget.  This will not be achieved and <Col N="685" /> they will be looking for a lifeline and I am afraid the State companies will be relied on to provide that lifeline for the Government.  I certainly do not want to see the State companies being used to prop up the Government's economic propositions as put forward in the budget. I believe that the suggestion of the Deputy in putting forward this amendment perhaps is predicated on the basis that the Government need this type of approach so that they can balance the books by the end of the year.  I believe the figures that are being given out and the assessment of the Minister for Finance in his budget speech did not depend on the sale of semi-State bodies to meet the requirements, but if figures go wrong over the year as a result of the Gulf War or the tourism figures not adding up or returns from taxation being less than predicted, it should not be the responsibility of the semi-State companies to provide the necessary back-up.  I certainly cannot support Deputy Garland's amendment because it seems to be a way of making the budget balance.  I therefore have to tell Deputy Garland that I will be opposing his amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 2 (6) of the Bill already provides that all dividends and other moneys received in respect of shares in the holding company and all sums paid in consideration of the sale or disposal of any such shares shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer.  The effect of the proceeds from the sale of shares being brought into the Exchequer is that the borrowing for the year, for instance, will be lowered by the amount of the proceeds.  This obviously, will have a beneficial impact on the national debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think this would be the appropriate place to engage in a general discussion on the different priorities of economic policy and strategy between parties of the left and Government. There is no need for me to go down that road beyond saying that the Government's position in relation to the reduction of the national debt is well <Col N="686" /> known and what we do here will be consistent with that policy.</P>

      <Col N="687" /> This amendment is to help the beet growers. We have discussed the workers in the Sugar Company for quite some time now.  This amendment is asking the Minister to exercise his role to ensure that the beet growers and the company can meet to decide on the delivery of the beet and the price fixing of the beet.  It is a very important part of the whole sugar company industry because, obviously, if the beet growers are unhappy the sugar industry will not survive as well as it should.  It is a reasonable request that there would be a proper discussion arranged.</P>

      <P>I am in sympathy with the general idea being proposed in this amendment but Deputy Browne will not be surprised when I say that it would not be appropriate to the legislation.  Deputy Browne is aware that each year negotiations take place between the Beet Growers Association and the company and the conditions of contract, which are of considerable detail and importance for both, are negotiated by them each year. The Deputy will also be aware that even when this was totally and utterly a State dependent company, the Minister never intervened in those discussions.  That process will continue.  I understand that even as we speak here discussions are under way.</P>
      <P>I have met the Beet Growers Association more than once in the context of the new arrangements, and I am glad to tell the Deputy that while the agreement is a matter between them and the company, other matters that the Minister and the Government are responsible for have been taken on board and will be reflected in the membership of the board.  The special equity provisions that I have already referred to, whereby they can subscribe for equity in the company, will also be in place.</P>

      <P>We have indeed spent a great deal of time on the rights of employees but it has to be accepted that they are employees of a company and, therefore, their needs have to be met directly as a result of how that company operates and the changes that may evolve in it without any reference to what may happen to the quota for the beet growers. I think it is right that we should have spent all that time in ensuring that their rights and concerns were met in this Bill. That is not to take away from the concerns that the beet growers have, which are slightly different.  Obviously they have aired their views in this House and I am sure the Minister is well aware of them.  He certainly represents more of them than I do in my constituency, although I do represent some.  They had two major concerns.  They looked for co-management of the Irish sugar quota and a fair payment system for sugar beet.</P>
      <P>I will be listening to how the Minister proposes to deal with the bulk of those requirements because they are the basic requirements.  If the Minister can assure us on both of those points, then I will be happy.  The arguments seem to have satisfied Deputy Browne but I would like to hear the Minister on those two concerns.</P>

      <P>At least the workers have statutory instrument 306 of 1980. There does not appear to be any legislation that we are aware of in the matter of take-over, which I referred to, to protect the interests of the beet growers. Of course the basic ingredient of any industry is the raw material.  We must have the raw material and that is provided by the beet growers.  Would the Minister say whether any discussions have taken place and whether any agreement has been reached or whether any assurance has been given to the BGA which is the body that represents the growers?  If not, I would find it rather strange that some effort has not been made to get some guarantees or some assurances on the future of the beet crop.</P>

      <P>As I said on Second <Col N="689" /> Stage, growers needs should be taken into consideration by the Sugar Company to a greater extent than they are at present.  There has been some very unfair treatment of growers in the past, particularly over the monitoring of tare and other matters.  I contend that amendment No. 29 is very reasonable in that beet growers should have a large say in the running of this company since they are partly dependent on it for their livelihood. It would be my hope that the Minister will take their views wholly on board.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> With regard to beet growers I am well aware of the effectiveness of the negotiations of the Beet Growers Association in the past and I am sure they will be no weaker in the future.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify the matter of the ghost sugar about which we spoke on Second Stage.  I read in the press that that had been accepted by the Sugar Company and agreement reached.  Perhaps the Minister might confirm that that very divisive issue has been resolved on behalf of growers.  It had been a serious bone of contention that they supplied 10 per cent of the sugar and were later penalised under the seed quota.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>As a grower myself who has worked closely with the company, I have noted the great relationship that has evolved between growers and the company.  However, price fixing often has been a cause of concern because of delays in negotiations.  It would be my hope that any impediments which often have an adverse effect on the sowing of the crop would be removed.  In recent years there has been a breakthrough in technology on the extraction of sugar, especially from the crowns, which led to the discussion on ghost sugar referred to by Deputy Browne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted from last week's edition of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> it was reported that the Sugar Company had accepted the growers claims with regard to ghost sugar.  I might add that there is a substantial amount of money involved, which <Col N="690" /> could lead to greater profitability of the company and which, by and large, would be comprised of farmer's money.  If that agreement is reached with the company I, for one, will be satisfied because it will be a step in the right direction occasioned by improved technology.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless we must examine the structure of the crop and the manner in which it is grown.  There are approximately 5,000 growers nationwide averaging in the region of 100 to 1,000 tonnes each. I should like to see protection provided for smaller growers, the backbone of our agricultural economy.  The enormous mechanisation and great technological breakthroughs at farmer level could very quickly lead to substantial growing of beet.  It is vital that we recognise that the family farm has made a significant contribution to the development of the Irish sugar industry over the past 60 years.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the board of the Sugar Company and the growers have been in favour of this new development, comprising the first element of privatisation in this country.  As has already been said, it provides the company with access to the market, and if necessary, to seek capital or extra funding to develop.  There have been many opportunities lost by the company and the industry over the years through lack of capital, when they were very dependent on capital injections by successive Ministers for Finance.  The ideal marketplace &mdash; and this has been endorsed by growers &mdash; is the stock market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I first met the Beet Growers Association a considerable time ago and when contemplating the introduction of this Bill, I thought it appropriate to enter into early consultations with them and I have met them on a few occasions since.  I think I can summarise their main concerns.  First, they were very anxious to ensure that the new structures would not lead to the national sugar quota passing out of Irish hands.  I accepted that concern.  I have now made provision to ensure that that quota will be protected in the special arrangements <Col N="691" /> for the golden share to be held in the name of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  The House will recall specifically that that golden share, among other things, provides that the quota cannot be disposed of without the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Food which, I might add, will not be forthcoming. That was the first point on which they sought and received assurance.</P>
      <P>The second matter in respect of which they wanted to be consulted was that, to date, they have never had any equity in the Sugar Company and, to that extent, never were able to benefit from any profits the company might make.  However, it is true to say that the Sugar Company have returned a profit only in the last two years so that, until then, there was no profit in which to share.  But they were anxious, as a major partner &mdash; which they are &mdash; in the whole operation that they would have access to equity on preferential terms in the new holding company. Having listened to them on that issue I am glad to say that this is being provided in the arrangements under the Bill.  This means that for the first time Beet Growers Association members will have what they never had when the company was under State control, that is an equity available to them, some at reduced and preferred shares and some available by way of preference on the open market. Of course that constitutes a major step forward in their interests.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, they wanted representation of a grower or an appropriate farmer interest on the new board.  They felt that what they had on the old board &mdash; though not by any legal right &mdash; they should have on the new board.  I am glad to be able to inform the House that arrangements will be made to appoint a representative farmer to the board of the new holding company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter on which they did not require assurance from me, because they appreciated that this was a matter for agreement between themselves and the company, was in regard to the details of the agreement on the price of sugar beet each year, in that each year beet growers <Col N="692" /> and the company conduct negotiations before the beet harvest begins.  They negotiate that between themselves and the Minister never has been involved.  At that point they agree the prices to be paid for beet and on other items connected with the beet campaign.  When that has been done there is then an agreed contract drawn up and submitted to growers. I might add that nothing will change in that respect.  In addition, I understand that the Beet Growers Association and the Sugar Company exchange letters covering what has been agreed.  This process will continue after the restructuring of the company.  It is a matter for the two parties concerned.  It is not appropriate to have it enshrined in legislation.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to inform the House that my latest information is that the two parties are in the process of drawing up a formal inter-professional agreement. I understand that substantial progress has been made on a proper understanding being reached between them.  When that has been done the only role I will have will be to examine the agreement to ensure that it conforms to European Community regulations, something I am required to do under European Community law, and I have no doubt from the consultations I have had with both parties that it will so conform. For that reason I would ask the House to understand that it is not appropriate that the details of an agreement would be enshrined in legislation.  I think Deputy Browne takes that point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>...of all shares of the Holding Company which are for the time being standing in the name of a nominee <Col N="694" /> for the Minister or the Minister for Agriculture and Food, that is to say:</P>
    <P>(a) it shall be lawful&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) for the Minister or the Minister for Agriculture and Food to transfer all or any of the said shares....</P>
    <P>Obviously that would include the special share.  Perhaps the Minister can tell me why he is not amending this section which would allow him to transfer the special share to somebody else?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I was making.  I made very clear in the amendment that has been agreed by the House that the Minister for Agriculture and Food shall not dispose of the special share referred to in subsection (2) of this section.  If I imposed an accepted legal binding obligation that I may not dispose of the share then I would not be appointing a nominee on my behalf to dispose of something that I have actually precluded myself from doing.  In other respects there will be other matters for the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I would say to both Deputies that in order to ensure that the interests are being protected there will be other matters that the Minister for Agriculture and Food of the day will want to supervise and he may not always be there personally.  As the Deputies will appreciate this is a standard procedure.  Whatever is being done in that instance could be done by a nominee duly authenticated, but there is no way that a nominee can do what I have prevented myself from doing, that is dispose of a special share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Thereby hangs a tale. The Minister who has put down amendment No. 9, as stated, is now refusing to accept an amendment on section 4.  May I explain briefly why it is absolutely desirable that section 4 (2) would be amended. Subsection (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following provisions shall apply and have effect in respect of all shares of the Holding Company which are for the time being standing in the name of <Col N="695" /> a nominee for the Minister or the Minister for Agriculture and Food,...</P>
    <P>so that it is lawful to dispose of all the shares in the holding company.  That point must be clarified.  I am seeking to amend subsection (2) by inserting the words &ldquo;other than the special share&rdquo;.  It is essential to do that if we want to copperfasten the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I can do so. Perhaps in some reports of our proceedings the last day there was some confusion. The Minister for Agriculture and Food holds only one share.  That share is what we have been referring to here as the special share; sometimes, in other jurisdictions, it is called the golden share. That is the share which the Minister of the day agrees I cannot dispose of and I have made provision for that in the Bill already.  To actually use the powers that attach to the special share, for instance, to prevent disposal of the quota, to ensure that certain cumulation of interests together could not do anything to get their hands on the national quota are the matters which are contemplated in the Minister's responsibility in the special share.  It would be a mistake to say that no nominee of the Minister can act on his behalf.  It is a standard provision of all ministerial authority that the Minister delegates from time to time, for a particular purpose, someone to act on his behalf when he may not be there.  All that is being done in this case is to ensure that they would act on behalf of the Minister in the normal course but certainly not to do in any way what the Minister himself is not free to do under law: dispose of the special share.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I am beginning to get mesmerised as I have so many copies open here.  The Minister is talking about the nominee.  When I read Deputy Sherlock's amendment I understand that he wants to insert the words &ldquo;other than the special share&rdquo;.  The Minister has already guaranteed that he <Col N="696" /> cannot sell the special share.  Perhaps it would help if this was clarified as I do not think it has anything to do with the Minister or his nominee.  Section 4 (2) states:</P>
      <P>The following provisions shall apply and have effect in respect of all shares of the Holding Company...</P>
      <P>If it concerns all shares of the company, there is one share it does not concern and would it not be as well to clarify it.</P>

      <P>(a) it shall be lawful&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) for the Minister or the Minister for Agriculture and Food to transfer all or any...</P>

      <P>I thought when we reached that amendment the Minister would have clearly understood what was meant by it, but for some reason he has not accepted that to amend subsection (2) is vitally important.  Otherwise his amendment, which has been agreed to, will have no effect.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (2) (a) provides that it shall be lawful:</P>
      <P>(i)  for the Minister or the Minister for Agriculture and Food to transfer all or any of the said shares to another person selected by the Minister concerned to hold as his nominee the shares so transferred;</P>
      <P>(ii)  for the Minister to direct a nominee to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or any of the shares of the Holding Company for the time being vested in him as such nominee;</P>
      <P>This gives rise to considerable confusion. However, if the Minister accepts my amendment which proposes including the words &ldquo;other than the special share&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;Company&rdquo; in section 4 (2), this would clarify the issue.

In fact, the Minister for Finance is the sole and exclusive shareholder in the company at this point, as he is in the case of other commercial companies.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food enters into this only because we are making special provision that one share, the special share, with the special rights and obligations attaching to it, which I outlined the last day, shall be held by me.

      <P>In page 5, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;(1)  The Holding Company shall reserve four positions of the non-executive directorships on the Board of Directors for the purpose of the election of employees to fill the reserved positions.  The aforesaid election shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and procedures specified in subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The election shall be by secret ballot and shall be conducted in the manner which applied heretofore within Siúicre Éireann c.p.t. and in <Col N="700" /> accordance with the terms of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, as amended, save as herein provided.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I hope this very reasonable amendment will be accepted by the Minister.  The Sugar Company were one of the first companies, if not the first, to which the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act applied.  This practice which has been in existence for some time has given workers an interest in the affairs of their companies and has had a great effect on their morale.  For far too long workers on the factory floor were highly critical of the way in which decisions were made by management without any reference to workers.  Very often they made decisions which were detrimental to the company and, consequently, to the workforce. Worker participation has proved to be a good way of rectifying these problems. Experience has shown that good worker representation is beneficial both to the company and the workers.</P>
    <P>As there is no provision in law for worker participation in private enterprises we should include such a provision in this Bill which would have to be complied with.  If my proposal is not agreed to, it will be the first step towards whittling away the rights workers have previously enjoyed.  Very often the board of a company can be far removed from what is happening on the factory floor.</P>
    <P>As I said previously, I believe the new holding company will find worker participation on the board beneficial as it works both ways.  In addition, a two tier system of management which should have been introduced years ago would add to worker participation on boards. My amendment proposes that no fewer than four workers be elected to the board.</P>

If the Minister says he <Col N="701" /> will accept Deputy Sherlock's amendment &mdash; I will be surprised if he does &mdash; I will support it, but I am giving him another alternative.  Often there are too many directors in companies.  Since it has been established that at least half this company will be privatised, half the number of worker directors should represent the shares remaining in public ownership &mdash; we do not know how long they will so remain.  These shares will be represented by ministerial nominees who will not be appointed under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act because obviously this will no longer be a State enterprise; it will be a private company quoted on the Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>Worker directors have operated very successfully on this board and have seen the company through a very difficult time.  As Deputy Sherlock said, this is one of the first companies to which this legislation will apply and they were one of the first State companies to have worker directors on the board.  The fears voiced in this House and in the private sector about the inclusion of worker directors on boards were totally unfounded.  People of excellent calibre have served on boards. I cannot think of one worker director who has not contributed greatly to the success of public companies, particularly the Sugar Company.  Participation of worker directors in this company has helped them through a very difficult time, with closures in Tuam and Thurles.  Their advice and intimate knowledge of the company was very important when decisions had to be made.</P>
      <P>Although the Minister for Labour is due great credit for what he has done over the years, I criticise him because he has not pursued the area of worker directors in companies.  Maybe he was too busy in other directions, but this is one area where I would like to have seen more ministerial direction.  The number of worker directors in State companies can be changed by ministerial direction without having to come into this House for approval.  I would like to see more encouragement being given to worker directors in the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic question is whether the <Col N="702" /> workers in the Sugar Company should be disenfranchised and excluded from the boardroom as the price of privatisation. The whole trend, especially in the private sector in Europe &mdash; and this is happening in the United States &mdash; is for far more employee investment not only in the specific production and organisational tasks but in the running of the business.</P>
    <P>My amendment simply proposes to retain the rights of workers.  This can only enhance the cohesion of the company and prevent any misunderstandings between institutional shareholders and the workforce. The issue of employee involvement in the private sector is currently being discussed by the ICTU and the FIE.  I wonder if anybody is seriously suggesting that the statutory election of worker directors in State companies should be the price workers would pay to have a voluntary non-statutory form of employee participation in the private sector.  This is precisely what is happening in this instance.  Unless this amendment is taken on board we will see a step backwards in this whole area of participation by workers in private industry.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to note that the provision of a token shareholding to the employees effectively means they will be excluded from sitting on the board. That is what I understand the Minister has in mind, unless this amendment is accepted.  Does the Minister envisage any token representation for employees on the new board?  There was no indication of this on Second Stage, and there was no mention of it when we were discussing the principle of the Bill.  I do not know whether it entered the Minister's mind or if he is concerned to see workers represented on State and private boards. Obviously he will give us his views in his reply to the amendments.  I ask the Minister to note that the provision of a token shareholding to the employees effectively means they will be excluded from sitting on the board.  As I have said, unless this amendment is accepted, the Minister will be excluding any participation by workers on the board.  That would be a total reverse of the position up to now.  It would disenfranchise workers <Col N="703" /> and exclude them from the boardroom, a price they would have to pay for privatisation.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> That is what I was going to say.  It is very important that the workers feel they have a say in the holding company and that they would decide overall policy.  The Minister has a choice of retaining four directors, two directors or one director. We put down an amendment proposing a representative of the beet growers; they should also be represented in the holding company.  In the long run, the holding company could decide to close down the Sugar Company or sell it if that is an option, although I am sure it will not be. In theory, they will be the main bosses and the Minister will keep them in line. It would be a very good gesture on the part of the Minister and would show that he has listened to all the contributions and is concerned for the workers and beet growers, if he were to accept one of the amendments.  I presume our amendment <Col N="704" /> is the best, but he should accept at least one.</P>

      <P>I would like to reaffirm that the worker directors of Siúicre Éireann will stay in place.  The company will remain a wholly State company with all the rights that attach to it. In the course of this debate, some people have said I am in favour of full privatisation in this case, and that this is the end of any State role in the holding company, or the Sugar Company.  That is not the case.  However, let us assume that we were doing that and going for privatisation as has been argued for from time to time.  This is a new dimension, I want a quality representative board which will be able to direct the new holding company and the interests of the workers, growers and investors &mdash; in that order &mdash; to maximum common advantage. For the first time, we will have a representative board of nine as distinct from the existing board of Siúicre Éireann which will remain at 12.  It is essential to have a representative board of high quality because it will have to compete with the most developed companies, nationally and internationally, which is what everyone wants.</P>
      <P>The composition of the board will have to give the right signals to the market and the market will have to be interested in the constitution of the board and whether they see it as a constraint or as a positive ingredient in the development policy and profitability of the new holding company. We must take all that into account; I am satisfied that it will be a high quality, representative board and that the interests of the workers will be reflected on the representation of the board.  As with the rest of our consultations, I hope it will be acceptable to the trade union movement and, in particular, to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions because this is just one element in the overall agreement which we promoted to common purpose between the unions and the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accede to the amendments in their present form but it is our intention &mdash; I understand that discussions are proceeding on that basis &mdash; that this will be <Col N="705" /> a representative board.  By that I mean it will be in the interests of growers, workers and the company.  Beyond that I cannot go.  The amendments want the same conditions in a totally new partially privatised structure which is the case in relation to the existing Sugar Company board.  The worker directors apply to the Sugar Company board, that was appropriate and remains so, but I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the past hour the Minister lauded the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the workforce in the Irish Sugar Company.  However, he refused to accept an amendment which would propose to put representatives of the workforce on the board of the new holding company.  We propose four because that is the number already on the board of the company, and they are drawn from different areas &mdash; Carlow, Mallow and Thurles.  There is also representation from the staff association, a factor which should be borne in mind. The election should be by secret ballot and be conducted in a manner which heretofore applied to Siúicre Éireann and in accordance with the terms of the Worker Participation [State Enterprises] Act.  In circumstances where the workers are of such vital importance to the development of any company, why not have worker directors?  I am quite sure that there will be growers' representatives on the board, as there have been for a long time.  For the Minister to reject the notion of having worker directors at this time &mdash; or provision in the legislation to have worker directors &mdash; is a clear indication that he wants to enact legislation to hand over to the new holding company as quickly as possible, to tell them that the Government have done their job and that there is now nothing to fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why will the Minister not agree to have worker representation on the board? They are a very valuable company and I have no doubt that, when their shares are floated on the stock market, there will be a demand for them.  In such a major changeover, to have workers represented <Col N="706" /> on the board would go some way towards allaying their fears.  Why will the Minister not accept that there should be worker participation?  There is confidence in the Irish Sugar Company at present and the Minister sees it as worthy of stock market flotation.  Consequently, the company will attract investors and, therefore, there should be provision in the legislation to have worker directors; after all, the workers provide the wealth and the workforce in the Irish Sugar Company are mostly very skilled.  The Minister made the point that everything would be all right and that the Irish Sugar Company, as they exist at present, would have representation on their board.  How can the Minister say such things when the Act setting up the company will be repealed when this legislation is enacted and the Minister will have no say, good, bad or indifferent, over what will happen to the company?  The company will then be a subsidiary, I understand that system very well from experience of association with the company.  I mentioned other subsidiaries, Dairynuts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are subsidiaries of the Irish Sugar Company but they are subject to the parent body.  They are answerable to the Sugar Company so there is no point in the Minister saying that all these things will be provided for by the Sugar Company.  The Minister will have no say in what the Irish Sugar Company do; they will be merely a subsidiary of the new holding company which will be set up under this legislation.  The company were built up at great sacrifice by the workers over the years and it is right and proper that there should be worker participation.  This amendment is asking for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect that the Minister would accept the amendment proposing that there be four directors and that is why I thought that on this first day of the Cheltenham Festival I would give him an each way bet in this area and offer him the second choice of <Col N="707" /> two directors.  I never thought he would give the reasons he gave for not having worker directors on the board, and he underlined it time and again by saying he required a board of high quality.  The only assumption I can draw from that is that worker directors would not be of high quality and I am very disappointed if that is his attitude to worker directors.  On several occasions in my two years in the Department of Labour I met worker directors of the ESB, CIE, NET the Irish Sugar Company and I was impressed by the high calibre of the worker directors who had been appointed by these companies. I have been in the trade union movement for a long time and I think the good sense of workers in putting forward their best people for these companies was underlined by the people I met on those occasions.  Then the Minister comes in here and tells us he wants the board of the Greencore company, the holding company, to have only high quality people and this is one of the reasons he cannot have worker directors.  That is scandalous. I hope he did not mean that and that he will come back and tell us that was not the inference we had to take from what he said.</P>
      <P>I think his second reason was more honest that people who may invest in this company may not be attracted by the fact that worker directors may be appointed, that when prospective investment would read the small print of the prospectus in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and <i>Business Post</i> at the weekend and find this revolutionary Government were going to put worker directors on this new privatised board, flotation might be affected adversely. That seems to me the reason the Minister has turned down this opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are here starting a process whereby several more public companies may come before us for privatisation.  What we achieve here today in this Bill will be the bench-mark for every other privatisation that will come before this House.  Some of the changes we tried to achieve but on which we failed and some of the advances we hope we have achieved in the rights <Col N="708" /> of employees are going to be more important in the future because so many other workers of public companies may find themselves in the same position.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that interest in this company will suddenly diminish simply because two worker directors as I have proposed should be chosen to be among the directors of the company, but that is the only inference I can take from what the Minister has said.  The question I posed when I introduced my amendment was to remind the Members in the House and some who were not here of the position should the worker directors in the Sugar Company be disfranchised and excluded from the board room as the price of privatisation.  The Minister has clearly answered that question by saying that that is the price of privatisation that we are not going to encourage worker directors in a privatised former State company.  I have to reject totally the reasons he has given either from the point of view of privatisation and attracting the private sector to invest in this company or from the point of view of those directors in terms of their credibility and their ability to do an important job as directors of a company.  I will be endeavouring to press this amendment and hoping to get support for it.  Obviously, it will not be from the Minister's side of the House but we might expect the support of the Fine Gael Party on this. Deputy Deasy was in Government when these worker directors were appointed and I hope he will remain true to those people who, particularly in this company when it came under pressure, stood up to that pressure, and made up their own minds as to whether the decisions in regard to closures were good for the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to pay tribute to the directors of the Irish Sugar Company for an outstanding performance in the last four years.  The amendment before us does not relate to what I have just said.  We are going to the market for equity and it would be wrong of this House to impose directors or to tie the hands of the new holding <Col N="709" /> company in any way.  We would be taking from the shareholders' rights and they are the people who put in the equity. A substantial amount of equity will be involved in the market and I would say we will see a number of institutions taking up blocks of shares in the holding company. I believe those institutions will be making claim for directors themselves and if they are the investors they must get the recognition.  The capital will be vital for the success of the company whose credibility in the initial stages will be very important.  While there is no legislation in this area before us it is premature of the Opposition to try to pre-empt the situation on this side of the House and try to embarrass us into doing something like this.</P>

However, we are in a new situation and the Minister informs us that the Irish Sugar Company will continue in their former state and that those four people will hold their share.  Deputy Sherlock is probably envious that there was never the foresight to have him elected as a worker director.  I am fairly confident that the amendments put down by the Opposition is nullified by the situation and is opportunist at this time.</P>

      <P>I am as sceptical, if not more so than Deputy Kavanagh about the Minister's acceptance of worker directors, but we did not even go for the each way bet.  We just looked for a place.  We have asked for one from each side one from the employees and one from the growers. There may be a partial solution to the problem in that between them the workers and the growers are going to have a fairly substantial number of shares in the new public company.  If they could see eye to eye and get together they could hold one seat on the board on an alternating basis.  If the Minister is going to vote down all these amendments &mdash; speaking out of the side of my mouth, let me say we will be supporting only our own amendment &mdash; and if his proposal is not acceptable, I suggest the workers and the beet growers get together and see they are represented and work in harmony. That might partially resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>When we put worker directors on to State companies we tended to put them on the main board.  On the Continent it is more usual that the worker directors are on subcommittees of the main board. It would be opportune for the Minister to give some indication whether he is willing to set up subcommittees of the main board; in other words, representatives of the board who would meet periodically with representatives of the workers and the growers.</P>

      <P>This Bill proposes to enable emigrants of up to 15 years to register as electors and to vote at elections other than local government elections. Deputy O'Sullivan proposed postal voting and suggested that if the Minister for the Environment was unhappy with the integrity of the elections he would have the power to modify the relevant legislation.  We have all experienced long delays in overseas postal deliveries.  Candidates go through an agonising few hours at election counts as they await the white smoke from the returning officer. God only knows what might happen to candidates if they were depending on a few first preferences from New York or Boston.  We could easily have a few by-elections before the full general election result was known.</P>
      <P>During the debate last week I outlined my reasons for opposing this Bill and they were practical and administrative reasons.  I have no doubt about Deputy O'Sullivan's good intentions in proposing this Bill but, like many other Deputies, not just on this side of the House I have serious reservations about the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To give voting rights to all Irish people who left during the past 15 years would give the vote to people in many countries throughout the world.  The Governments of some of those countries have proved not to be friends of Ireland.  In that atmosphere, surely it would be impossible for the Irish Government to guarantee that the election would be held in a fair and honest way.  Since our entry to the EC our Government have constantly dealt with European Governments and during that period we built up a certain amount of trust with our European colleagues. There has been enormous co-operation between members and if voting rights were to be given to all Irish people who emigrated to EC countries we could guarantee the integrity of elections.  I ask the Minister for the Environment to <Col N="712" /> seriously consider granting the vote to all Irish people living in the European Community.  However, I have to oppose the Bill proposed by Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>

When I emigrated to the US I worked in New York and I took part in all the activities.  I played football in Gaelic Park, New York.  Last summer I returned for the wedding of a niece and I was disappointed to see the condition of Gaelic Park as I had thought it might have improved over the years.  The man with the lease on Gaelic Park had it for the past 50 years and it was renewed again last year.  What has he done for the Irish emigrants in New York?  He made a lot of money for himself, providing a few facilities for the Irish people there.  I was saddened to see the way Irish emigrants were treated in Gaelic Park, New York.  I saw excellent football and hurling games on second-class grounds.  This man had made so much out of the Irish that he could have provided much better facilities.</P>

This Government have done something for illegal immigrants in the US over the past few years and I hope nearly all of them will get Green Cards to enable them to be there legally so that they will be able to come and go as they like.

      <P>Thank you.  I will get elected on the Deputy's surplus the next time.  In New York where I went to college a friend of mine, a French student, on one occasion voted in the French presidential election.  He took a day off college to go to the French Consulate in New York with passport in hand to cast his vote.  I have no doubt that that person was very proud, and felt very patriotic, that after two years living and working in the United States he could still exercise his franchise in the French presidential election.  This led me to think about all the undocumented illegal Irish immigrants in New York &mdash; there are three or four times as many there now &mdash; who did not have a say in the way the country was run.  What was worse, they did not have a vote in New York or anywhere else in America.  The least we should do is to give them the vote in the country they left involuntarily.  A number of the Fianna Fáil speakers have said that the problem is too great but I do not accept this.  There will be logistical problems but <Col N="715" /> I do not think that should be used as an excuse for not giving emigrants a vote.</P>
      <P>This morning I showed a group of 24 fifth year college girls from Dublin around the building.  While viewing the Seanad I asked them about their interest in politics and how many of them would vote in a general election if they had a vote.  Ten replied that they would while 14 said they would not exercise their franchise. I asked them the reasons and they replied they felt they would have to emigrate in two or three years' time and asked why should they bother getting involved in the political process if they would not be here pursuing a career. I found that extremely sad.  This is an indication of the level of cynicism among the young generation, but until we clean up our act and are realistic, this will continue to be the case.  Unfortunately, it will get worse.  If people do not take part in the democratic process, what are we left with?  That is a very serious question and it is one which we, as elected representatives, must act upon immediately.</P>
      <P>Coming as I do from a political family I have always had an interest in politics. I recall a young Fianna Fáil Deputy from Galway West, Deputy Fahey, now Minister of State with responsibility for Youth Affairs and Sport, spouting about the injustices being done to our emigrants, that no one was doing anything about the problem, that he was going to be their saviour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that he was going to bring them back to Galway, Leitrim, Tipperary by the plane load.  Not only did he say he would do this, but he went to New York to hold a big meeting with the then Mayor of New York, Mayor Koch.  Following this meeting it was stated in the Irish newspapers there and the national newspapers here, that Mayor Koch would provide medical facilities at a cheap rate for undocumented illegal immigrants in the New York area.  I have no doubt that that was <Col N="716" /> a political exercise in cynicism.  However, when poor unfortunate illegal immigrants went to avail of these cheap medical facilities, they were unable to find them. What it did do, however, was appease their families in Ireland who thought that Deputy Fahey was a great man to do all this for our emigrants.  I am sorry to have to say this when Deputy Fahey is not in the House, but there has not been a squeak out of him during this debate.  I wonder if he, too, has turned his back on the people he told he would be their saviour.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware of the extent of emigration and County Mayo, no more than County Leitrim, has survived the ravages of emigration. There were 32 boys in my class in national school in 1973.  Of these, two are living in County Leitrim today, 20 have emigrated and ten work in this country.  I have no doubt that 70 per cent of those who have left have done so involuntarily.  The reason they emigrated involuntarily was lack of work.  It is a sad reflection that that position has been ongoing and worsening.  The least we could do is give them a say in the election of some part of the Oireachtas.  I am not saying that will stop emigration or that they will be happy with that, but it is a recognition, a sign that we have not forgotten them and know they want to come back.  As politicians, we are seen as doing nothing but talk.  The Minister has a chance to take some action.  He is a great man for saying what action should be taken but nothing happens.  If emigrants were given the vote, the Minister might pass out Deputy Mary O'Rourke in the leadership polls.  Many people from Mayo would be interested in seeing him attain that high office.</P>

      <P>A number of people have emigrated voluntarily because they could get jobs in the EC at a better rate than we could offer here.  Another factor is the tax regime.  People are attracted by the availability of jobs, the incentive to work and value for money.  There is no incentive when one pays more than 50p in the £ in tax.  The Government will have to look hard at that issue.</P>
      <P>I support in principle the giving of votes to emigrants.  Young Fine Gael recently carried out a survey in 25 centres around the country.  The survey revealed that 73 per cent of those questioned were in favour of giving the vote to emigrants, while 26 per cent were against; 46 per cent of those in favour wanted the vote given to emigrants who left five years ago; 15 per cent wanted the vote given to those who left ten years ago; 5 per cent favoured votes for those who left 15 years ago and 34 per cent were for giving votes to emigrants indefinitely.  That reflects what people are feeling.  I know polls are taken very seriously on the other side of the House.  The Government's case is an exercise in political expediency.  People will remember that Fianna Fáil championed the just cause of emigrants while they were in Opposition but in Government they are doing everything possible to stop emigrants having a say in the running of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Reynolds for sharing his time and I compliment the Labour Party on a very worthwhile contribution to the affairs of this House and to the well-being of the hundreds of thousands of emigrants who have been forced to seek employment elsewhere. Successive Governments over the years have failed to provide and adequate standard of living in this country, thereby forcing people to emigrate.  It is regrettable that this Bill has evoked such a response from the Government.  It is a typical knee jerk reactionary response from a Government who assume a monopoly of wisdom in regard to all things that are right and good for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A principle is involved which most other EC countires recognise by granting <Col N="718" /> their citizens in exile the right to vote in elections for their national parliaments. It is regrettable that this principle is not recognised by the Government.  I admit there would be difficulties in framing tight legislation to cater for huge numbers of emigrants, but that is no reason for the defeatist attitude of the Government. These people are anxious to contribute to a new society here which would offer all its citizens a job and a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>It is particularly ironic that a party such as Fianna Fáil should oppose this right in principle.  That party for many years used the emigrant issue for political advantage. I do not have to remind the House of the electioneering campaign in 1987 when billboards were used which proclaimed that the only growth in the economy in previous years was the growth in numbers of people leaving the country. Deputy Reynolds referred to the antics of Deputy Fahey during those years, travelling abroad and cultivating the support of emigrant groups.  They are now dashing the hopes they raised.  Those who live in glasshouses should not throw stones. No party used the emigration issue so cynically as Fianna Fáil and their colleagues, who are now Progressive Democrats, in the years 1983 to 1987.  It is noteworthy that in the years since that cocktail was mixed to form a minority Fianna Fáil Government we have witnessed the highest levels of emigration.</P>
    <P>The most damning indictment of this Government's attitude to emigrants is that they have tied them into the arithmetic of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> That programme assumes for the purposes of balancing the books that the present rate of emigration will continue.  It is cold comfort to the many thousands of young people in second and third level institutions who have some sense of idealism and hope. The Government are not solely responsible for the programme.  It is regrettable that the social partners saw fit to budget for emigration at unacceptable levels. They have sold the interests of generations to come.</P>
    <P>The Government are bankrupt of ideas <Col N="719" /> of how to deal with the problems of unemployment and emigration.  They seem to accept without question the &ldquo;Doheny and Nesbitt school of economics&rdquo;, &ldquo;that you, you and you have no future in this country.&rdquo;  The people have to leave because the Government want to balance the books.  The sole achievement of the minority Fianna Fáil administration, which is now blinding them in Coalition was the balancing of the books. Presenting a balanced set of books to parents whose children are seeking employment here is cold comfort indeed.</P>
    <P>We have seen a persistent refusal by the Government to recognise the poverty traps which are ensnaring many people. Indeed unemployment is forcing many of them to emigrate in despair of the Government having realistic policies to resolve those problems.</P>
    <P>One has to question the Government's response to a Bill which seeks to recognise in principle the rights of people who have been forced to leave this country to vote in elections here and have a say in the formulation of policies they hope will lead to the creation of jobs and thus increase the possibility of their returning to this country.  The reason is that the Government, of all Governments, have a lot to fear.  The Government raised the expectations, for cynical political purposes, of thousands of emigrants and many people at home who have since been forced to emigrate.  That is the reason, despite what was trotted out by the Minister.</P>
    <P>We accept that there will be logistical problems.  What is at stake this evening is the principle of the Bill.  If we accept the principle we can then move forward to devise a scheme which will enable our emigrants by way of voting in Dáil elections to ultimately determine policies to be pursued here which may have a direct bearing on their future and the possibility of their returning to this country.  Many speakers have touched on the human face of emigration.  I suggest it has affected every family.  In fact, two members of my family have emigrated in search of employment.  The signs of emigration will <Col N="720" /> be seen next weekend when generations of Irish people who were forced to emigrate participate in Saint Patrick's Day parades around the world.  We will have a huge number of English registered cars off-loading from the car ferries at Rosslare and Cork.  We will have a brief glimpse of those people before they return to the country which offered them employment opportunities when this country failed to do so.</P>
    <P>The face of emigration can be seen in rural clubs, sporting, social and political. They have been denuded of a generation who had been educated and offered great hope.  The irony is that we have spent millions of pounds of taxpayers' money educating our young people but we have failed to tap in to that potential.  Without a blink we have cast them on the emigrant trail and in this debate the Government are refusing to give them a say in life in Ireland in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Cork North-West, my constituency, is a microcosm of life in rural Ireland.  The constituency comprises medium sized market towns, small villages and a large rural population.  I have had first hand experience in my capacity as a public representative, and in other capacities, of the blight of emigration across the constituency.  I find it nauseating that the Government can sit here and lecture from on high that there is no hope for our people here and that the only route for them is emigration.  That is the reality of the programme which the Government have concluded with the social partners.</P>
    <P>Last weekend the Macroom branch of Young Fine Gael, whose membership ranges from second and third level students to young employed and unemployed people, carried out a survey.  The first question asked if those questioned believed that Irish emigrants should be entitled to vote in Oireachtas elections. An overwhelming majority, 82 per cent of the people in Macroom, felt that those people should be given a right to vote. The second question &mdash; the Minister should take note of this, but I doubt if he will &mdash; asked whether the Government were doing enough to promote the welfare of Irish emigrants abroad and 84 <Col N="721" /> per cent out of a sample of 350 people responded that the Government were not doing enough.  When one sees Irish emigrants sleeping in cardboard boxes and thousands working illegally in the United States, and the Government throwing in the towel at home on the question of emigration and refusing to give a meaningful voice to emigrants, one despairs.</P>
    <P>At the outset I complimented the Labour Party on the Bill but I have some reservations about it.  It is too long a period to extend voting rights to those who emigrated 15 years ago.  Many people who emigrated and lived abroad for 15 years do not have the intention of returning to the country and, therefore, it would be wrong to give them a voice in elections here.  I see great difficulty in compiling accurate registers and putting the onus for them on local authorities.  I favour a system of self registration by emigrants.  I see great difficulties also in purely logistic terms in extending the provisions of the Bill to every emigrant.  Perhaps a policy of registration at centres where we have consular offices would be more realistic.  This would be better than offering a blanket extension of the franchise without detailed consideration of how it might work.  My great fear is that at the end of the day the Labour Party Bill will do little for Irish emigrants.  What TD does not claim to speak for Irish emigrants?  All of us do.  I would like to commend Deputy McGinley for his contribution.  He suggested direct representation in the Oireachtas by giving three seats to representatives directly elected by emigrants and that would give greater clout and credibility to the emigrant causes.  It would have a greater effect on policy and impact meaningfully on the question of emigration and the recognition of the rights of emigrants.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to recognise, at this late stage, that there is a question of principle, the recognition of the rights of people who have been forced out of the country to make a meaningful contribution to Irish life by having a say in policy and having that say by the extension of voting rights to them.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> This debate last week and again tonight in relation to voting rights for emigrants opens up the whole issue of emigrants and gives us an opportunity to reflect and to see that there is a real issue.  It gives an opportunity to politicians from all sides to remember the plight of emigrants all over the world.</P>
      <P>Deputy Creed talked about Fianna Fáil and political expediency and implied that Fianna Fáil had, in the past, used the plight of emigrants to gain some advantage. Recently I read about Deputy Jimmy Deenihan and others visiting emigrants in London and various parts of the United States to discuss with them their situation.  There is nothing wrong with that.  It is important for politicians, whether from this side of the House or the far side, to visit emigrants and keep in touch to see what improvements could be brought about.  We should not apologise for that.  There is no question of political expediency in this area.</P>
      <P>I come from Wexford in the south east corner of Ireland.  Rosslare has often been described as the gateway to Europe. It has been the gateway for many emigrants who have had to leave to find jobs. I, from time to time, visit London and other places to see how the young people from Wexford are getting on, to find out if they have jobs or if they are homeless. I go with a genuine interest to make sure that any concerns they might have are taken up and brought back here to this House and discussed with the relevant Ministers in an effort to improve their quality of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that young people have to emigrate.  Various Governments over the last number of years have provided a good, sound educational system here which has cost the taxpayer a substantial amount of money.  It is therefore frustrating that so many well educated, <Col N="723" /> talented young people that, if the jobs were available, we could have here in this country working to build a nation for the future, are giving their skills and talents to other countries.  I do not think it is a big deal for the United States to say they will give us so many Donnelly visas or so many green cards.  Those people who are in the United States are providing their skills and qualifications to build up that country.  We should get a far greater amount and not have to go cap in hand. The United States should be providing visas because of the skills they are getting free of charge.</P>
    <P>There are two types of emigration. There is voluntary emigration where people who are highly skilled and very talented take career breaks and go, usually to New York or to Sydney or to Perth, to take up jobs in nursing and other areas.  Those people are well able to look after themselves and usually after a year or two they can return to Ireland and have no problem getting a job.  It is the other area of involuntary emigration that is a problem.  People are going to London with no education and no skills, and generally it is felt that up to 20 per cent of those people end up in difficulties, homeless on the streets of London, unable to find a job.  Those are the people we must home in on to encourage them to return here and encourage employers here to employ, no matter what Government are in power.</P>
    <P>The question of votes for emigrants is very interesting.  There is no pattern of voting for emigrants across the various countries in the EC.  For example, a British resident abroad for up to 20 years is entitled to be registered as an overseas elector and to vote at parliamentary and European Parliament elections.  Electors are registered in the constituency where they last registered as UK electors, and voting by overseas electors is by proxy. There are 31,000 UK emigrants registered on the electoral system in the UK and this represents .03 per cent of the total electorate.  There are much more than 31,000 UK emigrants around the world and there has not been a mad rush <Col N="724" /> on the part of British people to get on the electoral register.  That is interesting because British people are certainly very patriotic.  Judging by those figures, however, they seem quite happy to vote, if possible, in the country where they live or not to vote at all.</P>
    <P>The Federal Republic of Germany residents abroad are entitled to be registered as electors for up to ten years after emigrating and this has only applied since the recent parliamentary elections; voting in Germany for emigrants has happened only recently.  It is by post and, again, 31,000 emigrants voted at the last general election in 1987.  That is something like .07 per cent of the total electorate. Again this shows that there is no great interest on the part of people from Germany in going back or voting by post in their own country.  In France they take a different line.  Emigrants are only entitled to vote at presidential and European elections and in referenda, and no provision is made for voting by nationals abroad in parliamentary elections.  This shows that the system varies from country to country.  Italian emigrants can vote only at European elections and voting is in person at polling stations set up in the host country, usually at embassies.  There are about 1.5 million Italian nationals living abroad and no arrangements are made for voting abroad by emigrants at parliamentary elections.  Spanish residents abroad are entitled to be registered to vote at all elections.  Portuguese emigrants may vote at parliamentary and European elections but not at presidential or local elections and they must register annually at local embassies. Voting, again, is by post.  The Netherlands allows all its emigrants to vote at all elections except local elections.  Again, voting is by post or by proxy.  At the last general election very few people bothered to exercise this right and the total number of emigrants who voted at the last general election was 23,600.</P>
    <P>In Luxembourg emigrants are entitled to vote at all elections, where voting is by post.  Something in the region of 2,000 emigrants only voted in their last general election.  In Belgium their emigrants may <Col N="725" /> vote at European elections only.  In Denmark emigrants are not entitled to vote in Danish elections but their civil servants are given that right.  It seems strange that their civil servants posted abroad are entitled to vote while their ordinary Joe citizen is not entitled to vote in their elections.  Greece allows their nationals resident abroad to vote in European elections only and not in parliamentary elections. Voting in European elections is done at their embassies where polling stations are established if it is considered by the relevant embassy that there are sufficient nationals resident in the country to so warrant.  United States residents abroad are entitled to vote in US Federal elections.  Approximately one million voters are entitled to vote under this provision, either in person or by post. In New Zealand, in order to be eligible for registration as an elector, a person must have resided there for a continuous period of one year.  Continuous absence from that country for more than three years leads to removal of the names of those concerned from the register of electors. Canadian emigrants do not have a right to vote at all.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it will clearly be seen that different countries worldwide have different systems.  There is no pattern to suggest that even within the EC, of which we are a member, emigrants abroad would be entitled to vote in parliamentary elections.  It is important that we examine the systems obtaining in other countries and, at some stage, perhaps take some of them on board.  However, we should not enact hasty legislation just for the sake of giving emigrants a vote, thereafter encountering all sorts of problems and difficulties.</P>
    <P>There has been mention of postal voting in many countries.  I think it was in the 1985 local elections a postal voting system was introduced here for certain categories of people.  One could not contend that it was totally successful.  Indeed I understand it was later abolished.</P>
    <P>The question one must ask is whether Irish emigrants want a vote at Irish elections. At the annual meeting in 1989 of the Federation of Irish Societies &mdash; the <Col N="726" /> primary body representing Irish organisations in the United Kingdom &mdash; a proposal calling for votes in Dáil elections for a number of different reasons, probably the main one being that there was a certain amount of apprehension that an extension of the Irish vote to emigrants could call into question their right to vote in United Kingdom elections.  It is important to take into account what one of the major Irish societies representing Irish organisations in the United Kingdom is saying to us.  They appreciate the fact that they have a vote in Britain, enjoy a good standard of living, whether by way of wages, housing or lower taxation.  We should listen to what such organisations in the United Kingdom and other countries have to say.  We should discuss with them frankly the positive and/or negative elements of allowing them the right to vote in Irish elections.</P>
    <P>In the emigrants' advice, information and counselling service annual report, 1989 &mdash; a 20 page document &mdash; there was no mention of the right of emigrants to vote or the need for young emigrants abroad to have a vote here.  Rather they were concerned that there be proper counselling services made available to our emigrants whether in England, New York or elsewhere.  More importantly, they highlighted the lack of services here for people intending to emigrate who may not have the requisite education or skills or to whom it may not be of any advantage to emigrate.  I know that is not the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.  Rather I would view it as being the responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare, possibly also of the Minister for Labour &mdash; to make more resources available for the establishment and maintenance of counselling centres here to advise young people whether it may or may not be in their best interests to emigrate.  I have witnessed some young people emigrate from my county who returned within a week or two, having found there was nothing in London for them.  They discovered that the cost of accommodation was in excess of what they could afford, the social welfare system totally inadequate and their <Col N="727" /> chances of finding suitable accommodation practically nil.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for Deputy Creed to say that politicians use emigrants.  I have been a public representative for the past eight or nine years and spend most weekends &mdash; as I am sure do many other Members on the far side of the House &mdash; visiting companies, seeking jobs for young people, endeavouring to have them facilitated whether on a short or long term basis.  I contend it is important that we continue to fulfil that role.</P>
    <P>Our economy is developing along the right lines with low interest rates and inflation but that inprovement has not been reflected in the number of jobs created by industrialists.  It appears to me that industrialists tend to cream off massive profits and do not re-invest in the creation of jobs.  I contend it is the responsibility of the Government of the day &mdash; regardless of which party or parties are in power &mdash; to create the proper climate for job creation when, in turn, pressure should be exerted on industrialists to create additional jobs to reflect that improved climate.  In some areas that is not taking place.  I contend there are employers who, if pushed, could create a substantial number of jobs but they do not appear to be interested in so doing.</P>
    <P>I hope that this debate this evening will make us all reflect on the possibility that we may have many emigrants abroad who could be better off at home.  It would be my hope also that there would be additional resources made available to the counselling services to improve the lot of emigrants.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the Labour Party Bill the Fine Gael idea of giving emigrants three Senators to represent them was not well thought out and would do nothing for them.  It would be my hope that we can put all our heads together so that many of our young people at present abroad on whose education much money has been expended by successive Government, could return home, get gainful employment and help build our economy in the way we would all like to see it develop over the next decade.  I find it <Col N="728" /> frustrating at times to observe so many of our young talented people abroad.</P>
    <P>In his remarks the Minister for the Environment outlined the problems he envisages in giving voting rights to our emigrants.  I contend the Bill before us has not been well thought out.  Nonetheless at some stage in the future perhaps the Government of the day, the Opposition parties and our people abroad representiting emigrants whether in London, New York, Sydney or elsewhere can put their heads together and examine the possibility of affording them voting rights in the future.  Perhaps we could begin, as did some other countries, by giving voting rights in European elections and continue from there.</P>
    <P>What is most important is that we develop jobs for our many emigrants, when we would not be talking about voting rights but rather jobs for them, expecting them to remain and work here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to say a few words on this Bill and to take up some points made earlier, particularly by Deputy Creed.  It is a pity he adopted the approach he did to the Bill because we can all point fingers when it comes to emigration.  From Cobh, in my constituency, emigrants left to go to the United States in very large numbers; these were sad scenes at that time.  Many of those who emigrated were not heard of for many years and many of them did not have an opportunity to return and meet their families again.  At least, today we do not have that problem. Communications have improved and contact with parents and people at home is much better.</P>
      <P>Involuntary emigration is an emotional subject and one that directly affects many households throughout the country.  For this reason there is an obligation on us as Members of the Oireachtas to deal with emigration in a balanced level headed way and at all times to be careful about the manner in which we speak on matters related to emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> The welfare of emigrants, whether voluntary or involuntary, must be the concern of all us us and our efforts must be directed towards advancing their interests in practical and constructive way.  We owe it to them to avoid hyping up the situation in one direction or another.  Above all, we must avoid turning the question of emigration into an unnecessary controversy between the parties to be exploited for partisan advantage.</P>

      <P>This is why the action of the Labour Party in choosing to introduce this Bill at the present time is so regrettable.  They have brought in a Bill which has not been properly thought out, which does not deal in a meaningful way with the very serious and complex issues arising and which contains none of the implementation measures which are essential in an electoral Bill of this kind.</P>
      <P>Electoral arrangements vitally effect the interests of all parties.  Indeed, they provide the essential underpinning for the institutions of State and Government. Any major changes which have fundamental implications for the electoral process must, therefore, be approached with caution.  There has been a tradition that substantive changes in the electoral law should proceed on the basis of broad, general agreement.</P>
      <P>On this occasion the Labour Party would appear to have carried out no consultations before bringing forward the present measure, either with the other parties in this House or with responsible organisations representing emigrants. Clearly they did not consult their former partners in Government who have introduced their own Bill providing for a radically different form of representation for emigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party have had a long history of involvement in public representation and, at this stage, have had substantial experience in Government. They must have known beyond a shadow of doubt that this Bill which they are sponsoring could not hope to succeed. <Col N="730" /> They must have realised that, in its present form, the Bill simply could not be accepted by the Oireachtas.  Despite this, they have chosen to go ahead with the measure, thereby heightening expectations among certain categories of emigrants, expectations which the party must have known could only be dashed.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that they have chosen to go ahead with this action.  I am not in the business of speculating in regard to motivation.  Their action may or may not be connected with forthcoming elections and rivalry between the groups on the left.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister for the Environment set out a series of questions which would have to be addressed in any proposal to extend voting rights to citizens permanently resident outside the State.  These questions were echoed and, indeed, augmented in contributions by other Members, particularly, let it be said, by Deputy McGinley.  These questions include the numbers involved and what cut-off point, if any, could be safely adopted; what is the real attitude of emigrants, particularly those in the United Kingdom who already possess the right to vote in British elections and would, presumably, wish to continue to have this right; the &ldquo;one man one vote&rdquo; issue in relation to emigrants in Britain; the question of taxation and representation; the constitutional questions, particularly the question of equal treatment of different categories of citizens; the implications for our particular and rather unique electoral system; the administrative arrangements having regard particularly to the very short time scale applying at Dáil elections; and the preservation of the integrity of elections and how any abuse that might arise abroad could be prevented or remedied.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately it must be said that the responses we have had from the promoters of the Bill cannot be said to have dealt with these questions in anything like an adequate way.  They either have not dealt with the arguments at all or have dealt with them in the very selective and partial way.  They have avoided the central argument altogether.  So far as I am <Col N="731" /> concerned, the central question is, could our unique and delicately balanced electoral system withstand the addition of a very large, and at present unknowable, number of electors, electors who would be resident abroad, perhaps permanently, and to one degree or another out of touch with issues and policies here, electors who would vote outside the country without the security arrangements that apply in polling stations here, without the supervision of candidates and personation agents or of our trusted electoral officials and effectively outside the reach of our courts?</P>
    <P>In my view, enactment of this Bill would place an overwhelming strain on our electoral system, would change it utterly and destroy the faith our people have in its fairness and integrity.  Is that what the Labour Party want?</P>
    <P>If we are serious about extending the franchise as proposed by the Bill, if we want to make the kind of provision for voting by citizens abroad that apply in the United States, in the United Kingdom or in some European countries, we must approach the matter in a business-like way and adopt the kind of electoral systems they have in the United States, the United Kingdom or on the continent &mdash; an electoral system which would be sturdy enough to withstand the kind of pressures that would be placed on it.  If the Opposition are serious about this and are prepared to examine it realistically and objectively in the context of a revised electoral system, then I think they will find us ready to look at the matter in a very open way.</P>
    <P>Supporters of the Bill have glided over the question raised in relation to taxation. The point here is that, if the Bill is passed, overseas electors could determine the composition of Government here and, thus, the political, social and economic policies which would be followed.  Yet, these electors would pay no taxes here. In other words, they would determine policies: we would pay for them.</P>
    <P>They have not said what would happen to Irish emigrants in Britain who have full voting rights in British elections.  Would <Col N="732" /> they be required to repudiate their voting rights in Britain and would co-operation be established between the electoral authorities here and in Britain to ensure that emigrants would vote in one country only?  I expect Deputy O'Sullivan in his reply will address this matter.</P>
    <P>The mechanics of voting, including the prevention of abuse, have been dismissed as of no importance.  As Deputy Gilmore said our emigrants could fly home at weekends if we had our elections on Sundays. Deputy Bell referred to the fact that we give voting rights to our 600 troops in the Lebanon.  To compare the situation in Lebanon with that of our emigrants is not facing reality.</P>
    <P>If we are sincere about this, there are other priorities for our emigrants. Deputy O'Sullivan is on record as saying that when he contacted emigrants this issue was not a priority with them.  This is a stated fact by the Deputy himself and I admire him for making it, but there are areas and issues which need to be addressed.  The needs of our emigrants in Britain, which were never attended to before by any Government, have been taken on board by this Government.  In this regard I want to compliment the organisations abroad who highlighted the serious problems being experienced by many of our emigrants.  The Government have responded to these problems.</P>
    <P>The Government have been unfairly criticised by some Deputies who wished to gloss over the fact that when their party were in Government emigration was rampant.  The economic policies pursued by those people at that time contributed in a very substantial way to emigration.  We should get together and deal with this issue constructively to see what assistance we can give emigrants either by enabling them to return home to good, sound jobs or guaranteeing them assistance from the State wherever they are.</P>

      <P>While reading the Minister's most recent speech on the subject of establishing what is basically a fundamental right to vote for Irish emigrants, I was struck by the way in which it absolutely and scandalously ignored the research on the subject of emigration and the information available from emigrants and, in particular, by its insulting and patronising imputation of motives to our emigrants.  I listened to a speaker who said the Labour Party are being opportunistic in relation to this legislation.  By training I am a sociologist and I ran the first course on the sociology of emigration in this country.  I have researched the subject for almost 20 years.  Only last year I visited Brent and other places to talk to emigrants about their welfare and where voting rights, as a demand, figure in these different issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to be perfectly clear about what has been suggested in this House by the Minister for the Environment.  On Tuesday, 7 February 1989 both Deputy De Rossa and I put down questions to the Minister asking him where he stood on the issue of voting rights for emigrants. Both Deputy De Rossa and I pursued the issue with the Minister on that occasion by way of supplementary questions. When I asked him about the basic right to vote &mdash; volume 386, columns 1455-58 of the Official Report refers &mdash; the Minister again and again made the allegation that the postal vote, as he called it then, would be abused by emigrants. When I asked the Minister if he could give the House a commitment to review the manner in which this issue has been examined by our partners in the European Community so that we would not be left in the absurd position, perhaps during the Irish Presidency, of having the only emigrants not able to vote within the Community, he replied: &ldquo;Our experience in this matter has not been good&rdquo;.  When Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla suggested that he did not trust the Irish voter the Minister replied &ldquo;not abroad but at home&rdquo;<Col N="734" /> and the Taoiseach intervened to say &ldquo;We never trusted them more&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The message was the same throughout that exchange.  The Minister took refuge in the Draper case which had been succeeded by amending legislation in relation to electoral law.  When I asked him about the right to vote, the Minister stated: &ldquo;I am saying to the Deputy that, if voting were to take place outside the State... it would be impossible to police properly and, consequently, it would not be in the best interests of the electoral system&rdquo;.  That was a comprehensive string of insults about our emigrants to whom the former President de Valera used to address his message as muintir na hÉireann thar lear on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister added to this the changes which have taken place in his thinking during those two years.  He suggested that our emigrants do not understand proportional representation, they would be confused, they would not know enough about local news, they would not know enough about the candidates and maybe their votes might have an effect.  Rarely has there ever been put on the record of this House such a string of inaccurate assertions concerning our emigrants and their motives.  His advisers brought him back to John Stuart Mill who said &ldquo;No votes without taxation&rdquo;.  One of the Minister's predecessors in office, a man who served as both Taoiseach and President of this country, used to record every year under invisible exports in this House emigrants' remittances.  One can add to that the money saved by shipping the social welfare problem &mdash; our emigrants &mdash; abroad.  When Peadar O'Donnell, that magnificent, concerned writer about emigration, was asked by the former President de Valera &ldquo;Would one million not have emigrated under your scheme as well?&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;They would not be the same million&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Easter Rising it is interesting to note that we in this House are not voting on detail and practicalities but are voting to deny people whom we would like to regard as part of the Irish family the right to vote.  Speakers on the opposite bench <Col N="735" /> do not have the courage to stand up and say they are afraid to give them the right to vote.  What we are hearing is a kind of modern day elaboration of what used to be the emigrant's prayer.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister made interesting assertions about emigrants.  He said, for example, that there is no age breakdown to migration.  My students, after a week studying the subject, know that the major emigration incidence has always been between the age cohort of 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 years.  We know that during the fifties the loss was as high as 60 per cent in some rural parishes, that in 1955, 55,000 people emigrated and that in 1985 we reached the second highest figure in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>There is no need to try to obscure the realities of emigration.  It has been studied by Stacia Crickley, Professor Damien Hannon and countless scholars. Two years ago when the discredited economies of Mrs. Thatcher was breaking out here people did not speak about emigration at all &mdash; they called it labour mobility.  There was a kind of sleight of hand to suggest that it was really movement within a labour market until research showed that the highly skilled graduate accounted for less than 20 per cent of the total migration and that the most vulnerable people in the emigrant stream were those between 16 and 18 years who were urban-sourced and who left places like Dublin, as rural people had in the fifties, without social welfare provision here and in the expectation of social welfare provision in Britain.</P>
    <P>We know the realities of emigration. What we offered them was climatology, &ldquo;We are creating a climate for investment and we hope all you will come back&rdquo;. The Minister's speech last week was riddled with ignorance about emigration. All reasonable research has concluded the same thing about emigration over the past 20 years &mdash; it is circular migration. By this I mean people do not leave for all time once they leave home but rather they come and go all the time for different festivals, family events and so forth.  To suggest that that circulatory pattern of <Col N="736" /> migration deprives them of knowledge of the reasons for their forced exile from this country or knowledge of their country is a compounded insult on a pile of insults. Indeed it comes well from the Minister for the Environment whose colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, has consistently refused to have political and social studies introduced in the classroom which would ensure that people would know their citizenship rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to think that if we were as big as America we could afford to accede to the right.  He said in his speech that the United States is entitled to give the right to its citizens that we are now going to refuse because only 1 per cent are involved.  Is the argument about the right or is it about the percentage? Will the Minister make up his mind?  He then goes on to say that 611,941 people in Britain claimed an Irish connection and would it not be dreadful if they considered themselves Irish and demanded the right to vote?</P>
    <P>Last year at one conference after another in Britain all the expert opinion suggested that what we were dealing with in Britain, to which the Minister referred, was a new concept which was not simply assimilation, that after assimilation you acquired the right to vote, but what you were dealing with in multiracial Britain was a recognition of ethnicity and nationality, of cultural background, of a plurality of cultures, and the people did not need, as it were, to wipe out their historic experience so as to acquire rights in the place to which they had been driven by market forces.  The Minister flies against all of that as well.  I tell the Deputy who spoke a few moments ago that it is the Minister who seeks to divide the emigrant community by saying: you had better be careful, keep your head down in Britain or you will lose what you have if we at home give you rights.</P>
    <P>Again, there is a nonsensical abuse of Article 40.1 in relation to equality of rights, treating citizens equally and as regards voting.  Why does the Minister and his advisers not address that issue in relation to the disabled?  For example, <Col N="737" /> the blind person who has to be accompanied to the polling station does not enjoy the exact same right when voting on a Braille ballot paper.  You cannot have it every way.  What the Minister does in his patronising language is to misquote.  The Federation of Irish Societies in 1989 did not vote to make this demand.  They deferred the vote at that meeting.  Yet, this evening there has been a blatant distortion of what took place at their annual meeting.  One could go on.</P>
    <P>What is really outrageous is the Minister's statement in his speech &mdash; I ask all families in this country who are touched by emigration to remember this forever for this Minister and this Government&mdash; when he said, &ldquo;A person living outside the country, even on a short term basis, cannot be as aware of current affairs in this country as a person living here&rdquo;. What basis is there for that statement? The only background one can get to it is the consistent arrogance of the Minister in relation to this question, but he precedes it by the great giveaway.  He stated in his speech: &ldquo;It is also a fact that relatively few seats in this House are decided by first preference votes; the majority of seats, particularly the vital marginals, are decided by the lower preferences of a relatively small number of votes&rdquo;.  The Minister's suggestion is that over there in single voting, first-past-the-post Britain, people would not only have lost touch with the candidates but would have lost touch with the voting system and they would throw into chaos the system that had made them and their fathers and mothers emigrate.  I thought for a while I was listening to D'Aubisson in Salvador or Christiani explaining why peasant women cannot have votes.  I hope it is never forgotten an masla do mhuintir na hÉireann, do na daoine atá díbeartha as an tír seo, agus nach ndéanfaidh siad dearmad go deo ar an Aire ná ar an Rialtas nach raibh sásta fiú amháin buncheart an vóta &mdash; nílimid ag caint faoi na sonraí a bheag nó a mhór &mdash; a thabhairt dóibh in a dtír féin in ar chuir teip eacnamaíochta iachall orthu í a fhágáil ar imirce.</P>

      <P>This Bill is an attempt to reach out and build a bridge to our emigrants.  Unfortunately for too long our emigrants have been out of sight and out of mind as far as this House is concerned. Most of them are forced out by unemployment, poverty or social ills. Occasionally Ministers pay lip-service to them.  They speak about them as if they are some vague immortal group out there.  Usually on St. Patrick's Day or when a premier from another country comes to visit this House we glorify our emigrants in some vague way that bears no relation whatever to reality.  The reality is we have turned our backs on our emigrants.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister spoke about the financial assistance we give to emigrant agencies in other parts of the world. That is nonsense.  We give a mere pittance to these agencies.  Our embassies and their staff do their best, but they are not emigrant agencies.  In my experience emigrants who go abroad, mainly to Britain, never contact our embassy or an emigrant agency, and rarely do they contact employment agencies.  They go abroad to work, not to contact embassies or employment agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a little about emigration.  My mother was one of 15 children from County Clare, 14 of whom emigrated to America.  She was the only one who stayed behind in Ireland.  That must constitute a record.  I emigrated to London in 1957 and worked on many building sites there with thousands of fellow emigrants. Most of the people I worked with were Irish.  Indeed, many of them came from the Minister's county &mdash; I am sorry he has left the House.  The County Mayo emigrants in London had an incantation which burned an indelible imprint on my mind.  They used to say: &ldquo;Mayo, God help us&rdquo;.  That was the conditioned reflex, the Pavlovian response, the west of Ireland lament that I heard.  These people had been abandoned by the politicians and by this country and most of them had given up hope of ever returning and finding employment here.  As I mentioned, those words have echoed in my mind down the years.  They were nothing <Col N="739" /> more than a sad summing up of the position.  Donal McCauley, a friend of mine, wrote about these people later in <i>An Irish Navvy.</i> I do not know if the Minister ever read that book, but it would be worth his while to read it some time.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed in the Minister's response to this Bill and to the overtures of Deputy O'Sullivan.  He has closed the door on our emigrants.  As Deputy Higgins has pointed out, the Minister fears the consequences of giving a vote to our emigrants.  He fears that some of the people who have gone abroad &mdash; to use words well known to him &mdash; might be contaminated by alien ideas or foreign philosophies and if they come back here or got a postal vote they might vote for Labour as most of them do in Britain. That is the thinking behind the Minister's statement.  The Minister also said in his speech that if we gave a vote to these emigrants the total emigrant vote would exceed the vote of the people at home. What a terrible indictment, what a terrible reflection on any Minister or any Government.  Surely that is a terrible statement to make in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about realism and the policies of the Government in creating employment.  He also said that our emigrants rarely contribute to the Exchequer of this country, but in the past that certainly was not true.  We owe a great deal, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, to the hard-earned pounds and dollars of our emigrants who worked on building sites and in factories to support their families at home.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to explain the difference between emigrant groups in Britain and merely succeeded in creating a smokescreen of rhetoric and evasion. There is no justification for his attitude. Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan admitted that this is not a perfect Bill but it is an honest attempt to build an electroal link with our emigrants.  Deputy O'Sullivan deserves the congratulations of the House &mdash; and of our emigrants &mdash; for introducing this Bill.  The Minister is concerned about counting heads, numbers rather than principles.</P>

      <P>The Minister made some rather disgraceful comments about the quality of worker directors and said it would be a disincentive to have them still in place as it would not attract prospective shareholders to buy into the new company.  I do not accept that and I outlined the quality of the directors in this and other public companies.  It is quite popular in Europe to have a sub-board <Col N="742" /> level of worker directors but all it adds up to is deciding the colour of the towels in the washroom, or something like that. That is not my idea of the role of worker directors although I realise that they are not involved in discussing the existence and viability of their company.  The appeal of the Minister of State falls on deaf ears, he has not persuaded me to withdraw this amendment and I do not intend to.</P>

      <P>I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State but I had hoped that the Minister would have managed to stay with us because I want to bring up a matter which I raised earlier which is pertinent to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been basing his case throughout this debate on the fact that nothing has changed; he is not privatising the Sugar Company, at best we dragged out of him that it would be part-privatisation. It would appear, judging from the response to this group of amendments and specifically to this amendment, that indeed everything has changed and that it is anticipated, as I suggested earlier, the new regime will take an entirely different outlook.  It is regrettable that the Government should sponsor the removal of worker directors with an established pattern from the board of this company. They have no regard for the arguments advanced about the unique input that workers can make to an enterprise like this, to how they form an integral part of a company as valuable as this is.  It throws out the window all the Government rhetoric down through the years about worker participation and industrial democracy.  For example, the report of the advisory committee on worker participation as long ago as 1986 recommended the extension of the experience and experiment in the State commercial companies to the private sector.  Here we have an opportunity, if nothing is changed, to underpin it in the legislation that the position of worker directors will <Col N="743" /> be continued; the response of the Government is very revealing and disappointing.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a matter which greatly disturbs me; at an earlier stage of the debate I raised the whole question of guarantees which the Minister was trotting out concerning the special share and many other things.  He said that the Deputy need have no worry, that it was all in the memorandum and articles of association.  I pursued him on that and, eventually, he ageed to make the memorandum and articles of association available, emphasising that they are only in draft form, which I appreciate.  I have the memorandum and articles of association of the new Greencore plc and it is, as you can see, a very unwieldy document, written in the ultimate of meaningless legalese.  In respect of this argument on worker directors I wish to draw the attention of the House to article (31) on page 6, which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>(31)  To promote freedom of contract, and to resist, insure against, counteract and discourage interference therewith, to join any lawful Federation, Union or Association, or do any other lawful act or thing with a view to preventing or resisting, directly or indirectly, any interruption of or interference with the Company's or any other trade or business, or providing or safeguarding against the same, or resisting or opposing any strike movement or organisation which may be thought detrimental to the interest of the Company or its employees, and to subscribe to any association or fund for any such purposes.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the Minister has a perfectly coherent explanation for this, but this, I suggest to the House, is fantastic and extraordinary.  Maybe there is a mistake somewhere in the drafting but article (31) is tantamount to ruling out even membership of a trade union.  Certainly activity in a trade union for the purposes of &ldquo;resisting, directly or indirectly, any interruption of or interference with the Company's or any other <Col N="744" /> trade or business, or providing or safeguarding against the same, or resisting or opposing any strike... and to subscribe to any association or fund&rdquo; may include a drafting error and perhaps there is a reasonable explanation for this.  I would like to take the opportunity of Deputy Sherlock's and Deputy Kavanagh's amendments to get the Minister to say on the record of this House whether that clause says what it seems to say.  Is a semi-colon missing anywhere?  If so, does that explain how it goes on to talk about preventing, resisting and so forth?  I would like to give the Minister an opportunity to consider that because it is a positively alarming clause.  I have never seen it in the articles of association of any private company before now.  I cannot imagine what its purpose is, in any event.  I would like to hear the Minister explain what it is supposed to mean.  Why is it there?  Is this the attitude that is going to be taken to worker participation or industrial democracy, admitting, as I thought the Government admitted, that what they required were more participative structures in industry?  Does the Minister for Labour, for example, know about this? I know not all his colleagues trust the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, on every matter but I wonder if he consulted the Minister for Labour here.  I cannot imagine the Minister for Labour standing over that clause.  If the officials have discovered an explanation for it at this stage I would like to hear it.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with a number of points, the first being Deputy Kavanagh's interpretation of what the Minister for Agriculture and Food said.  I was here when he made his initial response to the contribution on these three amendments and I cannot agree with the Deputy's interpretation of what the Minister said. Deputy Rabbitte is obvioulsy at a disadvantage in not being here when the Minister made his initial response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, I consider that an advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>At least he would have had <Col N="745" /> the advantage of hearing at first hand what he said in relation to worker representation on the board.  My interpretation of it was that in the interest of the workers and of the beet growers he will be endeavouring to ensure that they have adequate representation on the board and that because of the position with the discussion of the matter at present he could not be more specific on that, but clearly the sentiments in what he said underline the fact that that was his intention in relation to it.</P>
      <P>On the question of Deputy Rabbitte's quotation in the document here, surely the agreement with the ICTU and the company clearly provides for the normal union representation of the employees of the company.  Surely we are not suggesting in the House that the ICTU would agree to an arrangement that would do other than provide for the adequate representation of the workers subsequent to the company being established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but I must say it leaves me more alarmed than I was initially.  I attempted to contact the General Secretary of the Congress this evening and narrowly missed him but I talked to a senior official of the Congress who assured me that they were not consulted about this memorandum and articles of association. They have not seen them.  The Minister of State seemed to be asking us here to accept the good intentions of the Minister, of having the beet growers and the workers represented, albeit in drastically different fashion and diminished to the point of non-existence in the new arrangement.  I sought from the Minister an explanation what that extraordinary article 31 in the memorandum and articles of association means.  The House is entitled to know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spent a long time here on the fundamental question of the motion to privatise and the amendment that would retain a majority stake for public ownership, and the Minister kept constantly referring me to the memorandum and articles of association.  They were not available first, then he qualified them, <Col N="746" /> saying they were only temporary and in draft because the law is not enacted.  All that is fair enough and I accept it, but now we have got them, temporary and in draft though they may be.  The article is pertinent to this amendment about worker participation and an extraordinary article for which I can conceive of no reasonable explanation unless there is a mistake in the drafting.  It would seem to prohibit the lawful discharge by trade unionists of their functions of pursuit of a dispute or whatever or to subscribe to any association or fund for any such purposes.  I think it is reasonable to ask the House to explain what that means. We could not contemplate buying that kind of pig in a poke.</P>
    <P>I am not sure at this stage what other gems there may be in the remaining 80 pages, but it is not good enough to ask us, because it is the Minister's intention to include workers on the board, to accept this.  We have four worker directors on the board at the moment and from the very beginning we have had legislation enabling workers to be elected to the boards of semi-State companies.  I suggest with all due respect that generally it has worked very well throughout the State companies.  An official report called for that to be extended to the private sector.  Parties on all sides of this House pay lip service to that concept of giving workers a greater say in their own enterprise for all the reasons I will not take up the time of the House in rehashing.  Here when we did find the memorandum and articles of association we have this unprecedented clause.  I have never seen it previously and I think it is incumbent on the Minister to explain to the House precisely what it means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the three amendments before the House I am inclined to favour Deputy Deasy's amendment.  He deals with the question of the representation of the growers, and they need to be represented in this company in the same way as the employees need to be represented.  There is no effort in the amendment put down by Deputies Sherlock and Kavanagh to deal with this <Col N="747" /> problem.  On the other hand Deputy Kavanagh is very niggardly in his reservation of only two directorships, one for the employees and one for the growers. As I understand it there are four worker-directors at the moment in the Sugar Company.  Surely we do not want to reduce that further.  As a minimum we should have four worker-directors.  It can be argued that there should be four beet growers' representatives on the board to balance the interests of the growers and the employees.</P>
      <P>The balance of the board presumably would be the shareholders' nominees because we must face the fact that the company will be privatised and that the shareholders will appoint directors to look after their interests.  That, however, should not be the limit of the workers' participation.  The workers need to participate either as shareholders or by way of some profit-sharing scheme so that they will have a real stake in the industry and are not just waged employees with no vested interest other than keeping their jobs.  That would be a recipe for disaster. Every employee must have a vested interest in the industry in which he or she works.  That can only be done by way of worker shareholding, profit-sharing or some combination of both.  I hope the Minister will introduce some suitable amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Nowhere in the document from the Irish Farmers' Association which sets out their demands have they asked for directors on the board.  They want co-management of the Irish sugar quota and a fair payment system for sugar beet.  I support those two demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been worker-directors in the Sugar Company since the passing of the 1977 Act and we want to continue that.  Obviously, the trade union movement accepts that we cannot apply the worker director Act for State companies to a private company and, in order to continue that representation, they have asked that the Bill be amended accordingly. Deputy Sherlock has asked for four worker-directors.  Knowing the attitude <Col N="748" /> of the Minister up to now we decided to ask for two and try to debate which proposition would be the most acceptable to the Minister.  The Minister rejected both proposals and, indeed, the proposal for one beet grower and one worker.  I would remind the Minister that when the Minister of State was talking to this amendment he said that one of the reasons he was against this amendment was that he wanted a board of high quality. That is an assumption that worker-directors are not of high quality.  That was a slight on the worker-director legislation and on worker-directors in other State companies.</P>
    <P>By far the most telling reason for his obstinacy in relation to worker-directors was that the market would not wear worker-directors in the new company and that it would be detrimental to the flotation of the company on the market. Apparently his colleagues agree with that idea.  I do not, and it would not have any effect whatsoever.  The private sector are looking for profits and they must be delighted at the operation of this company which made £22 million last year and £14 million the year before.  The fact that the company are making money is what attracts the private sector.  If the private sector thought worker-directors were responsible for that they would be delighted to keep them there.  I wish to draw the Minister's attention to that.  The Bill will set a headline for other semi-State companies.  What goes in this company will go in every other one.</P>
    <P>In relation to the memorandum and articles of associations, I know that one can go to a legal stationery office and pick a memorandum and articles of assocation and apply them to a company.  I do not know what shop the new company's memorandum and articles of association was brought in but I know that section 31 is unacceptable to me and would be unacceptable to most Members. Obviously, we cannot amend the memorandum and articles of association but we want the Minister, or the Minister of State, to come in before the Bill is fully discussed and say what sections are not <Col N="749" /> acceptable.  I accept that the memorandum and articles of association is a very bulky document.</P>
    <P>Between now and when the debate on the Bill is concluded I will have to ensure that the Seanad representatives of the Labour Party are made aware of what is in the Bill.  It is because of the way the Bill has been rushed through the House that we have not had a fair opportunity to study this document.  From the time the Bill was introduced the Whip has been out, in every sense of the word, to get it through.  At the Whips meeting last week there was pressure to get the Bill through.  We know the Taoiseach has been saying that we are delaying the Bill. If provisions like this get through because we do not have time to discuss and consider all the documentation pertaining to this Bill, we will have real worries for the workers, and their representatives, in the Sugar Company, in whatever new company is set up.  The Minister has been left the rather unenviable task of completing this Bill tonight.  The least he should do is say that on Report Stage he will have that section, and others, looked at and eliminated in any document put forward as the memorandum and articles of association.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>We suggest that the number of worker directors should be four having regard to different locations. I am sure if the person elected is from Mallow, Deputy Browne will be annoyed and say that Carlow will lose out.  What does worker participation mean, and what has it meant in the past?  It means that a person is elected to the board of a company by the staff and workers at factory floor level.  Consultation can then take place between that representative and the management, staff and general workers at that level.  Many issues arise at board level.  As I said, this would be of benefit to the company and the workers. Given that many issues, such as capital expenditure and a programme of diversification, will arise it is very important that they have representation on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte, an experienced <Col N="750" /> debater, has produced something now which must be a source of great concern even to the Fine Gael Party as well as the Labour Party and The Workers' Party.  The Minister has placed great emphasis on the terms and conditions of the agreement &mdash; this one page letter &mdash; reached between the company and the union, but having regard to the fact that the Sugar Company will only be a subsidiary of the new holding company, may I ask him if it would not be desirable for the Sugar Company, or what will be left of it, to be represented on the board of the new holding company?  Is that not the most desirable thing one could ask for at this time?  What guarantee is there that our sugar quota will not be drastically reduced after 1992?  The answer is none. We need a strong voice on the board of the company to ensure that there will always be a demand to get the highest sugar quota possible for this country.</P>
    <P>The memorandum and articles of association represent the hidden agenda. As has been revealed, when we examine article 31 we see just how insignificant this little document, which the Minister relied upon so much when speaking about the preservation of workers' rights, is.  In conclusion, it is desirable that they be represented on the board and the number we are putting forward is four.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte raised the question of article 31 of the memorandum and articles of association, but I would see this as a standard article in all memoranda and articles of association. Deputy Rabbitte knows full well &mdash; given his experience and university background he would be much more familiar with this than many others in this House &mdash; that it is included to protect the company.  Deputies on the other side of the House have asked what is the rush, but it is not in the interest of the company to delay the Bill which has received much publicity.  We are talking here about raising extra capital for the company to allow them to develop, and now is the time to hit the market given that we have low inflation and low interest <Col N="751" /> rates.  I see no reason we should continue to drag out this Bill or filibuster the debate as the company have held meetings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The company have held all the necessary meetings with growers to advise them of the programme and make them aware of what privatisation will mean for the growers and the company.  They have received a favourable response throughout the country.  I only hope that growers will realise the value of the shares and take up their allocations.</P>
      <P>Reference has also been made to the sugar quota, but I have no fears in this regard.  Our quota of 210,000 tonnes has been well protected in recent years by various Ministers for Agriculture and Food, including Deputy O'Kennedy.  I have no fear of 1992 and I believe we will continue to have a sugar quota which will satisfy both the growers and the workers.</P>

      <P>Since coming into the House I have heard Deputy Sherlock make two points, the first of which was that it is desirable &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; that the Sugar Company should have representation on the board of the new holding company.  I can assure the Deputy that this is the intention and will be the case.  Second, in relation to the various matters on which the workers want to receive guarantees, this will be done by way of consultation.  As I have said already, I am confident that we will find a formula in relation to participation on the board which will be acceptable to the unions.  I know that will be a dynamic and vigorous representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock spoke about the need, as he saw it, at board level to protect the highest quota possible.  I want to reiterate, although I am beginning to wonder whether I can communicate this or whether other people cannot hear what I am saying, that the Minister for Agriculture and Food of the day will have the responsibility to protect the quota: it will not be the role of the directors of the board to get the highest quota possible. Any proposals to change the quota will come from the European Commission and will go before the Council of Ministers who will decide on the matter.  I <Col N="753" /> can only confirm once again that, as Minister for Agriculture and Food, I will vigorously protect our quota which is a very special asset and will have nothing to do with what is being proposed here. I cannot understand why this red herring is constantly drawn across the trail.  I understand that during my absence a certain amount of play was made regarding article 31 in the articles of association.  I cannot see how this is capable of being misrepresented or distorted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">

      <P>Every Deputy is familiar with the fact that articles of association cover a very broad range to ensure that at no point can it be suggested that a company was operating outside the scope of its legal function.  If I were to draw the attention of other Deputies to other articles it would clearly underline the point.  I could give many examples. To interpret any one of the articles of association as if it were to be a binding negative force is to misrepresent the role of these articles.  I cannot see how anybody could suggest that there is a threat to any worker interest in a proposal to promote freedom of contract.  Corporate entities have to engage in contracts.</P>

      <P>I cannot see how anyone can imply that anything is being done here which will do other than protect the lawful activities of trade unions which have been enshrined in our law since 1906.  I have some little experience in trade union law, though some in The Workers' Party suggest that I know very little about trade unions and their members.  I have had contact with trade union workers over many years.  In the 1906 Act and the earlier Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, all the trends have been to remove the sanction of illegality that previously applied to trade unions and to pickets.  I welcome the fact that this has been done right through our legislation.  Pickets were once regarded as unlawful but that has been changed.  Then picketing was allowed only for the purpose of communicating information but that is also gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a whole corpus of law to protect the rights of unions.  Even if the memorandum and articles of association were intended to exclude the statute law enshrined in the Constitution, they could not do so.  It would be <i>ultra vires..</i>  They are not even purporting to do that.  This provision which is intended to protect is being distorted as if it were to undermine the lawful rights of workers in their unions.  I find that unacceptable.  Deputy Mac Giolla has some experience of this. Anyone who has had experience of working with trade union law will know that this is a very grave distortion of what is intended in the article.  All the things we now regard as normal actions by trade unions are not unlawful.  The unions are protected.  I reject any suggestion that article 31, which refers to lawful trade unions, is in some way intended to be a repressive instrument.  Even if it were so intended, it could not take precedence <Col N="755" /> over established statute law and the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>After the long preamble and the references to trade union law, I thought we would get an explanation that was both credible and consistent with normal articles of association.  We did not get that from the Minister.  The right to strike is not lawful, either in the 1906 Act or the 1990 Act.  A system of immunities is conferred.  There is no legal right to strike in any law in this State.  I cannot accept that one of the objects of the company is to protect the right to strike.  I thought the Minister would say that the section is badly drafted and that, for example, there should be a semi-colon after &ldquo;therewith&rdquo; and that there should be a new section.  It is meaningless as it stands.  At the minimum, there is ambiguity about it.  The law in relation to the right to strike is not as the Minister says. Before the Report Stage we are entitled to have this important matter clarified. Workers who will be in a new situation for which there is no precedent, but which is likely to be followed in the programme of privatisation which the Government have planned, will be very anxious to know what is being laid down.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to say to this House that the matter has been agreed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I do not know the detail of the Minister's discussion earlier with Deputy Sherlock, but this matter has not been agreed with the ICTU.  I have established that.  Regarding the Minister's statement that the arrangement he proposes to make for the inclusion of worker participation is acceptable.  The unions and Congress are this out and discovered that it is not acceptable.  The unions and congress are not satisfied about the arrangements for worker participation.  There should not be any ambiguity or pretence and it should not be implied that Congress have accepted the removal of worker directors and are prepared to accept the watered down version which the Minister is offering. They are not.</P>

      <P>Nothing in these articles of association would render unlawful any action on the part of any union which up to the passing of this legislation was lawful.  There is nothing in the legislation or in the articles of association that changes that basic fact.  That is the assurance I have been anxious to give.  Deputy Rabbitte can try to misrepresent or distort that in any way he wishes but I am saying categorically that in respect of this Bill when enacted into law and in respect of the articles of association, when the company are incorporated fully under law, nothing that is now lawful before the enactment of the Bill will become unlawful as a consequence of its passage. If Deputy Rabbitte has some other issue to raise such as the rights and status of trade unions I suggest it is more appropriate to other legislation than to this legislation.  When the Deputy tells me about the right to strike, there are clear precedents in law and in the statute, there are judicial decisions of the Supreme Court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 35, to delete &ldquo;High Court&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Circuit Court&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue here is simply to insert into the definitions section the proposition that the primary court of jurisdiction should be not the High Court as suggested but that the Circuit Court should be given primary responsibility to deal with these applications.  The reasons for that are straightforward in so far as it is as readily available a court as the High Court and it is the court to which we have given the primary responsibility for dealing with other matrimonial matters.  In Dublin where invariably, if not inevitably, all the applications under this legislation will be <Col N="763" /> dealt with, there is located a fully equipped and very adequate system of courts policed and presided over by judges of competence, knowledge and expertise in the general area of custody and child care.  For those reasons I argue that the Circuit Court should be given preference.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Circuit Court is much less expensive.  I acknowledge that while the majority of these applications will be brought through the good offices of the law centres, if they can cope, nonetheless, for them the procedures, the rules and practice and the workload will be much easier and in the long term less expensive for the State to operate.</P>
    <P>The Minister agreed to look at this matter.  Indeed, if I remember correctly he agreed to look at many different matters we raised on Committee Stage for Report Stage.  I am somewhat dismayed, if I may note by general remark, that I do not see any Report Stage amendment emanating from the Minister and that does not bode well.  This was one of the matters, after persuasive argument from Deputy Barrett and me, but especially from Deputy Barrett, who put this proposition on Committee Stage, where we believed the Minister showed an inclination towards the good reasoning behind it.  I am sorry the Minister has not taken the initiative here but in view of the opportunity presented to him on Report Stage, perhaps he would accept the idea that as a matter of good practice, good economics and good effective administration &mdash; legal and otherwise &mdash; the Circuit Court should, in the circumstances, be given the primary responsibility. Clearly, if any matters of dispute are not dealt with to the satisfaction of either of the parties or the litigants in the Circuit Court, they have the right of appeal and redress to the High or Supreme Courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter also on Committee Stage but I did not table an amendment on Report Stage because I had not seen any amendments and I assumed the Minister, having listened to the arguments put forward the last day, <Col N="764" /> would have agreed in this instance that it would be a good idea to have these cases dealt with in the Circuit Court.  In line with what Deputy McCartan has said, leaving aside the cost factor and other factors of convenience and so on, it is essential that we have uniformity in matters appertaining to family and children. For that reason when the Judicial Separtation Bill was going through the House we made provision for Circuit Court hearings.  The whole object of the exercise was to have in place judges who were used to dealing with family law matters which, in my opinion, is a very sensible arrangement.</P>
      <P>Because he did not give us any reasons the last day that this legislation should refer to the High Court I thought the Minister would agree to our suggestion that we should bring uniformity into the whole area of family law and matters dealing with children, amend the legislation as presented after Committee Stage and provide in the interpretation section that the word &ldquo;court&rdquo; would refer to the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>I want to stress that it is vitally important that we get away from the said way in which we have dealt with certain aspects of our law.  Circuit Court judges deal with family law matters every day of the week and I have not heard any complaints about the ability of these people to deal with such issues.  It is in the interests of the public whom we serve that there is uniformity in this area and that we have judges who deal consistently with family law matters so that they get a feel for the type of problems which arise in different areas.</P>
      <P>With regard to child abduction, at the end of the day we are dealing with children who, unfortunately, may be the victims of broken marriages or whatever. For that reason, judges should have a feeling for the type of problems with which they may be confronted.  Like Deputy McCartan, I am extremely disappointed the Minister did not see fit to introduce his own amendment.  Therefore, I ask him to agree to the amendment submitted by Deputy McCartan.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy McCartan's amendment for the reasons outlined by my colleagues.  However, there is another important point I should like to make. People believe that the situation in the High Court and the Four Courts in Dublin is chaotic enough from a physical point of view without sending more cases of this nature into the building.  People would feel much more at ease if these sensitive problems were dealt with in their own localities; for example, in Drogheda or Dundalk in the case of County Louth.  People in rural areas can be in dread of the High Court.  In view of the sensitive nature of these cases it is important for women in particular to have their friends and family close by. Reference has been made already to the cost of transporting people to Dublin, Limerick or Cork.  This is ridiculous.  Like my colleagues I believe these cases could be adequatley dealt with by the Circuit Court.  I support the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry my colleagues are disappointed but they will recall we had a very full debate on Committee Stage about the use of the High Court and no other court to hear and determine applications under both The Hague and Luxembourg Conventions. I indicated I would consider again what Deputies had said in favour of giving the Circuit Court jurisdiction, which I have done.  However, for the following reasons I am satisfied that the High Court only should be empowered to deal with Convention cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, it is normally the High Court which deals at present with cases where a child is abducted to Ireland by a parent and the other parent seeks return of the child.  In order to secure the immediate welfare of the child, that court may exercise the jurisdiction it has in relation to wardship or proceedings by way of <i>habeas corpus.</i> It might, of course, make orders, as appropriate, under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, but the essential point is that the High Court is experienced in child abduction cases which <Col N="766" /> have an international dimension and in which constitutional questions may arise.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in their report, LRC 12-1985, recommend that jurisdiction under the Conventions be vested solely in the High Court.  They considered whether the Circuit Court should also be given jurisdiction but decided not to recommend this because it is the High Court which has a unique jurisdiction in <i>habeas corpus</i> applications and in the constitutional issues which may arise in these cases.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Conventions we are obliged to provide interim or provisional measures to secure the welfare of the child and to prevent prejudice to interested persons or changes in the circumstances relevant to the determination of applications under the Conventions. Sections 12 and 23 of the bill give the High Court power to make interim orders for these purposes.  The High Court, because of its experience in such matters, particularly as to wardship and <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings, and because it is always available, will be ideally placed to carry out the obligations under the Conventions in this area.</P>
    <P>The Conventions also set out grounds for refusing the return of a child which generally have regard to what is best for the child.  I should like to refer, in particular, to certain of those grounds.  The Hague Convention provides in Article 20 that the return of a child may be refused if it would be contrary to the fundamental principles of the State relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Under the Luxembourg Convention, recognition and enforcement of a foreign custody decision may be refused on the ground, provided for in Article 10 (1) (a), that the decision is manifestly incompatible with the fundamental principles of the law relating to the family and children in the State.</P>
    <P>These provisions in the Conventions will, in effect, enable the High Court to refuse to order the return of a child where this would be unconstitutional.  In the light of these provisions in the Conventions to which the Bill gives the force of law, I think Deputies will agree that <Col N="767" /> there really is no choice regarding the court which should have jurisdiction in this country to deal with Convention cases.  The only court which should have that jurisdiction is the High Court as provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In any event, Deputy McCartan's amendment would be inoperable since the amendment has no venue provision as regards the exercise of the Circuit Court's proposed new jurisdiction.  Regrettably, I will not be able to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Minister's reasons for not accepting my amendment in reverse order.  The third and most succinct reason he gave is that it would be inoperable because there is no venue provision.  However, equally there is no reference to a venue in the Bill in the case of the High Court.  Section 2, the interpretation section, merely states that the court means the High Court.  There is no reference to a venue for the High Court.  If this is the case, why should there be a need to mention a venue for the Circuit Court?  Both courts have jurisdiction throughout the country in all areas.  Therefore, I do not understand how the substitution of the word &ldquo;Circuit&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;High&rdquo; would render that provision inoperable.  It would simply mean that references to the court in the legislation would mean Circuit Court and not the High Court in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason he gave was that there are fundamental grounds upon which a court here might refuse to allow a child to be returned, on the basis of infringement of the constitutional or fundamental rights of a person.  The suggestion here is that the appropriate court to deal with such matters is the High Court.  That is a reasonable proposition but my amendment would not deny the High Court the opportunity to have a say in all of these matters.  I am simply arguing that the most convenient court in terms of accessibility, the necessary facilities and resources, particularly in the Dublin area where most if not all <Col N="768" /> of these applications will be heard, and experience in dealing with matters of custody and care of children is the Circuit Court.  Therefore, there should not be any difficulty.  Any matter which is not resolved to the satisfaction of the parties concerned can be taken, by way of simple appeal, to the High Court, which will finally adjudicate on the matter, or by way of case stated by the Circuit Court judge to the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, which will adjudicate on matters of fundamental importance. The second objection referred to by the Minister can be overcome and should not cause any problems.</P>
    <P>The first reason given by the Minister for not accepting my amendment is that the current practice is for the High Court to deal with matters of inter-State child abduction, child care and the return of children.  I accept that this is so.  As he said, complaints can be taken before a court either by way of wardship application, that is making the infant a ward of the court, which is reposited exclusively in the High Court, or by way of <i>habeas corpus,</i> which is to secure the body before the court.  Both of those are jurisdictions exclusive to the High Court and cannot be dealt with elsewhere in the first instance.  That does not get away from the fact that we are introducing here a whole new process which is a creature of statute, and there is no reason, in doing that, we cannot give the statutory powers to the Circuit Court.  There would be some merit in the Minister's argument against the Circuit Court dealing with these matters if heretofore it never had to decide issues dealing with the care, custody and wellbeing of a child, issues we identified the last day as being the paramount consideration.  Every day of the week the Circuit Court decides who should have custody and who should care for a child.  The only added dimension here is the international feature, the fact that the child is coming from or going to another country.  What is the difficulty? Are we suggesting that the Circuit Court is incapable of adjudicating inter-State matters or of understanding the interplay of the laws and conditions of one country <Col N="769" /><i>vis-á-vis</i> this country?  That is not a very ingenuous argument to advance.  It is one that has not due regard for the competence of the Circuit Court Judiciary and the practice in those courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister has treated this matter somewhat flippantly.  He has not given enough regard to the very good reasons advanced for this proposition on Committee Stage, reasons relating to accessibility, availability, recognition of the competence of the court and its facilities and the fact that it would prove a far more effective and less costly court in these matters.  For those reasons I regret the Minister's attitude and I therefore ask that the question be put.</P>
    <P>Question: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11.  &mdash;In deciding all applications under this Act, the Court shall have regard to the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises form a debate held on Committee Stage when I moved a broader amendment which stated there there is nothing in the Bill preventing the court from returning a child to another state merely because the return was not required by the convention.  I went on to suggest that in dealing with such applications the court shall have regard to the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State in response to that amendment identified that the first part of the amendment was somewhat superfluous because of the principles incorporated elsewhere in the legislation and in the conventions.  However, he did not convince me that it was superfluous and unnecessary to include the proposal for which I now argue on Report Stage, <Col N="770" /> namely, that the legislation should have incorporated into it a declaration that the underwriting principle for a court in all these matters shall be that the welfare of the child be the first and paramount consideration.  I suggest that that should be part of our legislation.  The Minister did not see the reason for it on Committee Stage but said he would look at the matter before Report Stage.  Again the absence of an amendment from the Minister in this area augurs poorly and not very optimistically for this debate.</P>
    <P>My simple reason for putting forward this amendment is that the Law Reform Commission recommended it.  The Minister's report to that is there is no need for it because it is included in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  My answer to that is that the Law Reform Commission must have been well aware of that fact but nonetheless said it should be incorporated in this legislation.  I instanced the previous statutory practice where in passing the adoption legislation in 1974 the House incorporated into the legislation, ten years after the passing of the 1964 Act, a proposition that in regard to adoption matters the paramount consideration should be that of the child.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission believe this is necessary and the House, when dealing with the custody and care of children in the context of adoption ten years after the passing of the Guardianship of Infants Act, believed it was necessary.  I hope the Minister does not repeat the rather vacuous proposition he put forward on Committee Stage, that because it is included in the 1964 Act the matter is covered.  There should be no difficulty on the Minister's part in accepting the amendment.  My proposition is that it makes clear that as far as the working of this piece of inter-State legislation is concerned, those coming here from another country and looking at the basic legislation can have no doubt where our courts are expected to stand in adjudicating on these matters, namely, that the child will be the paramount and first consideration.  From the point of view that we are dealing with inter-State <Col N="771" /> legislation, where foreigners and outsiders will be looking at our basic laws, they will have a clear and concise declaration of what is the first and paramount consideration in these matters.  I suggest for those reasons that this amendment should be acceptable to the Minister at this stage.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan's amendment on Committee Stage concerned cases other than those covered by the Hague Convention.  However, the amendment now proposed concerns only cases covered by the Hague and Luxembourg Conventions.  The amendment, therefore, is quite different in effect from that proposed on Committee Stage because it would mean that in deciding all applications under the conventions, the High Court would be required to have regard to the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  In putting forward his new proposal Deputy McCartan would appear to misunderstand the nature and purpose of the conventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, the conventions, which are being given the force of law by the Bill and will therefore become part of our domestic law, are based on the premise &mdash;set out clearly in the preambles to both conventions &mdash; that where the custody of a child is at issue, the child's welfare is of overriding or paramount importance. The principle in both conventions is that where a child has been abducted across international frontiers its welfare will normally be best served by its immediate return to the State from whence it was abducted.  While both conventions make it clear that the substance of custody decisions is not to be reviewed in the country to which the child has been abducted each convention has detailed provisions for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of a child to cover those cases where it is manifest that his welfare would not be served by his return to the country from which he was abducted.  The Minister for Justice dealt at length with these on Second Stage and the explanatory memorandum which <Col N="772" /> accompanies the Bill also deals with those provisions at length.</P>
    <P>The provisions briefly are the following. In the case of the Hague Convention return of the child may be refused if it is demonstrated that the child is settled in its new environment, or that there is a grave risk that the child's return would expose him to physical or psyschological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable position, or where the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and a degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his views.  Of particular importance in the Irish context because of our constitutional requirements in Article 20 of the convention under which return of a child may be refused if it would be contrary to the fundamental principles of the State relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Luxembourg Convention the welfare of the child will be safeguarded principally by Article 10 (1) (a) which provides grounds for refusal of recognition and enforcement of a foreign custody decision if it is found that the effects of the decision are manifestly incompatible with the fundamental principles of the law relating to the family and children in the State addressed.  Since the principle that the welfare of the child is paramount is a fundamental principle of our family law this will be applied where an Irish court is the court addressed.  Article 10 (1) (b) also protects the welfare of the child by providing that a State may refuse to return a child if it is found that, by reason of a change in circumstances including the passage of time but not including a mere change in the residence of the child after an improper removal, the effects of the original decision are manifestly no longer in accordance with the child's welfare.</P>
    <P>In the light of these very specific provisions in the conventions which are founded on the paramountcy of the child's welfare it is not necessary, nor indeed would it be proper, to require our High Court to deal with all applications under the conventions on the basis proposed in the amendment.  In many cases <Col N="773" /> the welfare of the child will be secured by an immediate order for its return under the speedy measures of the Hague Convention or the measures of the Luxembourg Convention which facilitate enforcement of foreign custody decisions.  In other cases were grounds for refusal are claimed by the defendant the specific provisions in this regard set out in the conventions will be looked at by the High Court.</P>
    <P>The amendment fails to address itself to the conventions which, as I have said, deal specifically with the welfare of the child.  I do not support the amendment which I consider to be misconceived.  I have, as I promised on Committee Stage, given the question of the welfare of the child in non-convention cases further consideration.</P>
    <P>I have looked again at the Law Reform Commission report and in particular the case law in this area since that report was published.  The point made in the commission's report, LRC 12-1985, is that certain judgments to which they refer do not provide a definitive statement of the circumstances in which an Irish court will order the return of a child to the jurisdiction whence it came without examination of the merits of the case. The report states that the judgements indicate that the principles applicable may be affected by the degree of comity with a particular jurisdiction.  The report emphasises, however, that the courts here are also bound to have regard to the interests of the children in abduction cases because section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, requires that the welfare of the child must be the first and paramount consideration in taking decisions on custody.</P>
    <P>The commission considered that our courts should not decide cases other than on the basis of their view of the welfare of the child.  The commission were speaking of cases other than those covered by the Hague Convention.  In those cases outside the Convention the commission made their recommendation that the court should be required to have regard to the welfare of the child as the first and <Col N="774" /> paramount consideration.  They suggested that the restatement, in legislation giving effect to the Hague Convention, of the principle contained in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, should be effective to remove doubts created by recent case law on this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out there have been developments in the courts since the commission's report was published some years ago.  In recent cases concerning child abduction the courts have emphasised that the welfare of the child is indeed the first and paramount consideration in proceedings relating to custody. The existence of a foreign custody order does not necessarily determine the issue although it may be a strong factor having regard to the doctrine of comity of courts.  Clearly, the fact that a custody order has been made by a foreign court does not prevent the issue being reopened before an Irish court and careful consideration being given to the evidence, in particular that concerning the welfare of the child.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, having looked at the various cases on the matter, that there is no uncertainty in the law about the application of the welfare principle enshrined in the Guardianship of Infants Act to child abduction cases.  On the other hand, to insert the amendment which was proposed on Committee Stage would, it seems to me, call into question the general applicability of section 3 of the 1964 Act in cases relating to the custody of children.  Such an amendment, as I have explained, is not necessary and it could lead to difficulties which do not exist at present as to the interpretation of section 3 of the 1964 Act.  The amendment before us, therefore, fails to address itself to the conventions which, as I said, deal specifically with the welfare of the child.  I do not support the amendment which I consider to be misconceived.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief, we are short of time and I should like to hear the Minister's response to our next amendment before we conclude the Bill. The Minister borrowed the preamble to both conventions suggesting that it lays <Col N="775" /> the matter beyond doubt but it should have been quoted at length because it would then be seen that it is nothing more than an aspiration which is motivating the contracting partners to move in the area. It states: &ldquo;firmly convinced that the interests of children are of paramount importance in matters relating to their custody&rdquo;.  That is the motivating factor and no more.  The issue about which the Law Reform Commission talked was that in specific disputes which can arise in deciding what is in the best interests of the child, the position of the child should be paramount.  That is the point but, unfortunately, the Minister has missed it. I must ask that the question be put.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;37.  &mdash;(1)  It shall be an offence to take, send or keep a child, under the age of sixteen years, who is habitually resident in the State, out of the jurisdiction in definance of a court order, or without the consent of each person who is a parent or guardian or to whom custody has been granted.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where a person has been charged with an offence under subsection (1), it shall be a defence to show that the defendant&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  honestly believed the child was over sixteen years of age,</P>
      <P>(ii)  obtained the consent of the requisite person or of the court,</P>
      <P>(iii)  has been unable to communicate with the requisite persons, having taken all reasonable steps, and there was reasonable grounds to believe that their consent would have been forthcoming, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iv)  being a parent, guardian or person having custody of the child had no intention to deprive others <Col N="776" /> having rights of guardianship or custody in relation to that child of those rights.</P>
    <P>(3)  No prosecution of an offence under this section shall be brought without the consent of the person in breach of whose rights that child was abducted out of the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>(4)  A person found guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both, or</P>
    <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This matter was also referred to on Committee Stage and the Minister gave an undertaking that he would reconsider the whole position for Report Stage.  The Minister does not appear to have tabled an amendment, perhaps he will accept mine?  Somehow I have my doubts, judging by the smile on his face.</P>
    <P>We debated this matter on Committee Stage.  The Minister refers to the Law Reform Commission report when it suits him, as he did in relation to the High Court, but he should now refer to Recommendation V of the same report which clearly indicated that the commission recommended that the offence involving the abduction of children should be an offence in relation to those under 16 years of age.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan's amendment &mdash; and mine &mdash; make special provisions where certain circumstances prevail where it would be inconceivable that one would press ahead with charges; those are outlined in subsection (2) and (3) of the amendment.  It is important that this House, as I said before, clearly indicated, loudly and clearly that we regard child abduction as a heinous offence.  It should be regarded as a criminal offence.  We should not pussyfoot around this matter, the reality is that we are not talking about <Col N="777" /> simply the question of marriage breakdown and perhaps a child being torn between parents.  If there is a misunderstanding, it is covered in subsection (2) of the amendment.  It is important that the House makes it clear that in circumstances which are nothing short of kidnapping those responsible should be charged and certain penalties imposed. For that reason &mdash; and because of the shortage of time &mdash; I ask the House to support the amendment in my name and the amendment tabled by Deputy McCartan as they are in accordance with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I undertook to Deputies on Committee Stage I have looked at this matter again.  Let me say at the outset that my first priority in this legislation &mdash; apart that is from enabling us to ratify these two very important conventions &mdash; is the welfare of the child.  I have examined the amendment from the viewpoint of whether what is proposed will be to the advantage of the child or children at the centre of these unfortunate cases of abduction.</P>
      <P>It is also important to note that the amendment is based on a change in the law in England which was brought in because it was thought that the offence of kidnapping did not apply as between a parent and child.  I very much doubt if that legislation would have been regarded as necessary if the House of Lords decision in R <i>v.</i> D, which decided that the offence of kidnapping did in fact apply as between a parent and child, had been available at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the arguments I advanced on Committee Stage against a special offence of child abduction was that it might be counter productive &mdash; that it might deter a parent who has abducted his or her child from returning voluntarily, and eliminate any possibility of reconciliation, or in the absence of a reconciliation, an agreed solution to the family's problems.  That argument was countered by the proposition that it would be up to &ldquo;the wronged spouse&rdquo; to consent to the prosecution.  I have <Col N="778" /> thought about this counter-argument since and it leaves me very uneasy.  It would be like the sword of Damocles in the hands of the wronged spouse and rather than assist in the voluntary return of the child or be an aid to reconciliation it might very well have the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>The criminal law in family matters can be a very blunt instrument and, in spite of the defences listed in the amendment, prosecutions could occur which might result in far more harm than good.  Not all abductions will be totally blameworthy. The Conventions themselves recognise that there will be cases where the child may not be returned to the country from which it has been abducted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, for the opportunity to raise in the House the chaos in the administration of the special employment schemes arising from the failure of the Government to provide sufficient funding.  This failure has led to widespread termination and disruption of existing schemes, with minimum notice, in the west Dublin-Kildare region in particular but also throughout the country. Badly needed projects are being abandoned and workers being sent back on the dole queues.  At a minimum the Government are guilty of incompetence; at worst of hypocrisy since these schemes are being terminated at the same time as the Government are obliged under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to bring forward a limited initiative, on a pilot basis, targeted at the long term unemployed.  How could the Government have got their figures so wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own constituency alone, several <Col N="779" /> badly needed projects are being abandoned and the organisers given minimal notice.  Indeed, in the case of the Tallaght Centre for the Unemployed the jobs of 20 persons are threatened from 5 April and they have only now been advised. Their dismissal will have a serious knockon effect for community projects elsewhere in Tallaght.  Also the jobs of 16 persons are threatened &mdash; six of them immediately, again with minimal notice &mdash; at Bohernabreena Community Enterprise. Fifteen persons are affected at the Alternative Entertainments Group in Tallaght.  Their scheme will finish on 23 March and they were advised only yesterday. I have received this evening the brochure of the European City of Culture 1991.  This Alternative Entertainments Group in Tallaght have only recently received funding from the Arts Council with a view to enabling them to participate in the City of Culture Year and they are now being signed to the dole queue from 23 March.  A very valuable project involving Barnardos at St. Muireann's House is also at risk and there is uncertainty concerning the impact of various county council sponsored schemes in the area.</P>
    <P>The impact of the FÁS circular for Tallaght alone must be viewed in the context of the relatively low uptake of the SES as a proportion of the unemployed in Tallaght and west Dublin generally compared to other regions of the country. I am awaiting later this week a specific response to a parliamentary question on this aspect, but from consultations with the trade unions I am satisfied that areas of greatest need such as Tallaght have the lowest uptake as a proportion of the live register.  Therefore, the disintegration of such schemes as are up and running in the west Dublin-Kildare region must not be allowed happen.  It would be grossly discriminatory against some of the worst employment black spots in Ireland if the Government fail to take immediate action to ensure the continuation of the schemes threatened. <Col N="780" /> Let me read two paragraphs of the circular to one project sponsor that issued only yesterday from FÁS:</P>
    <P>I regret to have to inform you that all recruitment to the above scheme, in the Dublin West and Kildare Region, has been temporarily suspended, effective immediately, due to budgetary constraints.  The decision, unfortunately, covers projects where written approval has already been issued and includes non-replacement of drop outs and of current participants on expiry of their 52 week participation should this predate termination of project date.</P>
    <P>In all cases participation will finish on current project expiry.  Results of the recent meeting of the Monitoring Committee on 20/2/91, will be withheld until we are in a position to cater for new start ups.  Should there be any relaxation in the situation, you will be notified immediately.  However, current indications are that recruitment will re-commence in September 1991.</P>
    <P>Any inconvenience to sponsors, participants and projects is very much regretted.</P>
    <P>I think it is incumbent on the Minister to take some immediate action to prevent such a tragedy for employment black-spots. It does not make economic sense because these people are going back on the dole queues where the cost to the State is at least as much as allowing the schemes to be revitalised and continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me apologise for the unavoidable absence of my colleague, Deputy Bertie Ahern, Minister for Labour.  However, I am glad to be here this evening to respond to Deputy Rabbitte's submission on the Adjournment. His submission was of a general nature in the beginning and then he narrowed it to the job areas he mentioned.  My reply will be of a general nature but part of it is expressly tailored to a point he raised which was the take-up percentage in his own area.  I know the Minister for Labour will be reading what the Deputy has said <Col N="781" /> and arising out of that he will be directly in touch with him.</P>
      <P>We all know the SES is an intervention to assist the long term unemployed.  It provides an opportunity for such persons to get a foothold back in the employment market.  We all, from whatever region in the country we come, have overcome our initial suspicion which was there when all these schemes were launched in 1985, which now seems so long ago.  The then Minister for Labour, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, brought in the proposal; I was the second speaker from the Opposition that day and I said I thought the schemes were a good idea.  Westmeath has been the county with the second largest take-up of the scheme.  That is only to say I have traced the progression of it.  We know that people must be over 25 years of age and what their income must be.  At the moment there are over 11,000 people on the SES involved with about 3,000 projects.  Those projects can be sponsored by voluntary agencies or public sector bodies.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer allocation in 1991 for the scheme is £58 million, an increase of over £7 million on the 1990 allocation. Together with the EC assistance of over £9 million an amount of £67 million will be provided in total for the SES in 1991. The level of expenditure will allow an average participation of 10,500.  That will vary up and down as participants come and go and schemes come to their 12 monthly end and others would not have started.  Everybody in the House will agree that the level of expenditure is significant. FÁS now operate on a regional basis with each region having its own budget to cover the provision of training and employment schemes in the area. This ensures a more equitable distribution of FÁS operations throughout the country resulting in some cases in requests for projects under the various schemes in parts of the country where a demand did not exist prior to the regionalisation process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am addressing now, because the Deputy stated this evening that previous to this there had been a slower take-up perhaps in the region to which he referred than there had been in other regions.  For that reason the Deputy felt that the process of the renewal of those schemes could be looked at in that guise.  I will bring that to the attention of the Minister for Labour.</P>
      <P>The level of funds available will allow about 10,500 people to be involved on projects throughout the country each week during the year.  Last year the child dependant allowance, which has proved very attractive to older unemployed people, was introduced.  Such people are now participating in the scheme in increasing numbers.  About 57 per cent of participants have adult and child dependants, compared with only 30 per cent at the end of 1989.  Those improvements had been sought for a long time and the suggestions had been put forward by unions and all sorts of interests throughout the country.  The social employment schemes have enhanced the value of the payments to the participants.</P>
      <P>The Minister is satisfied that participation in the scheme is very worthwhile and it helps people to improve their prospects of obtaining employment when opportunities arise.  There is the added bonus that the projects on which the participants work are of significant benefit to local communities.  The scheme has received universal favourable comment froms sponsors and participants and there has been heavy demand for more schemes from potential sponsors and participants.  We should remind oursleves that the scheme was introduced to help the long term unemployed to gain a foothold in the labour market.</P>
      <P>Projects which are likely to be ongoing would be well advised to look elsewhere for their staffing provisions towards the end of the 12 months of SES participation. The Minister for Labour is committed to making further improvements in the scheme as resources permit and he proposes to have a further review of the allowances and the numbers participating on an ongoing basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for choosing my question and I thank the Minister for coming in to take it.  The Dublin Dental Hospital was built in 1897. At the time it was purpose built for the conditions of the day and to cater for 2,500 patients per annum.  Today it caters for between 70,000 and 80,000 patients per annum.</P>
      <P>The hospital consists of two buildings, one the hospital proper and the other the administrative and library facilities.  To call the structure a hospital is a misnomer. The existing buildings and facilities have been condemned by official visitors representing the competent authorities for both Ireland and the UK as outmoded, cramped, hazardous and unacceptable.  There are more patients treated every fortnight than was initially intended as the overall complement for the year.  The building is a multi-storey fire hazard.  Despite repeated warnings from the fire officer and despite the installation of fire doors and alarms, it is an extremely dangerous structure.  Having seen it I am convinced that it is a potential inferno should a fire break out.</P>
      <P>A former secretary of the Higher Education Authority described the hospital as the worst facility in third level education.  That is no exaggeration.  Following a threat by the UK General Dental Council to withdraw recognition of the Dublin Dental Degree, the Government promised in 1963 that a new hospital would be completed by 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited the hospital today.  Up to a dozen people were administering dental treatment in rooms of only 200 square <Col N="784" /> feet.  Those awaiting treatment are actually looking at treatment being administered to other patients.  The patients are queueing in annexes and corridors.  In the X-ray department patients have collapsed during busy sessions due to overcrowding. There is no central sterile supply area, an essential feature given the hazards of cross infection in such conditions.  Because of the nature of many dental procedures, extreme care has to be taken in relation to such ailments as AIDS and hepatitis.  There is no lift in the building and wheelchair patients have to be carried up a narrow stairway to the top storey for treatment. The isolation of the Dublin Dental Hospital from general hospital facilities results in patients and staff having to attend eight centres around Dublin for certain types of treatment.  There are very limited back-up facilities in case of emergency.</P>
    <P>Successive reports from visitors sent to inspect the training programme and facilities of the Dublin Dental Hospital have all condemned the building as being unacceptable.  While the programme has been complimented, the institution has been referred to as &ldquo;hazardous, a slum, a rabbit warren&rdquo;.  One group of visitors from the British and Irish Specialist Advisory Committee for Higher Training in Dentistry described the laboratory facilities as barbaric.  Large parts of the building are reeking with dry rot.  The masonry on the front of the building is extremely dangerous and the replacement cost is estimated at £100,000.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the staff at the hospital and indeed, to the undergraduates there. Sixty per cent of the patients treated there are medical card holders.  Treatment includes orthodontics, oral surgery and oral rehabilitation.  The staff provide dental treatment for prisoners in all six Dublin penal institutions.  This is quite taxing as there is a high HIV infection level among prisoners, particularly among those who are intravenous drug abusers.  Staff provide treatment for patients from drug rehabilitation units. The hospital is a referral centre for dental <Col N="785" /> and maxillo-facial problems for the entire country.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the Dublin Dental Hospital is a vital and integral part of the dental service of the nation, yet it is expected to exist in what can only be described as atrociously sub-standard conditions.  Each year the hospital trains between 35 and 40 dental surgeons.  It also provides courses for undergraduates in dental science, post-graduate degree programmes, training programmes for the Dental Fellowship Examinations of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of London, Dublin, Edinburgh and Glasgow, a diploma programme training dental teachers and public dental officers for developing countries.  It trains dental nurses and dental technicians to the highest possible standard.  It continues to push out the frontiers of research in all areas of dental science.</P>
    <P>It is incredible, when one sees the generally high level of third level institution at RTC, DIT and university level, to understand how the Dublin Dental Hospital has been permitted to languish in such squalor over such a considerable period of time particularly when one considers the enormous saving to the State in the provision of dental treatment to over 80,000 patients per annum, many of whom are treated by students.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Minister for Education to put the provision of a new dental hospital high on her agenda of priorities.  Without wishing to denigrate the present development of Carysfort College, I honestly believe that this should have a far higher priority rating than Carysfort.  I also look at rationalisation and other savings that are taking place and particularly at the reducation of numbers to teacher training colleges. What we are talking about here is a commitment of £15 million pounds to a new, modern state of the art purpose-built Dental Hospital at St. James' Hospital. The plans are there, the site is there and the need is there.  The existing school has been designated by the World Health Organisation as one of the very few collaborating centres for dental education. It is in this capacity that members of staff <Col N="786" /> are asked to advise other schools and Governments on education and health service matters.</P>
    <P>Recently the International Association for Dental Research held a meeting of 1,700 delegates in Dublin.  In 1991 people from all over the world will come to the Dental School meeting celebrating Trinity College's 100th anniversary.  What a pity that instead of an up-to-date, functional and modern dental hospital on a par with the excellence and high standard of work carried on there, we have a building of which we can be truly ashamed.</P>

      <P>The need for a new dental hospital and school to replace the existing inadequate facilities has been accepted for a long time, indeed for 23 or 24 years. To comply with the fire regulations would cost about £2 million and those modifications would result only in a temporary solution.  We would still not have a premises which was clinically correct as well as a safe facility or an adequate training environment.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of providing a new hospital and school on the site is £14 million at 1990 prices.  This figure would include the furniture, equipment and fees but would exclude the £1.5 million already incurred on the site of the development, and the design fees.</P>
      <P>While this project, when it comes about, will be financed through my Department, we do not make the decision on the necessity or otherwise of such a facility or on what will be in it.  That is a matter for the Minister for Health. Because it is a third level facility the funding will be under my Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987 the Minister for Health was asked to report on the need for a dental hospital in Dublin.  The Department of Health have confirmed that they are satisfied that a dental hospital/school is <Col N="787" /> needed in Dublin, both in relation to the range and nature of the specialist services it provides and the extent of its patient needs.  This is where the Department of Health come in because naturally my Department would not have the expertise to deal with the matter.  It is also justified by the Department of Health in the context of the desired dentist population ratio.</P>
    <P>Approximately 80,000 patient visits are made to the hospital annually and a high proportion of these are made by medical card holders.  It satisfies the needs of those who require training, out patients and those who have no other way of getting dental care.  The hospital also provides treatment for haemophiliacs, HIV positive patients, prisoners and other medically and socially disadvantaged people, many of whom would not otherwise obtain treatment.  The number of patients treated could be increased to about 120,000 per year in a new building.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing training for about 200 undergraduate and post-graduate dentist students, the facility proposed for Dublin would also cater for 75 para-dentist students while the library and lecture facilities would be used by students in St. James's Hospital.  It is accepted that the case for a new dental hospital is well established and, as I said, this is based on the observations of the Department of Health.  However the question of providing such a facility has now to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred to the question of third level enrolments which have increased by almost 28,000 to a total of 70,000 this year, an increase of 66 per cent during the decade.  A capital provision of £14 million for a college which would cater for 200 full-time students must be subjected to a thorough scrutiny in the context of priorities.  My Department, with the Department of Health, are pursuing as a matter of urgency the question of how to address the present highly unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>The need for such a hospital has been assessed by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> Our provision, in student terms, is very modest compared with the provision by the Department of Health who provide a great many services each year.  This matter has to be worked out carefully so that the division of costings can be done in an equitable manner.  It would be odd if we were to provide from our own budget a facility which would be used in the main by public patients.  These are matters which must be addressed by the two Departments involved.</P>
    <P>I have had several meetings with Derry Shanley who has impressed me greatly by the way he has stuck with the case in very difficult circumstances.  I, too, have visited the hospital and was not satisfied with what I saw.  I have already spoken to the Minister for Health about the matter but we will now have to address the matter with greater urgency.  I hope we will speak about this matter again in the House and I thank the Deputy for raising it.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this very important and serious matter at this late hour and I hope that the Minister of State understands just how important this issue is for my constituency and for the south-east region. What is at issue is the Barrow Railway Bridge which is the main access point to the port of New Ross and the main railway link from Wexford to Waterford and the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Thursday, 7 March, a vessel, the mv <i>Amy</i>, struck the Barrow Railway Bridge which was immediately closed. Unfortunately, despite frantic efforts over the weekend, the New Ross Harbour Commissioners failed to reach agreement with Irish Rail to have the rail link, or more importantly, the sea link opened.  The Barrow Railway Bridge spans the river and allows access to the port of New Ross and it was closed from last Thursday until 2.15 p.m. this afternoon. After many hours of negotiation right through the weekend between the <Col N="789" /> New Ross Harbour Commissioners and the board of CIE, agreement was finally reached to allow limited access using part of the bridge.</P>
    <P>At the time of opening at 2.15 p.m. this afternoon 14 vessels were waiting to gain access to the port while seven vessels were waiting inside the port.  Under the very limited agreement, which allows only daylight tides or a slack tide to be used for navigation purposes, only three of the 14 vessels have gained access to the port while two of the seven vessels inside the port have been allowed to exit. One can imagine what effect the narrowing of the access routes has had on the important facilities in New Ross, unfortunately, this is not the first time this has happened.  This bridge is 100 years old and was built when there were no vessels of the size, scale and capacity now using the Barrow River.</P>
    <P>New Ross is an unemployment black spot.  It is the black spot of County Wexford which, in turn, is the black spot of the county.  In real terms, County Wexford has the third highest level of unemployment in the country and of all the towns and urban centres in County Wexford, New Ross has the highest level of unemployment.  Therefore, any disruption of commerce in New Ross would be a devastating blow to the area.  This crisis for New Ross has been ameliorated to a small degree but this problem will recur until CIE and the Minister agree to upgrade the Barrow Railway Bridge so that modern vessels can navigate it with a fair degree of leeway, otherwise there will always be the danger of accidents recurring.</P>
    <P>As well as the sea lanes, the railway link has also been affected.  The rail link is the main artery from the busy port of Rosslare which is currently the busiest ferry port in the country.  Over one million passengers passed through it last year.  Many of those who use it want to travel by rail to the west, to the scenic spots in Killarney, Kerry and Cork and I am sure the Minister of State would be <Col N="790" /> anxious that they use the railways to get to his part of the world.</P>

      <P>However, it appears to be the deliberate policy of Irish Rail to downgrade the line, and there would be a certain glee if it was taken out of action completely.  If commerce is to be maintained and the tourism potential of the south-east, indeed of the whole country is to be developed, the rail link must be improved and strengthened.</P>

      <P>At approximately 9 p.m. on Thursday, 7 March, a Dutch vessel the mv <i>Amy</i> struck the opening span of the Barrow railway bridge and the dolphin barrier protecting its supporting structure while entering the Port of New Ross.</P>
      <P>The port access was immediately closed by Iarnród Éireann in the interests of safety and in order to undertake a preliminary assessment of the extent of damage to the bridge and supporting structure.</P>
      <P>It became evident that the bridge span could not be repositioned to its precise level and alignment which would allow rail traffic to traverse the bridge.  The impact of the ship against the bridge structure severely damaged the main supporting structure of the bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A thorough assessment of the damaged <Col N="791" /> bridge was undertaken by Iarnród Éireann engineers and it became clear during the course of the examination that on the basis of the damage to the bridge and supporting structure, no further ships could be allowed access to the port until a safe method of operating the ships could be agreed with the New Ross Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to notify the House that Iarnród Éireann and the Harbour Commissioners have now devised arrangements which will permit all ships to enter and leave the port under revised working arrangements as and from 1.45 p.m. today.  That is my information.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the damage to the bridge and supporting structure the rail service between Campile and Waterford has been suspended for safety reasons until the bridge is fully repaired.  It is expected that the repair works will be completed in three to four weeks' time. In the interim, a bus service will be provided between Wellington Bridge and Waterford City to facilitate passengers travelling between Rosslare and Limerick Junction.  Arrangements are also being made to provide substitute road freight services in the area.  These measures will ensure that the local and national economy is not unduly affected by the closure of the bridge.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to commend Iarnród Éireann and their staff on the prompt action which was taken to guarantee the safety of the bridge in this case.</P>

      <P>The Senior College, Ballyfermot, provides an excellent one-year animation course dealing with all aspects of animation work.  The standard is recognised by those in the TV and film world as being of top quality.  The course in question is largely populated by students who did not succeed in getting into other third level institutions.  Many of them come from different parts of Ireland.  The cost involved in terms of maintenance and accommodation is the same as that encounterd by somebody attending Trinty College, Dublin, University College, Dublin, or any of the DITs.  Yet 34,000 students attending universities, RTCs and other third level institutions enjoy a range of scholarships from higher education grants to VEC grants and European Social Funding.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that Ballyfermot School is not an RTC or a DIT or a university but it provides what should be termed a third level qualification which deserves formal recognition as such and therefore, should be entitled to some funding, particularly ESF funding.  I urge the Minister to have the matter seriously examined with a view to bringing the course in question within the scope and range of the ESF.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Wednesday in Dún Laoghaire District Court, District Justice Hubert Wine dealt with the case of a 15-year-old boy.  The accused youngster had been remanded in custody for the previous three weeks in St. Michael's House for assessment purposes because Trinity House was unable to take him.  The judge referred in anger to the fact that one year previously the Minister for Justice promised that a site for a detention centre was in place and the impression given was that the detention centre was about to go ahead.  Twelve months later not a brick was in place.  Recently we had a desperate mother picketing the Department of Justice because there was no place for her 15-year-old son.  Tonight there are two 15-year-old girls in Mountjoy.  I know these people are guilty of crimes of violence. I am not excusing their crimes.  I am saying that the rotating door policy or the policy of having no door simply has to stop.  Putting these people back on <Col N="793" /> the streets in defeatist.  There should be a detention centre for them in suitable, secure surroundings with therapeutic facilities and specially staffed to give them a second chance.  Why it has not been provided to date baffles me.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that certain works are required at St. Kevin's School, Sallynoggin in order to facilitate the merger of St. Kevin's Primary School and St. Kevin's Infant School.  There has been a delay in carrying out the works and the parents, teachers and board of management are concerned that the work will not be done in time for the schools to merge next September.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that her Department and the Office of Public Works speed up this matter to ensure that the necessary and agreed works are carried out between now and 1 September.  These works were agreed initially between her and a deputation from the school and subsequently between officials of her Department and the board of management.  Everybody concerned is becoming quite upset that the works have not yet been carried out. The Minister is probably aware that recently there was a protest outside the school by the parents.  I would ask her to intervene to ensure that the works are carried out, thereby enabling the schools to merge next September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Deputy in praising Ballyfermot Senior College in establishing expertise in this area.  Throughout the country there are 24,000 students on VPT, 65 per cent funded from Europe and 35 from national funding.  Maintenance allowances would mean that the number of young people participating in courses would have to be sharply reduced.  The excellence of the courses is of enormous benefit to young people and it is better to have as many courses as possible and as many participants as possible. There are no plans to allow maintenance. If one had money it would be the proper thing to do.  The courses are of enormous benefit to young people.  We <Col N="794" /> are delighted that European funding and national funding combine to produce such excellent courses which offer job prospects.  There are no immediate plans for a maintenance allowance for young people doing these courses, much as we would wish it.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the ongoing need for a detention centre.  A new residential school to house 200 young female offenders is being planned, to be located at Finglas Children's Centre.  Arrangements are being made in the interim to have a portion of the former Ard Scoil Mhuire school premises at Lusk, County Dublin, refurbished to meet the current demand for places for girls.  This arrangement will make a further eight places available for girls in addition to the seven places currently provided at Oberstown Girls' Centre.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are also proceeding to refurbish the remaining facilities at Ard Scoil Mhuire to provide 36 places for boys initially.  I do not know why these facilities were closed in the mid-eighties. This number will be capable of being further supplemented when the new girls' centre becomes available in Finglas and the girls' units in Ard Mhuire become vacant as a result.  The refurbishment of Ard Scoil Mhuire will be completed this summer.  That is the interim arrangement. The longer-term arrangement is at the planning stage.  I share the unease about the matter.  We are anxious that the educational facilities to be provided in those centres will be of the highest order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third matter was raised by Deputy Gilmore, the amalgamation of the three schools, St. Kevin's boys, St. Kevin's girls and the infants' schools at Sallynoggin.  I met with a deputation on the matter.  It is a very good idea that the schools should come together and share facilities.  We have approved a scheme of improvements to facilitate the amalgamation. Tender documents for the project are well advanced and these will be completed at the earliest possible date when the school authorities will be informed. I expect they will have to get by-law <Col N="795" /> approval and I am sure the Deputy will be following that up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The project is proceeding.  Both management, parents and the Department thought initially it would be a simple project of amalgamation.  It is a very good idea that the three schools are coming <Col N="796" /> together and teachers, pupils and parents will benefit.  We will see what we can do to help along the various stages that now remain.  I am as anxious as the Deputy is to see it in motion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 107 together.</P>

As I told the House during the debate on the Private Members' Motion on 26 February, the Government have <Col N="538" /> given two clear commitments regarding the level of services: firstly, the Government set the approved number of acute hospital beds at 12,000 in 1990.  Apart from the normal seasonal closures, this level of bed availability will be maintained during 1991; and secondly, all services will be maintained at not less than the levels approved for 1990.</P>

The brief includes provision for the location of a day hospital, assessment unit, rehabilitation unit and heavy dependent nursing units on the site of the Cavan General Hospital at Lisdarn.  Approval to proceed with the appointment of a design team is under consideration in my Department at present.  The project will be considered in line with available resources and other competing projects included in the Department's capital programme for 1991.

      <P>The recent NESC report <i>A Strategy for the Nineties,</i> includes a valuable analysis of the key issues in health policy, and its conclusions provided an important input to the formulation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>The report discusses trends in public health expenditure, drawing in particular on the earlier work of the Commission on Health Funding, and arrives at a conclusion which may usefully be quoted in full:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, it must be acknowledged that any definitive discussion of the level of health care spending would require more detailed information and analysis than is possible to provide here.  However, it would be difficult in the Council's view to sustain the <Col N="543" /> argument that public health spending should increase before the reforms proposed by the Commission are put in place.</P>
    <P>As that quotation makes clear, the context of the NESC recommendation is their view that the structural deficiencies in the management of the health care system, which were identified by the commission, should be addressed before there is any real increase in the level of funding.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> sets out the principles upon which the Government are basing their proposals for structural reform in the management of the health services. These proposals will be announced later in the year and will address the deficiencies referred to by NESC and by the Commission on Health Funding.</P>
    <P>The allocation of resources to the health services in future years will depend on service needs and development priorities, within the overall public expenditure constraints.  The question of whether increases in real terms are appropriate will be determined from year to year on the basis of these considerations.</P>

      <P>In order to restore activity to the previously agreed annual target figure of 750, I have provided special funds for the provision of ten additional cardiac beds which, I have been informed by the hospital, are now coming into operation on 2 April 1991.  The total costs involved in that project are very considerable &mdash; £235,000 for renovation and upgrading, £186,000 for equipment and £400,000 annual staffing costs.</P>

    <P>The admission of a patient to hospital for cardiac surgery is, of course, a clinical decision taken by the consultant concerned and is based on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.</P>

      <P>The Government's approach has always been that all persons suffering from AIDS and HIV infection should be cared for as part of the mainstream health services within an integrated framework of community, primary care, respite, hospice and acute hospital services.  I am satisfied that adequate funding is being made available for these services through the financial allocations to the agencies concerned.  A total of £2.2 million has <Col N="550" /> also been allocated from national lottery funds for AIDS-related projects to a range of agencies including the AIDS fund, the Eastern Health Board, St. James's Hospital, the Coombe Hospital and Cork AIDS Action Alliance.</P>
      <P>In addition to this funding, the Government made in 1989, specific allocations totalling £1.25 million to the AIDS Fund and to the HIV Haemophiliac Trust, to alleviate the hardship of all persons with HIV.  These moneys, which were made available without prejudice, are being distributed to individuals on the basis of need.</P>
      <P>The Government's task is to ensure that all AIDS sufferers have ready access to the full range of services required for their care and treatment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of my views that the medical profession have a pivotal role in the provision of preventive medical health care services and particularly in the wider health promotion area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical profession is very much involved in the delivery of the various services provided under both the community protection programme and the community health services programme. The community protection programme encompasses such services as child development services, immunisation programmes, food hygiene and school health services.  The community health services programme includes, <i>inter alia,</i> the general medical services, community nursing services and maternity and infant care <Col N="552" /> services.  Significant resources are being made available this year to continue the development of these services as a major contribution to the prevention of disease and disability and to ensure that patients are dealt with at the appropriate level.</P>
    <P>The prevalence of many serious illnesses today can be reduced significantly through improved lifestyle decisions.  The Deputy will be aware of the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> on promoting positive health which will continue to inform the Government's decision-making in all areas of health care.</P>
    <P>The need to develop an enhanced role for the medical profession in the wider area of health promotion is acknowledged internationally.  Specifically, reduction in tobacco consumption and healthy nutrition have been identified by the WHO as important areas in which the greater role of the medical profession should be pursued.  In that regard the health promotion unit of my Department, in association with the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Irish Cancer Society, will develop, this year, an anti-smoking programme for use by medical practitioners in their contact with patients/clients.  In addition, I will be launching shortly a five year action plan on nutrition health promotion which will provide for a key role for the medical profession in promoting healthy eating.</P>
    <P>On the question of resources for health promotion, the health promotion unit will receive this year an additional 20 per cent in their allocation compared with last year's allocation.  I will also be increasing substantially the unit's allocation from my Department's national lottery funding.</P>

      <P>In line with the recommendations contained in <i>Planning for the Future,</i> the Eastern Health Board are at present developing a community based alcoholism treatment programme with a number of treatment facilities based at strategic locations in the board's functional area.  The emphasis in the programme will be on detoxification and treatment of alcoholism and after care.  I have been informed by the Eastern Health Board that they have reviewed the operation of St. Dympna's Unit in the context of these developments and they have decided to transfer the residential component of the alcoholism service from St. Dympna's to an alternative location for the purposes of integrating it with the day treatment programme for alcoholism provided at the Stanhope Street Treatment Centre. It is the board's intention to develop St. Dympna's as a mental health centre to serve the general psychiatric services in the Cabra area.  The purpose of this reorganisation is to make the board's alcoholism treatment services more accessible and to improve the board's overall community psychiatric services.</P>

      <P>I have been following political development in Mozambique attentively over the past year.  I believe it right to commend President Chissano on the manner in which he has steered the process of political reform in his country and <Col N="567" /> on his achievements in the establishment of full participatory democracy in Mozambique.  He is also to be commended on the positive stance by the Mozambican Government in the search for a resolution through peaceful means of the conflict in the country.</P>
      <P>I welcome the adoption on 30 November 1990 by the People's Assembly, following extensive popular consultation and debate in the Assembly, of a new Constitution for the Republic of Mozambique, establishing a democratic State.  The Constitution guarantees, among other things, such fundamental rights as universal sufferage, freedom of association, including the right to form and join political parties, freedom of religion, and equality before the law under an independent judiciary.  While the terms of the new Constitution place the ownership of land in the State, provision is made for individuals or collective entities to be granted the right to use land. The terms for the creation of land rights are to be established by law.</P>
      <P>Under the new Constitution, legislation providing for the creation of political parties was enacted in December and direct elections to the Presidency and the Assembly are scheduled for 1991.  These various steps meet the major demands of RENAMO and it is now up to them to demonstrate their commitment to peace and to engage fully in negotiations on the future of Mozambique.</P>
      <P>As I have stated in response to previous questions on South African support for RENAMO, the Government of South Africa have stated that they no longer provide assistance to RENAMO and we welcome this.  There remains a concern, however, that elements in and outside South Africa, who are not interested in promoting the democratic process in either Mozambique or South Africa, are continuing to support RENAMO.

    <P>The member states of the Community have stated on a number of occasions <Col N="568" /> their readiness to assist in the reconstruction and development of Mozambique. Mozambique already benefits from Community development assistance through its membership of the Lomé Convention and is expected to benefit from increased financial aid under the Fourth Lomé Convention. Because of the continuing conflict in the country, however, Mozambique has not been able to experience the full benefits of this assistance.  It is my strong desire that Mozambique may soon be able to enjoy, free from all outside interference, the benefits of such assistance, of which it stands in great need.</P>
    <P>Aware of the needs of the populations of Mozambique, the Government have within the past year allocated £50,000 from the Disaster Relief Fund to UN agencies operating emergency relief programmes in favour of displaced persons and refugees.  Applications for further assistance will be considered.</P>
    <P>Under the Bilateral Aid Programme fellowship scheme, Ireland is also currently financing the course of study in Ireland of one Mozambique fellow.  Fellowships are granted on the basis of applications received.</P>
    <P>Under the NGO Co-Financing Scheme, a grant of £36,143 was paid in 1989 to Concern towards an aid project in Nampula city.  No applications for co-financing of projects in Mozambique under the scheme were received in 1990. Two applications have been received to date in 1991 and these are currently under consideration.</P>

      <P>I am aware of reports that the Phnom Penh administration have announced plans to hold elections in June <Col N="569" /> 1992.  It is my view that the UN plan for a comprehensive settlement in Cambodia, which contains detailed provisions for the holding of UN-supervised elections, remains the best chance for a just and lasting solution to this tragic conflict.  It is important that all parties to the Cambodian question abide by the proposals of the UN plan.  This plan has received the unanimous endorsement of the Security Council and the General Assembly.  The essence of the UN plan is to empower the people of Cambodia to decide their own future in a free and neutral environment and choose their own leaders in free and fair elections.</P>

      <P>The tax provisions relating to mining activities are both extensive and very detailed and, accordingly, cannot be comprehensively covered in this reply. However, the following is an outline of the principal features:</P>
      <P>(i) Section 245 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, provides for a mine development allowance in respect of certain capital expenditure incurred in connection with a mine including, subject to certain exceptions, the expenditure on development of the mine.  The mine must be concerned with any scheduled mineral, mineral compound or mineral substance as defined in section 2 of the Minerals Development Act, 1940.</P>
      <P>(ii) The Finance (Taxation of Profits of Certain Mines) Act, 1974, provides for tax allowances in respect of expenditure incurred in exploring for scheduled minerals but only where the exploration is done in conjunction with the working of a mine.  Scheduled minerals are defined as meaning those in Schedule 13 to the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii) Section 39 of the Finance Act, 1990, provides for the deduction of exploration expenditure (incurred on or after 1/4/90) of prospecting companies from any future income of those companies from a trade of working a mine.  Exploration company is defined <Col N="571" /> as a company, the business of which for the time being consists primarily of exploring for scheduled minerals.</P>
    <P>(iv) Where the person working the mine is a company, the company will be chargeable in the normal way to corporation tax at the rate of 43 per cent (40 per cent from 1/4/91) on its mining profits.</P>
    <P>In the case of an unincorporated person working a mine, the individual will be chargeable to income tax in the normal way at the appropriate rate(s) on the excess of his income over his allowable expenses, tax-free allowances and reliefs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to employees my reply of <Col N="573" /> 5 March sets out the position.  Employers are entitled to confidentiality in relation to their taxation affairs so, for example, if an employee seeks information on payments of PRSI made by their employer to Revenue, the commissioners are precluded from disclosing it.  However, every employee is entitled by law to be given a Form P.60 by his/her employer on 6 April for the tax year just ended, which sets out his/her gross pay, PAYE and PRSI deductions, the number of weeks worked and the PRSI deduction class.</P>
    <P>Employers are required to transmit this information in respect of each of their employees to the Revenue Commissioners on Form P.35 by 30 April for the tax year ending on 5 April.  Relevant information from this document is then transmitted to the Department of Social Welfare by the commissioners.  The commissioners are not supplied with individual employee details by an employer during the course of the current tax year.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the way it is proposed to implement a condition of the ewe premium scheme whereby flock owners will be obliged to inform his Department of the loss of an animal within ten days of same; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that it is impossible to fulfil this regulation in mountainous areas of Ireland; and if he will ensure that common sense will be observed in this matter.</Quest>

      <P>The EC condition referred to specifies that applicants under the EC ewe premium scheme must notify my Department of any losses of ewes within ten days of discovery of such losses &mdash; not within ten days of the losses themselves as the Deputy states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this vital distinction clarifies the matter and makes it easy for flock owners to observe the requirement in question.  In this regard the 100 days retention period under the ewe premium scheme &mdash; during which each loss discovered is to be notified to my Department &mdash; overlaps with the lambing period for mountain flocks and, given that flock owners will be going on the mountains <Col N="584" /> during this period to bring down their ewes for lambing and will discover some dead ewes in the process, it seems to me that mountain flock owners should have no great difficulty in notifying losses within ten days of discovery as required. It is accepted that a small number of losses may not be detected until the date of inspection under the scheme and, in such cases, notification on that date will suffice.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this scheme is fully funded by the EC and that the conditions of the scheme must be strictly adhered to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Deputy of what I have said in this House on numerous occasions, in that, as the insurance supervisory authority I have a responsibility to ensure that insurance companies meet their statutory solvency and reserve requirements.  I do not have responsibility for the day to day operations of insurance companies. Therefore, I must respect the right of insurance companies to make their own underwriting decisions in the light of their particular circumstances and assessment of the market.</P>
      <P>In 1988, insurers sustained underwriting losses of £48 million on their motor portfolios, the corresponding figure for 1989 was more than double that at £116 million and is expected to be even higher for 1990.  Confronted with losses of this magnitude and in order to maintain their viability, insurers have considered it necessary to increase their premiums in line with their claims experience and/or to exercise more selectivity in the type of risk undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of motor insurance for young <Col N="585" /> drivers tends to reflect the claims experience of motor insurers.  Statistical evidence has shown that they are more likely to be involved in accidents and, therefore, to cause claims.  These claims can only be met by insurers if an adequate premium is forthcoming to cover the risk involved and one cannot expect the cost of insurance to come down or even stabilise when the number of accidents/claims and the cost of those claims are going in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>Having said this, however, I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by motorists at present and in particular the problems being faced by young drivers. In the context of improving the environment for insurance the Government have set up an inter-ministerial group to examine ways and means of improving the environment for motor insurance in particular. This group are focusing on strict and sustained enforcement of existing road traffic legislation, amendments to the Road Traffic Acts designed to reduce the motor accident rate, suggestions to improve the cost and availability of motor insurance and improvements/alternatives to the courts system for the resolution of personal injury claims.  I am hopeful that this will result in a number of positive proposals which can be implemented in the very early future.  I would add, however, that Government action of itself will not reduce or stabilise motor insurance costs.  Consumers must play their part by increased awareness of the need for safety.</P>

Since the imposition of provisional anti-dumping duties in November last on Aspartame entering the Community, the US exporter &mdash; the Nutrasweet Company &mdash; have entered into discussions with the EC Commission.  Until these discussions have been completed, it would be inappropriate to speculate on their possible outcome.

      <P>Before a Community position is finalised all member states, including Ireland, will be given a further opportunity to make their views known in this case.  I can assure the House that, in considering the best approach to be adopted by Ireland in the matter, I will take fully into account the interests of both consumers and user industry here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first stage in an application for a State mining lease is the obtaining of full planning permission for the proposed development together with the appropriate licence under the Water Pollution Acts 1977 to 1990 and the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  As part of the planning process an environment impact statement must be submitted.  This must be referred by the local authority to my Department for comment in accordance with the Local Government Planning and Development Regulations, 1990 (SI No. 25 of 1990).</P>
      <P>It is only when the above permission has been granted that I will consider an application for a mining lease or licence. The applicant must demonstrate to me that: the development is economically viable; he has the necessary financial, technical, environmental and other capabilities which I deem necessary to undertake a successful and acceptable development; insurance bonds will be provided that are sufficient to indemnify me against any third party claims arising from the development and to cover the cost of restoring the site in the event of the developer failing to do so.</P>
      <P>I also require that an environmental impact assessment be carried out by an independent expert acceptable to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the applicant complies with all of the above I will make an offer in principle of a lease subject to the provisions of section 18 of the Minerals Development Act, 1979.  (This section provides, first, for public notice of the Minister's intention to grant a lease and, secondly, public notice to any person entitled to any estate or interest in the minerals to claim compensation). The offer incorporates the principal conditions on which I am prepared to grant a lease viz: the duration of the lease, the return to the State (i.e. dead rent, royalites etc.) environmental conditions, insurance cover, costs to be borne by the developer and processing fee.  On acceptance of the offer and following compliance with the provisions of section 18 of the Act including the consideration of any objections received, a <Col N="590" /> draft State mining lease, or licence as is appropriate, incorporating all conditions is agreed with the applicant, finalised, signed and issued.</P>
    <P>A State mining lease provides for a minimum period in each year from the date of commencement of the lease within which the demised minerals must be worked.  This has the effect of requiring that mining commences within a specified period following the grant of the lease.  A forfeiture clause is also included in the event of failure by the developer to comply with the terms and conditions of the lease.  In a situation where a lessee fails to undertake the development of the demised minerals or does not work them for the full required period during any particular year, the revoking of the lease is an option available to me.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>There are no immediate plans to rebuild the jetty at the Whiddy terminal. As part of the overall strategy to make Whiddy more attractive to prospective investors, Bantry Terminals Ltd. sought and received planning permission for the construction of two single point moorings, which would allow a greater range of large crude tankers to unload at Whiddy.</P>
      <P>Future developments at Whiddy will depend on finding a suitable investor.  I am continuing in my efforts to find such an investor and until firm proposals for development of the terminal at Whiddy Island are accepted by the Government, I would not be in a position to indicate future levels of activity, employment and the costs arising from such development. My aim would be to maximise the terminal's use because of its importance both as a strategic asset and to the local economy.</P>

      <P>The Whiddy oil terminal is State owned and <Col N="593" /> has not been used for commercial storage of oil for a number of years.  It was, however, reactivated in September 1990 to store additional reserves of crude oil as a safeguard against any shortfall which could have arisen as a result of the Gulf situation.</P>
      <P>Apart from initial preparatory costs, notably improved safety measures, and staffing expenses, which would have arisen in any event, the costs associated with the present storage of crude at Whiddy are less than $1 per tonne per month.  There is, in addition, the interest cost on the loans cost of the stocks in question.  These costs compare favourably with average storage costs in western Europe for crude oil tankage which normally range from $2-3 per tonne per month.</P>

    <P>The total amount of reimbursements to employers of supplementary benefit paid to insured workers in the period was £933,061.  The opening balance on the fund at 1 January 1985 was £224,962 leaving a surplus on termination of £27,159.</P>
    <P>The surplus of £27,159 was transferred to the Social Welfare Vote as an appropriation-in-aid, and in partial repayment of the substantial Exchequer contribution made to the supplementary unemployment fund in 1985.  Similarly, further sums, amounting to £4,690 and £14,944 in respect of contribution arrears were received, as a result of successful legal action, for crediting to the Social Welfare Vote in 1989 and 1990, respectively.  Further sums, amounting in total to £48,711 are the subject of court orders as a result of successful legal action, and may therefore be received in future.</P>
    <P>No further claims for supplementary benefit are expected.</P>
    <P>The final account of the fund has been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The account is currently with the printers and will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.</P>

      <P>The social welfare services office in Newcastle West is already carrying out many of the functions of a one stop shop. The office is linked to my Department's computer inquiry system, INFONET, so that clients can now get up-to-date information on their social welfare claims and entitlements.

      <P>The social welfare services office in Listowel is also linked to INFONET and accepts medical certificates.  In addition, there is an information officer in the office to deal with clients' social welfare inquiries. There is also a social welfare officer in this office to carry out on-the-spot assessment interviews for means-tested schemes.</P>
      <P>Both offices will continue to be responsible for the provision of social welfare services in their respective areas.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 11 April 1990 to 18 June 1990.  He also received pay-related benefit.  He claimed injury benefit on 13 August 1990 in respect of an accident at work on 6 April 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On investigation, his employers denied that the reported accident had happened. The claim was referred to the social welfare officer for investigation and on receipt of his report, the claim was <Col N="601" /> allowed.  Injury benefit was awarded from 7 April 1990 to 18 June 1990 &mdash; the period in respect of which he had received disability benefit &mdash; and from 13 August 1990 to 4 October 1990, the end of the 26 week injury benefit period from the date of accident.  He was also awarded pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>The delay in deciding the injury benefit claim arose because the claimant did not indicate that his first claim, in April 1990, was for injury benefit.  Arrears due for the period 13 August 1990 to 4 October 1990 issued on 8 March 1991.  The amount paid was adjusted to recover an overpayment of benefit which occurred in 1985.  Arrears due for the period 7 April 1990 to 18 June 1990 issued on 11 March 1991.</P>
    <P>He is currently in receipt of disability benefit and pay-related benefit.  It is open to the claimant to claim disablement benefit if, as a result of the accident, he has suffered any loss of physical or mental faculty.  A claim form has been issued to him.</P>

      <P>His wife, who died on 6 December 1990, was in receipt of an old age noncontributory pension.  This pension is paid in advance each week.  Accordingly, it was not possible to award the Christmas bonus in her case; the bonus was payable from 7 December 1990.</P>

      <P>Garda juvenile liaison officers generally operate from district headquarters stations and provide a service on a districtwide basis.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that two juvenile liaison officers are assigned to Raheny station which is the district headquarters for Howth station and four to Coolock station. These are operational strengths. The Garda authorities consider that the number of juvenile liaison officers at these stations is adequate at present in the light of their current workload.</P>
      <P>As already publicly announced, I have approved a number of significant reforms in the juvenile liaison officer scheme following a review of the scheme carried out by Garda management.  These include the establishment of a national juvenile liaison office to oversee the operation of the service throughout the State, reform of the reporting and supervision arrangements for JLOs, flexibility in the period of supervision of youngsters, restoration of weekend working and enhanced training for gardaí assigned to these duties.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are aware of the problem of so-called &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo; in the areas in question.  They report that steps have been taken to deal with the situation, including increased patrolling and the operation of random mobile checkpoints. The community policing scheme has been established in the area and these estates have also received attention from the local crime prevention unit.  The Garda authorities report that they have had a considerable degree of success in reducing the incidence of joy-riding in the area. As an indication of their success, the number of unauthorised takings of motor vehicles reported in the Coolock sub-district in 1990 was 36 per cent less than the 1986 figure and the local gardaí are using every endeavour to see to it that this favourable trend continues.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that best use is being made of available resources in tackling this problem and do not consider that organisational change of the type suggested in the question would be of benefit.</P>

      <P>Under the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, dogs are required to be licensed and to be kept under effectual control. The implementation of the Act is vested in local authorities who have power to appoint dog wardens, to provide shelters for stray and other dogs, to seize dogs, to impose on-the-spot fines and to take <Col N="609" /> prosecutions.  They also have power to make bye-laws requiring, <i>inter alia,</i> a person in charge of a dog to have the faeces removed immediately when the dog has fouled a public place.</P>
      <P>While considerable progress in dog control has been achieved since the 1986 Act came into force, I continue to urge local authorities towards greater efforts. I take the view that further progress depends more on effective enforcement of existing law than in the enactment of new legislation.</P>

      <P>The roads in question would not form part of the network of national roads and, accordingly, the cost of any construction work carried out by the local authority would normally fall to be financed from the authority's own resources supplemented by the block grants for roads allocated annually by my Department.  A limited amount of funding is available for special road grant assistance towards the cost of providing and improving non-national roads.  The allocation of these funds is determined having regard to the priority of legible proposals throughout the country.</P>

    <P>Proposals submitted in 1981 for the Bryanstown cross route were considered <Col N="615" /> to be premature at that time.  A further submission has not been received about the proposals.  The local authority were recently informed that special grants could not be made available towards the cost of a bridge and approach roads over the railway at the Drogheda Industrial Estate at Matthews Lane.  Proposals for the Ballymakenny road route have not been received in the Department.</P>

      <P>A revised layout and house types for a scheme of 14 to 16 houses in Fintown consisting of six to eight two-bedroomed houses and eight three-bedroomed was received in the Department on 9 February 1987.  However, Donegal County Council did not nominate the scheme for inclusion in their programme of new &ldquo;starts&rdquo; in 1990.  It will now be a matter for the council to decide whether they propose to proceed with the scheme within their 1991 allocation which will be notified to them shortly.</P>

These proposals were submitted to my Department in June 1981 and approved in principle in July 1982.  I understand that the scheme, as proposed, did not proceed because of land acquisition difficulties.  In April 1986 further revised proposals were submitted to the Department for a section of the route at Saleen Bridge and approaches and approval in principle issued on 25 July 1986.</P>

      <P>In 1973 the National Drugs Advisory Board considered a number of published papers suggesting an association between the administration of diethystilboestrol at high doses in early pregnancy and the development of neoplastic vaginal pathology in adult female offspring of women so treated.</P>
      <P>In 1974 the National Drugs Advisory Board again reviewed the position and concluded that stilboestrol, as distinct from the steroidal oestrogens, was capable of exerting a specific teratogenic effect on vaginal epithelium which led subsequently to neoplastic changes in some &mdash; approximately 0.1 per cent &mdash; of the affected individuals up to 20 years later, i.e., between ages of 19-30 years).</P>
      <P>The board noted that in 1974 stilboestrol had a main indication in the management of prostatic carcinoma, a use for which it is still prescribed, and to a lesser degree a use in the management of post menopausal disorders, and indication for which it is no longer used although, as a vaginal pessary, it is still used for management of vaginal atrophy.</P>

      <P>In November 1989, I requested the Dental Council to undertake an objective examination of the question of establishing denturists as auxiliary dental workers under the Dentists Act, 1985.  In October 1990, the Dental Council submitted their views on this matter.  In brief, the Dental Council suggested, that in addition to existing arrangements there were two options i.e., (i) denturists might be established as auxiliaries entitled to engage in independent private practice; or (ii) denturists might be established as auxiliaries with a more limited role, working under the supervision of a dentist.</P>
      <P>The report of the Dental Council is being considered and I will be communicating my views to it in the very near future.  In my view there should be a less restrictive approach to practice by denturists.</P>
      <P>The primary initiative in this matter lies at present with the Dental Council. Under the Dentists Act, the council may, subject to ministerial consent, devise schemes for establishing classes of auxiliary dental workers.  Such a scheme would, <i>inter alia,</i> provide for the definition of necessary training and qualifications.</P>
