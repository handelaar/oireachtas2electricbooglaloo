      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>

      <P>The National Heritage Council distributes, subject to my approval, national lottery funds to heritage projects, including architectural projects. Grants are offered on an ongoing basis, following direct application to and assessment by the council.  Assessment and decisions about whether to recommend grant assistance and the amount in any case are matters for the council.  The council have a number of requests for funds under consideration at any one time and these can be expected to include some from Dublin.  It would not, however, be possible to say whether these are likely to be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the grants offered by the National Heritage Council, a number of tax reliefs have been provided in the Finance Act, 1991, for the Temple Bar area <Col N="1114" /> of Dublin.  These include double rent allowance, owner-occupier allowance for private dwellings and &ldquo;Section 23&rdquo; allowances for rented residential accommodation. A special new 100 per cent capital allowance is being given for refurbishment of existing buildings in the Temple Bar area.  This new capital allowance will cover the actual expenditure incurred on refurbishment plus either the cost of acquiring the building or its value as at 1 January, 1991, exclusive of site cost or value, when the amount spent on refurbishment exceeds the latter.</P>

      <P>Recognising what has been done by way of incentives, grants, etc. to promote Dublin as the European capital of culture, would the Taoiseach acknowledge that there is one glaring omission, after half the year has already passed, and that is, that nothing has been done, despite repeated requests, to refurbish or to give any grant aid whatever other than £10,000 from the Soldiers and Sailors Fund for the birthplace of George Bernard Shaw at No. 33 Synge Street which is in a state of considerable delapidation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach acknowledge that on 20 March last, following a request from me, he did agree to look at the possibility of lottery funding for this purpose?  Furthermore, is he aware that crisis time has arrived for the volunteer group promoting this project, that they have been notified that as and from September of this year, Allied Irish Banks will be looking for immediate repayment of the £54,000 and that if the money is not forthcoming the house will be put on the market?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he is satisfied with the way in which the council are inclined to consult with local authorities to identify buildings and sites that require preservation?  Is he satisfied that the council are up to date on what needs to be done in the general area?  May I suggest to him that his answer indicates a weakness in the scheme, whereby it is often left to local initiative to alert the council and to make an application?  By way of illustration may I suggest to the Taoiseach that the case of Howth House &mdash; which is very close to his own constituency and no doubt well known to him &mdash; is a good example of what I am talking about? That building is now close to the point of demolition and there is little a council such as the National Heritage Council can do to save it.  Perhaps the council should have had a role at an earlier date in the preservation and protection of the building.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been adroit and circuitous in getting Howth House on to the agenda here in this way. It is not really a matter for the National Heritage Council.  The problem in regard to Howth House is entirely a planning matter.  On the broader issue of whether I am satisfied with the operations of the heritage council, I certainly am; I think they are one of the most active and effective of such bodies that I know of.  They do wonderful work.  By and large they respond to applications made to them but they also take their own initiatives, and they have taken a number of initiatives, with regard to particular places, buildings or anything of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that Deputies have put down so many questions about the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> because it gives me an opportunity to remind them of the benefits this Programme and its predecessor, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, have brought to our economy.</P>
      <P>There should be no doubt in anybody's mind about how correct we were to negotiate programmes of this kind.  I know there are Deputies in this House who do not wish to be reminded of the object state of our economy in 1986 with zero growth, a balance of payments crisis with capital fleeing the country, public expenditure consuming 55 per cent of GNP and the biggest current budget deficit on record, the national debt virtually doubled in four years, unemployment up by 100,000 in four years and employment down by 70,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery and the Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> we succeeded in establishing an agreement between the Government and the social partners which had four essential and interlinked objectives to improve the fundamentals of the economy.  The first was to correct the imbalance in the public finances <Col N="1118" /> which was unsustainable and threatened to undermine our ability to maintain essential services.  The second was to restore our competitiveness as a trading nation by moderate pay policies, reduce taxation and lower Exchequer borrowing which brought down interest rates.  The third was to supplement the competitiveness and resultant growth of the economy by specific sectoral measures to generate more employment.  The fourth was to improve the social equity in our society by the reform of our social services.</P>
    <P>We succeeded in all these objectives. Public expenditure has fallen to around 42 per cent of GNP as compared with 55 per cent in 1986.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement has fallen from 12.8 per cent in 1986 to 2 per cent in 1990. This is one of the most radical changes in the correction of public finance deficits in the entire European Community.</P>
    <P>Our competitiveness in world markets has been fundamentally improved.  We have had a stable exchange rate within the EMS since 1987 &mdash; a fundamental need for a trading nation.  Allowing for changes in exchange rates, wage costs in manufacturing industry will be only 18 per cent higher this year than in 1986, as compared with 47 per cent in the UK and 33 per cent in the EMS partners as a whole.  The prime overdraft rate in the June quarter this year at 10.75 per cent is three points less than at December 1986.  We now have one of the lowest inflation rates in the world.  The fundamental changes we made in the economy under these programmes have created sizeable balance of payments surpluses in each of the past four years as compared to a massive deficit in 1986.</P>
    <P>We have turned around the trends as regards employment.  In the three years to April 1990, employment in the private non-agricultural sector increased by 70,000, the largest increase in decades. We now have the largest number employed in that sector that we have ever had.  This reflects the fact that industrial production rose by 45 per cent since 1986 as compared with only 25 per cent in the previous four years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> As regards unemployment, the live register is now some 10,000 greater than at the beginning of 1987.  This contrasts, as I already mentioned, with an increase of 100,000 in the previous four years. Every Deputy knows that net outward migration virtually ceased in the past year and that this, in conjunction with returned immigrants, are now the major factors influencing the live register. Every indication is that employment has not declined.  Therefore, the increase in unemployment on this occasion is not due to a decline in employment.</P>
    <P>I have reviewed these developments at some length so that Deputies &mdash; and economic commentators outside the House &mdash; would face the reality of what has been achieved under these two programmes. If the Deputies cannot accept my assurances, I recommend that Deputies and others would read <i>The Economist</i> of last week which classified Ireland as the fifth most healthy economy in the world after Japan, Norway, Luxembourg and the Netherlands as judged by our growth, inflation and current account balance&mdash;the fundamentals of any economy for increased employment and living standards.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, a primary objective of these programmes has been to maintain firm control of our public finances so that there is a steady reduction in the national debt to GNP ratio.  As the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress states:</i></P>
    <P>This is an overriding principle of the Programme, it has been drafted in accordance with that principle and that principle cannot be infringed in the implementation of the Programme.</P>
    <P>Because of the international trading situation which has had adverse effects on our economy and on the public finances, we will be taking the necessary measures to curtail Exchequer expenditure this year so that there is no serious deterioration in the balance of the public finances in the light of the end-June Exchequer returns.</P>
    <P>It is relevant in this context that I <Col N="1120" /> should point out to Deputies that three of the largest economies in the European Community, namely Germany, France and Italy, are all having to make mid-term corrections in their public finances because of slippage due to international economic conditions.  If such large economies can suffer such setbacks to their original forecasts and assumptions, it is not surprising that a very small open economy such as ours should have to make corrections.  Fortunately, because of the fundamental soundness of our economy due to the programmes with the social partners we are in a better position than most to take the necessary corrective action.</P>
    <P>The current concerns of the public finances are a matter for the social partners as well as for the Government since we are partners in the programme.  In addition, the acute problem of unemployment arising from the cessation of emigration is a special concern for all participants in the programme.  For that reason, I, with the Ministers for Finance, Industry and Commerce and Labour, will meet shortly with the Central Review Committee under the programme to discuss with them the current situation and outlook and consider together what new actions we might take.  In particular, I would like to inform the social partners of the measures we are taking to curtail expenditure in the current year so that they may appreciate that we are taking measures open to us to safeguard the principles of the programme.  I would emphasise that this meeting is not for the purpose of renegotiating the programme but is part of the normal process of reviewing progress in attaining the objectives of the programme which are so important for the continued welfare of our society as I have outlined to the House today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has taken advantage of parliamentary procedures <Col N="1121" /> in an outrageous response to questions put down.  He wants the Opposition Deputies to be constructive.  We could go back to 1979 or 1977.  So what?  That is no use to the unemployed people who cannot get jobs.  The Taoiseach could have been a lot more constructive if he had looked at the problems surrounding him in his four and a half years as Taoiseach since 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask a question, even if we did not get a direct reply to the questions asked, courtesy would also be in order.  What is the Taoiseach saying at a time when 253,400 people are unemployed, more than the number to which the Taoiseach referred to in January? Will he now tell the House what the figures are estimated to be for the rest of this year for the unemployed in terms of policies?  The Taoiseach said the Government would take corrective measures, perhaps he will outline them to the House?  Are we talking about more redundancies, more hospital bed closures, more cutbacks in public sector employment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that unemployment should go any higher this year.  It is very difficult, as the Deputy will appreciate, to make forecasts of that kind.  However, the latest figures, which the Deputy mentioned, were very <Col N="1122" /> heavily influenced by the advent of the large student population to the unemployment register in June.</P>

We have taken a number of specific initiatives which I have already outlined in the House.

When the Taoiseach is revising his essay for resubmission, will he consider including the following facts: that it was a Government led by him which trebled the national debt between 1977 and 1981; that the Economic and Social Research Institute showed in the recent report that almost all the problems Ireland suffered during the eighties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Will the Taoiseach recall that when I became Minister for Finance in <Col N="1123" /> July 1981, I had to introduce a supplementary budget within three weeks because this country was facing bankruptcy after he had left office?</P>

      <P>On Question No. 6 specifically which was addressed to the Minister for Labour in the first place because it was he who spoke in Killarney, will the Taoiseach say whether the reply he gave, that the purpose of the meeting with the Central Review Committee was not to renegotiate the programme, also means that the Government do not intend to renegotiate it?  Will the Taoiseach agree that any attempt to make public sector workers carry the can for the overrun in Government expenditure will virtually sound the deathknell for any future centralised pay bargaining?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the <Col N="1125" /> Deputy should engage in pejorative statements of that kind.  I have clearly indicated in my reply that the purpose of our meeting is not to renegotiate the programme.  As the Deputy will be aware, the drift of my reply generally was to point out the advantages we have gained from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and its predecessor. I believe that the provisions for pay in particular in both agreements have had maximum impact on the major feature in our favour at the moment, low inflation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended to renegotiate.  We will certainly discuss with the social partners aspects of the programme to examine whether improvements can be achieved.  The day I introduced the second programme I indicated that our aim was to achieve social advance paid for by economic growth.  If economic growth is slowing down then we will have to discuss that with the social partners.  That is a perfectly legitimate exercise, as already envisaged in the programme.</P>
      <P>In relation to public servants, the Deputy will have to acknowledge that a crucial feature in our budgetary difficulties this year is the need to meet special pay awards.  Those awards have accumulated.  In 1987 we were all very glad that the public service unions were prepared to postpone those special pay awards until this year but now, unfortunately, they are with us and we have to meet them.  They are a major part of the budgetary problem that has arisen this year.</P>

      <P>In the context of the various economic indicators given by the Taoiseach, will he agree that no programme is a success economically if it results in more than 20 per cent of the workforce being unemployed?  The fact that there are now 262,000 unemployed, which is the correct number, is indicative of a failure in the programme.  Will the <Col N="1126" /> Taoiseach tell the House when he will meet the Central Review Committee?  Is he aware that as the level of unemployment increased in recent months Fine Gael constantly asked that such a meeting take place to review the programme? Will the Taoiseach further indicate when the mid-term corrections he has suggested for implementation will be taken, and will he say whether there will be cutbacks or the imposition of additional taxation by way of a mini-budget?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take the final point first.  The Government's approach is to endeavour to solve the budgetary difficulty by means of reductions in expenditure.  We have gone away from the days of Governments allowing expenditure to rise without restraint and then just piling on more taxes to meet the situation.

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach questions in relation to three aspects.  I realise that there are some difficulties in forecasting unemployment figures for the rest of the year but, given that forecasts were made in January which are 25,000 off plus approximately 8,000 on preretirement schemes, what figures does the Taoiseach have available from Government advisers in relation to unemployment for the rest of the year? Secondly, it is obvious that economic growth figures have had to be revised downwards and will the Taoiseach indicate whether that will be the trend for the rest of the year or whether an economic uplift is expected?  What kind of economic growth is envisaged for the rest of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am about to be brief.  I believe the Government had two Cabinet meetings since the Minister for Finance made a statement about corrective measures. Will the Taoiseach outline to the House what measures the Government are examining because the House will not have an opportunity to discuss the measures between now and 4 p.m. on Friday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently confirmation was received that the original figure for economic growth will be somewhere near being maintained.  The most recent forecast has been better than some of the earlier ones, which were quite pessimistic. There is also a general view that the international economy should pick up later this year.  If that is so, we are certainly in an ideal position to benefit from any such pick up.  On the review of expenditures, I assure the Deputy that that will take place right across the board. Every Department and every subhead is <Col N="1128" /> being examined to find out where substantial reductions in the overruns can be achieved now, half-way through the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

Would he secondly agree that some 200,000 people now unemployed who have emigrated have had to do so because of the loss of growth in the eighties through the policies pursued between 1977 and 1981? Would he agree that, inflation having been reduced to 3 per cent by 1987 &mdash; this Government have of course maintained it since &mdash; in March 1987 when he took over office he found he was in a position of rapid growth which was maintained for several years thereafter; and would he finally say why in this year's budget the figures involving comparison between last year and this year have been distorted by £220 million by transferring £110 million of EC money due in last year into this year's accounts thereby hiding the planned increase in the underlying deficit which is doing such damage?</P>

      <P>The reform of Dáil procedures is, of course, a matter for the House as a whole.</P>

      <P>Is it not inaccurate for the Taoiseach to say that the Government have tabled their proposals before that group when in fact the Government have not tabled any proposals before that group and have simply sought ideas from other parties and then agreed to proposals where there was a consensus? Would the Taoiseach not agree that in failing to table any proposals of their own <Col N="1134" /> the Government have directly breached one of the conditions in the Programme for Government agreed with the Progressive Democrats where there was a commitment to table proposals on Dáil reform within six months?  The Government have tabled no proposals at all on Dáil reform other than agreeing to consensus proposals emerging from a working group mostly consisting of Deputies of other parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree at all. The report on Dáil reform which was approved by the Dáil last Christmas had the following main recommendations, all of which have been implemented: there is no need for a general imposition of time limits on the length of speeches; the present practice whereby the Whips decide on time limits of individual items should be retained; the new Adjournment Debate on topical matters procedure introduced experimentally last October should continue; the procedure for circulating tabular statements relevant to speeches to be incorporated permanently in the Standing Orders; the session orders allocating Private Members' time and priority questions to remain in force for the duration of the present Dáil.  A number of other changes have already been made.</P>

Is the Taoiseach telling us that what he is going to do is take on board proposals from other parties in this House and bring them forward as Government proposals?  Is that what the Taoiseach is planning?</P>

      <P>I think Deputies should be clear on what is involved here.  The reform of our procedures in this House is a matter for the House.  Deputies opposite would be the first to rebel if the Government sought to impose reform. Second, when we do try to expedite the proceedings of this House there is uproar <Col N="1135" /> from the Fine Gael benches consistently. I think therefore the right way to proceed is through all-party agreement on the committee, and the Government will, from time to time, put forward their own proposals in that regard and will also listen to proposals put forward by other Deputies.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that after a year of the existence of this committee the recommendations and report adopted by this House on foot of the work of that committee are minimal?  Will he further agree the actual reform element that has taken place in this House is virtually unnoticed by Deputies and by the public at large, and that most Members still feel totally frustrated in dealing with matters of urgency which are the focus of attention outside the House but which cannot be raised within?  Will the Taoiseach use this opportunity now to indicate his own thinking in relation to Dáil reform, because it is clear to us who work on the committee that, unless the Government, and in particular the Taoiseach, put their own weight behind it, no meaningful reform will occur?  I would specifically ask the Taoiseach what his attitude is in relation to committees of the House.  The work of the committees has been spectacularly good.  Could more of the legislative work of the House be channelled through these committees?</P>

      <P>I certainly agree that legislative committees are excellent and we will use them to the greatest extent possible.  The Deputy will understand that this House must always have its own functions.  One of the major reforms in any House of Parliament has been undertaken by this Government in conjunction with the other parties, that is, the televising of the House.  Let us not be too selfdenigrating. If the Deputy is implying in his questioning that I have some sort of magic wand which I can wave in this regard, I will certainly look around and see if I can find it.</P>

Is it not the case that the role of this House could not be more exactly typified by the fact that we are having a debate on the European Summit after it took place, whereas in Westminster they had the debate on the European Summit before it took place so that they could influence what their Prime Minister said? We could only listen to what our Prime Minister did.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11, 12 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>I announced the establishment of the Industrial Policy Review Group on 27 June 1991.  The terms of reference of the review group are as follows:</P>
      <P>to review and make recommendations on industrial policy in Ireland and on public policy generally as it affects industrial development. The review should address particularly the internationally trading indigenous industrial sector and, where possible, identify policies and measures to be adopted which would form the basis for the development of this sector over the medium to long term, with a view to increasing employment and wealth creation.  For this purpose, industry includes internationally traded services.</P>
      <P>The scope of the review will be wide-ranging as the terms of reference indicate. It is envisaged that the group will undertake their work over a six month period.  The group held their first meeting yesterday, 8 July.</P>
      <P>I would expect that the report of the group will be published soon after its completion.  The group is composed of people with outstanding experience across a range of business sectors, in economic analysis and in industrial relations and development planning.  The members were selected on the basis of the range of skills and experience which they can bring to the task which has been set for them and the potential which they possess to bring fresh thinking to the whole area of industrial policy.</P>
      <P>It will be a matter for the review group to decide on their own procedures and the extent to which they wish to employ consultants.  I have indicated to the group that they will have access to the resources required for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Task Force on Employment was established following discussions between the Government, trade unions and employers under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The task force, who operate under the aegis of the Central Review Committee for that <Col N="1141" /> programme, are examining the present job situation in depth and, in particular, exploring what factors are impeding or delaying job creation.  Their remit extends far beyond the industrial sector but the task force will be able to identify issues for the consideration of the Industrial Policy Review Group.</P>
    <P>The review group do not in any way exclude contributions by public sector companies.  Public sector companies will be facilitated in any submissions they wish to make to the review group and I would expect that such submissions will make a valuable contribution to the deliberations of the group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the group in the Minister's name.  While I might disagree with some of the individuals involved, the composition of the group is right.  The Minister was right to go outside of the public service to see if he could get contributions there.  I approve of what the Minister has done in that area.  I take it that the prime objective of this group is to review industrial policy and create more jobs.  Does the Minister agree that there is now an overlap between what the Taoiseach has done under the PESP, bringing the heads of State companies together and asking them to look at job creation, and what the Minister is doing?  There is an air of flap about what the Government are doing in this area.  Until the figures were shown to be going wrong six weeks ago there was no apparent concern in the Government to get the Minister's committee and the other committees established to see what could be done about creating jobs.  Will the Minister confirm that I am correct in saying that the objective of the Industrial Policy Review Group is to create more jobs and make bigger, more viable companies in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought it was evident that at least once in ten years there should be a fundamental look at industrial policy in its broadest and medium to long term sense and not just in a short term way in response to particular <Col N="1142" /> problems.  I formally announced that fact as far back as December last in the triennial review of industrial policy.  I announced that such a group would be set up during the course of this year and that it had not been decided whether to do this by way of external consultants, as was done before, or by way of a group primarily within this country.  I gave this matter some thought over a number of months and discussed it with different people.  When I came to my conclusion recently I made an announcement, which is very much within the timescale I indicated at the end of last year.  Obviously, employment is one of the most important factors this group will look at.  As I indicated before, they will look at industrial policy in its broadest sense.  A soundly based and viable industrial policy is the best guarantee of jobs in the long run and jobs should not be created in the short term if they are not entirely soundly based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister to comment on why there is no representative from the semi-State sector on the group he appointed?  Having regard to the fact, as the Minister said in his reply, that the group will examine across the range of business sectors, it seems strange that the semi-State sector are not represented on this group, particularly as the Minister is concerned, or says he is concerned, about employment which is an important factor.  As the Taoiseach was at pains to call in the leaders of the semi-State bodies on this issue, it seems doubly strange that the one sector visibly excluded from the review group is the semi-State sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked why there is no representative of the semi-State sector on this review group and I say to him that there is no representative of any sector on this body: nobody has been appointed in a representative capacity.  It has been the downfall of many such groups and committees in the past that they saw themselves as there not to argue for the best policies which might be pursued but rather to argue for <Col N="1143" /> the sectional interests which they perceived themselves as representing.  When I met the group yesterday at their first meeting I made it clear to them that none of them was there in a representative capacity.</P>
      <P>So far as experience of the semi-State sector is concerned, I can identify, looking at the list, three people who have long and outstanding experience in that field. In so far as any one sector is represented, and none is, the semi-State sector is better represented than any other.</P>

      <P>A system of triennial reviews of industrial performance was introduced in 1986 under the Industrial Development Act, 1986.  Reviews of performance are a very different matter, as the Deputy will see from reading those reviews, to reviews of policy.  Reviews of performance look back over the previous three years and comment on what happened, whereas a review of policy looks forward over the next ten years, tries to shape what will happen and set out how, in the view of the members of the group, it should happen.</P>

      <P>One of the issues to be examined by the review group is the impact of taxation on industry.  It is noticeable that the Department of Finance are not represented on the review group.  Will the Minister explain this omission?  Would he agree that the absence of a Department of Finance representative weakens the group and will lead to a lack of co-ordination?  Has the Minister had consultations with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, on this matter?  In view of the major differences which appear to exist between the Minister and the Minister for Finance on taxation policy such consultation is particularly important.  Having regard to the fact that the Fair Trade Commission report on competition law was delivered to the Minister in December 1989 but not published until five months later, in April 1990, will the Minister give an assurance to the House that there will not be a similar delay in publishing this report and that it will be published promptly?</P>

      <P>As I have indicated, I expect the report to be published shortly after it is received.

      <P>I wish to refer to the somewhat artificial distinction drawn between performance and policy.  People who are unemployed are concerned only <Col N="1145" /> about where performance has fallen down.  If that is as a result of mistaken policy objectives, so be it.  Since it is apparently the stated purpose &mdash; I quote from today's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; of the group to concentrate on the Irish indigenous sector, may I ask the Minister if that means the policy review will be largely confined to the Irish owned indigenous sector?  That may be a desirable policy objective at the end of the review but if this is a policy review of the widest possible scope, as indicated by the Minister, surely it is as necessary to review the total industrial policy, for example, whether funds should be directed from one sector to another or targeted in a particular direction?  Will the Minister comment on the report in today's newspaper that the group will concentrate on the Irish owned indigenous sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am reported in today's newspapers as saying reflects what I said in my statement announcing this group on 27 June.  I said I had asked the group to devote particular attention to the issues facing native Irish industry and seek ways in which that industry can grow and emulate the performance of those companies which are winning profitable shares of international markets. I went on to say that the review would not be confined to indigenous industry or industrial policy <i>per se:</i> it was intended that it would examine all of the key factors which affect industrial development.  I said the aim was to chart a course for the next decade and beyond. Clearly that is the position.  The House, and many people outside, will agree that we all share a concern that indigenous Irish industry has not seen the same measure of success here as overseas industry located here.  I am sure that it is a cause of regret to all of us.  Because of their membership, this group are particularly well fitted to try to come to grips with why this should be so, especially given the notable success of several members of the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to return to the <Col N="1146" /> question asked by Deputy Lowry.  The aim of our industrial policy for the past 30 years has been to attract, by way of tax incentives, foreign industries into this country.  If the group recommend that the incentives should be increased that obviously will be matter for the Department of Finance and the Minister will have something to say about it.  Deputy Lowry's question is relevant in that regard.  The Minister should be more precise in stating what he means by indigenous Irish industry.  For example, P J Carroll and Company, an example I have given already, are no longer Irish owned but as far as I am concerned they are an Irish industry employing Irish people.  We should be more precise in defining these terms.  That is but one example and there are many others.  Having said that, one of the comments made in the Telesis report was that some &ldquo;indigenous Irish industries&rdquo; should be picked out by the Industrial Development Authority and puffed up to allow them compete in international markets and that special attention should be given to them rather than to the wide range of industries who happen to apply for a grant.  Does the Minister agree with that assessment and is he guiding the review committee in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not sought to provide in the terms of reference any definition of &ldquo;indigenous&rdquo;.  Definitions vary slightly.  Some would regard something as indigenous only if it is Irish owned in the sense of Irish control through the ownership of 51 per cent or more of the shares while others would regard a company as indigenous if they have been long established here and if control is exercised from within Ireland in policy terms.  That is true in the case of some companies who are foreign owned but because circumstances vary from company to company I did not seek to lay down any particular definition.  It is a matter that is best left to the group. There are many matters relating to Departments other than my own which will have to be considered by the group but this does not justify having representatives from every one of those <Col N="1147" /> Departments on the group.  The group has to be kept to a reasonable number of people if they are to work effectively. The number and type of people we have come up with are ideal in this respect. There will be a substantial input from eight or nine Departments, an input they would wish to give themselves &mdash; their views and any information they may have which might be requested from them by the group.</P>

Because of this the region is being placed at a serious disadvantage in terms of promoting the region overseas.

      <P>As the Deputy said the Industrial Development Authority have no regional office in the mid-west region. A senior official of the Industrial Development Authority has been specially appointed to co-ordinate policy, relations and operations between the Industrial Development Authority and Shannon Development.  Shannon Development are performing in the mid-west region the functions which are performed by the Industrial Development Authority regional offices in other regions.  Shannon Development are fully experienced and fully competent in these matters.  I do not accept that the region is being placed at a disadvantage.  The change which I found it necessary to make about a year ago &mdash; it came into operation last October but I announced it a year ago &mdash; in relation to the promotion of the mid-west region related to the promotion of the region overseas.  It was very unsatisfactory that the region had to be promoted in competition with the remainder of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is serious about developing the region does it make sense that the key personnel responsible for promoting the mid-west region overseas are based in Dublin and adopting a hands-off approach?  Equally, does it make sense that the project executives who deal with foreign companies located in the mid-west region have to travel from Dublin on a weekly or daily basis to deal with them?  Would the Minister agree, given our experience in recent months, that the system is unwieldy, impractical, not cost effective and is placing the region at a serious disadvantage?</P>

Day-to-day contact with companies in the region is not made by executives located in Dublin but rather by executives located in Shannon and Limerick.

This should not be construed as any form of official launching of that body by me.  Equally, I have given no official recognition of any kind to the body concerned.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, no doubt, be aware that the Companies Act, 1990, has updated and strengthened the provisions of the 1963 Companies Act relating to the recognition of accountants for practice as company and public auditors.  Applications for recognition will, henceforth, be considered under section 191 of the 1990 Act.  I expect to make a commencement order in respect of section 191 in the autumn.  It will then be necessary for all accountancy bodies seeking company or public auditor status, including those already recognised under existing legislation, to apply to me for recognition, and satisfy me that they meet the new requirements set out in section 191.</P>

The Taoiseach, on spurious grounds &mdash; he is not correct in stating that the motion refers only to the conduct of parliamentary matters &mdash; has refused to allow Government time.

      <P>I wish to report today on the outcome of the European Council in Luxembourg on 28-29 June and to outline the work taking place in the two Intergovernmental Conferences on Political Union and Economic and Monetary Union.  The Conclusions of the European Council have been laid before the House in the usual way, and in order to facilitate Deputies for this debate, the draft Treaty of Union which has been drawn up by the Luxembourg Presidency on the basis of the work of the Conferences has also been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal issue scheduled for consideration at the European Council was the progress of the two Inter-governmental Conferences.  However, in view of the developments in Yugoslavia <Col N="1249" /> Heads of Government agreed that the crisis there should be taken as the first item on the agenda.  The Council quickly agreed to send to Yugoslavia the Foreign Ministers of the Troika and a representative of the Commission and to invoke the emergency mechanism of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.</P>
    <P>It is symptomatic of the changed situation in Europe, and of the new responsibility of the Community arising from this, that all 35 participants of the CSCE consider that the Twelve initiative for resolution of the Yugoslav crisis should be the basis of a mission to that country on behalf of all CSCE participating states.  Last week, the 35 welcomed the willingness of the Community to organise a mission to Yugoslavia to help stabilise a cease-fire and to monitor the return of armed forces to previous positions and the suspension of declarations of independence by Slovenia and Croatia for three months, so that an overall negotiated solution could be found.  The Community is now fully engaged in carrying out this mandate, which is an earnest of the confidence reposed in the Twelve by all the parties in Yugoslavia and by the States of Europe, along with the United States and Canada.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the crisis in Yugoslavia the European Council did keep to its scheduled business and great credit for this is due to the effective management of a difficult and complex agenda by the President, Prime Minister Santer and his Foreign Minister Poos.  My general assessment of the Council is positive. While it was, as Prime Minister Santer has said, primarily a staging post on the way to the Maastricht Council in December it did enable the Heads of Government to take stock of the work of the IGCs and to identify the major issues requiring political impetus and guidelines. Moreover I believe that from Ireland's point of view our important interests in the IGCs and in other significant international negotiations, such as the GATT, were protected and enhanced.  I shall deal with these questions in more detail later but at this stage <Col N="1250" /> I would like to point to the main results of the Council.</P>
    <P>First, we agreed that the final decisions on Political Union and on Economic and Monetary Union will be taken by the Maastricht European Council.  This is necessary if the timetable for ratification of the Union Treaty by the end of next year is to be kept.</P>
    <P>Second, we identified a number of key areas in the Political Union Conference on which work will need to be intensified if there is to be agreement at Maastricht, and we issued guidelines for this work&mdash; in particular on a common foreign and security policy, the powers of the European Parliament social policy, economic and social cohesion, and on home affairs and judicial co-operation.</P>
    <P>Third, the Council agreed that economic and social cohesion should be an integral part of the Union, embodied in the new Treaty.  It asked the Commission to clarify the ideas outlined to the Council by President Delors for developing the Union's cohesion dimension.  Cohesion is an essential part of the negotiations for Ireland and the Council's conclusions on this point represent substantial progress at this stage.  In the discussions, I stressed our concerns in relation to the review of the CAP.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the Council recognised that there are now broad areas of agreement on the basic components of Economic and Monetary Union, and agreed on the need to make satisfactory and lasting progress on economic and monetary convergance.</P>
    <P>Fifth, in the area of drugs and organised crime, the Council agreed on the establishment of a European drugs monitoring centre and on a programme of work for the Maastricht Concil, including work on proposals put forward by Chancellor Kohl.</P>
    <P>Sixth, we reviewed progress on the internal market, three-quarters of the measures have now been adopted.  The Council identified several matters for priority attention during the coming six months, including important work on the free movement of persons.</P>
    <P>Seventh, we reviewed the state of the <Col N="1251" /> Community's external relations, both bilaterally with its main partners, and in multilateral fora, including the GATT. Ireland successfully opposed a proposal to change the emphasis in the Community's approach and I can report that there has been no change in the Community's negotiating position on agriculture in the Uruguay Round.</P>
    <P>Finally, we issued a number of declarations setting out the views of the Twelve on a range of current international issues, including the Middle East, Iraq, South Africa, human rights, humanitarian aid, and the non-proliferation of weapons.  We also agreed that the Community should participate in international action to protect the Brazilian rain forest &mdash; an initiative which has resulted from the Declaration on the Environment adopted at the Dublin European Council in June of last year.</P>
    <P>From what I have just said and from the text of the detailed conclusions the House will see that the Luxembourg Council dealt with many issues central to the development of the Community and its role in international life.  Because of the significance of these for the Community and for Ireland I had a number of bilateral meetings with other Heads of Government before the Council &mdash; with Prime Minister Santer on 6 June, with President Mitterrand on 20 June, and with Prime Minister Major on 21 June. My meetings enabled me to obtain the views of these countries at first hand and to convey the Irish position on the major questions likely to arise.</P>
    <P>The Conclusions of the European Council and the work of the Inter-governmental Conferences reflect the response of the Community to the great changes in European politics over the past two years and to the challenges thrown up by the profound transformation of the European scene.  The old divided Europe which people had perhaps come to accept, in as much as it was familiar, is no more.  No longer can we operate on the model of a continent divided down the centre, with two groups of countries in hostile alliances facing <Col N="1252" /> each other, and a number of others in a third group, not engaged in alliances but determined to minimise the chances of an ultimate confrontation which would threaten the future of all.</P>
    <P>On the Eastern side of the former divide, the Warsaw Pact has ceased to exist as a military alliance, COMECON is no more, and we are the witnesses of the progressive transformation of states, once frozen in a totalitarian mould, into pluralistic and free democracies with market economies.</P>
    <P>On the Western side, NATO is engaged in the formulation of profound changes in its approach, changes which start from the acknowledegment that security and stability do not lie solely in the military dimension and that the political content of the organisation should be enhanced.  Significant decisions in regard to the military dimension too have recently been taken and announced.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the first post-war conventional arms treaty to include both the US and the USSR, signed in Paris in November last, provides for a significant reduction in the numbers of tanks, artillery, armoured combat vehicles, aircraft and helicopters deployed in the European theatre, and opens up the prospect of significant reductions in troop numbers. Germany has agreed already to important reductions in the number of troops deployed on its newly united territory and, following agreement Soviet troops are being withdrawn from Hungary, Czechoslovakia and the former German Democratic Republic, as well as Poland.  On the European continent confidence and security-building measures agreed in the CSCE can play an important role in security, reducing the emphasis on military means of ensuring security.</P>
    <P>As for the European Community it is fair to say that it has emerged from the turmoil of the past two years with enhanced validity.  It has become the pole of attraction for the newly liberated countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  At the same time, it is the one indispensable reference point for any future overall European system.  The culminating point in the changes affecting Europe over the <Col N="1253" /> past two years was the Charter of Paris for a New Europe, adopted by the Heads of State or Government of all CSCE participating states in November last.  This announced the end of the era of confrontational division of Europe and proclaimed that henceforth relations between the participating states would be founded on respect and co-operation.  It recognised the important role of the European Community in the political and economic development of Europe.  In such a new Europe there is inevitably a sense of new possibilities, at once challenging and giving rise to hope.  It challenges statesmen to come up with imaginative arrangements which will be adequate to the new situation and which will give the people of Europe as a whole confidence in their future.</P>
    <P>The newly liberated countries of Central and Eastern Europe have renounced decisively a bankrupt system and an unequal alliance.  It is clear that they look to Western Europe, and the European Community in particular, as the anchoring point for their security in the widest sense of this term.  Accordingly, at present Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia are negotiating with the Community Association Agreements with a political content.  These are seen as stages on the way to further development of their relations with the Community. Indeed it is clear that full membership of the Community is the strategic goal of all three.  Other countries of Central and Eastern Europe are likely to follow along the same road, as they make further progress towards full democracy and a market economy.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the countries of EFTA are negotiating an agreement with the Community for the establishment of a European Economic Area.  This raises complicated institutional and policy issues and raises the question in some of the EFTA countries, whether the solution is not to be found in application for membership of the Community pure and simple.  Two EFTA countries &mdash; Austria and Sweden &mdash; have lodged applications for membership.  In each case, it is notable that an important consideration <Col N="1254" /> has been that neutrality has a different specific weight in the new Europe that I have been describing.  Clearly, it does not now seem to pose the same difficulties in the minds of some prospective members that it did only a very short time ago.  We know that serious consideration is being given in other EFTA countries to the question of Community membership.</P>
    <P>At a time when the geo-political map in our continent has changed fundamentally, and is still changing, the place of the Twelve in the new Europe is of decisive importance.  This was recognised early by the Heads of State or Government of the Community. Responding to the proposal of Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand, they confirmed at their meeting of 28 April 1990 in Dublin their commitment to political union and began the process of examination of treaty changes with the aims of strengthening the democratic legitimacy of the union, enabling the Community and its institutions to act more efficiently and effectively, and assuring unity and cohesion in the Community's international action.  This process complemented that already under way on Economic and Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>Before taking up the individual issues under consideration in the Inter-governmental Conferences, I want to outline the overall approach that has guided the Government in the preparatory work and in the discussions within the Conferences.</P>
    <P>First we have brought to the negotiations Ireland's full and wholehearted commitment to the European ideal of an ever close union amongst the peoples of Europe.  It is sometimes overlooked that Ireland's commitment to European construction now extends back a full 30 years to when we first applied for membership in 1961.  We accepted at that time, and again when we joined the Community more than ten years later, that the original Treaties were a stage in the process of European integration, and that we would be engaged with our partners in developing the Community and in seeking new ways to give expression to the European <Col N="1255" /> ideal.  The two enlargements in the eighties, and the Single European Act were steps in that process.  The negotiations now under way on Political Union and on Economic and Monetary Union will take us further on the road.  But they will not complete the journey.  There will be further goals to be achieved.  The important thing is that we and our partners have come to a common understanding on the nature of the challenges facing Europe in the nineties.  We have committed ourselves to working with our partners in finding solutions commensurate with the historic nature of the changes taking place in European life.  I believe Ireland can take some pride in the way in which we participated in the debate on these issues and the Community's response to them during the Irish Presidency last year.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make is that the work of the Intergovernmental Conferences is a joint endeavour.  It must reach an outcome which is acceptable to all and accommodates the interests of all on an equal basis.  The great strength of the Community and the factor that more than any other has sustained it and enabled it to confront the challenges of international life has been its unity of purpose, of membership, and of organisation. All the member states share the same rights and obligations under a common legal order.  The Community has in the past rejected ideas of a two-speed or two-tier Community, and it is a concept that remains unacceptable to Ireland.  I said recently that we intend to be founder members of Economic and Monetary Union.  We intend also to be full members of the Political Union.</P>
    <P>The third guiding factor in Ireland's approach is that the outcome of the two Intergovernmental Conferences should strengthen the capacity of the community, internally in building a strong competitive economy for the benefit of all its peoples, and externally in dealing with the major issues on the international scene.  A primary requirement is that we should maintain and build on the successes already achieved.  It would be a sad irony if our <Col N="1256" /> efforts to develop the Community were to result in a weakening of its foundations, of its capacity for action, or of the common policies already established. All organisations must grow and adapt, and there are overwhelming reasons why the Community must now equip itself to face the changed situation in Europe and beyond.</P>
    <P>But there are a number of fundamentals, crucial to the achievement of the Community in the past and essential for its success in the future, which we wish to see preserved and built on.  In the sphere of the Community proper these include the supranational as against the intergovernmental character; the sole right of initiative of the Commission in the legislative area; a single legal order; and the overall balance between the institutions, which amongst other things helps protect the position of the smaller member states.</P>
    <P>Similarly we must not forget that in the economic area the Community has a range of solid achievements &mdash; the Common Agricultural Policy, the Common External Policy, policies to promote economic and social cohesion, the internal market &mdash; which have helped to create a dynamic and growing economy and sense of solidarity and unity of purpose between our peoples.  It is on this basis that Ireland wants to see the institutional structure of the Community developed, new policies instituted, and the Community's internal and external capacity for action strengthened.</P>
    <P>A fourth important consideration in our approach is to ensure that the Community develops in a way that is relevant to our people and will promote their welfare. The Irish people have been and are enthusiastic and committed supporters of the process of European unity.  We understand and share the political inspiration behind the establishment of the Community and the motivation of its founders.  We understand too that by pooling and sharing sovereignty in the areas covered by the Treaties we can better protect our interests and enhance our prosperity.  These two themes &mdash; of contributing to a safer European order <Col N="1257" /> which would enhance our security, and of developing a more prosperous European economy in which the Irish people would share &mdash; have motivated Ireland's initiatives in the Conference on such questions as health, education, culture, and economic and social cohesion; our support for the concept of Community citizenship; and our participation in efforts to find ways of strengthening the Community's external policies.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union opened in Rome in December last.  It meets each week at official level and there have been five formal sessions at Foreign Minister level, as well as several informal ministerial meetings on specific questions.  The outcome of the first six months work is contained in the draft treaty on the union which has been prepared by the Presidency and the text of which has been laid before the House.  I must emphasise that this text is not an agreed draft.  It is an attempt by the Presidency to set down in consolidated form &ldquo;the prevailing drift&rdquo;, to use their own words, to emerge from the work of the two Conferences.  At the Luxembourg Council the Heads of Government agreed that the Presidency's draft would form the basis for the continuation of the negotiations.  We, like all other member states, will be arguing our case on various aspects of the draft on the basis of proposals and positions we have put forward and on the understanding, embodied in the Luxembourg Conclusions, that final agreement will only be given to the Treaty as a whole&mdash; the principle is that nothing is agreed until all is agreed.</P>
    <P>In looking at the work of the Inter-governmental Conferences and at the text of the draft treaty it is necessary to bear in mind that the negotiations are focused on two sets of changes which are different in character.  One set concerns those adaptations to the legal order of the Community proper designed to introduce or develop common economic, social, and trade policies; to improve the effectiveness of the Community; to strengthen its democratic legitimacy; and to establish an Economic and Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1258" /> These involve essentially changes in the framework established by the Treaty of Rome.  The second set of issues concerns the introduction of new forms of co-operation and action which will form part of the European Union but outside the Treaty of Rome framework.  This involves the common foreign and security policy and co-operation on crime, immigration and other matters generally dealt with by Ministers of Justice or the Interior.  It is at present envisaged that these two areas will have rules and decision-making procedures separate from the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>Not everyone is content with this approach, and there are those who have argued with some intellectual force for a more unified approach based on a single Treaty framework.  The debate has been characterised as one between those who advocate building a union on the basis of three separate pillars and those whose preferred image is that of a tree with the branches representing the Community, common foreign and security policy and judicial co-operation.  It is, however, generally recognised within the Conference that the nature of the subjects involved and the present stage in the evolution of European Union do not allow for the application to areas such as foreign and security policy and interior matters of the classic Treaty of Rome procedures, and that what is required are new and improved forms of co-operation and common action.  Ireland agrees with this. A major challenge to all involved in the Conference is to find methods of co-operation and common action in these areas that will at once enhance the union's capacity and ensure unity and coherence between the union's various activities.</P>
    <P>A related issue is the general expression contained in the draft which stipulates that the &ldquo;Treaty marks a new stage in a process leading gradually to a Union with a federal goal&rdquo;.  A great deal has been said and written about this phrase, and it is not certain at this stage whether it will find a place in the final text.  For our part I could accept its inclusion in the Treaty.  We are already committed in the existing Treaties to an <Col N="1259" /> ever-closer union, and the Community already has elements of a federal character which are likely to be enhanced by the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conferences.  Expressions of this kind are of course important in setting the general direction of the Community.  But what is more important, as the founders of the Community knew, is the precise content of the union &mdash; its detailed objectives, its specific activities, its common policies, its institutional structure, its legal order. These are the things that will in the end determine the character of the union and its effectiveness.  If we can get these right then expressions about the federal goal or vocation of the union may appear less important obstacles to agreement than they do now.</P>
    <P>The Conclusions of the Luxembourg Council make clear the unanimous desire of the Twelve to reinforce the identity and role of the union as a political entity on the international scene.  This is at the heart of the discussions in the Inter-governmental Conference on a common foreign and security policy.  Before looking at the broader issues involved I want to make three points in relation to the Luxembourg Conclusions on this question.</P>
    <P>First, although the Twelve's general objective is clear and agreed there is not yet agreement on what is to be included in a foreign and security policy or on the means to implement it.  In particular the key question of the decision-making process &mdash; whether decisions should be by unanimity or majority &mdash; has yet to be settled.</P>
    <P>Second, the conclusions make clear, as did the conclusions in Rome in December, the distinction that we have drawn between security and defence.  All member states now accept this distinction.</P>
    <P>Third, there is no agreement on the question of a defence identity or role for the union.  This is still under consideration in the Conference and will not be decided until its final stages.  But the Luxembourg Council did confirm the agreement in Rome in December that <Col N="1260" /> any such identity will take account of the traditional positions of certain member states, including of course Ireland. Against this background I would like now to look in more detail at the work of the Intergovernmental Conference on this issue.</P>
    <P>The debate has covered points such as the scope of a common foreign and security policy, how decisions on formulating and implementing it would be taken, what the security area should cover, whether there should be provision for a common defence policy, and whether a relationship should be established with the Western European Union, or WEU, a body to which nine Community members already belong and which has a specific brief in the defence area.</P>
    <P>As regards the scope of a common foreign and security policy, some member states have proposed that all areas of foreign policy and security policy be brought into the common domain immediately, while others see no need for going further than strengthening the commitment and mechanisms already in place under the Single European Act. In fact, there are still wide differences between member states in important policy areas, and these will not be resolved merely by a decision that there is to be a common policy.  Realistically, the idea of bringing all areas into the common domain immediately will not find the necessary agreement.  On the other hand, most member states see a need for something which goes beyond the present system of European political co-operation, which is that set out in the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>A proposal in this area which has attracted substantial interest, and which aims to establish a mechanism which would realise the objective of going beyond the scope of present co-operation, is that the new Treaty should provide for the bringing of new areas into the common policy domain on the basis of a decision by consensus in the European Council or the Council of Ministers.  This would avert the need for a new Inter-governmental Conference whenever new <Col N="1261" /> areas were to be brought into the common policy, and would enable the member states to identify areas for inclusion on the basis of priorities agreed by them.</P>
    <P>I believe that this is an approach we could consider, provided that we are satisfied that there will be an orderly and disciplined approach to bringing in new areas and that our interests are protected. A mechanism which would allow new areas to be introduced in an <i>ad hoc,</i> unconsidered way, would not be desirable. The introduction of new areas could, for example, be governed by objectives stated in the Treaty itself and prepared by full discussion at expert and ministerial level to determine whether particular areas are ripe for a common policy.</P>
    <P>It will also be necessary in our view that decisions in the area of common foreign and security policy should be taken by consensus.  A number of partners have proposed that decisions should be taken by qualified majority voting, where votes would be weighted according to the size, population and economic strength of member states or on other criteria.  Our view is that foreign and security policy is a very sensitive area for all states, and where it is made the subject of joint action or common policy for the first time, it is simply not realistic to think that states will allow themselves to be bound by the votes of others if interests which they consider vital are at stake.</P>
    <P>The area of security is a particularly sensitive one for all the member states. At the European Council in Rome in December last the Heads of State or Government agreed that certain specific areas of security should be considered for inclusion in a common policy.  These include issues discussed in international organisations, such as arms control, disarmament and related issues; CSCE matters, certain questions debated in the United Nations, including peace-keeping operations; economic and technological co-operation in the armaments field; co-ordination of armaments export policy; and non-proliferation.  We are urging that a close study be made of these areas with <Col N="1262" /> a view to determining their suitability for a common policy.</P>
    <P>Some partners have taken the view that security inevitably includes defence.  I have already said in this House that the Conclusions of the Rome II European Council distinguish between security and defence, treating the latter as something to be considered with a view to the future and without prejudice either to the positions of member states which have existing obligations in this area, such as those in NATO, or to the traditional position of other member states, which, of course, includes Ireland.</P>
    <P>The position of successive Governments here has been that, if the Community were to develop its own defence arrangements for its security, then Ireland as a committed member state would consider participating.</P>
    <P>A number of ideas have been canvassed, such as joint military forces for intervention outside Europe to protect Community interests, or a mutual defence commitment of the type which already exists in Western European Union.  That being said, differences of orientation of a very basic kind have also emerged on the question of a common defence policy for the union.</P>
    <P>Some partners favour the development of a defence policy for the union as such, while others object to the union developing its own defence policy and see the defence of Europe as situated firmly in the NATO context.  A defence arrangement which the EC works out for itself, and which has Community interests as its primary focus, is clearly different from a system in which existing wider arrangements continue to have primacy and where non-Community members are part of the decision-making process.</P>
    <P>We have followed the debate in this area closely.  A significant part of it is taking place outside the Community framework in NATO, aiming at a NATO Summit meeting in Rome in November. Within the Twelve, there is an emerging consensus that a defence capability of the union proper is not on the cards at this stage.  Indeed, the Conclusions of the Rome II themselves are an earnest of <Col N="1263" /> this: they speak of defence &ldquo;with a view to the future&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the question has arisen whether a link with Western European Union might not be appropriate as a way of establishing a framework within which in due course a defence role for the Community proper and decided by the Community might be provided for. The current Western European Union Treaty remains in force until 1998.  In this perspective, some member states see Western European Union becoming a part or organ of the political union. Others believe it should be separate, with a responsibility in the defence and military area which the union does not have; others again see it as potentially a European pillar of NATO or a channel between the new union and NATO.  It has been proposed that Western European Union should develop security policy on behalf of the union, or that it should be the implementing arm in the military area for decisions of the union, or that it should take policy guidelines from the political union for its action in the defence area.</P>
    <P>These proposals at present run into the obvious difficulty that not all Community member states are members of Western European Union.  But even those who are have different views on the future evolution of Western European Union and on the question of a common defence policy.</P>
    <P>For some member states, any link established between the union and Western European Union would have to be counter-balanced by a link of at least equal strength between the Western European Union and NATO.  The overall shape of relations between the union and Western European Union clearly cannot be decided until the question of principle concerning the role foreseen for the union in defence matters is resolved.  It is equally clear that for many of the NATO members among the Twelve, the future role of NATO, which as I mentioned earlier is also under examination in that body, will have an important bearing on their decisions in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> There are other proposals for centralisation of decision making in the Council of Ministers, rationalisation of preparatory and support bodies and a role of initiative for the Commission on the same basis as member states, which are generally accepted.  The general aim is to rationalise the present separate systems of decisionmaking for Community business and for foreign policy.  As such, they give rise to no problems of principle for us.</P>
    <P>The development of a role for the Union in Home Affairs and Judicial Co-operation is another significant area of work of the Intergovernmental Conference. It constitutes the so-called third pillar of the Union alongside Community business proper and a common foreign and security policy.  What it involves essentially is bringing into the Union the considerable areas of inter-governmental co-operation between Ministers for the Interior and Justice which already takes place outside the scope of the existing Treaties.  The external borders of the Community, access, visa and asylum arrangements, immigration, drug trafficking, customs and judicial co-operation, and action against terrorism and organised crime.</P>
    <P>Already there is a considerable agreement in principle in the Inter-governmental Conference on this issue. At our Luxembourg meeting Chancellor Kohl brought forward ideas for further developing the work of the Conference in this area, including a proposal for a European Criminal Investigation Office. All Heads of Government are agreed that the fight against drug trafficking and organised crime requires the most vigorous, determined and co-ordinated approach.  At Luxembourg we agreed on the objectives underlying the Chancellor's proposals and instructed the Conference to examine them further with a view to the revision of the Union Treaty.</P>
    <P>Ireland can agree to a more systematic arrangement for co-operation between the member states on these issues.  We are working actively and constructively with our partners on the main issues involved including the scope of the <Col N="1265" /> arrangements, the decision-making structure, and the links between work in this area and in the Community proper.  Sensitive matters of national jurisdiction are involved for all the member states and we share the view held by most of our partners that at this stage this is an area where the approach should be largely intergovernmental with the emphasis on consensus in decisionmaking.</P>
    <P>But, of course, we cannot wait for the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conferences and the ratification of the new Treaty in order to take action in these areas.  The Luxembourg Council therefore reviewed current work, especially on the free movement of persons and on drugs.  Ireland has welcomed the signature by all member states of the Convention on Asylum and we wish to see early signature of the Convention on the crossing of external frontiers.  At Luxembourg I strongly supported the setting up of a European Drugs Monitoring Centre and this was agreed.  We also supported the proposals made by Chancellor Kohl to intensify work between now and the end of the year on immigration, asylum policy, drugs and organised crime.</P>
    <P>Apart from the negotiations on common foreign and security policy and judicial co-operation that I have just described, a considerable proportion of the work of the two intergovernmental conferences has been devoted to revision of the Treaty of Rome itself.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to create new Community competences in the areas of citizenship, energy, Trans-European infrastructure networks, public health, education, culture, consumer protection, tourism and civil protection against natural disasters.  It is also proposed to reinforce existing competences in the areas of social policy, research and technological development, and the environment. Finally, and of great significance for Ireland, it is proposed to reinforce the provisions on economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>All of these areas are very important, and we are taking an active part in the <Col N="1266" /> negotiations on them.  We have submitted proposals for Treaty texts on education, health, and economic and social cohesion, and have co-operated with the Commission in the preparation of a text on culture.</P>
    <P>I have previously stressed the importance I attach to the provision of arrangements for Community citizenship.  The conference is considering a range of provisions which will cover rights of residence, facilities to vote in European and local elections in the country of residence, co-operation in the protection of citizens' interests in third countries, and the establishment of a Community ombudsman.</P>
    <P>These proposals, in the form in which they have emerged in the Presidency's draft composite text, are largely acceptable as far as Ireland is concerned.  In the case of electoral rights, for example, our provisions are among the most liberal in the Community.  There may also have to be provision for the extension of citizens' rights as the union develops.  But this is an issue which we feel will require further examination in the Conference with a view to assessing the full extent of the commitment involved.</P>
    <P>The success of the internal market programme must count among the major achievements of the Community since its establishment.  Satisfaction at its success has been accompanied by a realisation that the needs of workers and their role in the development of the single market must be acknowledged and given expression.  The Community Charater of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, the Social Charter, agreed by eleven member states in 1989, represents a significant development in that direction.</P>
    <P>Ireland has already taken a positive approach in this area, and we were able to sign the Social Charter.  We are also taking a similarly positive approach in the Intergovernmental Conference.  In my view, there has to be a strong emphasis on a Social Europe to match the emphasis given in the Single European Act to the Internal Market.  <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is a clear <Col N="1267" /> example of what we have been able to achieve in this area.  For us, of course, the maintenance and development of employment is a major consideration.</P>
    <P>The Conference is considering the extension of majority voting in the social policy area beyond the provisions of the original Treaties and the Single European Act.  The Government are, as I indicated in the Dáil on 8 May, favourably disposed in principle to the extension of qualified majority voting subject to exceptions dictated by important national considerations. The draft Union Treaty clearly stipulates certain areas which should remain subject to unanimity.  We and other member states have stressed that changes in this area should not impose costs which would have a detrimental effect on job creation and employment.</P>
    <P>For Ireland the question of economic and social cohesion is an essential part of the negotiations in the two Inter-governmental Conferences.  Cohesion policy is, of course, already covered in the Treaty but in our view the major steps forward now envisaged in European integration require an enhanced cohesion dimension in the new Union.</P>
    <P>We were conscious of this in the preparatory work for the Intergovernmental Conferences and our objective at that stage was to ensure that cohesion was placed firmly on the agenda of the Conferences. At both European Councils in Rome I argued that is should be amongst the priority issues.  This was accepted by my colleagues and is well reflected in the conclusions of both these meetings.</P>
    <P>Our next objective is to ensure that the issue is properly taken up in the negotiations and reflected in the work of the Conferences.  I am particularly pleased with the discussion of economic and social cohesion at the Luxembourg Council and with the Council conclusions. There is agreement that cohesion is an integral part of the general development of the Union and that this aspect should be embodied in the Treaty in an appropriate way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> In addition, the President of the Commission made an important and interesting statement at the Council on cohesion policies and on the outlook in this area.  He mentioned a number of ideas, including continued growth in the Structural Funds, the setting up of a major infrastructural programme for trans-European networks, a possible special fund for the environment and taking better account of relative wealth in contributions to the Community budget. The European Council asked the Commission to clarify the various ideas it put forward in this statement in time for the December European Council.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, as a result of this meeting, that real progress is being made on strengthening cohesion, both by way of appropriate Treaty amendments and by way of specific actions to implement the cohesion objective.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the Conferences began in December last Ireland submitted a series of Treaty amendments related to economic and social cohesion.  By taking the initiative we were able to set the scene for the subsequent debate and to influence the attitude of the Commission and other member states with a major interest in the area.  Due in no small part to our continuing efforts, the Commission first, and subsequently the Presidency, came forward with proposals for Treaty amendments which recognise the need to strengthen the cohesion provisions. While these proposals do not go as far as Ireland would wish, we welcome their contributions to the debate, as we do the contributions of Greece, Portugal and Spain.</P>
    <P>Our negotiating approach is based on an analysis of the need for action to promote cohesion in the EMU context and over the long term and on an assessment of what it is feasible in the current phase of European integration.  Our approach is also conditioned by scepticism about the correctness of some of the more sanguine conclusions about the effects of EMU on regional disparities which the Commission drew from its analysis.</P>
    <P>Our specific proposals have been made available to Deputies.  In essence they <Col N="1269" /> provide for an obligation to take account of the cohesion dimension in the formulation of Community policies and in the design and implementation of Economic and Monetary Union; regular reviews of the progress towards cohesion and of the contribution made towards such progress of the various means &mdash; national policies, the Structural Funds and other Community policies &mdash; with provision, where progress towards cohesion has not been satisfactory, for proposals by the Commission and action by the Council to rectify the situation; and specific Community action to promote cohesion in the second and third stages of Economic and Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>In addition to the reform of the cohesion chapter of the EEC Treaty we have also sought to have cohesion specifically recognised as one of the tasks of the Community, and this has been taken up in the Presidency's draft Treaty.</P>
    <P>We are active to ensure that our concerns are adequately reflected in the final outcome.  In addition to our own proposals, we have supported worthwhile proposals made by other member states. Thus, we have supported the Spanish proposal for a Treaty amendment incorporating a commitment to a rapid review and follow-up decision on the own resources system, so as to reflect much better than it now does the internationally-accepted principle of progressivity, in respect of revenue-raising measures.</P>
    <P>Another Spanish proposal is for the creation of an Inter-State Compensation Fund in addition to the existing Structural Funds in order further to promote and underpin cohesion.  Our own submission had indeed made the point that in a more fully integrated community or union it would be necessary to move towards systems of financial equalisation such as exist in closely integrated states, some of them federal states, in different parts of the world.  Accordingly, we have supported the Spanish proposal.</P>
    <P>At the Luxembourg Council we noted that there are broad areas of agreement on the basic components of Economic and Monetary Union and that the draft <Col N="1270" /> union treaty provisions on EMU will form a basis for continuing negotiations.</P>
    <P>In some ways, the agenda for EMU has a more confined focus than that for political union.  However, this does not mean that the consequences of our participation in EMU will be any the less profound.</P>
    <P>If it is to be judged a success, EMU must succeed in promoting non-inflationary growth, economic convergence, high employment and economic and social cohesion.  It must also be governed by the principles of stable prices, sound public finances, a sound monetary policy and a healthy balance of payments.</P>
    <P>There will be a need for the closer co-ordination of economic policies among the 12 members states and for open, competitive markets which will allow this co-ordination to show its best results.  On the monetary side, dynamism should be underpinned by the eventual introduction of a single currency which will be the outward symbol of the single monetary and exchange rate policy which most member states wish to see in place before the end of this century.  This policy would be aimed at maintaining price stability and, subject to this objective, at supporting the general economic policy of the Community.</P>
    <P>In the economic area, we are looking to the establishment of economic policy guidelines which will help to determine, in broad terms, the overall growth path of the Community.  As compliance with these guidelines will be an essential element of Community discipline, it will be necessary to devise procedures to cater for the hopefully rare occurrence when one or more members states depart from them.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the emphasis which is placed on the need for budgetary discipline if a successful and viable EMU is to be established.  We have demonstrated that discipline and are resolved to adhere to it.  However, to copper-fasten our achievement, we, along with other member states, have agreed that certain specific rules be incorporated in a revised Treaty, in particular, a prohibition <Col N="1271" /> on monetary financing and a ban on bailing out member states where inappropriate budgetary policies result in them falling into severe financial difficulties. It is also agreed that excessive budget deficits should be avoided and a special procedure will need to be devised to give effect to this aim.</P>
    <P>In the final stage of EMU, monetary policy within the Community will be the sole responsibility of the European System of Central Banks.  That system will consist of a European Central Bank and of the national central banks of the 12 member states.  It will have the power to issue currency and to intervene on the markets, both domestic and foreign.  Its independence will be guaranteed by the new Treaty and its day-to-day operations will be carried out by an executive board composed of individuals of proven calibre in the monetary field.  Ultimate responsibility for the exchange rate policy of the Community will rest at the political level although close consultation with the ESCB authorities will be an essential prerequisite before any major decisions are taken.  There is agreement that the ESCB must be democratically accountable and the new Treaty must provide the framework within which this accountability can be managed.</P>
    <P>We are now in Stage I of EMU.  Within the Community, there is a very real desire to see the second stage of EMU begin on 1 January 1994.  However, a number of measures will have to be in place if this is to be realised.  In addition to full liberalisation of capital movements, certain rules in the budgetary area, to which I have already referred, will need to be accepted and there must be real and visible progress in the convergence of the member states' economies.  For many countries, this will require a considerable effort if inflation is to be got down to an acceptable level and if their public finances are to be put on a credible footing. Steps are now being taken to develop short to medium-term programmes for convergence on the part of the member states in question.  The Luxembourg European Council emphasised the need <Col N="1272" /> to make satisfactory and lasting progress on convergence as of now, during the first stage.</P>
    <P>The content of Stage 11 of EMU is still a matter of negotiation.  One of the principal outstanding issues here is the nature of the monetary body to be instituted in this phase and the date of its coming into operation.  In an effort to find a compromise the Luxembourg Presidency proposed the establishment of a board of governors on the entry into force of the union treaty.  This board would be responsible for the promotion of the ECU and for the smooth running of the European Monetary System.  It would also act to strengthen co-operation among the central banks of the member states.</P>
    <P>The ESCB would be established at the beginning of Stage II but it would not become operational until 1 January 1996, unless there was a unanimous decision in favour of an earlier date.  That system would take the place of the board of governors and would take forward the concrete preparation for the move to a single monetary policy at the start of Stage III.  This compromise seems to me to be a rational way forward and it has found favour with a majority of member states.</P>
    <P>To complete the envisaged timetable, it is intended that a report shall be drawn up, no later than 31 December 1996, which will enable the European Council to ascertain whether or not the conditions are in place, including satisfactory progress towards economic and social cohesion, to allow a date to be fixed for the passage to the final stage of EMU.</P>
    <P>The role of the European Parliament is a significant issue for the Inter-governmental Conference on Political Union.  This indicates the extent to which the Parliament has developed its position in the Community's institutional process in the 12 years since it was first directly elected.  It has sought to be heard and has succeeded in being heard.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland understand the actual and potential importance of the Parliament. In many areas, it has taken positions close to or identical with our <Col N="1273" /> interests.  For example, in the area of the structural policies it has been very supportive of the needs of the peripheral regions.</P>
    <P>We believe that the Intergovernmental Conference should increase Parliament's influence.  And there are a number of areas where we think Parliament's role could be enhanced: we think the Parliament should have the right to confirm the appointment of the commission as a body; we are prepared to look at an extension of its powers to assent to agreements between the Community and third countries and we are also prepared to consider the formalisation of its activities in the areas of petition and inquiry.</P>
    <P>In addition to these measures, we believe that a great deal can be done to increase the Parliament's influence in the legislative area.  More should be done to ensure that the Council takes account of Parliament's first reading opinions.  The existing co-operation procedure introduced by the Single Act which provides for two readings should be extended to new areas of Community activity.  At the second reading stage there should be direct discussions between Parliament and the Council in order to see if a common position can be reached.  In making these changes, we consider that the role of the Commission in reviewing the amendments proposed by the Parliament and as the intermediary in the contacts between the Council and the Parliament is vital and should be maintained. Overall changes along these lines would considerably enhance the Parliament's powers in the legislative field.</P>
    <P>There is as yet no agreement in the Conference on proposals to give Parliament the right of co-decision with the Council on legislative acts.  This was confirmed at our discussions in Luxembourg. For our part we are reserved on ideas for full co-decision.  In order to facilitate the operation of co-decision, it has been proposed that the present classification of Community legislation should be modified to provide for a new type of legislative instrument &mdash; the law &mdash; and that the Parliament should be able to share the final word with the Council on the <Col N="1274" /> adoption of this type of legislation.  In our view the present system of Community legislation has served the Community well, and it does not seem prudent to alter it simply to extend Parliament's powers.  If Parliament is to have some say in the final decision in a limited area, it should not be on the basis of an artificial reclassification of legislation but on a carefully defined basis which would have to include provisions for any voting by the Parliament to be by a majority of all its members.  Moreover, we must ensure that the arrangements introduced do not add to the already lengthy procedure for processing Community legislation.</P>
    <P>A final point I would like to make on the issue of co-decision is the role of the national parliaments.  It should be remembered that the national parliaments process a considerable amount of legislation arising out of Community activities.  It is also important to remember that the members of the Council are accountable to their national parliaments, and as such the Council has its roots clearly in the democratic process. The Conference has yet to consider proposals on the role of national parliaments, and, when it does, Ireland will take a positive view on enhancing their involvement in the work of the Community.</P>
    <P>This, then, is the scope of the negotiation underway in the Inter-governmental Conferences on Political Union and Economic and Monetary Union, and a description of the main issues which have arisen up to now in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Government agree that the Europe of 1991 and beyond demands that the Community strengthen its capacity for facing this new situation and undertake a new, significant step forward in the progress towards that European Union which has long been its objective.</P>
    <P>Ireland is fully committed to this objective. As an organisation, the Community is unique on the world scene, and it is unique precisely because its ultimate objective goes further than those set by other associations of states or international organisations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> Membership of the Community has been of great benefit to Ireland.  We have for almost 20 years been able to play a central role in the European body which, as I said at the opening, has been outstanding in maintaining and enhancing its validity while Europe changed around it over the last two years.  The Government are determined to maintain Ireland's membership of the Community and the benefits it brings.  In the Government's view, this will entail Ireland continuing to play a full and central role in the affairs of the Community as they develop. &ldquo;Opting out&rdquo; of the central policies of the Community can seem an attractive proposition only to those who take a shallow view of affairs.  It is not an alternative which the Government consider would serve the country's interests.</P>
    <P>Our general approach to the two Inter-governmental Conferences, then, is one of ensuring that, as the Community makes further progress in its integration, Ireland will continue to play the full part in all its policies that it has played since joining in 1973.  In this approach, we will be serving the interests not only of the Irish people, but of the people of Europe as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to say that I am not happy with the format of this debate.  The subject matter here is so complex and serious, and there are so many different compartments in which it can be debated, that really it is unsatisfactory to have a debate without having a question and answer session where Ministers and particularly the Taoiseach, would have to answer questions on particular parts of their speeches.  It is also unsatisfactory that the Government have not tabled any substantive motion for this debate which sets out their policies on which the House could either agree or disagree.  We have instead a series of statements which are open to any number of different interpretations and upon which no detailed questioning or scrutiny takes place.  I regard that as an unsatisfactory way of scrutinising a matter of such enormous complexity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> This debate is almost as important to this House as was the debate on the Constitution of 1937.  The changes in the governance of this island that will occur as a result of the changes in the Treaty that are in prospect are almost as far reaching as were the changes that took place when the new Constitution was enacted in 1937.  We need just as detailed a form of discussion as we had on that occasion which none of us in this House remember.</P>
    <P>Within its own terms of reference I am disappointed with the outcome of this Summit.  There are four basic reasons for this.  First, the Summit did not apparently discuss the problem of unemployment and yet that is the subject of greatest concern certainly to the citizens of Irealnd and to the citizens of most European countries.  In my view the Treaty of Rome should contain an explicit commitment to the achievement of full employment in Europe which would govern the activities of all European institutions.  This should have been included in the communique from this Summit but it was not.</P>
    <P>The fiscal policies of member states should be managed on a co-operative basis designed to maximise total employment. Big countries should not be allowed, as Germany is now doing, to soak up limited European savings in a wasteful way because it is not prepared to pay out of tax money for the cost of German unification and instead is paying by borrowing money and driving up interests rates for everyone else in Europe.</P>
    <P>So far as unemployment is concerned the Summit should have agreed to the establishment of a properly financed labour market research institute for Europe to help members to develop the best micro-economic policies to convert spending into jobs.  Present European policies are failing to convert economic growth into additional employment and only Denmark is worse than Ireland in this regard.  We have the worst record in converting economic growth into jobs. This has been demonstrated in recent tables.  There is no country which needs the best available advice on converting <Col N="1277" /> output into jobs more than we do, and we should press for the establishment of an institute to help countries to ensure that their policies are pro-employment. If the Summit was in touch with the thinking of European people it would surely have spent some time on the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is not clear from the Summit communique that when and if European monetary union is established it will be accompanied by a substantial increase in the European budget nor is it clear that the budget will be extended to include large scale support for, for example, education in member states like Ireland who have to provide skilled workers trained at Irish expense in the form of a subsidy to the economies of other member states where they work, for instance, Britain.  if there is to be a genuine sense of community in Europe, Europe should fund education.  There is no commitment in the Summit communique to move in that direction.  It is likely that we will have a Treaty which will have much by way of commitments on paper to improve things but without financial means to do so.  The framework agreement with regard to the budget does not expire until the end of 1993.  However, the Intergovernmental Conferences will be concluded before then.  We will agree on paper to all sorts of things without having any knowledge as to whether money will be there to pay for them.  Ireland should insist on a linkage between agreement on a substantial enhancement of the Community budget with any agreement on further enhancement of the powers of the European Community institutions.  We want to see an enhancement of the powers of European Community institutions.  It is in our interests that that should happen, but it is only in our interests if Europe can have the financial means to fulfill the obligations of Europe.  A Europe with many obligations on paper without the financial means to fulfill them will be a deceit practised on the people of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, representing a peripheral nation should have sought clearer commitments with regard to the European budget.  It is particularly notable <Col N="1278" /> that in the Commission's proposals for a new Treaty for a political union there is no reference to education.  There is reference to the environment, energy, research, culture and the protection of heritage but not to education.  There is no other area in which there is a greater need for European commitment than in funding education.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed, too, that the Summit failed to introduce tighter control on the use of industrial grants and other forms of local aid in richer countries to attract industry and jobs from the poorer countries.  One reason Ireland has to offer such a very high level of capital grants to industry is that richer countries like The Netherlands and Belgium are doing it on a large scale, thus forcing us to spend our money on capital grants to industry, which is not the best use of our money.  If we want to have genuine cohesion and convergence in Europe, there must be European discipline to prevent richer countries from attracting jobs from the poorer countries by using their financial might to offer unfairly attractive incentives to industry.  The extra top up grants given by richer countries distort free competition in Europe and yet there is not a single word in the communique about any limitation on that practice.</P>
    <P>If the communique is to be believed, it seems that richer member states will also be able to continue to top up aid to their farmers in Europe while poorer member states like Ireland with more farmers and less money will not be able to do so.  This is already obvious in the case of the set aside grants where other countries are topping up grants but the Irish Government are either not able or are unwilling to do so.  This is also true with regard to headage payments and we will go further along that road.  We are heading towards the re-nationalisation of agricultural policies where richer countries will be able to give an unfair advantage to their farmers against the farmers in poorer countries like Ireland.  There will be unfair competition in Europe with richer countries helping their industry and their farmers to attract resources to the centre from the periphery.  The communique should <Col N="1279" /> refer to strong action to outlaw such topping up grants, but it does not do so because the Irish Government have not made a sufficient case to do so.</P>
    <P>We must have not just a free Europe, not just a united Europe but a fair Europe.  As long as rich countries can offer bigger incentives to farmers and industrialists we will not have a fair Europe.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed also that the Summit did not discuss the crisis in European agriculture which will arise from the pressure on the CAP in the world trade talks and from the proposals that are being made by Commissioner MacSharry in that regard.  Ireland will lose more from these proposals than will any other EC country.  Estimates have been made of a loss of up to 16,000 PAYE industrial jobs and up to 22,000 jobs on farms will be lost as a result of changes in the CAP. A country with 262,000 people unemployed should not contemplate losing an additional 40,000 jobs in that way.  The social change involved will be truly traumatic for families and the rural localities involved.</P>
    <P>The Summit should have authorised the development of a coherent policy to protect the people and the countries involved, like Ireland.  Europe needs to ensure that it has sufficient native food production to feed the 320 million citizens of the Community in an emergency. While Europe has surpluses at present, and those surpluses are growing, there is a possibility that the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which is anti-economic and designed to reduce the competitiveness of European agriculture in the world as a whole because it is handicapping, in particular, commercial production, may destroy the basic capacity of Europe to feed itself over the next decade.  This would leave Europe strategically vulnerable.  Making this case is of particular importance to Ireland because Ireland, unlike most other European countries where much of the agricultural production is based on imported raw materials from outside Europe, can <Col N="1280" /> produce food for Europe using Irish grass and Irish grown grain without the necessity of resorting to imports from Thailand, New Orleans or anywhere else.  Ireland has the agricultural capacity to produce food for Europe regardless of the availability of imports.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should have made a case for special treatment of Ireland in regard to the proposed reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy because we, almost alone in Europe, can produce a surplus of food for Europe without having to rely on imported raw materials. It appears the Taoiseach did not make that case and the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will be disastrous in its consequence for Ireland and will have taken effect before the next Summit in Maastricht.  The last opportunity the European Prime Ministers had to give a clear direction as to what way the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy should go was at the Summit in Luxembourg. The reform will be a <i>fait accompli</i> by the time the Prime Ministers meet at their next meeting at Maastricht. The Taoiseach did not avail of the opportunity to make that case at the meeting in Luxembourg.  He has been particularly negligent in this matter.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the communiqué issued after the Summit which contains the following statements: the European Council considers the Uruguay Round to be the first priority in international economic relations and the European Council calls on the Council and the Commission, in its capacity as negotiator, to continue their efforts to enable the Uruguay Round to come to a satisfactory conclusion.  There was not one word in the communiqué about agriculture or the implications of that for the economy of this country, the destruction of rural Ireland or the destruction of 16,000 PAYE jobs in processing.  Yet these references to the Uruguay Round were contained in the draft communiqué the Taoiseach had before him when he went to the Summit.  It was wide open to him to seek at the Summit the inclusion of a phrase such as, &ldquo;while recognising the particular problems of certain member <Col N="1281" /> states which have an extreme reliance on agriculture&rdquo;.  If such a phrase had been included in the European Council's communiqué it would have had a considerable directive role on the subsequent deliberations both at the Council of Ministers and the Commission.  The Taoiseach was presented with a golden opportunity to do this because there was a statement in the communiqué about the Uruguay Round.  However, he failed to avail of this opportunity to insert any statement about the special position of Ireland.  He was negligent in this regard.</P>
    <P>It seems that the Government have no European policy of their own.  They see their role as one of reacting to other people's ideas.  Thus, they are abdicating their responsibility to the Irish people to seek to shape the Europe of the future in our interests as a people.  For example, Spain has proposed an alliance of peripheral states to fight for their rights. They have also proposed a formalised method of transferring resources from wealthier to less wealthy states, as applies in the German federal system and which I suggested to the Taoiseach in this House two years ago.  Ireland should have been making those suggestions.  Why did we leave it to Spain to make them?  Why are we allowing Spain to do our work for us? Why are we simply trotting along after Spain, which the Taoiseach is doing by saying he agrees with their proposal? Surely Ireland should have made that proposal first and Spain should have agreed with us?  We have a greater interest than Spain in the need for protection for peripheral states and in having a formalised method for transferring resources from richer to poorer countries. Unfortunately, we are following the Spanish rather than the other way round. This is not as it should be.</P>
    <P>It appears from the Taoiseach's speech that the Irish Government are opposed to giving powers of co-decision with the Council of Ministers to the European Parliament.  This is a foolish and unsustainable position.  It will isolate us from mainstream European opinion and will leave us in the company of nobody else but, perhaps, the United Kingdom.  If <Col N="1282" /> this policy is persisted with, it will create a very serious situation.  The Italian Parliament passed a resolution to the effect that it will not accept the new Treaty unless the European Parliament accepts it first.  Therefore, if the Parliament is not satisfied that it has adequate powers of co-decision there may be no outcome at all at the Inter-Governmental Conferences. Rather than taking the position the Taoiseach has taken and saying that we do not want any powers of co-decision for the European Parliament, we should have been supporting the idea of giving greater powers to the European Parliament and, perhaps, seeking to adjust the operation of the Parliament to suit the needs of a country like Ireland which is relatively small.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach will not suggest that the Council of Ministers is a democratically accountable body because it is not.  Dáil Éireann has no say whatever in the positions taken by Irish Ministers at the Council of Ministers.  That was true under all Governments but it is particularly true under the present Government. We only hear about what the Taoiseach and Ministers are doing at European meetings after the event and we have no say before the event in what they do.  Therefore, it is wrong to suggest that somehow or other the Council of Ministers is a body with a similar democratic and open mandate as the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting in this regard to hear the Taoiseach's views on the French proposal of a congress of national parliaments on European matters.  This issue was not referred to in the Taoiseach's speech and, although it was tabled by the French President, no reference seems to have been made to it in the Luxembourg communiqué.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is interesting.  I believe &mdash; I say this with some care&mdash; that if we are to give more powers to the European Parliament, which we should, we should look at a major restructuring of the European Parliament.  We should <Col N="1283" /> have a European Senate with equal representation of member states, as applies, for example, in the United States Senate, as a co-equal with the directly elected lower house which has proportionate representation to population.  That would give the European Parliament, on a bicameral basis, a genuinely federal system with a proper balance between the interests of smaller member states and the interests of the majorities of population which exist in the larger member states.  Rather than simply objecting to more powers for the European Parliament, which essentially is what the Government are doing, we should be looking for a restructuring of the Parliament.</P>
      <P>I know we will be told that that proposal is unrealistic, nobody agrees with it and so on but that is not a reason for not putting it on the agenda.  Proposals which frequently appear unrealistic initially can, in the maelstrom of negotiations when other positions are gradually ruled out one after the other, become the only proposals on which anyone can ultimately agree.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider favourably the establishment of a European Senate along the lines of the United States Senate, a Senate directly elected by the people of the member states, as is the United States Senate.  In the present Intergovernmental Conferences, the Irish Government are so worked up about theoretical defence issues &mdash; this is reflected in the Taoiseach's speech today &mdash; and blocking any progress in that area that they are failing to put forward any new views on other issues which might be beneficial to Ireland and have a more immediate and practical effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now wish to refer to certain other matters, to certain aspects of the Luxembourg communique itself, to the Taoiseach's speech and, finally, to the Commission's submission to the Inter-governmental Conferences on political union.  The Summit communique contains on the second page certain language which I find hard to understand.  It states: &ldquo;Common foreign and security policy will extend to all questions relating to the <Col N="1284" /> security of the Union&rdquo;.  On the face of it that is a very simple statement.  Obviously, one's ability to defend oneself has something to do with security but we have been told that defence is not involved. What does the sentence &ldquo;common foreign and security policy will extend to all questions relating to the security of the Union&rdquo; mean then?  That must mean defence, or does it?  It is not clear to me; if it does not include defence, the statement in the communique is wrong because it does not extend to all questions relating to the security of the Union if that is the case.  It would appear that a union which cannot defend itself is not secure.</P>
    <P>Another sentence which I find difficult to comprehend is as follows: &ldquo;The European Council has agreed that the question of strengthening the defence identity of the Union will be decided at the final stage of the Conference&rdquo;.  We should note the words &ldquo;the question of strengthening the defence identity of the Union will be decided at the final stage of the Conference&rdquo;.  That implies that there is already a defence identity of the Union. Is there and what does it mean?  It is not clear.  They go on to say that this identity will take account of the traditional positions of certain member states.  The earlier sentence implies that there is already a defence identity.  Now they are talking about the need to take into account in the future the traditional positions of member states.  What does that language mean?  It seems to be peculiarly opaque and I am surprised that the Taoiseach did not elucidate on this language because to me &mdash; I may be a simple fellow as Sir Anthony Esmonde used to say &mdash; it is meaningless.</P>

      <P>Those are the points I wish to make with regard to that matter but I will come back to it.  I now want to refer to the Taoiseach's speech, in particular to the position on Yugoslavia. We, in Ireland, should have a special sympathy for those peoples in Central Europe who wish to achieve the right to self-determination for their historic nations.  The European Community took the view, when the suggestion was made initially, that if Slovenia decided after a referendum, similar to the election held here in 1918 when the majority were in favour of self-determination, that it wanted to achieve its independence, that what was good enough for Ireland in 1918-19 should be good enough for Slovenia in 1991.  It will be recalled by Members of this House that when the Versailles Treaty negotiations were taking place, representatives of Dáil Éireann sought to be heard.  They were refused a hearing by the wise statesmen of that time who believed that it would be wrong to disturb existing boundaries and that Ireland should remain part of <Col N="1286" /> the enforced union of Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
      <P>To some extent the reaction of the practical statesmen of Europe meeting in Luxembourg to the wishes of the Slovenes for self-determination is very similar to the view expressed by the practical men at Versailles in 1918-19.  The Slovenian and Croatian authorities are acting on foot of the results of referenda among their peoples just as Dáil Éireann was acting on foot of the results of the general election held in December 1918. Indeed, it is fair to say that the mandate of the Slovenian authorities is far clearer than the mandate given in the general election held in 1918 when Members were elected to the British Parliament.  It was not a referendum held on the issue of independence specifically whereas the referenda held in Slovenia and Croatia dealt specifically with that issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I be allowed by Deputy Quinn, whom I will not interrupt, to conclude my remarks as I wish to put this statement into proper context?  If the principle of self-determination is to be introduced in different parts of Central Europe, where many peoples are intermingled, the principle for one people will only be able to exist at the expense of another.  It is important that Europe should approach this matter on a parallel basis.  The first principle which should be accepted is that of self-determination. One cannot repress a people's desire to be free by force but there must be another pillar and that is a proper code for the protection of the political rights of minorities. What Europe should now be doing, through the Council of Europe of which all these countries are now members, is evolving a system which includes not just rights for minorities in terms of individual rights to speak their language and education but also the right to political participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The model of executive power sharing attempted in this island in the seventies under the Sunningdale Agreement represents an ideal model and should be <Col N="1287" /> considered for application in other parts of Europe.  For example, in Croatia, where there is a significant Serbian minority, it should be possible to introduce a European code which would say that the Serbs are entitled to certain political rights within Croatia if Croatia achieves the right to self-determination.  Those rights should be justifiable in a European court.  We should work towards a charter of political rights for minorities, which includes the right to political and executive participation in Government.  If we do this we can at the same time move towards self-determination for the peoples on that basis and not on any other.</P>
    <P>The lessons of Irish history over the past 70 years are particularly instructive and useful for the peoples of Central Europe who are seeking to reconcile the right to self determination on the one hand with the proper protection of minorities on the other.  We need to draw from Irish experience a proposal, drafted under a proper European umbrella to ensure there is fairness to all sides, which reconciles the principle of self determination with the protection of minorities. Ireland of all the countries in Europe has a right, a duty and a historic responsibility to be the country which stands up for self-determination on a properly modulated and guaranteed basis to ensure protection of minorities.  The Taoiseach therefore, while I do not criticise him for going along with the Community on these matters, should have been more ambitious in suggesting from Irish experience useful models to be followed in the future.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reference in the Taoiseach's speech to the structure of the Treaty, he states that he agrees that there should be separate pillars to the Treaty, with certain matters being dealt with centrally under the Treaty of Rome and other matters being dealt with in other ways under the aegis of the very top of the European Council, the European Prime Ministers, in other words rather than having a single Treaty, with a single political mandate we would have a number <Col N="1288" /> of Treaties and a number of arrangements with the only common thread being the council of Prime Ministers meetings, which would be held twice a year in whatever country held the Presidency at a particular time.  To my mind that is a recipe for ensuring that we will never have a truly federal Europe and we will never achieve anything substantial in Europe if we continue on that basis.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has told us that he agrees with this multifarious approach to the building of a common European home, but I profoundly disagree with him on this issue.  This is quite an important distinction in the positions of the two major parties in this House.  I understand how the Taoiseach has reached that conclusion, that he is a practical man who is anxious to make progress in the short term &mdash; and I do not say this in any personally critical or disrespectful way &mdash; but I disagree profoundly with the conclusion the Taoiseach has reached on this issue.  I think we should have a unitary Treaty with perhaps different means of decision-making, unanimity for some decisions and non-unanimity for others. I think we should have a Commissioner in the European Commission responsible for foreign policy.  Foreign policy should not be something out there to be dealt with under another procedure but should be part of the Treaty of Rome, just as all the other matters are.  Perhaps the Taoiseach's views on this are not as fixed in stone as the text would suggest and I would hope that is the case.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says that &ldquo;the new Treaty should provide for the bringing of new areas into the common policy domain on the basis of decision by consensus in the European Council or the Council of Ministers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I had the privilege of being a member &mdash; and it was one of the instructive periods of my political career &mdash; of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  As the Taoiseach probably knows, the Committee of Ministers at the Council of Europe can only act by unanimity.  The Council of Europe was established in 1949 with a very ambitious <Col N="1289" /> concept that it would extend its competence to a very wide area.  There were provisions for the parliamentary assembly to be in almost constant session because there would be so many responsibilities undertaken by the Council of Europe.  However, the Council of Europe never developed beyond a very limited area of voluntary co-operation in the area of education and quite important provisions in regard to the protection of fundamental freedoms and human rights. In my view the reason it never developed beyond that was precisely because it is based, to use the Taoiseach's words, on decision by consensus.  There is no provision for majority voting.  I tabled a motion in the Council of Europe seeking the introduction of majority voting over a wider area.  In my view if you go down the road of not having majority voting we will not make progress and the European Community will congeal in just the same way as the Council of Europe has congealed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did say that new areas can be added by majority voting provided it is done in a structured way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his intervention.  I think it proves the point that it might be better if we had a more interactive debate.  However I am not trying to be in any way personal in raising objections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another interesting matter I wish to raise.  The European Commission in their proposals in regard to citizenship, which is a new title they want to introduce into the Treaty, say that every Union citizen shall be entitled to invoke the rights guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and fundamental freedoms, which the Union accepts.  That is very welcome. However the Irish people adopted a change in the Constitution which renders abortion unconstitutional.  The Constitution currently supersedes the provisions of the existing European Convention on Human Rights but if the European Convention on Human Rights is introduced as part of Community law <Col N="1290" /> as distinct from part of the Council of Europe law, then the European Convention on Human Rights will supersede our Constitution because we have already agreed that obligations under the European Community's Treaties can override the provisions of our Constitution.  It would be interesting if the Taoiseach would indicate whether that provision of the Treaty would mean if the Commission proposal is agreed, that the provisions of our Constitution in matters of this kind would be superseded by the provisions of the Strasbourg Convention. It may be that that particular proposal will not be adopted, in which case it is not a problem, but perhaps the Taoiseach or one of his Ministers would address this issue when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to raise is in relation to the completion of the internal market.  I had the opportunity of meeting six of the Prime Ministers whom the Taoiseach met last weekend, on the weekend previous to that when they were preparing for the meeting.  Their concern was that the meeting would make progress in regard to the internal market. One area in which Ireland is failing in this regard is in the ratification of the European Community Convention on patents; although we adopted the Convention in 1974 we have not yet ratified it because it requires a constitutional amendment.  I believe if we are to have a free internal market we must ratify that convention because Ireland's non-ratification is holding up its operation in other member states.  We are not just holding up ourselves but the rest of Europe as well.  In reply to questioning by me the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave very indefinite answers as to when there might be such a constitutional amendment but I would like to know when there will be such a constitutional amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was nearly going to call on the Taoiseach Deputy Haughey, to reply to some of the more interesting questions that were tabled towards the end of Deputy Bruton's contribution. Tragically I suspect &mdash; and I say this with <Col N="1291" /> all respect &mdash; that we will not get a comprehensive reply to the many questions that have been raised by Deputy Bruton. At the outset I would like to concur with him perhaps not in the same tone, but with the same observation.  If one looks at the multitude of journalists in the gallery who are riveted with excitement to this debate, I think the Taoiseach will concede just how inappropriate this mechanism is of communicating ideas about the implications of the next stage in the European Union.  If they had the slightest whiff of what Deputy Bruton was referring to in the last few moments of his comprehensive speech they would be packed out along the corridor, as the Taoiseach well knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to start at the end and work backwards.  In all probability we will have to face a referendum sometime in the autumn of 1992, some 16 months away, and I would urge this administration not to make the mistake which the previous administration of which I was a member made of not preparing the Irish public by not supplying them with sufficient information on the implications of the Single European Act.  I think the Taoiseach's party will remember that that debate was characterised by misinformation, misapprehension and downright malevolent ignorance on the part of some people who were stirring the pot, and that we very nearly did not ratify the Single European Act for reasons for which all of us in this House share some responsibility.  If the Taoiseach accepts that conclusion, and I have reason to believe that he does not disagree with it, it is therefore essential that the Irish Government very soon publish a White Paper on the present position of the Irish Government, and indeed the present position of the Fianna Fáil Party, as the dominant party within that Government &mdash; and I will get back to that point in a few moments.  The position of the Irish Government is as relevant as the reaction at the end of the compromise and negotiating process when the two treaties emerge side by side.  Even if such a White Paper were to be non-conclusive, it could <Col N="1292" /> simply set out the issues in a comprehensive way, initiating debate and signalling the Irish Government's preferred option in respect of those matters which still need to be resolved.  Our democracy, if it wants to give effect to the commitment to European union, needs such an informed debate but we are not having it in this House.  We need a committee or journalists who will take this issue seriously who will listen to what we are saying.  We are not getting these.  A monster, a Moby Dick, will suddenly surface and devour not just the present Administration but the political ideals of the various parties represented in this House. A proper debate is critical.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's speech today was perhaps the most comprehensive statement he has made on European affairs in this House.  It was a densely packed speech, clear, concise and explicit in many respects, shorn of any kind of cosmetic rhetoric.  Where the Taoiseach could give positions he indicated them.  The Taoiseach referred to new competences in relation to home affairs which will include crime, drugs, citizenship, energy, trans-European infrastructure networks, public health, education, culture, consumer protection, tourism and civil protection against natural disasters.  There is also to be increased competence in areas which already have a competence.  That specific agenda on its own is worthy of considerable scrutiny and explanation. We do not have the parliamentary mechanism to get adequate information from the Taoiseach or from the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs regarding the implications for any of these areas.  The question and answer exchange at Question Time is useful but limited.  A good Minister with the backup of a good supplementary brief will carefully avoid answering any question that might be potentially difficult.  Since there are plenty of good Ministers in the Government they are well capable of doing that.  We are not getting the kind of information we need.  A false argument could be made which could derail the political European union which this country wants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> Part of the problem rests with the Fianna Fáil Party.  They have no European partner.  They are orphans in Europe, having more or less severed their relationship with their cousins, the Gaullists, who have retreated into a racist, nationalist pose to which Fianna Fáil would never want to aspire.  Part of the problem regarding the debate in this Parliament is that the largest single party is a political orphan on the European stage. The Fianna Fáil Party cannot have access to the European People's Party network or to the Socialist group or the Left group of which Deputy Proinsias De Rossa is a member.  This is seriously impeding a conscious development within the Fianna Fáil Party which is of major significance to this Parliament.  Fianna Fáil will always be a major party in this Parliament, irrespective of what people think or do not think about them.  Because of the lack of contact, lack of friends and relations within the political family of Europe, the Government appear to be following the debate rather than initiating it.  They appear to be hesitant about living with the word &ldquo;federal&rdquo; but they will not get hung up on the adjective &ldquo;federal&rdquo;.  On the one hand they seem to be happy with the idea of supranational structures within the EC but at the same time they would prefer inter-governmental structures. It is classic Thatcherism to say, as the Government do, that somehow or other the Council of Ministers is democratically accountable to their national parliaments.  Everyone knows that is simply not true.  It is far less true in this House than in the mother of parliaments where the phrase was coined by a prime minister.  It does not even begin to compare with the level of accountability of Danish Ministers to their parliament. That is the other extreme.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of commitment and clarity and a lack of confidence.  I did not think I would ever hear myself accuse Fianna Fáil of lacking confidence.  It is the one commodity they have had in abundance.  Some people would give it another word but politeness and the desire to have a constructive debate do not entice me down that road.  It is a <Col N="1294" /> serious impediment to responding to the many points made by Deputy Bruton.  As Leader of the Fine Gael Party in this House he is a senior member of the European Christian Democratic-European People's Party.  He reflected very clearly not only the ideology and thinking of the broad span of that party but also the awareness of the members of that party in respect of the agenda in Luxembourg two weeks ago.  If we do not get a White Paper in respect of the thinking of the Fianna Fáil Party or the Government on whether they are in favour of a federal Europe or separate pillars, we will not be able to respond positively to the minute detail of some aspects of the treaty that will emerge.  I forecast a very confused referendum debate which will be hijacked by the maniacs in the pro-life movement who will discard every other dimension of closer European union and run a campaign on the basis of a scare. That potential nightmare should be stopped in its tracks by a detailed exposition by the Government of their position in this area.</P>
    <P>This would have been a far better debate if we had had sight of the Taoiseach's speech 24 hours ago.  There is a lot of meat in the statement, some of which is incapable of being digested on the Floor of the House.  The debate on EMU is rather mechanistic once the provisions for social cohesion are included. The stages from one to three are defined within fairly confined parameters and the options, which are of a quasi-technical nature, are limited.  These can be assessed against a criteria of measures to see if they are satisfactory.  They are to a lesser extent value free.</P>
    <P>The area of EMU is very different.  My own party are not without sin in this regard.  The Labour Party in a post-cold war situation must define what neutrality actually is and must define what our commitment to European union is.  Are we prepared to defend the union to which we subscribe if that union is succeeding in moving towards a closer and closer post-federal Europe?  We have not yet a constitutional adjective to describe what will finally emerge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> It is clear that the question of defence will have to be met, and we have no problem with that.  We are prepared to defend the Union which the Labour Party, a participant in this Parliament whether in Government or in Opposition, will vote for.  We are prepared to make the necessary provisions for the defence of that Union as Europeans.  We do not want an Atlantic dimension to our defence, and that is part of the problem when we consider those who are in favour of the pillars and those who are in favour of the federal position.  Then within the federal position there are Atlanticists who would like to have NATO just subsumed into a European structure.  All these questions need to be resolved and put much more clearly than they are. They are alluded to in the Taoiseach's contribution but are not made explicit.</P>
    <P>In an evolving intellectual, political debate I offer to this House that my party along with major socialist parties within the EC who do not have an imperial tradition or who do not feel they won the Second World War single-handed, for example the British Labour Party, would be in principle more in favour of a European defence commitment that does not involve in an integral decision-making way the Atlantic dimension of, essentially, the USA.  That issue should be brought out on the Floor of this House, preferably in a foreign affairs committee.  I think I can anticipate what the Minister of State's preference might be in that regard, but other people make these decisions for us.  This kind of extended exchange is unsatisfactory. There is not unanimity in one group; the socialist group in the European Parliament consists of rabid militarists who polish their medals with great alacrity and think militarism is good for the character and all this kind of nonsense.  Others are total pacificists, and I suspect there is a similar spectrum, though not as extensive, in the European People's Party. Therefore, I am not speaking from a position of unique, coherent, centralised unanimity but the socialist leaders' meeting about four weeks ago, which was similar <Col N="1296" /> to the one to which Deputy Bruton referred, raised this very question.  The German Social Democratic Party in particular are very strong on this question of a defence commitment for European Union but in terms of a defence capacity that does not become a euphemism for a new colonial strike force that can suddenly decide Third World countries interfering with European multi-national installations somewhere in the Third World trying to extract a higher rate of exchange, are now attacking essential European interests and, therefore, a multi-national European strike force has the right within Community law to fly in and do an Entebbe type commando raid on it.  Some of our colleagues in the French party are particularly strong on this idea.  People have accused President Delors of being distraught, that he did not have a review of uniformed Community soldiers to look at at the height of the Gulf War, unlike President Mitterrand, Mrs. Thatcher or all the others who were out visiting the troops.  I make that observation somewhat flippantly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite possibly.  There is a very strong militarist tradition within the French culture.  Part of it is very much central to the culture of the French Socialist Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am making these references simply to illustrate that Fianna Fáil's articulation of their own view in this area should not be impeded by a belief that the other parties on the European stage have a coherent, single resolved position.  We do not.  It is an evolving position.  To come back to the Irish national interest, we will not approach this debate, effectively to the best of our capacity if the major party in Government are refusing to articulate their own options or preferences in any manner, shape or form.  I tried to read the Minister's speech a second time while listening to Deputy Bruton and going through it, in some key areas it is not 100 per cent clear at this stage what preferred option the Government hold.  There is an <Col N="1297" /> idea that the Irish Government, on behalf of the Irish people, at some Council meetings which are not open to the press &mdash; though for all the leaking that goes on afterwards they might as well be and people might behave a little better in more ways than one &mdash; are being led rather than participating, that we are silent, poor relations afraid to open our mouths.  That is not in the national interest.  I want to say formally to the two Fianna Fáil Deputies here in the House for whom I have professional respect that the Fianna Fáil Party's present inability to establish a developed position on Europe, an inability which comes out of their traditions, which draws on the strength of that party over the years, is an impediment not only to the development of their own party, which is a matter for themselves, but is not helping the Irish national interest because of their position in Government.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to cohesion and peripherality and Deputy Bruton's reference to taking an initiative with peripheral states.  I believe the peripheral states we should be talking to at this stage are those that are about to join, not the mendicants from the Mediterranean, because that creates the wrong impression altogether. We are not getting into some kind of begging queue or béal bocht queue with the outstretched lámh looking for extra money or extra funding.  In many respects we are fundamentally different from the Greeks in relation to development, and from the Portuguese.  Spain is quite a complex and diverse country from the point of view of regional development and economy.  Deputy Bruton referred to the internal barriers to cohesion that are erected within the developed &ldquo;golden triangle&rdquo; of the EC, barriers to trade and competition set up by national distortions and national instruments of industrial policy which effectively discriminate against other European competitors entering into those markets.  The Irish Republic is capable of trading its way to prosperity.  Our citizens are capable of earning the kind of average median European wealth other countries have.  I do not believe we need a permanent social <Col N="1298" /> welfare handout from somebody in Brussels. We need the same person in Brussels to eliminate the barriers that prevent the Smurfits and the others from competing in the centre of Europe for a share of the market which we are capable of getting if those barriers are removed.  I think the people who can help us in peripheral terms to make that kind of assault are the people who are going to confront the same barriers once they get in, the Austrians and the Swedes.  If we were to set up some kind of peripheral alliance of an <i>ad hoc</i> nature or peripheral discussions of an <i>ad hoc</i> nature it is with those countries we should now be talking and saying to them openly and frankly that we have been within the EC for 20 odd years, that we are a small, cohesive, &ldquo;Murphya&rdquo;, as somebody once described us in terms of our knowledge of the institutions of the EC, and that we will help in so far as they think we can help them to negotiate their operation of the European institutions for the transitional period in return for tactical alliances on areas where there are obstacles to trade from places like the Benelux countries, to a certain extent parts of Italy and certainly parts of France.  The CII and the Irish Business Bureau in Brussels have identified these fairly clearly for the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>Of course, capital transfers for infrastructural development in areas of communication and roads and some tourism development are important but they are not essential, and so long as this Government keep giving out the attitude that we are going to get more money from the Structural Funds and more grants from Brussels in the enlarged Structural Funds, then in my view we are missing the main target.  Since 1922 this State has been pouring money into the west of Ireland.  Harbours, now abandoned, along the west coast give testimony to that.  But there are marvellous tourism infrastructural facilities for both Irish people and foreign visitors who come to our shores.  Efforts were made by people on the east coast to make structural transfers to the west coast to facilitate viable economic jobs but they did not work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> Deputy Lenihan &mdash; who knows the west of Ireland well &mdash; knows that to get to his holiday home in Ballyconneely, he has to drive past about five different failed investment projects which existed since the mid-fifties.  There was no difference between the money which came from Brussels and that which came from Dublin for those ventures.</P>
    <P>There is a culture here that if only we get another raft of money from somewhere &mdash; originally it was Dublin, now it is Brussels and in some places it was the American fund &mdash; we will get a project right in these areas.  I want to see workers in Finglas, Ringsend, Laois-Offaly and Kilkenny being able to compete freely and fairly with the products they are currently producing into the centre of Europe and that is not about increasing structural grant funds.  That whole area of cohesion, and what the Irish Government are doing about it, is not adequately referred to in the Taoiseach's speech. That should be identified in a White Paper setting out the Government's objectives.  These are obstacles we have identified and these are things that make cohesion work with the legal provisions, to which he makes reference in his speech.  They should be included in the Treaty.  That Treaty should apply to regional authorities, for example, in Belgium, to the French regional departments and parts of northern Italy that are currently operating policies of industrial protectionism which are totally contrary to the spirit of the Treaty of Rome and to the spirit, if not the law, of the completion of the internal market.</P>
    <P>Peripherality and cohesion are interconnected. If we seek, as the Taoiseach did at the outset of his speech when he talked about the enlargement of the Community, to devise a strategy for this country in terms of European political union that only considers itself with the Twelve it is in my view, and in the view of the Labour Party, a complete mistake. We should now assess who is going to be around the table in four or five years time.  The Austrians can join in the morning; they are not seeking derogation in <Col N="1300" /> relation to anything and they have said that.  I heard Franz Vranitzky, the Chancellor of the Austrian Republic, repeat that position.  Likewise, the Swedes are not only prepared to join with little or no requirements for a transitional period but they are also prepared to make a direct contribution to some kind of cohesion fund beyond the obligations they would have normally.</P>
    <P>If Sweden and Austria join &mdash; and both are now formal applicants for membership of the European Community&mdash; it would only be a matter of time until both Norway and Finland join.  Nobody in Europe has a more peripheral problem, in terms of location, than the Finns. Having more than half of the country permanently inside the Artic Circle is about as peripheral as one can get in anybody's method of measurement. They are not a poor country but they will have problems of discrimination.  Therefore, the Irish Government should say in a White Paper &mdash; in preparation for the referendum which I calculate must take place not later than the autumn of 1992, if the anticipated time table is to be adhered to &mdash; we expect Europe in ten years' time to consist of at least 16 member states, including Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway and three more applicant states, close to, if not already within some kind of European union.  I am referring to the three central European countries: Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.  We cannot anticipate what will happen in Yugoslavia.  If Slovenia establishes its independence from the rest of Yugoslavia, whatever about Croatia, Slovenia would be a qualifying applicant member.  We should recognise those countries as potential allies with whom we should establish links.  Instead we do not seem to have addressed that problem or, if so, it has not been fully referred to in the Taoiseach's speech.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn briefly to the question of economic and monetary union and the European Parliament.  I will be brief on the question of economic and monetary union.  As I said earlier the relative technicalities associated with it should be the <Col N="1301" /> subject of a separate debate and should be laid out in this Parliament in a more comprehensive way.  The options are more limited and the implications are more difficult to analyse but I share the view expressed by the Taoiseach in his contribution where he challenged the validity of the economic assertion of the commentators within the Commission that the completion of the integrated market would have automatically beneficial economic effects on all regions of the European Community.  There is little substance to sustain that conclusion. Indeed, the Cecchini report, despite all the efforts to so do, did not satisfy many commentators, certainly many political commentators, about the validity of that assumption.  Therefore, the need for economic cohesion within the Community will have to be looked at very carefully in terms of economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>Finally, I turn to the European Parliament and, in a sense, this is where I started my contribution.  The Government are frightened of giving powers to the European Parliament because they feel &ldquo;an orphan&rdquo; in that body.  Notwithstanding the ability and the contribution of members of the Fianna Fáil Party who have been in the European Parliament they are effectively reduced to the level of independent by-standers not dissimilar to the role that Independents have in our own Parliament. Deputy De Rossa may, perhaps, wish to expand on this as he is a member of the European Parliament.  The isolation of the Fianna Fáil Party in the European Parliament, and the cultural, political and intellectual impact that has had on the thinking of the Fianna Fáil Party over the last ten to 15 years, certainly since direct elections in 1979, has given the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition and in Government a totally different perspective of the role of the Parliament and the potential beneficial impact parliamentary decisions could have on Ireland and Ireland's sovereignty.  The Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party are members, with our relatively small numbers, of the two largest groups.  The <Col N="1302" /> Progressive Democrats through MEP Pat Cox, have a role of some significance in the Liberal Group in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The idea that influence in the European Parliament is proportionate to nationality is flatly contradicted by the impact and the effect our members have in the EPP group, the Christian Democrats Group, and Barry Desmond's contribution within the Socialist group, ably assisted by John Hume on the occasions when he is in the European Parliament and through his position as a Vice-President of the Socialist group.  I make that observation because our party, and I suspect the same holds true for the Fine Gael Party from what Deputy Bruton said, are not frightened by the idea of the European Parliament getting extra powers.  We are very frightened by allowing some kind of inter-governmental power to rest exclusively with the European Council because we do not think it is democratically accountable.  We believe that the democratic deficit exists in that forum and it is compounded by the lack of suitable scrutiny in this House.</P>
    <P>The position as set out in the Taoiseach's contribution, where he agrees that the Parliament should have the right to confirm the appointment of the Commission as a body, is about as radical a democratic or republican assertion as would do credit to the first Minister of Queen Elizabeth I.  It gives the Parliament or the assembly little or no discretionary powers.  My view is that the European Parliament should elect the President of the Commission.  The Council should nominate the President who should be elected by the Parliament and not merely confirm the appointment.  As a body there should be some mechanism not dissimilar to the US Senate of advising and consenting to the appointment of various members of the US Cabinet. The US Cabinet is far less powerful in many respects than the European Commission.  Likewise, in relation to the process of making law, the European Parliament should be given far greater powers because in certain areas the process of, currently 12, soon to be 14 and <Col N="1303" /> probably 16, national parliaments making laws and that law mechanism going through the Council of Minister in the way it does is simply too tortuous to meet the needs of a modern, progressive European society of which Ireland is an integral part.  The Government's position in that area is deficient.</P>
    <P>Having, made those points of criticism, I compliment the Taoiseach and his Department's personnel for providing one of the most comprehensive and detailed statements to the House regarding the present situation.  I hope that they will have an opportunity on other occasions to respond to the many points raised.  As parliamentarians, we express a certain lack of satisfaction with this mechanism of debate, nevertheless it is a vast improvement in terms of content than we have had in the past.  I hope my praise will encourage the Government to issue an interim paper for discussion &mdash; if not a White Paper, a Green Paper &mdash; setting out the agenda for Ireland and allow a debate to evolve within society to which we can respond.  The Government may well have to make difficult compromises but the body politic, inside and outside the House, will understand the framework within which it will have to operate. They will already have analysed some of the options in a reasoned and informed manner and will be able to form a view whether a reasonable compromise has been arrived at.  I hope that we do not get ourselves into the kind of situation which we did in the past in relation to the Single European Act.</P>

      <P>The latest European Community Summit has been widely described as a &ldquo;stocktaking exercise&rdquo; and a &ldquo;staging post&rdquo; prior to major and, in many cases, final decisions on the future path of European Union.  While such a meeting does not tend to produce banner headline news, &ldquo;stocktaking&rdquo; is in many ways the most telling assessment of the real worth and achievement of any company, business or Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of European economic, <Col N="1304" /> monetary and political union, it is indeed now time to assess the Irish Government's efforts, if any, to secure adequate agreements with the EC to ensure development of our economy, further democratisation of EC structures and to promote development of a positive and non-militaristic foreign policy in the Community.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as perhaps the most peripheral member state of the Community has the most to gain &mdash; or lose &mdash; from the manner of implementation of the Single Market and the putting in place of policies geared to bring Ireland's living standards closer to the Community average.</P>
    <P>The Government have in recent months quite rightly emphasised that the policy of cohesion should be incorporated in moves towards the implementation of economic and monetary union.  The alternative will be an accelerated drift of finance and investment to the economic centre of the Community, but the Government seem to have failed to get guarantees on this question.</P>
    <P>With the final decisions on EMU to be made at the next IGC in Maastricht, we still do not even have a commitment about the scale of additional resources which will be provided from Community resources for economic development of peripheral regions such as Ireland.</P>
    <P>EC Commissioner, Jacques Delors, has recently proposed that Structural Funding should be increased by about 50 per cent.  Mr. Delors's proposals have a habit of becoming the accepted position, and if this proposal is implemented, it would involve an increase in Structural Funding from the £3 billion operating between 1989 to 1994 to around £4.5 billion, for presumably the remaining years of the decade.</P>
    <P>Even if this figure be adjusted for inflation this would be a grossly inadequate increase, but I have yet to see a specific target figure which the Irish Government see as adequate to meet Ireland's requirements, or how such funds would be used.</P>
    <P>In a recent editorial on this specific matter, <i>The Irish Times</i> stated &ldquo;much more than the doubling of structural <Col N="1305" /> funds which accompanied the Single European Act will be required to compensate poorer parts of the Community for the centralising effects of Economic and Monetary Union&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned that the Taoiseach should be quoted in the media as being &ldquo;very pleased&rdquo; with the outcome of the Summit in the area of EMU.  He has chosen to interpret some well-meaning phrases in the Summit document as if they were cast-iron commitments.</P>
    <P>Statements such as economic and social cohesion being an &ldquo;integral part in the development of the union&rdquo; and that they should be included in a new Treaty in an &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; manner are effectively meaningless when it comes to the question of cash on the table and full development of Ireland as a region of the Community.  The removal of regional and social disparities has been set out as a key objective of the Community since the adoption of the Treaty of Rome, and has failed to be achieved.  I have no reason to believe that the most recent platitudes in the Summit conclusions are any more than that.</P>
    <P>There is little evidence that the current Structural Funds are adequate to the needs of the Irish economy and society or that they are being spent in a manner which allows for the development of jobs and living standards here.  Any new funding must be subject to strenuous regular review, to ensure that it is having the planned effect.</P>
    <P>It is adequate to simply allocate funding, large or small, for a five year period and then effectively forget about the issue until the next allocation.  If significant discernible improvement is not being achieved in the Irish economy, then the EC must be required to adjust its policies and, if necessary, provide compensatory assistance, financial or otherwise, to ensure that Ireland does not become an economic backwater of the Community, rearing and educating our children to service tourists or simply to emigrate.</P>
    <P>What is particularly worrying is the Government's low key approach to this entire matter.  This is not some academic discussion of a hypothetical development <Col N="1306" /> at the end of the decade.  The Single Market is already upon us.  However, I note that the Taoiseach finally admits to having some doubts because he pointed out that our approach is also conditioned by scepticism about the correctness of some of the more sanguine conclusions about the effects of EMU on regional disparities which the Commission drew from its analysis.  We have been making similar points to the Taoiseach for some considerable time and it is only now that he seems to be waking up to that reality.</P>
    <P>The evidence is there that the general living standards in Ireland have failed to approach the EC average in the years since joining the Community.  There is every indication that there will be an increased drift to the economic centre after EMU.  Yet the Government seem reluctant to adopt the hard bargaining approach which is essential if we are to be taken seriously and win the type of Euro-policies which are vitally necessary to underdeveloped regions such as Ireland.</P>
    <P>Again the comments of Commission President, Jacques Delors, offer an insight into the likely development of policies in the area of cohesion.  In addressing Heads of State prior to the Summit he proposed to downgrade any commitment to cohesion by simply referring to the preamble of the new Treaty, and to defer discussion and decision on funding levels and arrangements until 1992.</P>
    <P>All this carries the clear message that achievement of monetary &mdash; and political &mdash; union is the real, maybe the only goal, and achievement of economic and social cohesion, if it comes about will be accidental rather than an essential and obligatory part of that process.</P>
    <P>The British Government, under Mr. John Major, continue to pursue an insistent approach in their questioning of federalism in the Community.  The French Government's pressure for a new EC military and defence policy was highlighted by the provocative meeting of the Western European Union in Luxembourg on the eve of the Summit.  These are examples of how pressure can be put <Col N="1307" /> on the EC to react to specific demands and to shift its policy.</P>
    <P>On the issues of peripherality, regional development, cohesion and defence, the Government are remarkably quiet.  The EC Council is agreeing positions and policies which allow the Community to dodge on cohesion.  The EC budget stands at just over 1 per cent of Gross Community Product and the Structural Funds are only a quarter of that 1 per cent.  We should be in no way apologetic about insisting on our demand for a realistic redistribution of wealth within the Community as part of the cost of creating a Single Market and political union.</P>
    <P>This whole matter, of course, relates directly to the question of employment generation.  Ireland's unemployment rate now stands at 19.4 per cent.  Our emigration level, officially 136,000 between 1986 and 1990, has helped to disguise an even greater jobs crisis.  In the conditions of the EC Single Market, Irish job creation policy cannot stand in isolation from European policy.  The theory of the Common Market-EC is that we share our sovereignty and gain a say in European policy formation.  But unless those policies lead to improved living standards for all Irish people then the EC is a sham. And unless the Government fight our corner in shaping these policies then the Government are a sham.</P>
    <P>With the increasing economic integration of the member states of the Community it is unrealistic for any one member state, particularly a small state such as Ireland, to expect to solve economic and social problems or problems of unemployment and poverty through policies which depend solely on national conditions and decisions.  It is for this reason that I have argued for some time now for the creation of a common industrial policy in the Community, which would be interventionist rather than depending on market forces to do what market forces clearly have no interest in doing, creating jobs.</P>
    <P>Despite the establishment of the Regional Development Fund in 1975 the reality is that, after a small initial <Col N="1308" /> improvement in the 1970s, the gap between Ireland and the Community average is as wide now as when we joined the EEC.</P>
    <P>To achieve cohesion, it is reported that the Irish economy would need to grow by almost 2 per cent a year above the Community average, and it would need to keep up this performance for the next 20 years.  This did not happen in the past two decades of membership and it will not happen in the next 20 years either if we continue to pursue the policy of seeking and distributing a few ECUs here and there on bigger roads or tourist attractions. On this basis, even if the economic tide rises in the Ruhr, the best we can expect is that it will simply lift the number of emigrants leaving Ireland.</P>
    <P>What is required is an interventionist common industrial policy which has the objective of bringing jobs to people in the regions rather than bringing people from the regions to jobs on the Rhine or other already overdeveloped parts of the Community.  In effect, we need a policy geared to &ldquo;leapfrogging&rdquo; the peripheral regions over some of the phases of development to provide technology and export-orientated industry, research and innovation.</P>
    <P>The time to set about this task is right now.  The approach of Economic and Monetary Union is justification in itself. But there is an added reason.  The Common Agricultural Policy as we have known it is on its last legs.  It is a policy which has seen unbelievable millions of pounds squandered with virtually no sustainable development of our agriculture or agri-business sector, the virtual extinction of the family farm and the neglect of the rural environment.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that an Irish Agriculture Commissioner, and one from the Fianna Fáil stable at that, has finally begun to grasp the CAP nettle.  Instead of the Government and IFA fighting a rearguard action here to defer or delay reform of CAP, we should be to the forefront in seeking its replacement by an effective instrument which, while geared to maintaining the fabric of rural society, would <Col N="1309" /> set about the creation of jobs in agri-business and industry, with an emphasis on pollution-free and &ldquo;clean&rdquo; development.</P>
    <P>The European Commission is clearly well on the way to a major reform and reduction in CAP spending; we must fight to ensure that any such savings are spent on ensuring development of Ireland and other peripheral regions.</P>
    <P>There should, of course, continue to be a common agricultural policy.  But it should be integrated with a new common industrial policy which would benefit food processing and efficient farming development as well as provide the basis for employment generation in our towns and cities.  The Minister for Finance appears to have finally conceded this point.  If I could quote from a speech to the Association of Irish Chartered Accountants in Great Britain on 1 July last, he said:</P>
    <P>The greatest disappointment (of EC membership) has been our inability to generate new job opportunities fast enough to absorb the consistent growth in the labour force.</P>
    <P>The consequence has been persistent high unemployment and emigration ... It is relevant to ask whether the Community should give a higher priority to employment and what new approaches it might adopt in pursuit of this.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The Community's philosophy has always been to get the economy right and the jobs will follow but this approach must be questioned in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>I could hardly put the argument for an interventionist common industrial policy or jobs policy better myself.  However, in reply to a Dáil Question from The Workers' Party on 5 June, the Taoiseach stated that there was &ldquo;no detailed discussion&rdquo; on development of a common industrial policy at the IGC on 22 May last.  When I pressed him on his support for incorporating a reference to industrial policy in any proposed new treaty or in <Col N="1310" /> amendments to the existing treaty, he stated first that he felt there would not be &ldquo;widespread agreement to incorporating anything of that nature&rdquo; and subsequently that the Government continues to rely on &ldquo;economic and social cohesion as the principle on which the European Community must develop.&rdquo;  But the reality is that policy instruments of cohesion &mdash; the social fund, regional fund, CAP and such like &mdash; do not deal specifically with the development of industry.</P>
    <P>Where do the Government really stand, therefore, on this vital issue?  The Minister for Finance and his departmental advisers clearly see the writing on the wall.  But the Taoiseach, from the time of the Irish Presidency right up to last week's summit, seems content to carry on a rearguard action of defending CAP, indeed doffing his cap on virtually every other issue, leaving us indefinitely in a cap in hand position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the stronger EC member states.</P>
    <P>I move now to the social side of the cohesion argument.  This seems to be the truly abandoned side of the move towards 1992.  The Social Charter was adopted a full 18 months ago by Ireland and the other member states with the exception of Margaret Thatcher's Britain, but it is indeed a struggle to see where it is being implemented with any commitment in this country.  To my knowledge, only one aspect of the charter, the requirement making it compulsory for employers to give detailed working contracts to staff, has received the necessary unanimous approval from all 12 member states. Other vital issues, for example, relating to working conditions for pregnant women and negotiation and bargaining structures for employers and employees, have been shelved, deferred and in many cases bluntly blocked by member states. Reading the conclusions of the summit, I can see no evidence that this serious situation received any worthwhile attention from the Heads of State.</P>
    <P>Mr. Jacques Delors, addressing Heads of State at the Luxembourg Summit, is reported as saying, because apparently he was speaking in private, that the 1992 <Col N="1311" /> process was progressing at full steam with the exception of the Social Charter. Indeed, one news media report quotes him as saying that the charter had &ldquo;broken down&rdquo;.  The charter is weak enough as it stands.  It is essentially a charter for workers' rights rather than one for all its citizens and it ignores the problems facing young people, women, the unemployed, disabled, and minorities. It is in far too many cases aspirational rather than binding, and the programme of implementation of its existing provisions is woefully inadequate.</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude to the Social Charter is quite despicable.  The new provisions allowing free movement of labour will lead to even greater exploitation of the growing army of part time casual and temporary workers in the Community, and there appears to be an unwritten agreement that the Social Charter will gather increasing dust as a result of the stampede to allow market forces an unfettered role in the brave new Single Market.</P>
    <P>This will have dire consequences in this country for the one million people who live in poverty, the 250,000 unemployed and the 100,000-strong army of part-time workers.  And it will have the same consequences for the millions of people in the same categories throughout the European Community.</P>
    <P>On the issue of future EC foreign policy and defence and security, the Government have clearly abandoned any attempts to influence developments.  This is evident in a number of areas.  There are no Irish proposals to the IGC on what role the concept of Irish neutrality will have in future EC security policy, what priorities any such foreign policy will have, apart from a generalised statement of &ldquo;defence of EC interests&rdquo;, how factors such as NATO membership by the other member states will influence development of foreign policy and no opposition to a role for the Western European Union, despite the fact that the Western European Union is specifically committed to a nuclear deterrent.  These <Col N="1312" /> questions apparently hold no particular or urgent interest for the Government. We are simply told that there will be no decisions on defence for the foreseeable future and, therefore, they have nothing to say.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Never tackle today what you can put off until tomorrow&rdquo; is clearly the Government's policy.  The trouble is that so many issues are being put on the Government's long finger that it will be too late for Ireland to exert any influence on the eventual direction and decisions with regard to EC foreign policy by the time decisions are made, because informal arrangements will already be in place by then.</P>
    <P>References yet again in the Summit document to Irish neutrality in the context of the &ldquo;traditional position&rdquo; of some member states probably means that other states have not quite figured out how they wish to deal with the neutrality issues. But if one reads the report on the meeting of the Western European Union held, arrogantly, in Luxembourg on the eve of the EC Summit, there is no doubt on where they see their own future military role and that of the EC.</P>
    <P>The communique of the Western European Union Council of Ministers meeting says that a European security and defence identity is emerging within the Twelve and the Western European Union.  It adds that Western European Union should &ldquo;be fully part of the process of European integration&rdquo; and further on says that &ldquo;the Western European Union should be developed in this phase of the European process as its defence component.&rdquo; Whatever the Taoiseach may say about decisions not being made by the European Council or, indeed, the European Community, decisions are being made elsewhere which are shaping the defence of the European Community.</P>
    <P>Third they assert that &ldquo;development of a genuine European security policy and defence identity will be reflected in the strengthening of the European pillar within the Atlantic Alliance.&rdquo;  Nothing could be clearer.</P>
    <P>I do not think they could have been <Col N="1313" /> any more specific.  The intention is that the EC will develop a security policy geared to maintaining and taking forward the principles which have operated in NATO for the past 40 years, principles which assert domination and aggression, maintenance of vast nuclear arsenals and the threat to use them.  Those principles led to the launching of the needless war in the Gulf, with still untold levels of destruction and civilian casualties and massive destruction of the environment in the region while doing nothing to solve the overall problems of the region.</P>
    <P>So far, the most significant result of the war for the victors will probably be the huge deals to resupply states in the region with new and replacement weaponry and the huge contracts for reconstruction of infrastructure destroyed in the war.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government are, I believe deliberately, refusing to state a position or take an active part on where European security policy should lead.  When the EC recently discussed suspension of all arms sales to Yugoslavia, the Irish Government had no visible involvement.  At the outbreak of strife in Yugoslavia a fortnight ago, an offical Slovenian representative, interviewed on RTE radio, talked of Ireland's position as a neutral country and how he felt this could be of particular importance in helping in the mediation process there.  It is something the Irish Government clearly do not appreciate.</P>
    <P>Ireland had run away from that challenge also.  Indeed, the Government and Taoiseach are running away from any utterance or initiative which might draw attention to our neutrality.  It is indeed a sad decline in the political morality of Fianna Fáil, from the days when Frank Aiken pressed the United Nations to confront the issue of Chinese membership of that organisation, to the current policies of allowing war planes on their way to a &ldquo;turkey shoot&rdquo; in the Gulf free access to Irish refueling facilities and air space, and the self-censorship by this Government of any issues which would promote an anti-militarist policy within the EC.</P>
    <P>I want to make it crystal clear that I am not against development of a positive <Col N="1314" /> EC foreign and security policy.  What I am advocating is that Ireland should right now take the initiatives necessary to ensure that future policies in this area advance the principles of a positive neutrality, and that they bring these proposals right to the heart of the EC.  The policies of militarism must be challenged and rejected, not just among neutral states, but in those countries currently in NATO and the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>The Community is due for enlargement. A longstanding application from Austria continues to gather dust.  Sweden also wishes to become a member.  Can the Taoiseach state what, if any, approaches or discussions have been held with the Governments in these countries on future security trends and on what role neutral states can have in shaping these developments?</P>
    <P>Ireland must play an active role in international affairs not one of isolation or passive alignment with the most powerful alliances.  Our neutrality must be given a truly positive character to enable us to play a meaningful role in international fora such as the UN, CSCE, and increasingly the European Community through EPC.</P>
    <P>We must insist that the balance of power in such fora is weighted in favour of the dispossessed of the world, to replace the now redundant &ldquo;cold war&rdquo; balance of interests.  This will require radical changes in how the UN Security Council reaches its decisions, and monitors actions carried out in its name.  It means that the General Assembly of the United Nations must have a more clearly defined and effective role in Security Council decisions, and also expansion of Security Council membership.  The CSCE should also be developed as a panEuropean forum for collective security under the UN.  These things are not brought to bear in any way.  We simply seem to sit in a corner and pretend these matters are not of importance or are not being discussed.</P>
    <P>Similarly, while paying lip-service to the CSCE the Government continue to ignore the role which the Conference on <Col N="1315" /> Security and Co-operation in Europe can play in building confidence among European states in a non-militaristic way.  At the recent meeting of the CSCE in Prague, Czechoslovakian President, Vaclav Havel, suggested a &ldquo;universal embargo&rdquo; on arms exports to the whole of Yugoslavia.  He also warned that &ldquo;nobody expects that all the accumulated problems can be resolved in Yugoslavia without a complex and probably lengthy process taking place.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a formula which could be applied, and, unfortunately, may have to be applied in future to other states and regions, in central and eastern Europe and in other parts of the world.  Why is Ireland failing to promote such policies within the EC?</P>
    <P>Indeed there should be a similar effort to promote the ideals of positive neutrality at United Nations level.  The Cold War is over, but it is not a case of &ldquo;over and out&rdquo;.  The forces which lived off the Cold War &mdash; the military strategists, the military-industrial complex and the economic strategists who see domination by the &ldquo;north&rdquo; of the &ldquo;south&rdquo; best being maintained in the shadow of the gun&mdash; all these forces are busily searching for new enemies so that a revamped strategy can be used to justify and maintain the horrific expenditure on arms production. Ireland sits on its hands, pretending it is waiting for real debate to start in five years time.  Ireland effectively has been neutralised on this issue by its refusal to develop a new definition of neutrality to omit the new volume of forces in the world.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that the Cold War romantics are not only to be found in the west.  There are increasingly clear indications that elements in the Soviet Union would welcome a return to the old certainties of the Cold War.  There is an obligation on us in Ireland, and people everywhere, therefore, to clearly differentiate between those who want peace and work for it and those who want to continue to enslave the human race under the threat of war and nuclear annihilation which is what we would be doing if we <Col N="1316" /> went along with the current proposals to incorporate the Western European Union within the defence structure of the European Community or to link that with NATO in its present form.  The people of this country should be aware that parties in this House who propose that role are proposing precisely that we go down the road of developing a European Community nuclear capacity.  The Minister can shake his head all he likes but that is what is on the cards.  That is what NATO and the Western European Union are all about.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  That is what I am saying, that we should be in there fighting our corner and not standing back and pretending that it is not going on.  Seen in this light, the Government U-turn on plans for a foreign affairs committee is disgraceful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where do the Progressive Democrats stand on this issue of democratic accountability? The United States Congress has such a committee, the British Parliament and indeed every other European Community state has such a committee.  What are the Government afraid of?  They are apparently unable to stand over their own positions on international issues.  They are unable to stand over why no clear position has been outlined to the Inter-governmental Conference on foreign policy issues or on why they have abdicated on the issue of promoting positive neutrality at EC level or on how they intend to counter the increasing, and what may shortly become an inevitable, <Col N="1317" /> drift towards an EC foreign policy which is at odds with even our so-called traditional neutrality, never mind being at odds with what might be developed as a more positive and modern approach to neutrality.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may say and has said that the issue is not for immediate decision that the matter will not come up for decision until the mid or late 1990s.  I would remind the Taoiseach of the clear consequences among the Western European Union states evident in the quotes I have cited earlier from their meeting on the eve of the summit.  What will our position be if the issues of security, defence, and cohesion become linked? What if problems such as those now threatening to tear Yugoslavia apart force the pace of discussion on security and defence?</P>
    <P>What of the Oireachtas Committee on Secondary Legislation?  When will they be given a brief and adequate resources to examine and tackle the question of cohesion policy in the context of EMU. We are talking about a range of issues affecting the vital interests of this State, which are not being effectively discussed in this Parliament.  A series of statements as we are having here today, is probably the most meaningless way of dealing with them.  What has happened to the promise that the Minister, Deputy Collins, made to me some months ago in this House that he would organise weekly debates on foreign affairs?  We have not heard of it since.  The Minister even promised that the Dáil would sit every Friday if necessary for weekly debates.</P>
    <P>While the Government would indeed have to face awkward questions in such properly constituted committees, the benefits which would accrue from their establishment would far outweigh any embarrassement factor for Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats, over their ineffectiveness at the European negotiating table.  Promotion of a more thorough public debate on the alternative strategies which might be applied, on the economy, on the reform of CAP, on the development of a common industrial <Col N="1318" /> policy, on a pro-active approach to positive neutrality, to disarmament, the Middle East, ODA, and other issues, would if anything strengthen the Government's hand in any future negotiations with our EC partner states.</P>
    <P>We cannot talk of moves to a Single Europe without ensuring that greater democracy is brought to European institutions. At present most decisions are made behind closed doors by the virtually unaccountable Council of Ministers. Despite the argument made that because the Ministers on the Council are elected to the various parliaments they are therefore accountable, the fact is that the proposals they bring to Council meetings are never debated in this House before they are brought forward and agreed, or the decisions that the Government propose to agree to are never brought forward in this House to be agreed to or to be even debated.  We end up simply responding to statements made by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs about positions that have already been agreed. That is not democracy.</P>
    <P>There is a virtually unaccountable Council of Ministers and Commission, while the democratically elected parliament in Europe is severely restricted in its powers.  This position must be remedied. There is no willingness on the part of Irish Governments to support greater powers for the European Parliament such as moves towards co-decision with the Commission or Council or a greater say in the appointment of the Commission, other than the blanket approval or disapproval of the Commission as a whole. But the situation becomes even more contradictory.  While the Government said they support the role of the Commission as the best common denominator for the 12 member states, they still are unwilling to allow the Commission to take on additional real responsibilities. For instance, the issue of foreign policy is being retained under the control of national governments, meeting in council with decisions being decided on at summit level.  In this regard the Government are pursuing a policy close to that of the Thatcher era in Britain.  Although <Col N="1319" /> in theory having a democratic mandate, the Council is probably the least democratic of the EC's institutions.</P>
    <P>We should instead pursue a policy of opening up the Community to its citizens. This should be done firstly by steadily increasing the powers of the European Parliament.  These powers should be adequate to allow it effectively oversee the executive institutions and should share legislative responsibility with the bodies representing member states, with a structured accountability for reporting back by member states to their own respective parliaments.</P>
    <P>Secondly there is need for a closer and structured relationship between the national and European parliaments which would include frequent consultative meetings between representatives of the parliaments of the 12 member states and the EP, which would also incorporate report-back procedures. A regular forum such as that held in the Conference of European Parliaments in Rome last year, and provision for attendance by committee members from national and European Parliaments at each other's meetings on a reciprocal basis would lead to at least a greater understanding about what is going on at European and national level.</P>
    <P>However, it must not stop there.  There must also be a policy of developing powers to regional and local level.  Decision making should be exercised at a European level only where it can be done more effectively at this level.  There must be an active policy of involving environmental, community and other non-governmental organisations at all levels in decisions.  It is particularly important that representatives other than politicians and bureaucrats should have the opportunity to contribute to and to scrutinise the activities and policies of the Community in their area of interest.</P>
    <P>This Government are still reluctant to involve this House in debating their proposals and policies at EC level and international affairs generally.  That is an anti-democratic stance and must be resisted by this House because we have a right to <Col N="1320" /> be informed and to be involved in the decision-making process.  We must resist because if is only in this way that the many complex issues facing this country will become questions of public debate. At the moment there is virtually no debate and every opinion poll done in recent times indicates that people have not got enough information to make up their minds on the issues that will face them in a referendum in the not too distant future.  We must also resist this approach to EC decision making and Government involvement in EC decision making, because there is no other way in which the crisis in jobs here can be fully brought home to Government and people alike and dealt with.  If there was a sufficient level of debate on these issues they would become matters of public debate and would become matters of concern for Government when they go into their secret meetings at Council level, and they would have a strengthened hand in arguing for policies which would lead to job creation and which would ensure that this country plays a real role as a partner in the development of the European Community.</P>

      <P>This important debate is taking place at a time when the European Council in Brussels have clearly agreed that the final decisions on political union and economic and monetary union will be taken at the Maastricht meeting in December.  This debate affords this House the opportunity of debating certain key issues which will be incorporated in the final decisions made at the Maastricht meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to point out &mdash; this is germane to what Deputy De Rossa said &mdash; that the conclusions reached in Luxembourg, which repeated the conclusions reached in Rome in December, emphasised the need for a distinction to be drawn between security and defence. Therefore, what we are really talking about in terms of our input into these matters between now and the finalisation of the decisions is the question of a common foreign and security policy.  We are not talking about a defence policy. <Col N="1321" /> There is a clear distinction between the two policies.</P>
    <P>We have always been strong supporters of a comprehensive co-operative approach towards security matters.  We emphasised this approach within the League of Nations during the thirties. Indeed, the League of Nations foundered in the mid-thirties because they did not have a co-ordinated security policy to deal with Italy's aggression against Abyssinia. When the United Nations were set up they were given a clear mandate to intervene in such cases, as they did when Kuwait was annexed by Iraq.  Similarly, since the Helsinski agreement of 1975 we have adopted a positive role of neutrality within the frame work of security co-operation in Europe, the CSCE process.  I am glad to be able to say that the CSCE process is now coming into its own and is regarded as the real process for security co-operation in Europe.  This can be seen from what has happened in recent times in Europe.  I would take issue with the remarks made by Deputy De Rossa in this regard.  The barrier between East and West Europe, between NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries, is now disappearing. There is a new emphasis on the CSCE process and what a comprehensive security policy can mean for the 36 nations involved in this CSCE. A comprehensive security arrangement needs to be put in place from the Atlantic to the Urals now that the redundant mechanisms of NATO, the Warsaw Pact and the Western European Union are patently superfluous to the requirements of the new Europe now emerging.</P>
    <P>We need to have a common foreign and security policy in the new Europe now emerging which will embody the elements on which we have always laid emphasis, for example, CSCE matters, peacekeeping operations whether within the United Nations or CSCE, economic and technological co-operation in the armaments field, co-ordination of armaments and export policies, non-proliferation, the control and reduction of armaments on a phased basis with accompanying competence measures within the European framework and the <Col N="1322" /> tightening of security co-operation on the European continent within the framework of the CSCE.  That is the sort of combined common European foreign and security policy which Ireland can adhere to and support.</P>
    <P>We are moving towards the adoption of a common European foreign policy. We saw evidence of this in recent days when the CSCE group of countries mandated the European Community to take action in regard to the conflict in Yugoslavia. The troika from the European Community, sponsored by the CSCE, intervened to try to restore peace in Yugoslavia.  The real problem facing Europe today is the co-ordination of policy in relation to conflicts such as that which arose in Yugoslavia, a federal state, where people are seeking the right to self-determination.  A similar conflict may break out in Czechoslovakia while conflicts have already broken out in the Baltic and southern states in the Soviet Union and other areas of the Balkans. All these conflicts which are taking place on the doorstep of Europe can only be resolved by a vigorous European Community with a common foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>Europe has to resolve these problems via the European Community which represents strength and authority.  With the collapse of the Marxist system in Central and Eastern Europe, the European Community needs to have a common foreign and security policy which is devisive and effective.  As I said there is a need for a common policy in regard to such issues as peacekeeping operations, armaments reduction, etc.  At present Minister's meet at intergovernmental conferences to decide, on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, foreign policy.  This system can be extended by the adoption of a common foreign and security policy.  Added to this there could also be co-operation between member states in regard to home affairs and judicial matters.  These matters were discussed at the recent summit in Luxembourg. Discussions also took place on matters such as access, visa and asylum <Col N="1323" /> arrangements, emigration, drug trafficking, customs and judicial co-operation, action against the terrorist and organised crime, etc.  The introduction of the concept of common citizenship within the European Community is a further example of progress of the kind I have mentioned in the overall context of a common foreign and security policy and judicial co-operation.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made to the importance of economic and social cohesion.  This principle which is written into the Treaty of Rome must be given a far more positive dimension.  While steps have already been taken in this regard at the meetings in Rome and Luxembourg we must ensure that it is included on a permanent basis in the concept of monetary union.</P>
    <P>We do not want to have to rely on Structural Funds being transferred on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  This is good in its own way and the funds should be massively increased but not alone should economic and social cohesion extend to the Structural Funds but also right across the board.  I instance the Common Agricultural Policy under which there is a transfer of resources.  There is also a need for cohesion, given our peripheral location, in the area of transport policy. The type of cohesion that I would envisage is the type of cohesion which already exists in many integrated states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, let me make one final point on the need for cohesion and the need to extend it to all Community policies.  We have got to get away from a position where resources are transferred on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to some mechanism which would allow financial equalisation which is already the position in many integrated states where resources are transferred from one part of the state to another.  For example, this is the position in Italy where resources are transferred from northern Italy to <Col N="1324" /> southern Italy.  Such a mechanism in an integrated Europe would allow automatic financial equalisation with support being given from all Community policies to areas on the periphery who are at a disadvantage.  This applies to other countries within the Community as well as Ireland.  We should adopt such a mechanism which would allow such a transfer of resources on top of a vastly improved allocation of Structural Funds in moving towards economic and social cohesion within the framework of economic and monetary union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In many ways I am sorry that Deputy Lenihan did not have the time to expand on his views on cohesion.  I agree with him.  An indication of the pressures we are working under, in terms of the limitations on this debate &mdash; we cannot even call it a debate &mdash; on European affairs is that Deputy Lenihan did not have time to expand on his sensible views which would probably be shared by a vast majority of the Members of this House.  The three and a half hours allocated for the taking of statements on the European Council held in Luxembourg would be more than adequate if the statements were to refer only to what was, in the internal EC context, a stocktaking exercise.  However given that broader issues are to be dealt with, in particular the Yugoslavian crisis, the future of Europe and foreign affairs matters generally, the amount of time allocated is inadequate.  I agree with the point made by Deputy Bruton which was reechoed by Deputy De Rossa that we are not participating in a debate at all but merely making statements.  I was surprised when Deputy De Rossa reminded the House of the commitment made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to have a debate in the House every week but I am not surprised that we have not had such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the European Council meeting itself, it is very clear that nothing of consequence occurred either in relation to economic and monetary union or to European political union.  The Heads of State did not need to have a <Col N="1325" /> formal meeting to arrive at a common intention to reach an agreement at the Maastricht European Council meeting to be held next December as everybody knows that this was already the intention. It is doubtful if the meeting in Luxembourg contributed anything concrete towards the attainment of that objective. The only internal EC point of news interest discussed by the European Council concerned the setting up of a EURO-POL police force to counter organised crime and drug traffickers who may try to take advantage of the post-1991 single market.  Ireland should strongly support the establishment of such a force which would also have a major role in tackling terrorism.</P>
    <P>As happened at the last European Council meeting an international crisis totally overshadowed the Summit meeting. On the last occasion it was the problem of the Kurds and on this occasion it was the Yugoslavian crisis.  The coincidence of the eruption of the crisis and of the European Council meeting raises some very interesting questions.  What, for instance, would have been the reaction of the European Community if EC leaders were not due to meet that weekend? This gives rise to further questions as to whether the European Community does have proper procedures to anticipate trouble in international affairs.  In my view it does not.  The consequence is that very often the EC response is unsure and in this instance the initial EC response seemed to parrot the line taken by the US Secretary of State, Mr. James Baker.  The consequence of the insistence on supporting and recognising only the federated state of Yugoslavia has been seen by many as being the basis for many of the actions of the federal army to which people have objected and for their attitude of refusing to recognise political control. It is my view there was a disastrous ham-fisted approach initially on the part of the European Community which directly contributed to the consequences as outlined, in particular the actions of the federal army.  Such a response had all the hallmarks of being hasty and <i>ad hoc.</i> One of the more serious questions which <Col N="1326" /> must be addressed in the future is whether this had to be so.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of what we have in the European Community at present.  We have an industrial giant but a political pigmy.  There is a need for a far more detailed analysis of many of the problems in international affairs with a careful examination of the different options at European Community level in advance of the development of crises. One possible way of doing this would be to establish a European institute on foreign affairs which would be supported by all members states.  Another possibility would be to establish a secretariat within the European Commission for this purpose but I accept that this may have repercussions in maintaining the delicate balance of powers as between the Commission and the Council.  One way or the other some such institute or secretariat needs to be established at European level so that a detailed examination and consideration of different options can take place and common action agreed prior to the eruption of crises.  Such a common foreign policy approach might help to prevent the eruption of such crises.</P>
    <P>I urge that Ireland press for such an approach.  I accept that we would not have much credibility at present in making such a proposal.  It is very clear that the attitude of the Government on foreign affairs generally and particularly on the European Community is very insular, parochial and patriarchial.  The result is that we have no debate, discussion or exchange of views of any consequence on European or international affairs.  Let me make it clear that I do not see the occasional setpiece statements following meetings of the European Council as being any substitute for a real debate.  I would remind the Government that the debate on the European Council in the House of Commons took place before the meeting and not after it.  I would also remind the Government that we are not participating in a debate at all today, as Deputy De Rossa mentioned, but merely making statements and that there is no motion to debate.  This is a further indication of the irrelevance of the Dáil as <Col N="1327" /> highlighted last week in relation to the refusal of the Government to allow debate on individual Estimates.</P>
    <P>Essentially, these 19th century attitudes and procedures will have to be changed.  This highlights again the need for a foreign affairs committee.  When I was Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs in the early eighties I proposed and succeeded in having a committee on development co-operation established.  At least elected Members were able to have a detailed debate on overseas aid.  This contributed to all party support for my efforts to increase the aid allocation from 0.18 per cent to 0.26 per cent of GNP.  This progress has been disastrously set back since 1987.  Is it a coincidence that we have had no Dáil foreign affairs committee in the meantime? At that time my colleague, Deputy John Bruton, who was then Minister for Finance and now Leader of Fine Gael, seriously proposed the establishment of a committee on foreign affairs in place of the committee on development co-operation. It is my view that we need such a committee on foreign affairs who will also cover overseas aid.  By way of an aside.  I should say that the lack of informed parliamentary debate is a major contributory factor to the lack of development of our country as a nation. We have no transparency on expenditure decisions and no opportunity to assess whether we get value for money or the impact on employment of various Government decisions.</P>
    <P>To return to the European Council and the position in Europe we have to know where we are going.  It is quite outrageous that we have no White Paper or clear vision as to what our objectives are in the European Community.  Instead we have opaque statements which are no substitute for clearly defined foreign policy decisions.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Taoiseach made a beautiful statement when he referred to the application of Austria and Sweden for EC membership, that &ldquo;in each case, it is notable that an important consideration has been that neutrality has <Col N="1328" /> a different specific weight in the new Europe that I have been describing.&rdquo; What in the name of goodness the Taoiseach meant by that I do not know and I suppose I will never find out.  Even now there is an opportunity for the Government to produce a White Paper on European union and I remind the Government that we will have to have a referendum. Our people should not be treated like sheep, are at least entitled to know what the Government's objectives are and how far they have been successful in achieving them.  We need a clear statement from the Government on their position on the current crisis in Yugoslavia and whether we as a small country stand for the freedom of small nations.  This is essential when one considers the position of Slovenia and Croatia.</P>
    <P>Historically, and otherwise, this country should be to the forefront in insisting on the principle of the right to self-determination.  At the same time we should be aware of the difficulties in relation to minorities and we should be insisting on the establishment through the Council of Europe of a charter of rights for minorities, including political rights.  Such rights should provide for the full participation of such minorities in the political process and this would be of relevance in relation to Croatia where there is a significant Serbian minority. These rights should be capable of being legally enforced in the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Fears have been expressed about the break up and disintegration of the federated states that exist.  In my opinion this is inevitable in situations where these federated states did not come into existence by democratic means.  I do not believe the Baltic States will remain part of the Soviet Union because they were never given the opportunity of saying yea or nay at the time of the forcible annexation in 1940.  The Balkan States would not have held together if it had not been for the repressive Communist regime under Tito.  It is very much an imperialist approach on the part of the European <Col N="1329" /> Community to demand that these federated states stay together and to refuse to recognise the principle of self-determination. We should bear in mind that the European Community, which I wish to see develop as a political union by consensus, was formed originally principally to stop the wars between France and Germany.  It would have been unthinkable 45 years ago to have a federation between France and Germany as a way of stopping wars but it would have been even worse to force such a federation. Now, after the experience of working together in peace and harmony over so many years, the question of a possible federated states of Europe is being openly discussed and that is as it should be.  This has developed by consensus and through the democratic process.</P>
    <P>I have merely touched on some of the profound issues of foreign policy which arise either within the EC or outside.  I do not accept for one moment that this format gives rise to an opportunity for genuine debate on the many complex issues.  This reinforces the view that there is need for a clear analysis of foreign policy at both national and EC level. There is also need for a structured debate on a regular basis.  I do not believe it is possible to do this under the outdated procedures of the Dáil.  This reinforces the need for a committee on foreign affairs which should operate during the recess, and that is an important aspect of having a committee.  Perhaps the greatest failure of the Government in the area of foreign affairs is their absolute refusal to establish such a committee.</P>

      <P>The debate this evening has <Col N="1330" /> allowed us to cover a series of issues both as regards our general European policy and the work of the two Inter-governmental Conferences.  The Government's wish is to ensure that the House has an opportunity not only to comment on the outcome of the European Council meeting in Luxembourg but to review the position at this the half way stage of the conferences.  The fact that the Government have taken the unprecedented step of placing the Luxembourg Presidency's work in progress report in the Library for the information of Deputies underlines the importance the Government attach to this debate.</P>
      <P>In his opening statement the Taoiseach outlined in detail the Government's over-all position on political union and on economic and monetary union.  There can be no doubt as to Ireland's commitment to the success of the conferences; the input of further movements towards European union accelerated during our Presidency last year and Ireland's commitment has remained firm since then. The Taoiseach has indicated the overall Irish position on the main issues of the conferences at the five formal meetings of the political union conferences at ministerial level and at a number of informal meetings which have also considered the matter of Ireland's position on these issues.</P>
      <P>The conferences have still nearly six months to run and the final lines of their results cannot be fully discerned. However, I am satisfied that the Irish position, which has been clearly presented on all the issues involved, is fully understood by our partners and I am sure that in the course of the intensive negotiations which still lie ahead we will be able to achieve our objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The negotiations are complex and that is understandable.  The Community is a unique organisation; it is unique among international bodies in its decision-making structure, in its scope and in its institutional make up.  Its policy structure follows a coherent path designed to give reasonable and balanced treatment to the interests of all the member states.  The European Community Treaty applies <Col N="1331" /> directly and equally in all member states and this unity of approach is an essential characteristic of the Community system. The other special features of the Community are that it is much more than an intergovernmental organisation.  Its legislative and legal system, and its institutions, operate in exactly the same fashion throughout the Community. Again, this reflects the unity of the Community in its management of the interests of its member states and of its citizens.</P>
    <P>A particular feature of the Community system is the direct responsibility it takes for various policy areas, these include agriculture, international trade, monitoring of state aids and observance of the principles of economic and social cohesion.  Built into the administration of these policies and principles is a concrete recognition that the needs of regions on the periphery of the Community, such as Ireland, are the needs of the Community as a whole and they ought to be approached in a united way.  References to common policies and common actions are widespread in the Treaty and this reflects the unity of approach and treatment which is fundamental to the Community. It is important, therefore, as far as Ireland is concerned to ensure that the unique nature of the Community is preserved and, where necessary, reinforced in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>We have benefited in a very real sense from the unique nature of the Community and, because of its unique nature, our concerns have been more readily recognised than might have otherwise been the case.  It might have been necessary to take into account the very specific and sensitive nature of a number of areas and this is recognised in the three pillars of the Luxembourg Presidency's draft. Foreign and security policy and interior issues are not yet amenable to the classic Community approach and this is generally recognised.  In their case specific provision will need to be made to recognise the primarily intergovernmental nature of co-operation at this stage of the Community's evolution.</P>
    <P>Apart from the intergovernmental <Col N="1332" /> conferences on political union and economic and monetary union, the Luxembourg European Council devoted considerable attention to other issues. The Taoiseach referred to Yugoslavia and, in view of Deputy O'Keeffe's remarks, it might be opportune to say some more on this issue.  The Twelve are actively engaged in efforts to find a peaceful solution to the problems in Yugoslavia.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is to travel to The Hague this evening for a meeting with the European Foreign Ministers of the Twelve who will again take important decisions aimed at contributing to a settlement of the problems there.  As the Taoiseach informed the House on 28 June, the European Council sent a Troika of Foreign Ministers to Yugoslavia and they secured an agreement from the parties on a three point package, the ceasefire and withdrawal to barracks of the armed forces; a three months moratorium on the implementation of the declaration of independence and the appointment of Stipe Mesic as president of the Presidential College.  Since, at first, this agreement was not observed the Troika returned to Yugoslavia on 30 June and obtained a renewed commitment to the terms already agreed.  Initially the arranged ceasefires broke down but that which took place on the evening of 3 July appears to be holding reasonably well, despite the fact that there have been a number of incidents.</P>
    <P>Foreign Ministers of the Twelve met in emergency session on 5 July and suspended the operation of the second and third financial protocols between Yugoslavial and the Community.  They also agreed to impose an embargo on the sale of arms and military equipment to Yugoslavia. In addition they issued a declaration in which they called for a dialogue without pre-conditions between all parties on the future of Yugoslavia which should be based on the principles enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act and the Paris Charter for a New Europe, in particular, respect for human rights, including rights of minorities and the right of people to self-determination in <Col N="1333" /> conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant norms of international law, including those relating to territorial integrity of states.</P>
    <P>The Yugoslavia parties reaffirmed their commitments to the points of the ceasefire agreed on 30 June, with Twelve mediation.  As called for by the Twelve, the parties in Yugoslavia agreed that talks would start by 1 August on all aspects of Yugoslavia's future without pre-conditions and on the basis of the CSCE principles.</P>
    <P>Agreement was also reached on sending a Community mission to help stabilise the ceasefire and to monitor the implementation of the other elements agreed.  The despatch of this monitoring mission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Council in Luxembourg highlights the number of issues and policies that remain central to the discussions on the future development of the European Community.  The range and scope of the issues is very broad indeed.  There are a number of fundamental questions that must be addressed: Where will the locus of decision-making be in a more unified European Community?  What exactly do the Government understand by European Monetary Union?  What will be the role and authority of the European Parliament? What shape will the governmental element take?  What is meant by the social dimension and to what extent is the Community intending to influence this element?  What are the implications for Ireland of a common foreign and security policy?  What are the costs of European Monetary Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government seem unperturbed by these questions and have not answered them.  In the recent exchange in this <Col N="1336" /> House on the establishment of the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Taoiseach asked me what had changed since Fine Gael left government in 1987.  It seems that the Taoiseach has missed some of the most dramatic changes in recent history.  Indeed his judgment with regard to other developments has been faulty.  When I questioned him last year about the possible impact of German unification on the European Community and on Ireland, he assured me, in the words of his former deputy leader, that there was &ldquo;no problem&rdquo;. We can now see how wrong he was and based on this precedent I believe that his Government are just as wrong about the future of the European Community &mdash; an area to which they have given so little serious consideration.  The agenda of international affairs is more urgent and complex.  The break up of the Eastern Bloc, the Gulf crisis, the changing situation in South Africa and in Yugoslavia are events of enormous importance and significance.  At the same time the European Community is undergoing rapid and profound change.</P>
    <P>We are, at present, in the throes of discussions on the future shape of the European Community.  What is being mooted is the biggest transfer of power and decision-making capacity to the Community institutions, the result of which will mean that economic and political decisions will be increasingly made on a supranational rather than a national basis.  The impact of this process will be more dramatic than the impact of our original decision to join the European Community.  Yet the Government have given no real indication of how they envisage this transfer of power or what kind of European Community they wish to see.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the Government have not prepared the Irish economy or the Irish people for the impact of greater European unity following the completion of the internal market in 1992.  Their whole approach to the European Community has been to react to other people's agenda rather than actively try to set an <Col N="1337" /> agenda that encapsulated the priorities and interests of society.</P>
    <P>One of the areas of potential difficulty, as well as potential opportunity, is the question of European monetary union. It seems extraordinary, at a time when member states are contemplating the transfer of a large part of economic and political decision-making capacity to the European institutions, that the Government have not produced a White Paper or developed a national policy on the area.</P>
    <P>Recent reports have suggested that Ireland has a poor record in the area of implementing EC directives in the runup to 1992.  It is also worrying to note that the Government are unclear of the impact that 1992 will have on the Irish economy.  The Minister for Finance stated in January that it is the Government's aim to bring indirect tax rates into line with our EC neighbours.  However, the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland stated recently that the need for convergence of tax rates within the Community could pose very severe problems for the Irish public finances.  Whom are we to believe?</P>
    <P>EMU has the potential to involve costs for Ireland as a result of our location on the periphery of Europe.  It could increase the differences between lesser developed regions and richer regions. The Government have laid great emphasis on the Structural Funds as a mechanism for ensuring cohesion.  The reality is that the funds alone are not sufficient. The Community seems to have recognised this but it is not clear how economic and social cohesion will be achieved.  The recent meeting of the four smaller EC member states, constituting themselves as a pressure group, is counterproductive. This kind of action, mainly organised for domestic consumption, promotes the psychology of a two-tier Europe.  The debate and discussion on economic cohesion must take place at the level of the Twelve and the Irish position should have been more vigorously pursued there long before now.  Those in favour of EMU would suggest an increase in the Community budget.  At present <Col N="1338" /> the transfers to member states are only about 1 per cent of Community GNP. This contrasts with economic and monetary unions like the United States, Canada, Germany and Australia where financial transfers are of the order of 10 to 20 per cent of GNP.  Structural Funds may attempt to compensate for the losses incurred through convergence but they are not adequate on their own.  The Government's record in the effective use of the funds must also be evaluated.  The fact is that they have not put in place the institutions and structures that could operate a sound regional policy.  They have failed to deliver on local government reform and they continue to operate a centralised policy and decision-making system that is not geared towards making the best use of the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The Government have not addressed the potential costs of EMU.  In contrast, the Netherlands, a small state with some similarities to Ireland, has produced a White Paper on monetary integration and the Dutch Government have a clear strategy on how they would like the process to proceed.</P>
    <P>Another are of crucial importance where the Government lack a coherent policy is the reform of the CAP.  The Government were slow to recognise the impact of the proposed reforms on agri-business. The thrust of the MacSharry proposals for reform is a general reduction in intervention supports with compensation for farmers coming in the form of direct premia and this compensation being limited to specific types of farms.  The CII estimate that the milk loss in the dairy sector will be approximately £100 million and in the beef sector it could be up to £200 million.  This would have an impact on the food processing industry and the overall impact would be devastating to the entire economy.</P>
    <P>Once again, the Government are reacting to events rather than initiating policy proposals.  They seem to have no clear notion of how Irish agriculture should be restructured to take account of the reform of the CAP.  They have consistently mistaken a negotiating position <Col N="1339" /> for a policy and the result is that the Irish economy is unprepared for the future.</P>
    <P>The present Coalition of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil have refused to address issues until a crisis point is reached.  One of the key areas they have been unwilling to address is the question of a common foreign and security policy in the context of a unified European Community.  Whether it is formally stated or not, a common foreign policy will have a security-defence dimension.  This is a question we must tackle head on.  For the Taoiseach to say it is away in the distance and will not have to be faced for a long time is not a solution.  It will have to be faced and we might as well understand that now.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that we must have a national debate &mdash; a debate similar to that held at the forum for a New Ireland. The debate should be initiated by the Government and must be informed, responsible and realistic.  The people will, ultimately decide, However, they must be given every opportunity to make an informed choice.  The task of Government is to give a lead in these considerations and not claim that the question does not arise.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has dismissed the need for a national debate while suggesting quietly that we will give consideration to these matters in the distant future.  What does he fear?  Do his party and, indeed, his Government have a position on the issue?  Why does he insist on preserving on outmoded cloak of secrecy about foreign policy?  We must formulate our priorities and policies and be prepared to negotiate with a clear objective in mind.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the debate that is taking place in Britain on the question of federalism and a supranational European state.  It is a debate that should be of some interest and consequence to us. If the intention is to centralise power in a Euro-superstructure the implications for our political system could be profound. However, if the intention is a federal Europe with power delegated to the regions, then the impact on our political <Col N="1340" /> system could be positive and constructive.</P>
    <P>The crucial question of the relationship between the European institutions and the national institutions must be examined and evaluated.  This House has no mechanism through which we, as elected representatives, can really debate and discuss these issues.  I believe that the lack of a clear strategy on the development of the European Community places us at a disadvantage facing into the Inter-governmental Conference in December.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The central issue facing the two Intergovernmental Conferences is how to strengthen the European Community as an economic and political entity.  The Community clearly cannot stand still: it must either develop or decline.  The further development of the Community is clearly in the interests of the citizens of all the member states.  It is equally clearly in the interests of the EFTA countries, which want to expand their economic relations with the Community. It is also abundantly clear that the development of the Community is in the interests of the newly emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe which aspire either to becoming members of an expanded, wider European Community, or to being associated with it in a fundamental and meaningful way.  It is very clear that our best interests are served in an expanding, developing Community with a real commitment to economic and social cohesion.</P>
      <P>The case for a Single Market within the European Community has now been accepted: it is time to move on to Economic and Monetary Union and Political Union.  These are the considerations that should inspire the work we do in the two Intergovernmental Conferences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe, nor is there any evidence before us to suggest, that the Government are tackling that job systematically. We have very little information about the Government's views on any of the major issues, and both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have been extremely coy in this House and outside about revealing any <Col N="1341" /> views they might have on these issues. Today again the Taoiseach was timid, hesitant and even platitudinous in what he said in this House about the substantive issues.  We have frequently heard the Taoiseach make the nonsensical assertion that it would in some way be wrong for him to reveal views in this House on important issues before meetings of the European Council.  In fact, both he and the Government should be actively seeking the views and the advice of this House in order to enrich their approach to these negotiations.  What is happening instead seems to be that the Taoiseach and the Government who have no clear views on where they should go are being sucked along willy-nilly by political currents which they do not even try to influence.  Indeed, the Taoiseach himself admitted this this afternoon when he said on one of the key issues, that the Government have &ldquo;followed the debate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The European Community needs greater efficiency in decision making. Enormous progress has been made in the 40 years since the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Communities was signed in 1951.  Right through those 40 years, however, there has been an inevitable conflict between what I would call on the one hand &ldquo;statism&rdquo; and on the other hand &ldquo;federalism&rdquo;. The EC has never fully lived up to its potential and the reason has always been the same, that fundamental political compromises on structures, institutions and decision making procedures have always leaned too much on the side of &ldquo;statism&rdquo;.  It is time we learned that lesson because we have not a great deal of time to improve the coherence of the European Community.</P>
    <P>We need a strong Commission with a virtually exclusive right of initiative.  I say virtually exclusive rather than wholly exclusive because I can see a strong case for a consultative procedure under which the European Council and perhaps the European Parliament, or both, could suggest new initiatives to the Commission which the Commission would have a right to refuse under certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> The Commission has served the Community extremely well.  True, it has rightly been criticised at various times for what many people have seen as an excess of centralising zeal.  In my view, however, it is far better to have a zealous Commission which has to be reined in from time to time by the other institutions, than to have a supine Commission which will not advance the overall interests of the Community.  The Commission should have the power of initiative and the responsibility to implement Community decisions on a day-to-day basis.  The new Treaty now being negotiated should take away from the Council of Ministers the executive powers which it has gradually arrogated to itself through the process known as comitology in a whole series of areas.  Attempts at management by the Council of Ministers have always created more problems than they have solved, and have always been a cause of incoherence in the Community system.</P>
    <P>We need a Council of Ministers that can make decisions, not one that will be blocked for long periods on important issues.  That means, in my view, that the power of veto implicit in the requirement for unanimity in voting on certain key matters should be dispensed with in all save very important matters such as modifications to the treaties or the conclusion of new treaties with states or groups of states outside the Community. Majority decisions should be the norm in the Council of Ministers; qualified majority decisions should be an infrequent exception.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, the only view that the Government have expressed on these issues is the unsupported assertion that Ireland's interests can best be defended in a Council of Ministers where we have one voice out of 12.  This, mind you, from a Government who have never vetoed a single decision in the Council of Ministers and from a Government who seem to ignore or be unaware of the fact that Ireland has much less than one voice in 12 in qualified majority decisions in the Council.  Both the Commission and the European Parliament have shown themselves to be more consistent and more <Col N="1343" /> committed supporters of the smaller member states and of the peripheral regions than the Council of Ministers has ever been.</P>
    <P>The draft Treaty proposals put forward by the Luxembourg Government &mdash; this infamous non-paper &mdash; do not deal either radically or decisively with the issues that arise in relation to the powers of the Commission and of the Council of Ministers, still less do they deal adequately with the powers of the European Parliament. What has come to be known as the &ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo; in the Community is now widely acknowledged. There is no effective, consistent and continuing parliamentary scrutiny of the greater part of the decisions made by the Council of Ministers.  It is idle for the Government to pretend, as the Taoiseach tried to do this afternoon, that there is any democratic scrutiny in the national parliaments.  Even this debate today is only a pale substitute for the kind of scrutiny we should undertake, and indeed it is a habit with this Government because they do not want scrutiny of our domestic Estimates either, as we saw in their disgraceful conduct last week.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament has limited powers.  It has powers of &ldquo;co-decision&rdquo; in relation to the directives on the Single Market.  Once these directives are in place, the effective powers of &ldquo;co-decision&rdquo; of the European Parliament come to an end under the present dispensation. It is a parliament elected directly by universal suffrage.  The Council of Ministers is not directly accountable to the European Parliament, nor are its members directly accountable to their national parliaments.  There is, therefore, a very strong case for giving the Parliament a greater say in decision making in the Community.</P>
    <P>The Parliament seeks wider powers of &ldquo;co-decision&rdquo;.  It already has this power in relation to the Single Market directives. Contrary to what is claimed by members of the present Government, those powers have been very wisely used and have helped to expedite the Single Market process rather than to hold it up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> The case therefore for giving the Parliament extra powers is well founded on the use it has made of its &ldquo;co-decision&rdquo; powers and is undeniably well founded when we look at the requirements for democracy and proper parliamentary scrutiny of decisions of the Council of Ministers.  The draft treaty proposed by the Luxembourg Government seems to give the Parliament new &ldquo;co-decision&rdquo; powers, but a detailed examination of the treaty shows they are in a very limited number of areas and with very limited scope.</P>
    <P>There has been time to mention only a very few of the issues that arise here.  I deplore, as do other Members of this House, the inadequacy of this debate.  It is the only discussion this House has had on these issues, and it is one which the Government, to their shame, a few minutes ago tried to muzzle.  They are running away from the matter and there is not the proper democratic input that is needed at this crucial time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, let me say to all Members of this House that unless the major political parties wake up to reality and realise that something must be done to stop the handing over of large new areas of law-making competence from the Oireachtas and the Irish people to an EC Monetary and Political union the days of this House and its remaining powers are numbered.  Future Government and elected representatives will be nothing more than a stage performance because all decisions relating to the running of our country will be made in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach's position, which spinelessly supports the EC view on the situation in Yugoslavia, is not only shameful but it further highlights the fact that the Irish Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs are almost irrelevant as far as policy-making is concerned. Ireland should be supporting the rights of nations to self-determination and should take a positive attitude towards the developments in Croatia and Slovenia.  It should at least consider official recognition of these republics, but instead, the <Col N="1345" /> Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Collins, have agreed with EC policy and said that Ireland will refuse recognition to the independence of Slovenia and Croatia if they leave Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>Slovenia clearly asserted its right to national self-determination last December when over 80 per cent of registered voters in Slovenia said they wanted their national independence.  Ireland's opposition to this, because it is against the wishes of the big States of the European Community, is support for what amounts to a collectively imperalistic EC foreign policy.  The democratically elected parliaments in both Croatia and Slovenia support demands for self-determination. The failed Communist regime in Belgrade has attempted to put an end to the process of freedom by the use of military force.  This is an outrage which the Government should strongly condemn. Ireland in particular should support the principle of the peoples right to self-determination without the loss of life.</P>
    <P>As the EC seeks to become a quasifederal superstate, it fears boundary changes in existing multinational federations, for example, Yugoslavia, the USSR, Czechoslovakia, India, Pakistan, Nigeria etc., all of which are artificial 20th century political creations that lack what gives states legitimacy and lasting popular democratic support, that is national continuity and decentralisation.</P>
    <P>The EC is embarrassed by what is happening in Yugoslavia, because it clearly shows that stable political democracy cannot exist within super-centralised regimes, but will only exist within national states and national communities. The EC integration is an assault on national democracy in the interests of powerful transitional business and bureaucratic elites under no democratic control, whose laws and edicts can thus never have popular legitimacy.  Indeed, it is ironic that while Free Eastern Europe is moving towards decentralisation Western Europe is going full steam in the other direction to a complete centralised system which Eastern Europe has clearly shown does not work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1346" /> European Union, which is to be the new name for what we now call the European Community, formerly known as the European Economic Community and originally known as the Common Market, will mean the end of national democracy as we know it.  It would appear that by name changing and slowly chopping away at the structures the powerful bureaucratic elites and big business think they can confuse the Irish people into giving up any rights to govern their own country.</P>
    <P>It would appear from the Taoiseach's speech that he is going to the bureaucratic elites and powerful big business who are pushing this European Union to get away with their plans to foist two new EC Treaties on the peoples of Western Europe at the Maastricht Summit next December.  The European and Economic Monetary Union Treaty is designed to have a single EC currency and an EC Central Bank and EC decision making on credit, interest rates and the financing of national budgets for each EC member country by the late nineties.</P>
    <P>The second treaty, which is a political union treaty, is aimed at common EC defence and foreign policy and new law making powers over energy, environment, education and other areas to be taken by Brussels from the national Governments and elected national parliaments.</P>
    <P>The aims of the draft union treaty, which were discussed by the EC Ministers in Luxembourg, are to create an area without internal frontiers and the establishment of economic union including finally a single currency and to assert the union's identity on the international scene in particular through the implementation of a common foreign and security policy including the eventual framing of a defence policy: in fact, this is a new super state in the making.  What is being planned with these new EC Treaties is clearly an all out assault on the national independence of the various peoples of Western Europe.  This would be the destruction of their hard won democratic rights, i.e., the right to make their own laws through their own elected <Col N="1347" /> parliaments, to decide their own governments, to levy their own taxes and decide independently their relations with other states.</P>
    <P>The replacement of that by law making behind closed doors by the EC Commission and Council of Ministers, where Ireland has only three votes out of 76, is the end of government of the people, by the people, for the people of the countries concerned.  Its replacement of government by supernational politicians and bureaucracies enforcing the policies of transnational capital sees Ireland as primarily a source of cheap and migrant labour and an island tourist resort.</P>
    <P>When people realise they have lost their democracy and national independence they will inevitably fight back. Unfortunately, it is harder to regain what has been lost than to refuse to surrender it in the first place, and it often takes people a long time to wake up when powerful political and media forces have an interest in hoodwinking them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, and their Government colleagues backed up by Fine Gael and others must be continually criticised for their plans to sell out what is left of Irish democracy and neutrality. It would appear that the only issue they are concerned about is what price they can get in return.  Unfortunately these people will be well out of politics when the people of Ireland are still suffering the dire consequences of their acts.  That is why we need to prepare now for the inevitable constitutional referendum, which will probably be in 1992, to ratify the signing of these treaties next December. The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, appeal to all those concerned to come together now and prepare to fight against this planned sell-out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absolutely astonishing that the Taoiseach should come in here to report on the European Council and, with the exception of using the word &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; once in the second last page of his speech, employment was not mentioned, good, bad or indifferent, <Col N="1348" /> despite the fact that 30.8 per cent of the Irish workforce have failed to find a job at home since Deputy Haughey became Taoiseach.  The percentage of the work force on the register of unemployment is now 19.9 per cent.  In addition almost 11 per cent of our workers have emigrated in the past five years.  This is a crisis.  In order to record the accuracy of these figures the unemployment register published last week, and the supplement for those between the ages of 58 and 65 published yesterday, show an all time record for unemployment.  This is the fourth month this year in which new records of unemployment have been recorded. Never was unemployment higher than it is today, yet it would appear that our Government, or no other government, put unemployment to the forefront. What good is economic and social cohesion if there is no future at home for all our citizens?  Surely one of the principal measures by which the success or failure of society is measured is whether society provides a viable and fulfilling future at home for all its citizens. We have failed 31 per cent of our citizens.</P>
      <P>I said some weeks ago in Limerick, and I am glad my party leader has taken up the phrase, that what was called the famine in the last century was not a famine, it was a hunger.  At the time of the famine we were exporting food and in ten years the population of this island was reduced by 30 to 40 per cent.  Millions died on coffin ships, while others eked out existences in Birmingham, Boston and further afield.  Some of my own namesakes were found in Van Diemen's land, now Tasmania.  The principal cause of that so called famine was not potato blight but official complacency by a government located in Westminster.  We have all heard the ballads about Trevelyan's corn &mdash; the corn that was exported from this island while millions went to their deaths at home, on the high seas or in the transit camps on Ellis Island and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the same official complacency which is causing unemployment.  It is astonishing that our Taoiseach presiding as he does over the worst unemployment <Col N="1349" /> figures by far in any of the Twelve EC countries, should go to a summit and not have as a principal item on the agenda policies to generate employment; it was not even a sub-item on the agenda.  That is a shocking dereliction of duty and this shocking complacency fully measures up to the level of complacency and hostility which emanated from Westminster in the middle of the last century and from which this country has not yet recovered.</P>
    <P>Since Deputy Haughey was returned as Taoiseach, 31 per cent of our workforce have failed to find a job at home. That is an indisputable fact published by the Government themselves, albeit in a way to try to obscure it.  In the last few months they have taken to breaking the unemployment register in two: one part is published on the first Friday of the month and the second part is published on the following Monday, and sometimes on Tuesday.  Today some political correspondents were looking for the second part of the June unemployment figures because they had not been given them yesterday.  This is the extent to which the Government are prepared to go to obscure the true unemployment situation. What does European Union mean or what relevance has it for our people?  What is the meaning of economic, monetary and social cohesion if it has no impact on unemployment, except to make it greater?</P>
    <P>Even if the EC agreed to pay our total social welfare bill out of its budget it still would not be enough because even high social welfare payments cannot replace the sense of pride, fulfilment and employment which even routine, boring work gives to a person, compared to the dole and idleness.  I condemn the Taoiseach for not placing unemployment on the agenda as a principal concern of the European Community.</P>
    <P>Unemployment throughout the Community is between 8 per cent and 9 per cent.  In Ireland unemployment, adjusted for migration figures, is 31 per cent.  One must adjust for the migration figures because none of the other 11 countries has even remotely as bad an emigration problem as we have.  The indication for <Col N="1350" /> the census year finishing on 5 April last is that there was no emigration last year. The reality is that in the past five years 136,000 people have left our shores, on top of which 264,000 people are registered as unemployed.  If you add those two figures they come to exactly 400,000, 30.9 per cent of our workforce.  I do not believe it has penetrated the consciousness of the Taoiseach &mdash; or his Government &mdash; the seriousness of unemployment, the demoralisation it creates, the tensions and health problems which arise and other adverse consequences, quite apart from the fact that homes completely dependent on unemployment payments live in poverty.  They find it difficult to put food on the table and to clothe their children.</P>
    <P>Unemployment must be our first issue at home and abroad.  It is all the more surprising, given the overrun in the budget figures, that the Taoiseach did not see fit to adopt the Fine Gael strategy and put unemployment at the top of the political agenda.  If we could only reduce unemployment by one-third we would have no budget deficit, less poverty, no emigration and fewer taxes.  The Government stand condemned for their failure in this regard.</P>

      <P>Ní thógfaidh mé ach cúpla nóiméad, ach tá cúpla pointí atá tábhachtach a ba cheart dom a nochtadh anocht.  I wish to raise a few points in the speech from the Taoiseach in introducing this report on the proceedings of the intergovernmental conference on political economic and monetary union and related European developments which deserve clarification.  On another occasion I made an attempt, for example, to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and, through him, the Taoiseach, what precisely was the Community's decision in relation to the structural basis of African famine.  When I tabled questions of this nature I got used to a recitation of promises and donations made by the European Community in response to famine.  It is one of the abuses of parliament and of language that a long list like this wastes the time available for <Col N="1351" /> asking supplementary questions.  Question Time in relation to Foreign Affairs has become a notorious and scandalous abuse in this House.</P>
      <P>When a comparison is made between the amount of time devoted and the number of questions answered the record of the House will show that very rarely are we able to complete a significant number of questions.  This is almost entirely due to the extraordinarily long, descriptive, narrative and non-analytical answers provided for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  That atmosphere has encouraged far more supporters of the idea of a foreign affairs committee than previously in this House.  The irritation is shown and shared, not only on Opposition benches, but on the Government side.</P>
      <P>To make economical use of the few minutes I have I should like to now repeat my question.  Why, in the speech delivered, was there not a more serious attempt to account for any discussions, deliberations or position papers if they had been prepared on the structural basis of African famine?  I am not merely being academic, I am talking about the situation that faces many people when this House will be in recess.  I make no apology for having repeated this, week in week out, for the last several weeks.</P>
      <P>In Sudan, out of a population of 23.8 million people 7.7 million are at risk; in Ethiopia out of 48 million people 7.5 million people are at risk; in Somalia 2 million people in the population of 5.9 million are at risk; in Mozambique 1.9 million are at risk in a population of 15 million people; in Angola 1.9 people in a population of 9.5 million are at risk; in Nigeria 1.8 million out of a population of 7 million are at risk; in Liberia 1.35 million are at risk out of 2.5 million.  When I read those figures in the past the response was almost the bill of lading of different means of transportation systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me be clear, I have always welcomed such systems but I asked a specific question which was not answered.  What about the discussion or proposal on the structural basis of the famine itself?  I very <Col N="1352" /> clearly itemised this.  For example, what is the Community's thinking in relation to the burden of debt facing the countries most severely affected?  What is the thinking of these councils which have reported on the cancellation or rescheduling of international debt?  It was interesting that even Secretary Baker addressed this question in the United States even if his proposals were both cynical and absurd as he suggested that the debt could be exchanged for equity. I am sure that the starving millions on the gravel and sand of the desert will want to say what equity there is in death, gravel and sand.</P>
    <P>What is the Community's position?  I have to ask that today because, on several occasions recently, we have been told in this House &mdash; most recently in what might be regarded as a definition of the mystical body &mdash; when the Minister said that Ireland participates fully in the Twelve, that the position of the Twelve is the position of Ireland and Ireland, participating fully, is the position of the Twelve.  When you have worked out it means that, sooner or later, we must get an answer to our question.  We cannot get answers from the person with responsibility for foreign affairs.  I believe the preparations in the debate &mdash; and the White Paper &mdash; for the Single European Act were absolutely farcical.  It does not bother me which Government were in power or which Minister was responsible. I said at the time, and I repeat now, that in my opinion that was based on another error &mdash; the total neglect of the economic and social dimension in the preparatory documents leading up to the Single European Act.  That became transparent when eventually a position document was forced out of those responsible and was rushed to the public rather late in the day.  Will we have a repeat of that performance? The speech delivered this afternoon seems to give an agenda of problems but very little indication of Ireland's position.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;social cohesion&rdquo; in the history of the language will probably be dated in the fullness of time to the debate <Col N="1353" /> surrounding the Single European Act. The phrase was used, if I might put it this way, to try to deal with the soft side of Europe &mdash; bluntly, those interested in a Europe of all Europeans, a Europe with people.  It is interesting that of the documents to come before the House at the time, which are available in the Library, those dealing with the benefits of the integrated market both outweigh in a physical sense and precede in a temporal sense any suggestion of an identification of the social consequences of an integrated market.  It is clear to anybody who walks the streets of any village, town or city of Europe that the social dimension of the European Community is in serious crisis.  The commitment to the Social Charter, and the social action programme, is halfhearted.  From meetings I have attended in Europe and as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Social, Environmental and Miscellaneous Affairs of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Legislation &mdash; what a title &mdash; I can say that I have seen no evidence to suggest anything that might generate enthusiasm or confidence in a principle of co-terminus evolution, and I use my phrase deliberately.</P>
    <P>The mandate sought from the Irish people for the Single European Act and the mandate given was given on the clearest legal undertakings of equal development of the social side and the integration of the market.  There is not one whit of evidence to suggest that that has in fact happened.  In every single area &mdash; for example, in terms of an area just referred to, employment &mdash; Europe is in fact performing hopelessly.  Figures in relation to participation have been jigged occasionally by the proliferation of schemes in substitution for employment opportunities. I find it hilarious that in the course of this afternoon's speech made by the Taoiseach it was suggested that we were somehow or another enthusiastic about social cohesion.</P>
    <P>May I just list the issues that I feel require clarification?  In relation to Ireland's overall approach, it is extraordinary that there should be a statement that it is now accepted that there is a <Col N="1354" /> difference between security and defence. At what price in the definition of security? It is interesting that in another part of the Taoiseach's speech it was noted that the Warsaw Pact had ceased to exist but the following paragraph stated the NATO was reconstituting its role.  Does that mean that the Taoiseach welcomes the collapse of the Warsaw Pact but sees a future role for NATO?  That is a change in Ireland's thinking.</P>
    <P>In relation to many other issues I note that there is a celebratory, hyperbolic statement about the bankruptcy of central and eastern European regimes but that there is not a single reference to the unemployment consequences of the market economy.  The document is indeed ideological.  It is vague in spots and it is a disappointment.</P>
    <P>Let us have a debate, let us not have arrogance and let us have a flushing out of what all the options are and what all the definitions may be before going to the people.  If we get a mandate from the people, let us honour it.  The people will remember that on the previous occasion the mandate was not honoured nor accountability rendered in this House and that Ireland is unique in Europe in being regarded as the only Parliament and the only people who are unworthy and whom it is unnecessary to consult through a foreign affairs committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few moments available to me I wish to address a couple of points to the Minister for the Environment, who, I understand, is to reply to the debate on behalf of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kind of debate and the structure of the proceedings that have taken place this afternoon are indicative of the Government's commitment to the whole European process.  It would appear that in the summer of 1991 the Irish Government have a begging bowl mentality <i>vis-á-vis</i> the European Community, that Ireland is in the European Community for the benefits that may accrue but when it comes to contributing to the political and social decisions of that Community it opts to stand back and let the decisions be made by others.  That is the one <Col N="1355" /> common thread that appears throughout the Taoiseach's speech this afternoon &mdash; a most disappointing and empty speech following a summit that should have been of much more interest to Ireland than the Taoiseach's report would indicate.</P>
    <P>I would hope that we as a national Parliament and as a House could have better structures so that we would have a much greater input and be better briefed on decisions made both in the European Parliament and at Council of Ministers level.  It is something of a farce that we as a parliament should be given an afternoon to debate matters that took place at a summit and to debate decisions that have already been taken.  I wonder why we do not have a full day's debate on such matters before a summit takes place; why we do not have a report to the House from Ministers before they depart to Council of Ministers' meetings?  The lack of dialogue and communication between us as a national parliament and the institutions of the European Community is giving rise to a widespread cynicism throughout Irish society about our participation in European affairs.</P>
    <P>The matter of foreign affairs committee has been amplified <i>ad nauseam</i> by Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  I certainly do not wish to speak for Deputy Higgins, but I sense at this stage a measure of embarrassment on his part when he stands on an almost daily basis to raise the matter of a foreign affairs committee, which at this point in time brings only acknowledgments of derision, laughter and scorn from Government benches.  It is simply not good enough for a country that prides itself on being European that has been a member of the European Community for almost 20 years, that the Government do not allow us to have a foreign affairs committee for fear of the committee speaking out of line or for fear of it making decisions or being seen to make decisions or having views not in keeping with the views of the Taoiseach of the day.</P>
    <P>An illustration of Ireland's commitment to the European Community and the entire European process is the <Col N="1356" /> part of the Taoiseach's speech which refers to the very important issue of security and defence and which comes up with the gem that the position of successive Governments has been that if the Community were to develop its own defence arrangements for security, then Ireland as a committed member state would consider participation.  If I have ever seen a prime example of a statement that says absolutely nothing, that is it.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Government towards the European Community at this time is shameful.  We are engaged in an almost meaningless round of statements. There is no motion before the House, no decision-making structure, just a series of statements and the national parliament of a member state will then note the fact that sometime in the early summer of 1991 a European summit involving the Heads of members states took place.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Luxembourg Summit did not deal with the question of employment has been mentioned.  The fact that it was not raised by the Taoiseach is further proof of the shameful performance on the part of the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow the House again will have an opportunity to engage in a series of speeches on agriculture with particular reference to the effects on this vital national industry of the proposals of an Irish Commissioner.  Again, it is regrettable that tomorrow there will be nothing more than a series of statements and the House will not have an opportunity of passing a motion or a resolution or stating that the MacSharry cuts will bring widespread and wholesale devastation to rural life as we know it.  I hope that early tomorrow morning the Minister for Agriculture and Food will set out for the House, and the country, the plan of campaign he will engage in at the earliest opportunity when we get final clarification from Brussels of what the decisions will be.  Undoubtedly, this is a matter of vital national interest.</P>
    <P>Comparing Irish agriculture to agriculture in other European states, we have by far the greatest dependency with 16 per cent of our workforce directly engaged in agriculture.  That is more than <Col N="1357" /> twice the European average.  More particularly our type of agriculture is such that 87 per cent of Irish farms are family farms.  We hear meaningless commitments by Government Ministers to protect the family farm, protect Irish agriculture, and yet we see total capitulation by our Minister at the Council of Agriculture Ministers and by the Irish Commissioner.  It would appear that it has been the greatest disadvantage of all time for Ireland to have its Irish Commissioner designated to agriculture because, in order to prove his independence, he has bent over backwards to act against our vital national interests.</P>
    <P>I hope tomorrow the Minister for Agriculture and Food will give us, the elected representatives of the people of Ireland, an indication of the stance he will take at future Council meetings on the devastating proposals on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  There is no doubt that damage will be caused to farm incomes which, even before this latest round, had suffered with farmers earning on average 50 per cent less than they did two years ago.  Would any other sector take even a 10 per cent cut in income given the state of our economy without an outcry of almost revolutionary proportions? However, we are expected by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, and by the Commissioner, to allow farm incomes to be halved over two years with worse to come when the effect of the proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy filter through.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what has come from this debate.  Would it not be more beneficial to everybody, and to our country, to have this type of debate prior to the Summit.</P>
    <P>We are not even rubber-stamping the decisions taken at the Summit because, to judge by what the Taoiseach said, he did not even bother bringing forward the most important issues, agriculture and employment, and yet we call ourselves committed Europeans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the House should express its thanks to the Taoiseach for his very <Col N="1358" /> comprehensive outline of the proceedings on the Intergovernmental Conference on political union and economic and monetary union and related European developments in his contribution. It is seen outside as the most detailed examination of the progress made to date leading up to the final decisions to be taken later this year at Maastricht.  It should be recognised as one of the most comprehensive reports ever put before this House.  If Deputies opposite had paid more attention, and had had a better attendance here, they might have gained something useful from the speech since they were so active in pursuing the debate in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Earlier my colleague, the Minister for Defence, outlined and updated the Community's response to the crisis in Yugoslavia. I would like to take up some of the points made by other Deputies during the course of the debate.  First, on the question of the internal market, as is standard at the European Council the state of play on the completion of the internal market was reviewed in Luxembourg. One of the most important aspects of the conclusions is the need, recognised throughout the Community, to ensure that legislation is transposed without undue delay into national law. Implementation at national level is vital to the success of the 1992 enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At Luxembourg the Heads of State and Government invited each Government to take all necessary steps to make up for lost time.  The Commission has been asked to report back on the situation to the next European Council meeting in Maastricht in December.  The internal market programme remains a major preoccupation of the Community.  It provided the motivation which led to the success of the Single Act and it helped to inspire the renewed drive towards European union.  It has encouraged other countries, such as Austria and Sweden, to seek membership of the Community. Its success has helped to inspire a process of change in eastern Europe.  Its completion is one of the requirements for the commencement of Stage II of economic and monetary union.  For all of these <Col N="1359" /> reasons much depends on the success of the 1992 programme and it is linked directly to the success of its efforts in other areas.</P>
    <P>The second point I would like to deal with is the Community's external relations, a very important topic at the European Council and at Luxembourg. Important declarations were adopted on a number of significant matters.  The Community has been very active in helping to encourage the process of democratisation in Eastern Europe.  The Commission in particular has a central role to play as was recognised by the summit of the major industrial countries in Paris two years ago.</P>
    <P>On the USSR the European Council reviewed the state of play on assistance and underlined its full support for the endeavour of President Gorbachev and the Government of the Soviet Union to accelerate the reforms undertaken and to ease its integration into the world economy.</P>
    <P>Very significantly the Commission was invited to pursue exploratory talks with the Soviet Union on a major agreement covering not only economic but political and cultural matters.  Irish bilateral links with the Soviet Union are important and we are conscious of the importance to bilateral relations and ties with the Community. We have supported the development of these ties, as positive progress has taken place in the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>Some members referred to the EFTA countries.  As the House is aware the negotiations with the EFTA countries are reaching a crucial stage.  Important issues remain to be resolved before we can reach our objective as a single market involving the EFTA countries.  These include issues such as fisheries and cohesion where Ireland has significant concerns.  We regard the success of the negotiations as important and have encouraged a satisfactory outcome.  We are continuing to take a constructive approach in the negotiations.  while ensuring that our specific position on fisheries and on cohesion is recognised by <Col N="1360" /> the Commission, by our partners and by the EFTA countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton in his contribution referred to employment and the need for a Community focus on employment.  This is one of the issues under consideration in the Intergovernmental Conference. Article 2 of the draft union treaty sets out the essential tasks and objectives of the Community, and includes among these objectives, to which all the policies of the Community are directed, is an explicit commitment to employment. Nothing could be clearer.  This was an Irish proposal and I am happy to see it included in the draft negotiating text. Moreover, the specific common policy set out in the draft will be directed at economic development and job creation, for example policies on economic and social cohesion, research and development and on education and training.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised fears about the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  It has been suggested that the Taoiseach did not intervene on this question at European Council level.  The House will have an opportunity to discuss Common Agricultural Policy reform tomorrow.  I would make it clear that the Taoiseach intervened on this issue at the European Council and made clear to his Heads of Government colleagues the social and economic significance of agriculture to Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach pointed out his concern at the implications for Irish agriculture of the proposals now under consideration.  He successfully opposed any attempt to include in the Council's conclusions a reorientation of Community priorities in the GATT round which could have affected the Community's negotiating position on agriculture. As it is there is no change in the Community's negotiation position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the development of a common foreign and security policy and to the issue of defence.  The Taoiseach set out the <Col N="1361" /> present state of discussions in this area in his opening statement and he made it clear that the distinction that we have made between security and defence was acceptable to the other member states at the Rome European Council in December, and that this distinction is confirmed in the Luxembourg conclusions last month.  This is important, because it has enabled the Intergovernmental conference to focus its discussion separately on the two areas.  Some progress has been made in defining the scope of security along the lines of the areas set out in the Rome conclusions, namely arms control and disarmament, CSCE matters, certain questions debated in the United Nations, economic and technological co-operation in the disarmament field, co-ordination of Community export policy and non-proliferation. We expect that the next phase of the negotiations under the Netherland's Presidency will carefully examine each of these areas to determine their appropriatness to a common policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are engaged with our Community partners in constructing a new, political, economic and monetary union.  It is essential in building that basis that policies should be put in place to ensure its solidarity and stability.  That is why we have stressed the need for new policies on economic and social cohesion as an essential part of the development of the Union.  To suggest that we should be ashamed or that we should be bashful about our approach implies that we should ignore an essential part of European Union.  This would be misunderstood and misrepresented and the Deputy should not have pursued that line in his contribution.  On reflection I am sure the Deputy will recognise that it was a mistake, a statement issued in the heat of the moment, and that he will be happy to withdraw it.</P>
      <P>In relation to economic and social cohesion the Taoiseach outlined today the specific concrete proposal the Government have put forward for Treaty amendments to strengthen the Community commitment to cohesion and Community action in that area.  Ireland was the first member state to make concrete proposals on cohesion to the Conference. We have been instrumental in pushing the debate on this issue.  It is significant that the draft Treaty now on the table takes up the ideas first put forward by Ireland.  We have also been instrumental in ensuring that the issue is discussed at each European Council meeting at which political, economic and social cohesion is discussed.  As a result of our active policies the President of the Commission, Jacques Delors made a comprehensive and important statement on cohesion at the Luxembourg Council. This was due to our interest which led the way in this matter.  The Council have asked the Commission to clarify and develop their ideas, and these will be taken up between now and the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the half way stage in these very <Col N="1363" /> complex negotiations I can report substantial progress on this issue, which is one of the priority concerns in the Inter-governmental Conference.  It is clear from the Taoiseach's statement this afternoon &mdash; and we have to agree that it was a most comprehensive report of Inter-governmental business &mdash; that the Government have taken on a very active and committed part in the negotiations in a way that enhances Ireland's interest in these matters.  In 1973 when we joined the Community we made a commitment to European integration and closer union between the peoples of Europe.  Our participation in the conferences and our contribution to the negotiations are fully in line with that commitment.  That commitment has always been in Ireland's interest and in the interests of the Community in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I made the point that the defect inherent in orthodox economic thinking represented by conservative politicians over a number of years was the assumption that economic growth led automatically to investment and beyond that to job creation.  I would like, this evening, to give further <Col N="1364" /> evidence on just that one point because it is necessary.  I should like to rely on someone who I believe has perceived the fallacy of what was orthodox economic thinking which led to the assumption that a climate could be created which would automatically produce jobs.  <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 30 June 1991 contained an article entitled &ldquo;Goodbye and don't come back&rdquo;.  Paul Tansey who wrote the article may not be responsible for the title but, more importantly, he is responsible for the analysis in it.  He referred to estimates from different sources, which I think most people accept, including the Economic and Social Research Institute.  The views I offered on the last occasion not simply held by me but by others, including working economists.  Paul Tansey states:</P>
      <P>The reality of labour market performance over the past five years is both stark and simple.  Up to 1991, emigrants' departures, not job arrivals, acted as the principal force for reducing unemployment.  Between 1986 and 1990, emigration served to siphon 136,000 people from the country.  The domestic labour force, which would have swelled considerably with their staying, instead declined by 5,000 over those four years.  Employment agains of 39,000 were then sufficient to reduce unemployment by 44,000 against this background of labour force contraction.</P>
      <P>He further states, interestingly:</P>
      <P>After a disappointing growth slowdown to around 2 per cent in 1991, the Irish economy is expected to regain momentum next year as the economies of its principal trading partners revive.</P>
      <P>This thinking is not unlike that contained in the Minister's speech.  He went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Real GNP growth is forecast to average 3.75 per cent annually in the five years ending 1996.  Inflation is set to remain low, averaging less than 3 per cent annually while the balance of payments is scheduled to remain in <Col N="1365" /> comfortable surplus throughout the forecast period.</P>
    <P>One could describe this succinctly as meaning the climate continues to be right.  The Minister did not depart either from such a projection.  He continued:</P>
    <P>The main constituents of the ESRI's medium-term forecast are shown in Table 2.  From a distance, they contain an impression of steady, if unspectacular, economic progress.</P>
    <P>He went on to say, and this is where he departs from the Minister:</P>
    <P>But, on closer inspection, all of the old labour market problems remain. Through the forecast period, the numbers joining the labour force continue to expand at a rapid pace.  Despite the decent pace of forecast economic growth, this fails to translate into employment expansion on a sufficient scale to absorb the net number of new labour entrants.  With labour supply overshooting labour demand, it is left either to unemployment or emigration to absorb the excess supply shock.</P>
    <P>This is the argument I have made, not against any one party in this House &mdash; I think some Members of this House would agree &mdash; about the assumption that economic growth rates projected over a period lead automatically to job creation. I have been reviled by people who objected to my suggestion that this is a fallacy.  Hence my development on the last occasion of what I called the myth of climatology within economic theory and the notion of the economy without people, the &ldquo;depeopled&rdquo; economy.  Mr. Tansey goes on to give figures, which I think are drawn from the Economic and Social Research Institute's projections. He states:</P>
    <P>As can be seen, between 1991 and 1996, total employment is forecast to increase by 51,000 people, with industry and market services providing the principal impetus to jobs growth.  Yet, while this sounds impressive in absolute terms, it represents an annual expansion in employment of just 0.9 <Col N="1366" /> per cent a year.  Thus, the jobs dividend yielded by economic growth remains disappointingly poor.</P>
    <P>He goes on to offer other figures which are truly frightening.  He says:</P>
    <P>The ESRI projects that in the five years to April 1996, net emigration will amount to almost 90,000 people.</P>
    <P>Thus, in the last two decades of the twentieth century, net emigration from Ireland, on present projections, will have amounted to almost half a million people.  During the years 1845-1851, when Famine stalked the land, emigration from Ireland has been estimated at roughly one million.</P>
    <P>He concludes his article by stating:</P>
    <P>The political consequences of a further 230,000 people drawing the dole are too terrible to contemplate.</P>
    <P>What comes out of all of this is very interesting, it is, that emigration, and not job creation, has reduced the unemployment volume and rate and that emigration when it eases in volume creates unemployment at home and, politically, that the returned emigrant whom I mentioned on the previous occasion becomes a political problem.</P>
    <P>If one wants to be positive about that scenario one has to follow on the logical consequences of such an analysis, which is the investment strategy.  You have to ask what have been the sources and investment strategies, factually and historically &mdash; let us not rely on rhetoric or ideological proclivity &mdash; which have actually created jobs in the recent history of Irish economy?  Let us rely on the facts as they have been published in journals and reports.  The answer comes very simply &mdash; from an atmosphere and climate, not necessarily the one which has been described in the Minister's speech and elsewhere, but the one in which the Government are in favour and facilitate investment through State action, semi-State action and credit policy.</P>
    <P>I want to make a point about the monetary side.  It has been more rewarding over the five years which have been described in the article from which I <Col N="1367" /> quoted to invest in either manipulation of currencies or equities than in a productive activity such as building a factory or creating employment.  The marginal return from investing in gross speculation always has been greater than that of the person who had some sense of patriotism &mdash; let us call it that and not be ashamed of the word &mdash; and invested in creating something for export and creating jobs for people living in the community we call Ireland.</P>
    <P>The ethos in this country shifted to adulation of the speculator rather than the productive investor who was seen as old fashioned.  Those who had made money speculatively on either currencies or equities received the admiration of the media and many other people took a voyeuristic interest not in how they had got their money but in how they were spending it.  Let me place on the record yet again that it was not I but rather the distinguished public servant in his day, Dr. Whitaker, who, in the seventies, drew attention to the fact that even the Irish Stock Market was changing in character with a speculative rather than a productive bias and that the drift in the economy was such that it would in the future facilitate what effectively amounted to gambling with money and equities.</P>
    <P>Some of the major figures on the Irish social scene today have come to their positions of personal wealth not by creating jobs in Irish society, by building something, developing a new product or capturing a niche in the international trading economy but rather by job destruction and acquiring companies, which were founded by people who had a better orientation towards the country and its people, asking others to become involved and by going, like a dose of salts, as asset strippers through one string of companies after another.  They are the people to whom conservative politicians turned when they were looking for people to put on boards, for advice or to head up companies owned by the State, by the people of Ireland.  It was said they created a kind of envy among people, people <Col N="1368" /> who were effectively traitors to the State philosophy on investment, who began to think that perhaps they too could be like this; if only they did not have a public obligation they too could be out in the market place on larger salaries having a share of the action.</P>
    <P>In bistros, restaurants and bars all around the city the language took off of the little people who wanted a bit of what the people and the community owned. This led to a philosophy of privatisation and flotation but not of what they owned, built, paid for or borrowed money for, but of what the public owned, the PAYE taxpayers who paid up to 87 per cent, in taxes, who put their taxes into creating assets which these people, these sharks, wanted to say would do better outside of the control of the State.  Like everything tatty and seedy from the worst pages of the British tabloids came the Irish version of Thatcherism, and like everything in Ireland a disease dies over a longer period and it is still infesting this country.</P>
    <P>We have the notion that if only the State were not involved in different enterprises things would automatically be better.  This begs the question: better for whom?  For some, certainly.  There will be an escape from the restrictions of the Devlin report for certain salaries, there would be an opportunity to participate in ownership of something they did not own before, but what would be in it for the families who are looking for employment creation?  I do not want to make an emotional speech about this, although I do not subscribe to the theory that if one believes in something strong enough one should be unemotional about it.</P>
    <P>Let us look at one of the semi-State bodies on the hit list which has been referred to already in the debate &mdash; Irish Life.  If we all suspend our views about whether the company should have been floated, the question which is important is, will the investment decision-making within Irish Life stay intact, interested in Irish projects which would create Irish jobs, or will they be the first rat off the ship before 1992 and fly from the country with their investments?  Is this but the first anticipatory yellow hint of cowardice <Col N="1369" /> before capital flight takes place elsewhere? Where are the examples which would prove me wrong?</P>
    <P>I have been watching Irish banking investment decisions for a very long time, for more than 20 years.  They change as Dr. Whitaker said &mdash; I do not want to misconstrue him because he spoke about the seventies and the position got worse in the eighties &mdash; but the Irish banks now gather deposits and charge people for the privilege of depositing their own money which is not very European, but they will learn about this in time.  Having gathered up such funds they, too, are invested abroad.  The question might reasonably be asked where have they, through their investments, created jobs in the Irish economy, and how many?  It is the nature of a society which is nominally democratic but not in reality as Ireland is that they would suggest that these decisions are nobody's business but their own. However, they are everybody's business.</P>
    <P>It is a very interesting feature of both annual reports, of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, that they report profits on their Irish operations and losses on their external operations.  I am sure that when a woman in Clifden or in Schull, who has a number of children whom she hopes sooner or later will be employed, passes the local branches of these banks she will like to know that the local people's money is being spent in America and elsewhere and she will feel a sense of satisfaction that a good, progressive, macho theory of banking is at work.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the other list of companies which are ready for the marketplace. I became a Member of this House in 1981 and Seanad Éireann in 1973.  I had a conversation then with the former distinguished Minister in this House and a former Member of both Houses, Dr. Noel Browne.  This was in 1973 when unemployment was approximately 67,000; we were debating whether it would reach 70,000.  In a moment of pure horrific fantasy he said, what would happen in Ireland if unemployment rose to 200,000?  The figure now stands in excess of 250,000, it is heading towards 300,000 and this trend is projected to <Col N="1370" /> continue.  We are so ignominious in economic performance that we are now saying it is a pity our emigrants are coming home and embarrassing us by putting the unemployment statistics up.</P>
    <P>Let me say something else which in time will be regarded as a forecast. Thatcherism is over, reliance on the marketplace is dead and this is producing slum economies in every country in Europe.  There is not a scintilla of evidence that in any of the great social purposes of economic planning, human, job creation, ecological, egalitarian, social, cultural, that the marketplace has ever solved a single major problem which involved the community of people.</P>
    <P>In the individual countries of Europe the marketplace has widened the gap in income, wealth, participation, education, housing and so on.  Behind it stands a philosophy which is socially destructive.  Faced with the fact that the franchise is distributed widely, there are even now signs that the philosophy is abandoned.  I have come to learn in over 20 years involvement in politics that it would be a useless exercise to defend statism. I will not say that centralised economies were successful, that they were without problems of bureaucracy, gross inefficiency, bad investment and ecological damage, but I note the penchant for that critique to get into scripts while at the same time people have an inability to realise the excesses of market economies.</P>
    <P>It was in that sense that I spoke last week of an intellectual capitulation in this country.  There is only so much the elected representative can do but in the community that is our country, there are historians, social scientists and economists. Where is the originality of thinking that would say something new in relation to forging the new way between at once a form of use of the market which would be a mechanism or an instrument of distribution, which it validly is, and at the same time protect the concept of social investment and of the distribution of income?  Instead of that, we get cheap copies of what has been Britain's last month's fashion.  I have seen senior figures <Col N="1371" /> from the absent party in the Library reading six months later the tired, jaded opinions of Mrs. Thatcher's think tank in Britain, the old policy institutes, tired old trash with its mixture of social destruction for the north of England, racism for London and madness.  I never thought the day would come when a 70 year old man, a former British Prime Minister, Ted Heath, would stand up and have the courage to say to Thatcherism what the copyists in Ireland who have applied her tactics here have not the courage to say.</P>
    <P>If there is to be an investment strategy it will return to there being a State responsibility for credit policy that will favour productive borrowing as opposed to speculative borrowing.  There has to be a restoration of faith in the semi-State bodies and an end to the thuggish destruction of their job creation activities.  Again and again in the House these conservative parties &mdash; and we are unfortunately benighted with so many of them &mdash; have been asked to capitalise the semi-State companies, let them be efficient, compete in the marketplace and create jobs. Rather like the peasant &mdash;&ldquo;We would not know anything about that, your honour&rdquo;, with the cap doffing and the forelock pulling &mdash; we have the suggestion that they could not do that if they were in public ownership.  &ldquo;They would need, Sir, to be privately owned, Sir, if they were to be efficient, Sir&rdquo;.  That is the mentality of the people who are sending 500,000 people onto the boat and exiling them before the end of the century.</P>
    <P>In investment strategy it is necessary to look across the heads of different areas where we could have innovative and creative thinking.  There is no absence of good ideas in practically any sector of the economy.  Who else but a kind of seedy set of successors of Legs Diamond's mob would be discussing the agriculture and food industry in the way we are?  In other countries they have identified food products that can be sold at high value added to consumers who can be assessed and researched.  They are placing their products on the shelves.  In Denmark, a small country comparable to ours, they have <Col N="1372" /> bought in patents and technology.  They are a net importer of food for re-export, capturing markets in all the traded food areas of the world.  Why can we not do that?  Is it because it was people in semi-State bodies like the Agricultural Institute who thought up the different products which are lined up on the shelves?</P>
    <P>When I came into this House there was a Minister who was much criticised for opinions which had nothing to do with what was called Posts and Telegraphs, Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien.  He signed an agreement to borrow £100 million to modernise the Irish telecommunications industry in the earlier part of the seventies. I hope all the people who have been paying for that loan since in their taxes will know that what they modernised and created as a modern entity with potential for future jobs is also up for sale.  It depends on who buys it.  We all know one potential purchaser who, curiously, at the same time he was nominal chairman of a semi-State body said he would put a price of £1 billion on it.  It so happened that this amount was available at the time from a certain rather interesting scam in the United States.  In whose interest would it be if Telecom were to develop alliances within Europe? If the State owns it and links with the French system, there will be jobs.  If the State does not own it and it is acquired by a private individual, where will the jobs be?  I put a moral question: have not the people who paid for that loan a right to express their opinion on a question like this?  This is the lack of nerve from the detritus of the peasantry who masquerade as independent politicians, some of them calling themselves Republicans. They do not have the nerve to believe in the concept of the social, the concept of Ireland, the concept of State and semi-State companies and their only contribution at the end of the 20th century, with 500,000 people set to go, is to say, &ldquo;Have we anything else left for sale, even if we do not own it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Across the different Estimates we find this mealy mouthed approach.  With regard to social welfare, the people still <Col N="1373" /> come to the same old buildings, never renovated or painted, just for the humiliation. In health, if you are a chronic case, literally bleeding on the road, you might be scraped off it, but then the concept of a public health service is an old fashioned socialist one.  God be with the days when in de Valera's time we sent to England for their false teeth and false limbs the predecessors of the 500,000 people now to go.</P>
    <P>The Minister who thinks he is God has a list of housing lists across the country, while he announces that there is something wrong about a working class person ever owning a three-bedroomed house again.  The way of the future is to stop public authority housing.  In the Rahoon flats in my city 85 per cent of the people derive their sole income from social welfare. Agriculture will be debated again.</P>
    <P>When we ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs a question, he no longer uses the phrase the &ldquo;Irish position is&rdquo; because that phrase is now passé.  When I, as an elected representative chosen by my party to be the spokesperson on foreign affairs ask him a question on the Irish Government's position on an aspect of foreign affairs, he stands up like a parrot and says, &ldquo;The position of the Twelve is ...&rdquo;.  I introduced the idea of the theology earlier: Ireland is the Twelve, the Twelve is Ireland, in the beginning there was Ireland, there is the Twelve.  What nonsense.</P>
    <P>The man who is under the delusion that he is Napoleon thinks that this House cannot have a foreign affairs committee. How Irish is that?  We are the only people in Europe who would not be up to it; we could not manage too many committees, and would it not bring too much decision making into this old-fashioned Parliament? That seems to be the thinking of the day.  God be with the late John Kelly who, when he heard that Chancellor Kohl, and President Mitterand and others were waiting for our visits to decide what to do said once: &ldquo;And what did they say when you gave them the advice?&rdquo; Talk about delusions of grandeur. We do not want that, we want <Col N="1374" /> something more simple and democratic, accountability.  I will vote against these Estimates for Foreign Affairs because of our failure on Overseas Development Aid, the failure to establish a foreign affairs committee and all the mismash I got in reply to my foreign affairs questions.</P>
    <P>What happened in the area of communications was a farce.  We had an attack on public broadcasting to facilitate a few pets who could not perform in the open air and came crawling back for assistance.  The poor dears were asked would they like something to help them on their way.  This rugged new frontier breed who are going to replace the people who built up organisations that had an international reputation.</P>

I speak for the Labour Party also on the Irish language and I usually speak in Irish.  However I will use one minute to deliver my message in English lest it gets lost.  Everything I said about the decimation of the economy and society could be multiplied for the Gaeltacht.  In the past year we have had divisiveness; an attempt has been made to set those who use the Irish language against those who live in the Gaeltacht and there has been a failure to establish Teilifís na Gaeltachta &mdash; yet another broken promise.  Teilifís Gaeltachta was promised in the Minister of State's county by no less a person than the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey.  It has not happened and the indications are that it will not happen.  We wasted years in this House asking when Teilifís na Gaeltachta would be established.  The answer was dribbled out in half truths, that some version of Teilifís Gaeilge would be provided, and good people who changed their names and the rest of it will know the difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Without a shade of doubt this has been one of the most bizarre economic debates in the history of Dáil Éireann.  Deputy Bruton and his party, having lectured the Dáil continuously for ten days on the fulfilment of the Dáil's constitutional responsibilities then went on to abdicate that primary responsibility of any parliamentarian by deciding to abstain from this debate and he left the task of Opposition to the Labour Party and to The Workers' Party.  While I would not agree with their arguments, it has to be said to their credit that they stayed here to fight the battle and put their points of view on record.  They queried the policies of the Government and castigated them when they felt it was necessary.  That is the role of the Opposition. For the major Opposition party to I sulk in a dark corner is not parliamentary behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton was quite correct when he said that the Dáil only vicariously fulfils its constitutional responsibility in a whole series of areas, not least in the area of public finance.  On another occasion it would be a good thing to debate the type of committee structure that he suggests and how Deputies who have to run in multi-seat constituencies with the vagaries of proportional representation would manage to take themselves away from constituency tasks to fulfil their responsibilities as committee members.  No doubt it would be interesting to debate this with him, but because we would not capitulate to Deputy Bruton's view of the future that he should take the major Opposition <Col N="1376" /> party out of the Dáil is a scandalous parliamentary tactic.  I understand fully the comment made by one of his own backbenchers who referred to &ldquo;bungalow Bruton&rdquo; as he led his party members out of this House.</P>
    <P>Abstentionism is not a particularly new policy nor is it particularly creative. Storming out of this House in a huff is a poor substitute for standing your ground and submitting your policy options for consideration.  While I would be critical of some of the contributions made by members of the Labour Party and The Workers' Party I admire the fact that they stood here and took all the time available in this debate to put their views on the record.  The Left, as exemplified by both Labour and The Workers' Party made contributions which to my mind were characteristically long in analysis and rather short on solutions.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins, a man for whom I have a warm personal regard and a long friendship, was interesting, indeed absorbing in an academic sense but in reality he did not take use very far.  Climatological economic, to use his own phrase, received a scathing dismissal from him.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time that Deputy Higgins has dismissed the view that getting the climate right for job creation and investment was less than important.  In fact I would go a long way with his analysis, that it is not sufficient just to get the climate right, but that one has also to put in the spurs that will bring the leaders of industry to fulfil their part of the obligation. I sometimes wonder whether Deputy Higgins ever engages his not inconsiderable intellect before he throws his rhetorical powers into overdrive. Does he suggest that getting the climate wrong would create jobs?  Would he dismiss the importance of stabilising wages and salaries and getting the public finances under control?  Is the Exchequer borrowing requirement to be regarded henceforth as irrelevant?  Does Deputy Higgins consider that the money supply is no longer relevant or that the tedious <Col N="1377" /> statistics of the balance of trade, the balance of payments and all the other balances can be dismissed?  Do the Labour Party dismiss the importance of interest rates?</P>
    <P>If they regard all these climatological I indicators as irrelevant what do they deem to be important?  It was suggested the last day at the end of an absolutely absorbing contribution that we should rekindle the debate on political economics. I rushed back to be here tonight to hear that debate being rekindled but I have not heard it.  I heard the analysis, I heard the restatement of the problem, and I would not disagree with much of what has been said in that regard but I did not hear the solution.  As Deputy Higgins' indignation grew the last day he sought first to dismiss climatology, next he dismissed what he referred to as being the Doheny and Nesbitt school of economics. To my mind he should not confuse the tedium of the unreconstructed monetarists that sometimes hang out in that other fine institution and dismiss the institution itself, but having dismissed monetarism, Thatcherism, Friedmanites and all the other &ldquo;ites&rdquo; that march along in those serried ranks, he went on, surprisingly to my mind, to dismiss Keynes as well.  As his blood pressure rose and his voice soared to Pavarotti proportions, he argued, that attempts in the late seventies to create jobs by depending on the &ldquo;time worn policies&rdquo; of Keynes had failed too.  After a spectacular performance we know what Deputy Higgins and presumably the Labour Party are against. Unfortunately, having dismissed everything from the classical economists right down to the various types of reconstructed and nonreconstructed Thatcherites, monetarists, Friedmanites and even the odd Keynesianist who is still left, we do not know what they stand for.  They reject all pre-existing economic theories.  More surprisingly, they reject also the Keynesian view that Government should try to expand an economy which is slowing down, to bolster employment and encourage some economic reflation, because if you reject all Keynes stood for and more precisely if you reject <Col N="1378" /> as fundamentally wrong things done in this State in the late seventies, that is what you reject.  They believe a resolution of our economic woes is to be found in some mythical way by rekindling the debate on the essence of economic policy, of political economy.</P>
    <P>I doubt that many of the quarter of a million unemployed and many of the hard pressed taxpayers of this State share Deputy Higgins' touching faith in the power of rhetoric or the mystical and even magical capacity of a return to a debate on the meaning of political economics. Unfortunately, economics and reality are different from the rhetoric we heard here.  Academic idosyncrasy is one thing but naked cynicism is another thing altogether.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte, contributing from The Workers' Party benches, deplored what he saw as a lack of specifics on job creation.  I would go along with him in this debate because I believe the issue of No. 1 national importance at this time is job creation.  I would go along with any Deputy who comes in here and shows an impatience with the lack of specifics in this area, but he went on to deplore what he described as the use by successive Governments made up of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour of emigration as an instrument of economic policy.  Deputy Michael Higgins, who chose to ignore the comments of the Minister for Labour on the last day on this very welcome trend that our young men and young women are returning home, made a somewhat similar point but I accept he was coming at it from a different viewpoint.  Given the activities of The Workers' Party over the past 15 years in their various disguises, Deputy Rabbitte illustrates, to me at least, that he has a cast iron neck to come in here and talk of job creation.  No party in the history of this State has done more to wilfully destroy jobs than The Workers' Party.  I say that in a measured way.  They have wilfully set out to destroy jobs in industries that are running and to subvert job creation elsewhere and I will give some specifics.  Their alliance with armed thugs, which they say ended ten or 12 years ago, did nothing to help Ireland's <Col N="1379" /> industry or create a confident economy in which jobs could flourish.  Their continued connections with people who operate beyond the pale of the law in Northern Ireland does nothing to assist this nation's financial wellbeing, the creation of jobs for Irish people, North or South of that sorry Border or to create peace and reconciliation in this island.</P>
    <P>At yet another more specific level the Workers' Party subversion has been destructive of jobs.  I said previously, and I am pleased to say now, that for many years the labour movement in this country and the Labour Party had a very close connection.  The Labour movement, trade unionists and the Fianna Fáil Party have a very close connection.  At no stage in the history of the Labour Party and certainly at no stage in the history of Fianna Fáil was there ever an attempt to subvert the traditional labour movement and use it in a way which is inherently destructive of the interests not just of working class people but of all the people.  However, we are all too familiar with industrial disputes which have become politicised and more intractable because of their politicisation as a result of the malignant involvement of The Workers' Party. Then their spokesman comes in here and castigates us, not just for mistakes, which is his right, but questions our whole contribution for the life of this nation and our whole interest in creating jobs and creating wellbeing for the people of this nation.  He not only casts doubts on our bona fides in this matter but he questions the bona fides of other parties with whom I might disagree from time to time but whose bona fides I would never question.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of his contribution Deputy Rabbitte promised to examine some possible solutions.  He failed abysmally to do so.  His party have no solutions. They are not interested in solutions.  Problems are more the stuff their politics are made of.  He criticised the Minister for not being specific on job creation, although the Minister indicated in his speech the intricate relationship between economic issues he wished to handle and the whole jobs crisis.  To his <Col N="1380" /> credit the Minister recognised we have a job crisis, an employment crisis, and it has to go to the top of the priority listing, yet, having pounded us all about the ears, Deputy Rabbitte, and The Workers' Party had nothing to say on job creation.  They talked about cutbacks which have not been announced as if they had occurred and suggested that all these and all our other woes could be resolved by collecting what he described as the best part of £2,000 million in taxes which he, Deputy Rabbitte, suggested have been assessed and uncollected.  Deputy Rabbitte knows as well as I and every other Member of Dáil Éireann know, that there is no £2,000 million of £3,000 million of uncollected taxes out there.  There is not jackpot of revenue on which we can fall back on this occasion.  To my mind it is a sign of political desperation when the elusive, non-existing crock of gold is seen as the sole solution to all our problems. Wherever else we can expect help in our moment of trial we cannot expect leprechauns to come up with the money to get us out of our present predicament.</P>
    <P>In his contribution the Minister sought to put the current problems with the national finances into perspective, and I think he is right to do so.  There is little to be gained from panic, less from fatuous policies and nothing at all from political rhetoric.</P>
    <P>Over the last few weeks Fine Gael voiced the opinion that the 1991 budget had been fraudulently cast, that the Estimates on which the budget was based were at a minimum defective and in fact fundamentally unsound.  This is a very serious charge and when it was made by a serious Opposition party it should be substantiated because it impugns not just the integrity of the Minister but the integrity of the much maligned officials in the Department of Finance and in a whole variety or other State agencies.  In so far as there is any proof to substantiate those charges this is the place where that proof should be laid.  Fine Gael who are away sulking, are not here to support their views, which is a great pity because I believe their views are unsupportable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> There has, of course, been serious slippage &mdash; a word which I do not like &mdash; in the 1991 budget figures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy can come up with an alternative word I will accept it, but the Deputy will accept it is a piece of rhetoric or jargon which has slipped into everyday use.  There have been serious problems with the 1991 budget figures, and the explanations put forward by the Minister seem to be tenable explanations. The over-run on social welfare of £66 million is due to the growth in the number of people signing on.  This arises primarily from the fact that foreign job markets are in recession and that our people are coming home.  We should celebrate their home-coming &mdash; this is the point Deputy Higgins was making.  These people are not a problem and they should never be perceived as such.  The one wealth we have in this nation is our people.  If there is a cost to be borne by their returning home, this nation, if it is worth anything, should be happy to bear that cost.  Whatever the cost, when people who were forced to emigrate from these shores come back, we should rejoice.</P>
      <P>The over-runs on Exchequer returns could certainly cause us concern but they should not lead to panic.  Revenue for the first half of the year is slow, and we all accept that, but there is nothing novel about that.  One slow-down which concerns me, and which Ministers should address, is the slow-down to a trickle of European Social Fund moneys.  In addition to disrupting the budgetary figures, the slow-down in ESF funding is causing very real problems for some of our voluntary organisations who are increasingly dependent for their existence on such funds.  A person from Fine Gael referred today to our dependence on such funds as being a begging bowl mentality, but that is not the case.  It is part and parcel of the Europe the Irish people entered in 1973; part and parcel of the policy of creating a Europe that will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> I welcome the undertaking given last night by the Minister for Labour in this matter.  I hope he, and his fellow Ministers, will press the European Commission for some rationality in this matter.  It is wrong that moneys which are due to voluntary organisations and health boards are not forthcoming.  It is very wrong that health boards and voluntary organisations have to boost overdrafts and increase their running costs because funds to which they are entitled have not been paid over.</P>
    <P>Critics of the budget choose, consciously no doubt, to ignore other realities. One reality they choose to overlook was the Gulf War and its impact on the world economy.  I do not say this as a carping excuse, but it is a reality and something which those who criticise the Minister, and his officials, should bear in havoc with world markets.  It has certainly deepened and lengthened the recession in nations which are our trading partners and, naturally, we will suffer from that.</P>
    <P>Another fact the critics have failed to acknowledge is that the over-run which we now face is by no means unprecedented. We have had over-runs before, some when Government critics were in positions of power and about which they did nothing, but the sky did not fall in. We have been able to tolerate over-runs before and, provided this is a temporary over-run and we keep our wits about us, we will weather this over-run too. However, we must not be panicked into doing certain things.  We should be very wary about applying the cleaver of public expenditure cuts to public policies which have already been pared back to the bone.  I say that because I am conscious that in the next few days and perhaps the next few weeks, discussions will take place and some people will find it politically more acceptable to suggest we should have cutbacks rather than move away from some well-favoured political objectives of theirs.</P>

      <P>I certainly will not listen to them.  It is predictable that some industrial pundits should propose, as was done last weekend, that there should be further cuts in public services.  Ministers should be cautious about accepting such advice, whether it comes from political advisers, new political allies or industrialists.  The people putting forward this proposition should at least have the decency to publicly identify those services which they suggest should be cut.  It is all too easy to propose further belt-tightening in the abstract while retaining the right to enter into special pleas for one's special area of activity, and we should not go down that road.  That is not to say that any areas of public service activity should be regarded as sacrosanct.  Clearly now more than on any other occasion Ministers must ensure that we get a pound's worth of value squeezed from every pound spent, but we should also ensure that the weak and the powerless in society do not carry the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a second temptation to which we should not succumb, the suggestion that is going the rounds that selling off State companies could and should be used to overcome current difficulties.  I do not take the same view as Deputy Michael D. Higgins about the privatisation of State enterprises.  Some of our State enterprises have grown within the all-encompassing cloak of the State to a point where they could quite readily, and without fear, be sold and be expected to do well.  I am glad, for example, that in the sale of Irish Life the Minister has retained the golden share option.  I share the fear of some people that investment decisions would increasingly be relocated elsewhere, and that could have the flight of the central activities of the company to another location.  However, in so far as the Minister has retained options, those fears can be allayed.  Capital funds released from the sale of State bodies or any other asset should be used for the creation of new State-owned assets. Whether they should be invested in schools, hospitals, roads or infrastructure I do not know, but they should be used <Col N="1384" /> in that way, or preferably, to lower the national debt.</P>
    <P>Ireland has never adopted an ideological stance towards our State enterprises, and we should not start doing so now.  It is interesting if we look back at the debates that took place in Dáil Éireann in the late twenties at the time of the foundation of the State enterprises we are now talking about, particularly the ACC and ICC, we will see that the privatisation of those companies, purely on pragmatic and certainly not on ideological grounds, was envisaged.  The ICC and ACC were created solely because the Irish banks had behaved in a selfish way then, as they do now, had behaved rather oddly as regards making loans available to Irish farmers and Irish industry.  It was felt when those companies were set-up that with the passage of time they would mature, be sold off and become private banks.  Therefore there is nothing revolutionary in what is happening with regard to our State-sponsored bodies.  I would, of course, be more than a little concerned if they were sold off right, left and centre for entirely current purposes.</P>
    <P>Another policy area in which much has been achieved, an area in which we should take a note of caution, is the area of taxation reform.  Again there are some people of political mien who do not hold office in this House who have been arguing vociferously for the last two years about the need to rush into the same sort of taxation policies as the conservative Government did in Britain a few short years ago.</P>
    <P>The improvements which have been made in personal taxation are welcome and we should continue to make every effort to ensure that PAYE payers get the tax equity to which they are entitled. However, I urge Ministers to look closer at the contention that taxation cuts across the board, to all levels in society, will automatically in some unspecified way, lead to economic improvements and more jobs.</P>
    <P>Taxation improvements introduced in the last four years have been worth of the order of £800 million.  If there was an automatic linkage between taxation <Col N="1385" /> improvements and job creation we should expect to have seen an upturn in jobs at this stage.  This line was argued very consistently for some time, predominantly in debates conducted outside this House.  Before we accept the line of argument it needs to be cautiously reviewed.  The experience in the United Kingdom bears close examination. Improvements in personal taxation certainly did not improve the employment situation there.  I would be <i>ad idem</i> with Deputy Higgins on the point about simply creating the climate and hoping that the jobs would flow; a more coercive role has to be played by the State.</P>
    <P>Improvements in the United Kingdom in personal taxation led to regressive transfers of wealth, boosted short term consumer expenditure and resulted in an economic mess&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>And increased it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it did not create jobs.  It created unemployment and increased the series of economic problems. Ministers will, in the next weeks and months, have to review, as happens with every government in their mid-term economic policies.  The expressed view of the Minister for Finance that we move in a steady paced way along this policy option is a very wise policy.  The Minister for Finance said in his contribution that we have a major unemployment problem and this has moved to being our number one national priority.  For some years the number one priority was control of the public finances.  When a measure of control was achieved, tax reform, rightly, became a priority and tax equity for the PAYE payer remains a priority, particularly tax equity for the low paid.  It is very wrong that, even with the changes we have had, people are dragged into the higher rates of tax at a very low level of income.  However, the creation of sustainable jobs must now be the number one national priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has said, and I endorse his sentiments, that we must intensify the employment content of growth and the speed of growth but we <Col N="1386" /> must disentangle ourselves from the notion that the jobs will automatically come.  I am not happy that existing policies are achieving the level of growth in jobs that they should.  Irish industry, and in particular major Irish enterprises, have been particularly selfish in this regard. The benefits of the <i> Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; and there were very real benefits &mdash; and the new PESP have been accepted by Irish employers but they have not delivered on their side of the bargain &mdash; the jobs have not come.</P>
    <P>If workers are expected to curb their wage ambitions, more security for existing job holders and more jobs must be delivered.  Workers, and their unions, have a role to play.  The race to redundancy which has been a feature of Irish life needs to be re-examined.  All too often jobs which have cost the taxpayers of this country thousands of pounds, even tens of thousands of pounds to create have been sold away for a couple of hundred pounds or a couple of thousands of pounds.  That cycle must be examined and broken.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of public policy which needs examination is the linkage between job creation, economic growth and the growing, and welcome, environmental awareness.  Inevitably there is an environmental cost in any development.  When one puts a spade into a green field and turns the sod for the foundation one does damage to the environment.  This environmental cost is a factor which is not being addressed or even identified at present.  The failure to address the relationship between environmental cost and job creation is something which those of us who represent County Wicklow have become painfully aware of recently. Our job creation policies, and the growing environmental awareness of the people, are not in sychronisation.  At present, the job creation agencies are not taking the people into their confidence and the result is that there are clashes between the people's conscious awareness of the value of our environment and the need to create jobs.</P>
    <P>In County Wicklow a major Irish conglomerate made funds available to a <Col N="1387" /> small Irish manufacturing company and they proposed a very revolutionary project whereby they would buy-out a Japanese production facility and move it to the village of Kilcoole.  The people of Kilcoole were kept in the dark and rumours began to abound and circulate. Some people in political circles sought to make political capital with the local elections coming up by adding to those rumours.  Ordinary decent men and women were told that a major chemical manufacturing plant was being moved secretly into their village.  There was no communication between the people of the village and the State agencies.  As far back as October 1989 I contacted the senior personnel in our county council and senior personnel in the IDA and said: &ldquo;for goodness sake, bring the people into your confidence&rdquo;.  There was no effort to bring the people into anybody's confidence until July 1990 and at that stage such a level of distrust had been created that the project became untenable.</P>
    <P>There will be other occasions when we will discuss industrial policy and I will deal with this in more detail.  This case, and similar cases, illustrate the absolute necessity when the IDA and county development teams become aware of a project as a valuable project that they must take the people into account.  It was wrong in that case that people who were concerned not just about their environment but about the health and wellbeing of their families were subsequently castigated by State agencies as being obstructionist.  It was not the people who were obstructionist but rather those who refused to take the people into their confidence.</P>
    <P>The problems the budget has run into are very real.  They arise in large part because of world circumstances which are beyond our control but they arise also because of factors which are within our control.  The fact that our people are returining to these shores in their tens of thousands is not a problem; it is a privilege and an opportunity.  What we need is a community effort not just within the community of people that form the <Col N="1388" /> nation but among the people who form the political opinion in this State.  We may differ on certain points of principle but we should be at one on the importance of creating an environment in which jobs can grow and develop.</P>
    <P>The debate has necessarily been heated over the last few days.  It is a great pity the major Opposition party have absented themselves from the debate which is ongoing.  By so doing they have also abdicated their responsibility to participate with the other members of the political community in struggling towards a solution to the massive problems which face this nation.</P>
    <P>The economic, financial and social problems which face Ireland with slightly in excess of 250,000 unemployed are so great that no politician, worthy of the name, has the right to absent himself or herself from the search for a solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that in a debate on the Estimates the Labour Party should state their position which would indicate to the Ministers and the Government that we are generally dissatisfied with the Estimates as presented to us, their inadequacy and the problems which will be created, unless the Government are prepared to meet their responsibility. This means having priorities which would give to the people whom we represent a measure of service in the areas of health, social welfare, job creation or any other economic service on which the people whom we represent are totally dependent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past few weeks there have been statements in the media purporting to come from reliable sources in Government that the Cabinet are meeting in crisis with a view to curtailment of public expenditure, postponement of promises made to people involved in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, to go back on promises made to people in agriculture and to consultant surgeons in the health service.  They are a very special group on whom people are totally dependent because of the very heavy responsibility they bear.  Today I spoke to consultant surgeons throughout <Col N="1389" /> the country who said emphatically that if the Government are prepared to break their word on guarantees and agreements entered into, some of the consultants are prepared to work to rule.  This is not industrial action but it reflects the frustration of specialised people in the community who are totally dependent on the goodwill of the Government regarding agreements.  The Government dramatically changed the terms of reference of their common contract and their contracts for service in public hospitals.</P>
    <P>In this House we debated the new Government proposals which would offer people, irrespective of their income, the right to have consultant services and beds in public hospitals.  The Minister for Health gave a solemn assurance to this House that there would be no change in the number of public beds available to public patients throughout the country. Since the legislation was passed, all the health boards, without exception, have sent their programme managers and officials into public hospitals with measuring tapes, note books and pencils to determine which corner of a hospital they could designate for private beds so that the income from the VHI and other private sources to health board administrations and hospitals would be protected. That is not in accordance with the wishes expressed in this House.  The beds closed by the Government and the Minister, which were lying idle, were brought into service and redesignated as private beds.  I did not have a problem, ideological or otherwise, regarding the programme the Minister announced, on the basis that these beds were lost to the public service anyway.  I was assured by the Minister that the numbers of public beds would not be interfered with but I am not satisfied that the number of public beds has been left intact.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for the Department of Social Welfare do not reflect reality or the real figures of unemployed people actively seeking work.  They are not reflected in the numbers of people who have legitimately claimed unemployment benefit but who have been refused their <Col N="1390" /> entitlement by social welfare officers who are now a law unto themselves.  They demonstrate their independence to our constituents by saying that it is irrelevant whether a person goes to a local TD or other public representative because the social welfare officers will make the final decision.  Many of those decisions are subject to critical analysis and review by the Ombudsman in certain instances but it is an indication of the instructions by the Government to all their officers to make it almost impossible for people with legitimate claims in the area of social welfare to benefit when, in spite of their best efforts, they are unable to get gainful employment or survive in the community. Children have been forced to leave their parents' homes because the Government have determined, through the social welfare officers and means testing, that people will be assessed with means because they are living at home.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Labour have problems in relation to people leaving school &mdash; who are legally adults &mdash; claiming unemployment assistance to tide them over the period when they will be endeavouring to get jobs or during the time in which they prepared to emigrate.  The Government have made it almost impossible for some of those people to get their rights.  If that is what the Estimates for the Department of Social Welfare mean, it creates a problem for legitimate claimants. Nobody in Opposition advocates that people who are not entitled to compensation for being out of work should receive it; nobody on this side of the House has ever advocated that people who do &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; or operate in the black economy should be looked after.  The State, with its constraints on public expenditure, could not tolerate a system where people would be signing on and working at the same time.  However, I am concerned at the attitude of Government to legitimate claimants under this system.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow we will have the opportunity of debating the Estimates for Agriculture and Commissioner MacSharry's proposals in the review of the Common <Col N="1391" /> Agricultural Policy and the GATT negotiations. The reviews will ensure that the levels of unemployment will escalate to figures beyond our wildest fears because compensation for farmers to cease production in whatever percentage is necessary will not compensate for the loss of jobs which will ensue from a lack of production in the processing, food and milk industries.  Losses of jobs will inevitably follows if Commissioner MacSharry's proposals are accepted.  As I said, tomorrow is a day when we can debate that matter at length, a day when the farming community &mdash; the &ldquo;culchies&rdquo; as the &ldquo;Dubs&rdquo; would call them &mdash; come to town to listen to what their parliamentary representatives have to say about their future in rural Ireland and whether they will be able to survive there.</P>
    <P>As the Labour Party's spokesman on Health, I am particularly worried about that Estimate.  Notice of the Government's present discussions has already appeared in the newspapers on a daily basis but today, for instance, it has been leaked that the Government are concerned about overspending and an over-run in the General Medical Service. Many people avail of that service because they have small incomes, they live in poverty and caught in the poverty trap. They are eligible for the service and come within the guidelines laid down by the Minister and health boards.</P>
    <P>Members of the Labour Party in the House, including myself, are concerned about the services that will be available to those people who are legitimately entitled to these services under the 1970 Health Act.  I say to you, Sir, and to the Ministers present that if there is further diminution of the services available to people on the medical card list the Labour Party will oppose tooth and nail every Government proposal to curtail those services.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about the pace of Cabinet discussions.  When the Dáil is in recess &mdash; early and much disputed as the date for the recess might be &mdash; the Government will have the freedom of the news media and the airwaves to decide <Col N="1392" /> without recourse to the House what they intend to do in health, education, social welfare and all other strategic areas of economic development.  We are extremely concerned that people who had benefited in the past and who are eligible within the guidelines laid down could find that they are unable to receive their legal entitlement.  That the Labour Party will oppose vehemently.</P>
    <P>It is known that the Government entered into negotiation with the general practitioners, a profession for which all of us have a special regard.  The medical profession was not satisfied with the previous fee for item basis of recompense. In negotiations between the Department and general practitioners and in the agreement reached a certain level of compensation was agreed for members of the medical profession.  Irrespective of whether they attended the people we represent, they were given a certain level of compensation.  As democrats, trade unionists and members of the Labour Party, we accept the concept of free negotiation and agreement.  But now it is found that the Department's negotiators completely under-estimated the cost to the State of that particular system.  Figures recently released by the payments board for the General Medical Service show an overrun on the Estimates of some 5 per cent to 6 per cent, going into millions of pounds.  That could cause a diminution of the services provided medical cards holders.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned about the doctors, they can negotiate, debate and argue their rights of payment &mdash; and I shall uphold whatever rights they have achieved &mdash; but I shall not allow the Department, in the process of fiscal rectitude, to decide that because the agreement reached with the general practitioners cost more than was estimated that should result in a reduction in the services to the people we represent who are legally entitled to them.  I do not want there to be another list of medical card prescriptions that are no longer covered under GMS; I do not want a different rate of payment for those in the drugs refund scheme; I do not want another reduction &mdash; indeed, <Col N="1393" /> I would look for an additional declaration &mdash; in the illness defined as long term illnesses.  Help for people suffering from long term illnesses is a worthy cause and admittedly, it does cost money.  If the Government do not respond to the challenge given them in 1989 and are unable to decide what their priorities should be, people in certain categories must be protected at all costs, irrespective of fiscal rectitude, I feel they may have deserted those who supported them.</P>
    <P>In the most recent local elections unemployment was highlighted and discussed with all of us on the doorsteps. Likewise, health services were also analysed critically by the electorate. Your own area, Sir, was an exception, but the electorate reflected their dissatisfaction with the level of Government spending and the Government's priorities on health administration and delivery of health services.</P>
    <P>Until 1987 people throughout the country who had medical cards were entitled to free hospitalisation and free transport to clinics.  On the excuse that the system was being abused &mdash; abused by whom we do not know, certainly it was not by those who qualified &mdash; in 1987 all systems of transport within most health board areas was curtailed or abolished. That meant that people in rural Ireland who live 35 or 40 miles from a hospital or clinic were left to find their own way &mdash; to walk, cycle or taxi at their own expense &mdash; to the point of delivery of the service to which they were entitled. That is a disgrace and that practice continues to this day, 9 July 1991.  People in genuine need of hospitalisation and outpatients' attention have to pay £35 or £40 on taxi fares to reach their nearest acute, general or county hospital.  My own constituency provides an example.  People from areas such as Emly, Cullen, Lattin and Bansha &mdash; places 15, 20 and 30 miles from the nearest hospital in Clonmel or Cashel &mdash; will be left at home by the Government unless they can afford a round trip in a taxi, costing about £35.  I admit that the expenses in travelling to a hospital outside a region are covered, but that is poor consolation for those who <Col N="1394" /> need to visit their general practitioner, local hospital or local consultant for the medical and clinical tests to which they are entitled.  Those are some of the anomalies arising from the cutbacks that have taken place, and I say this evening that the Labour Party will not stand for further cutbacks particularly in health.</P>
    <P>I know that Cabinet have monetary problems; I know that they have problems trying to balance the books but those same Deputies were not generous in their attitude when other Governments faced the same dilemma and I hope they do not expect <i>carte blanche</i> approval just because they now have financial problems. In the past months Ministers were prepared to spend any amount of money for certain occasions and for certain provisions of a personal, business or official nature for Government members from the Taoiseach down.  There was no problem about the expenditure of public money when it came to those measures, but when it comes to the delivery of services specifically related to areas of crisis &mdash; to issues that affect the poor, the sick, the underprivileged and the handicapped &mdash; the Government have been very quick to leak information that there are problems and that the Government, in Cabinet would have to consider what might be done about them.</P>
    <P>Every other day there are leaks that the Department of Health have a problem or that the Department of Education have a problem. However, this Government were quick to say not many months ago that things were looking up, that the country was booming and blooming and that there was a 3.5 per cent improvement in the economy.  They entered into all sorts of agreements with the trade union movement that if they were responsible in the area of wage increases the country would survive and continue to grow.  We made comparisons with all our EC neighbours.  We made comparisons internationally.  We listened to a certain amount of euphoria that was coming from the Government benches and we allowed them an opportunity to follow through and prove that to the <Col N="1395" /> electorate.  The reality is, unfortunately, that now they are sounding the warnings which will allow them, when we are gone from this House, to announce various Cabinet decisions which will not be accountable to this House which we will be unable to critically analyse or condemn, and we will be unable to debate what this Government might decide.</P>
    <P>The budget figures announced by the Minister and approved by a vote in the House are the figures that we all believed in, the figures that were presented to the public in the area of taxation and tax changes which indicated that the benefits from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in the areas of social welfare and health would automatically follow because of the decisions of this Government and this Parliament.  That is an important distinction because a Government can make decisions but we know from experience that when the vested interests get down to debating with the Government many changes follow.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government once more outshine themselves in their totally cynical and contemptible attitude towards the public it serves.  Inappropriate decisions by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, not to introduce a list of spending cuts in response to an overrun of some £200 million in the budget until after the Dáil goes into recess illustrate the cynical style of politics that is prevalent in this current Coalition Government.  Now that the local elections are out of the way, the Minister for Finance is about to introduce a whole series of cutbacks.  I have warned him about some of them and I will elaborate futher.</P>
    <P>These cutbacks will, at the very least, place a serious question over the already threatened health services in respect of which I am spokesman for the Labour Party.  If the Government decide to pursue a policy of cutbacks in the health services their memory will have to be refreshed.  In response to the overwhelming rejection by the people of the health cuts in the 1989 general <Col N="1396" /> election the Government were forced to take certain measures.  Up to them, of course, the Taoiseach admitted that he was not aware that the crisis in the health services was so bad.  His own forces in the previous 1987 election spoke about how important and serious health cuts were for the old, the sick, the handicapped and the poor.  In 1989 when this became an issue on the doorsteps late into the campaign the Taoiseach admitted that he had not realised that things were so bad.  In response to the overwhelming rejection by the people of the health cuts in 1989 the Government were forced to take measures.  These measures included the restoration of the casualty service in the Dublin hospitals from just one hospital operating in North Dublin and one in South Dublin to six hospitals and 150 additional nursing staff to man the extra but urgently required casualty service.  Before that there was no problem. Then suddenly as a result of the election these were the steps that had to be taken.  Otherwise this new Government would have been routed from office.</P>
    <P>In addition 500 positions were promised arising out of the introduction of the 39 hour week which was also agreed by the trade union movement which hospitals found very difficult to operate without bringing forward additional posts in the health services.  However the reality is that the cumulative effect has been the removal of approximately 5,000 beds from the hospital system which illustrates the very real crisis in all the non-acute hospital admissions.  There are still beds in hospital corridors in spite of promises to the contrary.  The Government have promised to take action in areas like Kilkenny.  Now there is a warning from the Minister that all capital programmes might have to be postponed, curtailed or deferred.  Does this include the much vaunted and publicised improvement in St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny?</P>
    <P>In regard to the Tallaght hospital, I was the first to itemise the problems of that project in this House.  I will spell out the problems in that area as Deputy <Col N="1397" /> Rabbitte and Deputy Taylor have done. There are still hospital beds in corridors in many hospitals.  One has only to walk the corridors of these hospitals to see the insult that is offered to patients by way of a health service or a hospital service. It is not good enough.  The Government have made a promise and I am anxious to know if this promise will be honoured particularly in view of the Health Estimate in the capital programme.</P>
    <P>The waiting lists for hip replacements and heart surgery for public patients has spiralled even further.  We on the Opposition benches have been trying to bring it to the attention of the Minister and the Government that some of these waiting lists are totally unacceptable.  We accept that there will always be some measure of waiting lists for some of these medical interventions but it is not acceptable that the list should extend over a number of years when people are in agony, out of work and unable to participate in a normal life.  In various debates we have consistently identified in a constructive way some of the problems that have arisen in the areas of the health service.</P>
    <P>The criteria in determining priority for a whole range of operations is still related to the availability of finance.  Priority is not based on clinical diagnosis.  We pointed out, on other legislation, to the Minister for Health that if somebody has money to go to a private consultant for an opinion as to the need for hospitalisation or surgery, that person's chances of being admitted to a public bed in a public hospital are improved.  This was refuted by the Minister although we went so far as to name people so that the Minister could verify the cases.</P>
    <P>With the health services already critically depleted how can the Government attempt further cutbacks without disastrous consequences for the people?  I admire the Minister as a person who is professionally committed in his area but I know he must live within the constraints placed on him by the Cabinet and the Minister for Finance.  I am asking the Minister to give a commitment not to resort to using redundancy packages as a means of cutting health board budgets. <Col N="1398" /> This procedure was used most effectively from the Minister's point of view, from 1987 to 1989 when up to 5,000 health workers were coaxed to leave the health service with attractive redundancy packages. This has left vacancies in strategic areas in the health service.  I want the Minister to give a commitment that he will not force hospitals to resort to further bed and ward closures.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that it is normal for hospitals to close wards in the summer. It has not been the norm.  People get sick in the summer and have accidents in the summer.  Until this year in my constituency and in many other constituencies, whatever about the Minister's constituency, hospital wards have not been closed in the summer.  In spite of the decision forced on health boards by the budget I hope the Minister will not make them resort to further ward closures.  The Minister should resist any attempt by the Department of Finance to further reduce community health services which have already suffered under the Government.  We need an efficient, vibrant community health service to cater for all needs.  The Government, in spite of their public utterances have allowed the community care service to collapse in some areas and to be reduced in others. I hope the Minister will stand up to the Department of Finance whose only priority is to balance the books irrespective of the social, economic and health consequences of their actions.  The Minister for Health must accept responsibility for his very important portfolio.  In discussions with the Minister, in debates across the Floor of the House and during Question Time I have never found the Minister other than forthcoming in his commitment to the service but I am aware that the Minister, like previous Ministers for Health, has to live and fight with the Department of Finance.  The health service cannot afford further cutbacks and we cannot afford continuing underfunding, without neglecting people.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have been constant in their opposition to the running of the health services.  We are not opposed to <Col N="1399" /> the Minister as a person but as the political head of his Department.  Our arguments against health policy should strengthen the Minister's hand in Cabinet and in negotiations with the Department of Finance.  The support of Opposition parties for increased health funding should sustain the Minister for Health in his arguments in Cabinet.  The Labour Party unequivocally adhere to the belief that health care is a basic human right and that there is an explicit obligation on the community to discriminate positively in favour of the poor.  The Government policy has been to discriminate against the less well off.  The Government do not want to admit that we have any poor people and they discriminate against the less well off in our community making it increasingly difficult for people on low incomes to secure access, let alone equality of access to the health services.</P>
    <P>We will never be able to describe the health service as a service giving a basic human right until we face up to the need to provide adequate resources.  The House should support the principle that resources for health should be a priority. The Government have had the benefit of a whole range of reports in this area, a report from the Commission on Health Funding, the Kennedy report, the Fox report and so on and still they have done nothing other than to fiddle around at the edges of the problem.  At the end of the day both partners in Government will have to make a decision in principle in regard to these areas of priority.  No final decision can be made in regard to how much should be spent on our health service until such time as we decide that health care is a basic human right.  If we decide that health care is a basic human right then we must take the necessary steps to give effect to this important principle. If the Government renege on their commitment to make this a priority area then they will have to answer to the electorate in future elections.  It has become more and more apparent that the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition Government do not consider health care to be a basic human right.  Despite the <Col N="1400" /> warnings which were sounded by the electorate in the run-up to the 1989 general election and this year's local elections the Government have done nothing to improve our health services.  Fianna Fáil candidates have suffered defeats in these elections as a result of the decisions made at national level by the Cabinet.  The Government's decision to introduce further cutbacks blatantly illustrates that they do not consider health services to be a basic human right.  It is tragic I have to say this because many members of the Government, particularly Fianna Fáil members, are committed to improving this sensitive service.  However, that commitment is not followed through at Cabinet level in terms of fiscal rectitude.</P>
    <P>The effects of the cutbacks have been visible all around us for the past six months.  The Government have decided yet again to postpone the construction of the new hospital in Tallaght.  This is a disgrace.  In spite of their public commitments to build this hospital I signalled on the Floor of this House some months ago that they would renege on this promise to the people of Tallaght.  In view of the urgent necessity to provide this acute facility for the people of Tallaght, I find it almost impossible to understand the Government's decision to postpone the construction of the hospital.  The site development was initiated in the mid-eighties to provide this essential service for approximately 150,000 citizens in the Tallaght area and surrounding districts. However, no provision was made in the 1991 health capital programme for this much vaunted and promised hospital in Tallaght.  As a result, all the work, planning and development has come to a halt.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Minister for Health charged health boards with the responsibility of providing the same level of service as that provided after the 1989 general election.  However, the current budget provisions will not allow health boards to maintain that level of service. This means that health boards will be forced to severely cut back further on services, thus giving rise to further waiting lists.  I have identified here specific <Col N="1401" /> health boards who have financial problems and cannot pay their suppliers. These financial problems are so bad that health boards are almost bankrupt.  They have had to tell their suppliers they cannot pay them for goods, drugs, medi-cines and services rendered to them.  I do not think it is good enough that health boards should be placed in such a position in this day and age.  People who supply goods and services to servants of the State do not expect to have to worry about if and when they will be paid.</P>
    <P>We recently read in the newspapers the proposals by health boards to close down beds for the summer.  The Minister referred to this as a tradition.  This is a bad tradition and should not be regarded by any Government as tradition, particularly in the case of services which may be urgently required at any given time. The argument that it is holiday time and there is a budget deficit will not stand up if even one life is lost as a result of this procedure.  As I said initially, this tradition was started by the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon.  Perhaps it is a tradition in his area but even if it is he should not be proud of it.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre made an announcement today about their severe financial problems and the possibility that they might have to close their doors.  Their director has maintained that unless the centre receives assistance &mdash; this statement has been circulated to all Members of this House &mdash; it will have to terminate all counselling and therapy within the next three months.  I repeat this warning in the House tonight in the hope that either the Minister for Health or the Minister for Social Welfare will respond to it.  If the Government allow this centre to close, Dublin city and county will have no rape crisis service and people whose lives are already shattered as a result of child sexual abuse will have no one to turn to for help.  In January of this year the Government promised to allocate a meagre £10,000 to the Rape Crisis Centre but to date they have not received this money.  This is a damning indictment of the Government.  None of <Col N="1402" /> us like to talk about the problems suffered by the people in this very sensitive area but we all acknowledge the need for this service.  If the Government do not fulfil their promise to this centre, further problems will be created down the road in the long term.</P>
    <P>The level of services provided for people with physical or mental handicap has deteriorated in recent years.  We have debated this issue regularly in the House. The Minister has put forward proposals, plans and figures which seem to indicate that everything is much better in this area but I intend to put on the record of the House some of the specifics in this area which show the way in which we have neglected the mentally handicapped.  The review group appointed by the Minister outline graphically in their report which was published last month the problems in this area.  They say that there has been a standstill in real budget terms while those with a disability or mental handicap and their families have grown older and their demands more pressing.  This is a terrible indictment of any Government in regard to the provision of services for this very vulnerable group.</P>
    <P>The crisis in this area covers many aspects, the most worrying of which is the lack of a multi-disciplinary early intervention service for parents and children. The absence of pre-school services for children with delayed development has meant that parents have to cope alone and children are losing crucial opportunities which they may not be able to avail of again.  The Government need to respond to the crisis in the area of mental handicap.  The hardship suffered by people who have mental and physical disability will increase unless appropriate plans are made but planning must take place in the knowledge that resources will eventually be made available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The political background in Britain at the time in question <Col N="1403" /> was as follows: 5 October 1974, Guildford pub bombing, five dead; 7 November 1974, Woolwich bombing followed by the Balcomb Street siege; 28 November 1974, Birmingham bombings, 21 dead. The Prevention of Terrorism Act was also passed that year.  On 4 March 1976 Annie Maguire who was then aged 40 and her husband Paddy, an ex-British soldier, were each sentenced to 14 years imprisonment for possession of explosives. Her two sons, Vincent who was aged 13 and Patrick who was aged 16, were sentenced to four and five years imprisonment respectively for possession of explosives.  Her brother William Smith, her brother-in-law, Guiseppe Conlon, and a friend, Patrick O'Neill, each got 12 years imprisonment for possession of explosives.</P>
      <P>It is important to recall that the nitroglycerine test, in the context of the recent decision of the British Court of Appeal, allegedly reveal traces, not more than a microgram, that is, equivalent to a millionth part of a sugar cube, on plastic gloves which Mrs. Maguire used.  The defence was refused permission to have independent tests done.  Tests were done on each hand and on scrapings from under nails of the accused persons.  A positive result was recorded from every scraping.  All the samples were then destroyed.  The forensic expert from Woolwich Arsenal who carried out the nitroglycerine tests was an 18 year old apprentice with two months experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explosives test used was the TLC test, or thin layer chromatography test, a modification of the now discredited Greiss test.  The TLC test was invented by Mr. John Yallop who had worked at Woolwich Arsenal for 30 years.  Mr. Yallop appeared for the defence and stated that &ldquo;no competent scientist could do otherwise then conclude that the ...results are not due to presence of nitroglycerine&rdquo;.  Mr. Yallop stated that positive tests can be got using the TLC test from household products like washing powder, air freshner, nail varnish and polish and also stated that cigarette <Col N="1404" /> smoke is capable of giving TLC test positive results.  Mr. Yallop was also critical that corroboration or control tests were never carried out at Woolwich Arsenal.</P>
    <P>To put the matter in perspective the verdict of half innocent, half guilty by the Court of Appeal in the Maguire case has no precedent in English law.  When the Sir John May inquiry does what the Court of Appeal could not do, that is, introduce a verdict of absolute blamelessness, the Maguires will be found not guilty of the remotest association with the crimes with which they were charged.  The Court of Appeal could not find the seven innocent. Neither could they hand down a not guilty verdict.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, a towel was produced from somewhere unknown.  It was suggested by the Court of Appeal that that article was responsible for the contamination of the hands of all of the accused &mdash; what a farce and a travesty of justice.  This infamous towel had never been heard of before and has not been seen since, yet it allowed the Court of Appeal to give a so-called face saving verdict, to save the faces of the British Judiciary.  In the opinion of eminent practioners of the law, it is the verdict in the Maguire case which will end the role of the Court of Appeal in cases involving glaring miscarriages of justices.  It was a wretched verdict handed down by judges in the best tradition of Lord Lane in the case of the Birmingham Six appeal.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the need to place this case and this infamy on the record of the House, my intention in raising the matter is to ask the Taoiseach and the Government to protest to the British authorities in the strongest possible terms within whatever mechanism is available to them, in particular the Anglo-Irish Conference, about this verdict. As the House is aware, the Conference is due to meet on the 16th of this month and I genuinely ask the Taoiseach, his Ministers or whoever will represent the Government at the Conference &mdash; presumably, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice &mdash; to do what I ask.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Andrews for raising this very important issue.  It is appropriate and important that this House should consider the tragic and protracted case of the Maguire family and their friends.  Their plight has deservedly evoked much sympathy in this country from people in all walks of life and all parts of the political spectrum.  In this regard, I wish to commend the sustained humanitarian interest taken in the case over the years by so many Members of the Oireachtas, including Deputy Andrews.  I believe that their interest has helped in no small way to maintain the pressure for a satisfactory resolution.  It is extremely important that this pressure and interest is maintained in the future.</P>
      <P>The Maguire case, as Deputy Andrews set out, is one of a small number of cases dating from the seventies &mdash; and sharing a number of the same disturbing features &mdash; which have been a matter of deepest concern to the Government.  In the last two years, as the House is aware, major developments have taken place in two of these.  The first was the sudden and dramatic conclusion in October 1989 of the Guildford Four case, so closely linked to that of the Maguires.  A few short months ago, we saw the overturning of the convictions of the Birmingham Six. Both these events were a cause of joy and relief in this country, in Britain and beyond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Justifiably, there was general hope and indeed optimism that the Maguire case would follow the same pattern and that, in this case too, a great wrong would &mdash; however belatedly &mdash; be put right. <Col N="1406" /> However, to the grievous disappointment of those who had followed the courageous efforts of the Maguires and their friends to clear their names, this is not, as Deputy Andrews pointed out, what happened.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, these convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal on 26 June &mdash; and the Government welcomed this development. However, the rejection by the court of all the grounds of appeal except for the limited grounds of &ldquo;innocent contamination&rdquo;, which had earlier been conceded by the Director of Public Prosecutions, meant that this judgement was far from being the unambiguous vindication which the appellants had sought for so long.  In their statement following the judgment, the Government made clear that they shared the disappointment and dissatisfaction of the appellants at this outcome.</P>
    <P>Clearly &mdash; and I believe that I speak for the House on this point &mdash; it is imperative that consideration of this case must not end with the narrow grounds on which the convictions were overturned. The Maguire family and their friends, after so many years of struggle against so tragic a miscarriage of justice, are entitled to have their good names rehabilitated without qualification.  The Government share the widespread admiration for the courage, perseverance and dignity with which they have sustained this struggle.  They are also conscious that Guiseppe Conlon, who so tragically died in prison in 1980, could not see his claim of innocence vindicated.</P>
    <P>The Government have made clear that the Appeal Court judgement has not removed their deep concern about this case and they remain committed to seeing it fully and satisfactorily resolved.  As indicated in the Government statement, we will be pursuing the matter with the British authorities as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>This Government and their predecessors have consistently sought to have rectified this and the other miscarriages of justice I mentioned.  It will be recalled that, over the years, we have pressed the British authorities with a <Col N="1407" /> strong sense of urgency to have these cases reconsidered.  We will continue this approach until the Maguire case, like the others, is brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of considerable encouragement that the inquiry headed by Sir John May is to continue its consideration of the broader aspects of this case.  The Government would like to express their appreciation for the very valuable work done to date by Sir John and his inquiry in bringing to light so many vital aspects of the case.  We are conscious that it was the work of the May inquiry on the forensic evidence which paved the way for the case being brought back to the Court of Appeal and we hope that the continuing work of the inquiry will lead to further positive developments.</P>
    <P>Another ground for optimism is the recent establishment of the Royal Commission under the chairmanship of Lord Runciman of Doxford, who are charged with examining criminal investigation, prosecution and appeal practices in England in the light of the quashing of the Birmingham Six convictions.  It is greatly to be hoped that the work of the Royal Commission will help ensure that the circumstances leading to such miscarriages of justice as befell the Maguires will never recur.</P>
    <P>I am sure I am right in saying that there exists in this House a broad non-partisan desire to see justice fully done in the case of the Maguire family and their friends. The Government share this desire, and &mdash; I repeat &mdash; will avail of every appropriate opportunity to pursue the matter with the British authorities until the Maguire family have been vindicated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Howth House is an early 19th century house, the most imposing on the Howth Peninsula.  It stands at the <Col N="1408" /> entrance to the village of Howth and links the village to the harbour.  Its situation under the ramparts of the medieval St. Mary's Abbey means that it forms part of the historic core of the village.  The site on which it stands is potentially of great archaeological importance.</P>
      <P>The planning permission to demolish Howth House, is, according to legal advice, in breach of the proper planning procedures.  The permission constitutes a material contravention of the development plan, but material contravention procedures were not followed.  The 1980 development plan zones the area residential, yet the council have given permission for a development which includes shops and offices, specifically forbidden under the zoning plan.  Furthermore, the policy statement relating to Howth declares that the policy is &ldquo;to maintain the character of the village&rdquo;.  This proposed development will seriously damage the character of the village.  This view has been expressed by a wide range of experts, yet the county council, An Bord Pleanála and Monastra Developments have seen fit to ignore this.</P>
      <P>The parks department of the council reported that Howth House is a building of unique character and with the garden compliments and links the character of the village and the harbour.  The report went on to state that if permitted the development would seriously injure the visual amenities of the area.  The report stated that the proposed development was totally out of character with the area and no open spaces were provided.  It recommended that the application be refused.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works, as custodians of St. Mary's Abbey, a national monument which adjoins the site, recommend the employment of a competent archaeologist and state that it is also important that the proposal does not interfere with the abbey.</P>
      <P>The sanitary services and the chief medical officer, are also against the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning officer in his decision to grant permission has ignored all these reports.  He did not even wait for the <Col N="1409" /> report of the roads department.  Though this is an area with a documented history of traffic chaos, the planning officer also failed to note that the permission is in material contravention of the zoning and ignores the policy relating to Howth and the pivotal position of Howth House.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála's decision was taken in the face of a wealth of expert evidence and very strong public opinion.  The architectural historian, Peter Pearson, has drawn attention to its importance as maritime architecture, and Bord Fáilte in their submission stated:</P>
    <P>We beleive that tourism can best be served if the distinct character and the quality of the old natural stone buildings, together with the good marine environment, becomes a tourism attraction in its own right.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte rightly compare Howth with Kinsale.</P>
    <P>Roger Stalley, Professor of the History of Art at Trinity College, stated:</P>
    <P>The site is one of the most conspicuous and sensitive locations on the Howth peninsula.  Whatever building stands here will establish the visual character of the village and define what type of place Howth is.  The implications of this appeal are clear cut.  Will Howth survive as an ancient village with its own rich and varied history, or become yet another anonymous suburban enclave?</P>
    <P>This gets right to the centre of the issue as far as the people of Howth are concerned. They have been faced with the arrogance of a developer who decides to ruin the historical core of the village and even states that the centre of the village should be moved.  Who are Monastra to impose this development on the community, declaring a wish to respect the village, but pushing ahead in the face of overwhelming local opposition trampling on their heritage, their history, and their culture?</P>
    <P>The site has been described in archaeological terms as a potential mini Wood Quay.  It was the site of the ancient port, from Norse and Viking times until the <Col N="1410" /> late 18th century.  The adjoining national monument of St. Mary's Abbey currently dominates the harbour and the proposed development undeniably damages this.</P>
    <P>Local people are dismayed at the prospect of the destruction of the house and the integrity of the whole area.  They have met Monastra Developments and have offered to buy the site from them for their buying price of £350,000 plus costs. However, Monastra are seeking £1 million to £1.2 million, effectively holding the community to ransom.  All this is taking place against a background of a strong local grassroots planning movement through the Howth/Sutton 2000 development and planning strategy.</P>
    <P>Monastra's quick buck attitude compares very poorly with this.</P>
    <P>Many questions remain to be answered.  Why do the council not follow their own development plan?  Why do An Bord Pleanála not recognise the importance of Howth House to the village of Howth?  Why have the Office of Public Works not appointed an archaeologist as provided for in the planning permission. Why has the Minister, Deputy Brady not responded to the Friends of Howth House's letter to him?  What gives Monastra the right to trample on the wishes and the heritage of the people of Howth? When will local people control the planning of their own areas?</P>

For all the reasons Deputy Garland has advanced, I urge action by the Government in this respect.</P>

      <P>Howth Abbey, St. Mary's Church, has a history going back many hundreds of years.  The first <Col N="1411" /> church on the site was founded by Sigtrygg, King of Dublin, around 1042.  The present church dates from the late 14th or early 15th century.  It houses the notable tomb of the St. Lawrence family which was carved around 1470.  The church was a collegiate church, which meant that it was attached to a college or house of learning.</P>
      <P>Planning permission for this development was originally granted by Dublin County Council on 16 July 1990 and on appeal, by An Bord Pleanála on 17 April 1991.  Though the proposals do not interfere with the visible national monument remains of nearby Howth Abbey, as a precautionary measure, a condition was attached to the planning permission which required the developer, &ldquo;to facilitate the safeguarding of any items of archaeological significance the site may possess.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Commissioners of Public Works that developers should bear the cost of any archaeological investigations necessitated by their developments.</P>
      <P>The developers in this case have agreed to retain an archaeologist to appraise the site from an archaeological point of view and to supervise ground disturbance work.  The Commissioners of Public Works will monitor the situation to ensure that any archaeological remains are not damaged.  Finally, I should also point out that the commissioners have powers under the National Monuments Acts to directly intervene, should this become absolutely necessary in any way whatever.</P>

      <P>This is the second time within a week that I have raised a matter on the Adjournment pertaining to education when the Minister of State has been sent in to bat for the Minister. Acknowledging the versatility of the Minister of State, his area of competence is mainly youth, sport and school transport. He is not responsible for the sins of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> The National Council for Educational Awards were one of the most important and prestigious education supervisory bodies.  The council were set up by an Act of this House in 1979 to encourage, facilitate and promote technical, industrial, scientific, technological and commercial education, as well as education in art and design.  The seventies and eighties have seen a huge expansion in the growth of third level education.  We have seen the emergence of the NIHEs and their evolution recently to full university status.  We have seen a massive expansion of intake into the traditional universities. In particular the growth and development of the regional and technical colleges has brought its own particular dynamics to the third level education sector.  It is generally accepted that the regional technical colleges have very much forced the pace of third level education by providing very healthy and open competition among all third level sectors, and that they have earned their spurs which will be further enhanced by the introduction of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.  This should have been before the House this term but unfortunately it has been postponed until we resume in October.  We are fortunate therefore to have a wide choice of third level institutions and that the standard of qualification being awarded by our different colleges and universities are on a par or indeed excel those of their third level peers in any part of the world.</P>
    <P>Very much central to the promotion of third level education and absolutely essential from the point of view of synchronising, monitoring and gauging third level qualifications is the National Council for Education Awards.  It is the NCEA who are responsible for the conferring of degrees, diplomas and certificates. The council who have a five year term of office lapsed in July 1990, exactly one year ago, and have been on ice since. Their work is being carried out by the chairman, Mr. Richard Healy, who was nominated by the Minister for Education, and by the director, Mr. Pádraig Mac Diarmada, both very capable and <Col N="1413" /> competent gentlemen.  However, the chairman has no council over which to preside and therefore is largely redundant, the director is supposed to do the bidding of the actual council but as there has been no council in existence for the past year he does nobody's bidding.  The intention of the Act was that the NCEA would be a representative body, comprising a chairman, director and 21 members.  Of particular significance are the five VEC representatives because some of them are directly elected local authority members.  I am led to believe, however, that the crux of the problem seems to be that the nine ministerial appointments cannot be agreed.  It has been put to me that the major obstacle seems to be whether the Progressive Democrats should get a share of those appointments as they are the junior partner in Government.  I am not particularly worried as long as the council are put in place as soon as possible and that the people who are put on the council are able to discharge their remit and have a qualified input to the council deliberations. I fail to see why any split or disagreement between the Government partners as to the number of seats which should be assigned to each of the partners should be the reason that the council are put on ice.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clear the air once and for all tonight and I want an assurance from the Minister of State, in the absence of the Minister, that the new council will be formulated without delay. It is potentially very damaging at present that there is absolutely no synchronisation, no monitoring or standardisation of degrees, diplomas and certificates being awarded by the various third level institutions which is one of the kernel functions of the NCEA.  It is absolutely vital that the matter be rectified forthwith and that the new council be constituted and begin their important five year term of office without further delay.</P>
    <P>Not alone is the non-existence of the NCEA in itself a considerable handicap to higher education, but there is the added problem that all of the NCEA's subcommittees are defunct and therefore <Col N="1414" /> important areas of third level development are not dealt with.  I have been contacted by the principals of some of the regional colleges and some of the RTC personnel who feel very aggrieved that the NCEA should be left on ice for so long.  The situation is all the more serious if it is to be the victim of political pettiness.  Approximately 80 per cent of the business of the NCEA is related to the regional technical colleges.  New courses are emerging all the time, new third level developments continue to arrive on the horizon but without the guiding hand of the NCEA the colleges find themselves left in a considerable state of uncertainty or without any official recognition or imprimatur until such time as the new council is set up.</P>
    <P>Finally I urge the Minister of State to tell the House in no uncertain terms that he proposes in the absence of the Minister to dispel the disquiet and rumours and that it is his intention to reconstitute the NCEA without further delay.</P>

      <P>First, I assure the Deputy that the rumours and disquiet he talks about are non-existent, in fact the difficulties he has spoken about have nothing to do with the hold up in the appointments to the NCEA.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the NCEA Act, 1979, council members may be appointed for a maximum period of five years and as it has been the practice to appoint members for the maximum period consequently council members appointed in July 1990 would have held office until July 1995.  An anomalous situation was foreseen however in that the amalgamation of Thomond College with the University of Limerick was under consideration. Under the terms of the Act, Thomond was entitled to nominate two representatives to the council.  A situation would have arisen therefore that an institution which would no longer exist as a legal entity would have two representatives on the council until July 1995.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>First I will deal with the Celtic Sea herring fishery.  Last year the fishery was not organised in a proper manner and as a result the quota was totally used up by fishermen fishing in the western end of the Celtic Sea, that is around the West-Cork and Kerry coast. The entire quota of hearing was caught in that region prior to Christmas 1990. Traditionally some of the herring would be caught in the western end of the fishery and some in the eastern end of the fishery, which is traditionally known as the Dunmore East herring fishery.  In today's paper I saw that the Minister had <Col N="1416" /> obtained a quota for herring fishing in the Celtic Sea for the 1991-92 season of 15,000 tonnes of herring.  I want to put down a market tonight that the quota should be split equally between the western and eastern segments of the Celtic Sea and that the quota should not be fished in its entirety by the fishermen working from the western segment as happened last year.</P>
      <P>It actually cost the fishermen and business people of Dunmore East and districts approximately £1 million at the end of last year and at the beginning of this year and that is a lot of money for a small community to lose.  I ask that the fisheries be properly managed.  The fish move in an anti-clockwise direction so they will first hit the west Cork-Kerry coast and they should be given a chance to travel so that the fishermen in the Dunmore East fishery would be given a chance to fish and that the people who service that industry would have the chance of making a decent living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's concern arises, I assume from the recent newspaper reports relating to the Celtic Sea herring quota.  I will outline the background to these reports.  Ireland has consistently maintained that herring stocks in the Celtic Sea are considerably higher and can stand a higher level of exploitation than the annual total allowable catch and quota regulations will allow.  Unfortunately, up to recently we have had little success in convincing the European Commission to increase the total allowable catch for this stock, in fact last year the total allowable catch was actually reduced in line with the ACFM and STCF recommendations.</P>
      <P>However, following a further submission by Irish scientists, ACFM at their meeting in May reversed previous recommendations and proposed a substantial increase in the TAC for this species.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister raised the matter at the Council of Fisheries Ministers' meeting in Brussels yesterday.  As a result of his intervention the Commissioner for Fisheries, Vice-President Marin, has agreed <Col N="1417" /> to a significant increase, as Deputy Deasy said, in the TAC for the stock this season. The Minister expects the Commission to put forward a formal proposal in this regard very soon so that the increased quota will be available for the autumn fishery.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke of the management of the fisheries.  The Minister's objective in the management of the Celtic Sea herring fishery is to allocate the quotas available as evenly as possible over the main spawning season, with a view to maximising incomes and employment, as Deputy Deasy told the House, both for the fishermen and the processors.  He is aware the Celtic Sea fishery can be divided broadly into two distinct elements from a spawning viewpoint.  First, the western element, from Dingle to Cork Harbour, is an autumn fishery where the roe is suitable for commercial exploitation in the October to December period.  The eastern element, from Cork Harbour to Dunmore East, is a winter-spring fishery where the roe is suitable for exploitation in the December and early New Year period.  Each year the quota is divided between the winter-spring fishery and the autumn fishery to ensure that fishermen in the various constituent parts are able to catch an equitable portion of the quota.</P>

      <P>Before the 1991-92 fishery reopens next autumn, the Department, following full consultation with the industry, will have put in place a management regime designed to ensure that whatever quota is available is divided as evenly as possible between the eastern and western sectors.  I feel that is what Deputy Deasy is anxious about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The second item I want to raise involves the tonnages of Irish shipping which is allowed by the EC.  I do not want to be unkind to the Minister of State because he is a very honourable individual, but a total botch was made in Brussels of the annual tonnage for Irish boats in the past 12 to 18 months.  I have raised this at Question Time and answers were given by the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine who quite clearly did not know what he was talking about.  I do not like to be offensive or unkind, but this is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>There are anomalies, inequities and injustices all around the coast because of the mess that was made in Brussels allocating tonnage.  People who have been fishing all their lives are not now allowed to go to sea.  There are probably something like 400 to 500 fishermen who are deprived of making a living because of bureaucratic bungling.  This fact is openly acknowledged by everybody in the industry. I believe it is acknowledged by senior people in the Department of the Marine, but nobody will admit that a serious mistake was made.  The Council of Ministers of which the Minister is a member, is a body which should rectify the wrongs which have been done.  I am asking here tonight that the message be sent to the Minister that he is expected to rectify the mistakes which have been made.</P>
      <P>There are a number of cases in my constituency.  One chap in a fishing village called Passage East has a boat which has been used for the past 70 years, and he is not now allowed to go out, fish and earn a living in that boat because he was not included on the register which was forwarded to Brussels last year.  There are dozens of similar cases in my constituency in all the fishing villages around the coast, and there are 400 to 500 throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am asking merely that the Minister use his political wisdom, muscle, charm, bilingualism or trilingualism to ensure these people are given a right to earn a living on the sea, fishing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, since the question given to me is &ldquo;To ask the Minister for the Marine the necessity for additional tonnage from the EC to enable more Irish fishing boats to be registered&rdquo; I am not in a position to reply to some of the suggestions or allegations made by Deputy Deasy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I might have had a different reply if I had known the line the Deputy was going to take.</P>
      <P>The Government's central objective for the fish catching sector in the medium term is to increase progressively and maximise the take-up of existing fish quotas and the catch of non-quota species. This objective is being pursued, <i>inter alia,</i> through the modernisation and restructuring of the fishing fleet to better match available fish stocks and to strengthen its long term viability and competitiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as Deputy Deasy is no doubt aware, there are major constraints on fleet capacity arising from the European Community fishing fleet policy.  That policy is designed to address the problem of the serious over-capacity that exists in the Community as a whole.  In line with the current policy, as expressed through the Multi-Annual Guidance Programmes, 1987-91, member states are required to reduce their fleet capacities by 3 per cent below the 1984 level before the end of 1991.  This requirement poses very real difficulties for a number of member states, including Ireland as Deputy Deasy has suggested, whose fleets had increased since 1984.  In Ireland's case the cutback in capacity requires that the fleet be reduced to 43,941 gross registered tonnes by the end of 1991.  To date, we have achieved the target of 49,000 tonnes set for the end of 1990.  A substantial further reduction of <Col N="1420" /> about 6,000 tonnes is sought by the end of 1991.</P>
    <P>These restrictions are not unique to Ireland.  Similar restrictions apply to all member states.  Moreover, there are links between the restrictions and other elements of policy, specifically the availability of substantial financial assistance for the fishing sector generally.  Member states which fail to reduce the gross registered tonnage of their fleets will be handicapped in seeking EC financial aid from Structural Funds to modernise and refurbish their fleets.</P>
    <P>EC fleet policy is currently being reevaluated on the basis of new multi-annual guidance programmes recently submitted by member states in respect of the period 1992-96.  The methodology used in the programme submitted by Ireland was to (1) define coherent fleet categories, (2) relate the capacity of each fleet category to the actual and potential state of the stocks exploited by that category, (3) assess conservation and management constraints on each category and, most importantly, (4) on that basis set specific objectives and policies for individual fleet categories.</P>
    <P>It is evident to the Minister, and he is supported in this by scientific advice, that there are unexploited fishing opportunities available to some of the fleet categories, in particular in the offshore demersal and crustacean sectors.  These issues have been raised specifically in the Irish multi-annual guidance programme.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Deasy that the Minister is exploring all possibilities of introducing the necessary vessels to the Irish fleet to exploit these opportunities not only in the context of the discussions on the multi-annual guidance programme but also in the context of the ongoing review of Irish fisheries policy.  I will certainly give Deputy Deasy's suggestions to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 10 July 1991.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied generally that sufficient safeguards exist whereby possible abuses of dominant or monopoly position by the organisation in question can be avoided in relation to Irish broadcasting services.  In this regard, under the Copyright Act, 1963, where a copyright licensing scheme exists and a dispute arises between the organisation representing the copyright owners and a person (such as a broadcaster) requiring to use the copyrighted material, the matter may be referred to the Controller of Patents who shall consider the issues in dispute and may make such order, either confirming or varying the licensing scheme (including tariffs) as he may determine to be reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also point out that section 5 of the Competition Bill recently before this House prohibits the abuse of a dominant position within the State regardless of whether that position is held by foreign or national interests.  Section 6 provides parties who may be aggrieved by such abuse with the means to seek redress in the Circuit Court or the High Court.

      <P>The policy emphasis of this Government is to further strengthen Irish competition legislation.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 23, 30 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the target is to create 20,000 new jobs each year of the programme in manufacturing and international services.  It was pointed out in the programme that the achievement of this target would require continuing stability in the economic environment and cost competitiveness throughout the industrial and services sectors.  The need for a positive external environment for our exports, and a co-operative response from firms, employees and the various State agencies involved in supporting developments was also critical to its achievement.</P>
      <P>After initial uncertainties earlier in the year caused by the Gulf War and exacerbated by recession in the USA and the UK, the industrial development agencies are confident that the target of 20,000 new jobs in manufacturing and international services can be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of interest in investment in Ireland from overseas firms has revived <Col N="1160" /> and the prospects of winning new investments for Ireland are encouraging for the remainder of the year.  Even with competitive gains in costs, Irish industry has been hard hit by the UK recession and this highlights the need for Irish companies to continue their diversification into other EC markets.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to take all possible steps to ensure a positive business environment.  In particular, the Government are determined to bring about the strengthening of the indigenous industrial sector, particularly in terms of scale and innovation.  Greater integration of industrial activity with other sectors of the economy will also be pursued in order to increase the Irish value added share of industrial output.  In this connection, the presence in Ireland of over 1,000 overseas companies provides an outstanding market for Irish supplier companies.</P>
    <P>Finally, the review of industrial policy recently announced by me should identify what further initiatives need to be taken, particularly to develop indigenous industry. The foundation for a sustainable increase in real jobs must be the growth of internationally trading native industries. It is only through such a development that wealth and jobs can be created which are viable in the long term and which contribute to the greater economic well-being of our society.</P>

      <P>Two measures which will add significantly to consumer protection when implemented have recently come before the House.  These are the Competition Bill, 1991 which has now passed all Stages here, and is currently with the Seanad, and the Liability for Defective Products Bill, 1991, the second Stage of which was completed on 6 June.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice recently announced a new small claims procedure as promised in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It will operate initially on a pilot basis in the Dublin metropolitan district, in Cork and two other District Court venues.</P>
      <P>I also propose to introduce consumer protection measures in the areas of consumer credit, food labelling and safety with regard to imitation products.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are proposals being discussed at EC level as regards unfair terms in consumer contracts, product safety and the liability of suppliers of services.  These have as their objective the strengthening of consumer protection legislation in the European Community and will on their adoption benefit Irish consumers significantly.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the work currently in progress in his Department on the likely impact of the Single European Market on industrial development policy and its effect on employment on which Irish industries are most vulnerable; if he will give details of the advice which has been offered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The process of completing the Single European Market is likely to give a spur to the growth of the European economy from which industry in Ireland, as elsewhere in Europe, can benefit.  The integration of the market will also increase competition for many producers as the remaining vestiges of national barriers to trade within Europe are removed.  Nationally we stand to gain from this process as we have not resorted to barriers to imports and our exporters have improved their cost competitive positions in recent years.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of the many exhortations I have given over the past few years to Irish companies that they must gear up to take full advantage of the opportunities the internal market will bring.  I have also constantly stressed that there cannot be any complacency on anyone's part that the Single Market will tolerate incompetent or inefficient firms. These firms will not survive.  The message is that stark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have placed, and will continue to place, great emphasis on the need to develop our indigenous industry. It is essential that areas of perceived <Col N="1164" /> weakness such as marketing, technology and management development are addressed and brought up to the level where Irish firms can not only compete but secure additional markets for our products.</P>
    <P>The development of greater scale in Irish industry has been identified as a critical need in the context of the greater competition arising from the Single European Market.  This need will be addressed in a number of ways: State support will be concentrated selectively on those indigenous companies capable of achieving positions in international markets, enabling them to grow to the scale necessary to maintain these positions, particularly through marketing, product development and management development supports; supports will be offered in appropriate cases for the merger of companies or co-operatives where such restructuring would lead to growth in employment and added value in Ireland, and the industrial development agencies have adopted an operational target to increase by 100 within ten years the number of Irish manufacturing companies having an annual turnover greater than £5 million in real terms over the period.</P>
    <P>The development of the necessary physical, technical and educational infrastructure to support industrial growth will be facilitated by the EC Structural Funds which have been put in place for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The sectoral implications of the Single Market were highlighted by the various studies carried out under the aegis of the EUROPEN campaign, and these are kept under continuous review by my Department and the development agencies.</P>
    <P>Finally, the implications of the Single European Market for industrial policy will, of course, be one of the major considerations of the review group recently announced by me.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 28 and No. 33 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the report referred to by Deputy Bruton.  The present position is that the number of EC internal market measures which have been agreed at Community level for which the date of implementation has been reached but which have not yet been transposed into Irish law is 37.  Ireland has, therefore, implemented 73 per cent of the total number of measures which are required to be implemented.  This compares with an EC average of approximately 78 per cent.</P>
      <P>Ireland's performance in this regard is, therefore, below the average of EC member states as a whole.  This is something about which the Government are concerned and Departments have been reminded of the need to speed up the implementation process.</P>

This figure, which is provisional and subject to revision, is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in the 1990 calendar year by the estimated number of PAYE taxpaying units effectively liable to tax in the 1990-91 tax year, and multiplying the result by one thousand.  (A married couple who have opted, or have been deemed to have opted, for joint assessment, are counted as one tax unit).  It should be noted that income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income. Receipts of deposit interest retention tax are not included in the calculation.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to authorise an official seal cull off the north-west coast.</P>
      <P>Seals are a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976, and it is an offence to hunt or kill them save under licence or permission under the Act.  The best scientific advice available indicates that culling is not an effective method of preventing seal predation of fishery catches. Accordingly, I am not prepared to issue a licence for such a course of action.</P>
      <P>There is, however, a remedy available to fishermen in that they may apply for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Act to kill seals which are causing actual damage to their nets.  Any such application will receive prompt attention.</P>

      <P>In so far as exports are <Col N="1183" /> concerned, the Deputy will be aware that Europe and the US are Ireland's major markets.  Consequently the main thrust of our promotional drive must continue to be in these markets.  By comparison, the Middle East and Far East only represent a small proportion of total exports. In 1990 Irish exports to the Far East only accounted for 4 per cent of total exports and the Middle East less than 2 per cent.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am anxious that each and every market should be fully exploited to the benefit of Irish manufacturers and service suppliers.  CTT are constantly analysing market changes to ensure that any opportunities which might occur to Ireland's possible advantage do not go unnoticed.</P>
      <P>The recent crises in the Middle East disrupted business in this region.  Trading conditions were often difficult or impossible. Exports to the Middle East in 1990 fell by 30 per cent to £279 million.  The fall-off in meat exports to Iran, Iraq and Egypt was the main reason for this decrease.</P>
      <P>Irish companies will, nonetheless, be represented at two trade fairs in Iran this year and CTT have just returned from a market assessment in Tehran.</P>
      <P>As regards Kuwait, I am convinced that in the reconstruction of that country, the best opportunities for Irish companies are in the sub-contracting area.  I therefore intend to visit the senior executives of major US and European companies who have won orders in Kuwait, to seek business on behalf of Irish sub-contracting companies.  In addition CTT have set up a special task force to service the Kuwait market.</P>
      <P>As regards lapsed markets, I will consider the question of re-entering the Iraqi market after the trade embargo has been lifted by the UN and the EC and after Iraq has cleared a substantial part of the debts it owes to Irish companies. All other Middle East markets are being monitored through CTT's network in the region.  While export prospects for 1991 for meat and dairy sectors are difficult to gauge, growth for other sectors is expected to be above average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> As regards the Far East, CTT will focus their attention on Japan which is our biggest market in the region.  Our exports to Japan suffered a decline in 1990 because of lower values in the dairy and chemical sectors.  This year CTT will be organising a number of sectoral missions and I myself intend to lead a trade mission to Japan in the latter part of the year.  On 18 July this year I will be hosting a visit to Ireland by the Japanese Minister for International Trade and Industry which will follow upon the visit here of the Japanese Foreign Minister on 10 July. During our discussions I will seek to advance the interest of Irish exporters as well as highlighting Ireland as a suitable location for Japanese investment.</P>
    <P>Another Far East market to which I am giving special attention is Korea.  In June of this year, I met with the Korean Minister for Trade and Industry and we agreed that Ireland and Korea would conclude an agreement on economic, scientific and technological co-operation.  This is intended to open the way for increased export opportunities for this country.</P>
    <P>Specialist missions are being organised to Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia.</P>
    <P>As regards industrial development, the IDA, through their offices in Tokyo, Seoul and Hong Kong, actively promote Ireland as a location for inward mobile investments.</P>
    <P>In Japan, the IDA is competing with 120 development agencies, and over the past four years they secured a number of significant projects from this market. Other Far Eastern investments in Ireland include Saehan Media and Goldstar Company Limited from Korea.  Marketing plans are in place to secure more overseas investment from companies in the Far East and progress on these plans will be reviewed on an on-going basis.</P>
    <P>At present, the IDA is not promoting Ireland in the Middle East as a location for industrial investment.</P>

      <Quest>if he will review the pension entitlement of a person (details supplied) in County Waterford who lost out financially in relation to his pension on the transfer from the Department of Forestry to Coillte Teoranta in view of the fact that he retired on health grounds after 40 years service on 14 December 1984 but did not reach age 65 until 6 July 1990 which was after the vesting date of 1 January 1989 when the agreement, that all pensioners retiring after the vesting day would have their pensions paid by Coillte Teoranta, came into force.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference in the pension scheme operated by Coillte Teoranta in respect of pensioners who retired on or after 1 January 1989 and the pension scheme operated by the Forest Service of my Department in respect of pensioners who retired before that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 1970 retiring forestry workers were only entitled to a pension under the Social Welfare Acts.  In 1970 a non-contributory pension scheme for non-established State employees was introduced to supplement their social welfare pensions.  The forestry pension is co-ordinated with the social welfare pension so that, in the case of a person with forty <Col N="1186" /> years service, the recipients combined income from the State forestry pension and the social welfare pension schemes should in general be equivalent to half his income prior to retirement.</P>
    <P>The person concerned retired in 1984 on the grounds of ill-health and his initial forestry pension was co-ordinated with the appropriate rate of social welfare disability payable on his last day of paid service.  When he received the contributory old age pension in July 1990, which is much higher than the disability rate, his forestry pension had to be reassessed and was reduced downwards to take account of the additional amount payable from the Department of Social Welfare.  When the amounts of the two pensions he is at present in receipt of are combined they should equate approximately to the amounts he was receiving from disability benefit and the forestry pension amount payable prior to the reduction in his forestry pension.</P>
    <P>The person's forestry pension is at present being revised upwards under the normal revision of pensions and he will shortly receive his up-to-date pension together with a small amount of arrears. His pension will continue to increase in line with any relevant future pay increases.</P>

The number of members who retired in recent years on grounds other than reaching the compulsory retirement age has ranged as follows: 135 in 1985, 133 in 1986, 151 in 1987, 211 in 1988 and 150 in 1989.

      <P>I have no evidence that there are any special road safety problems in relation to imported used vehicles.  Such vehicles in the categories which are liable to compulsory roadworthiness testing in this country, must be tested and passed as roadworthy by a vehicle testing station here before being licensed.

Taxis and hackneys are roadworthiness tested by the Garda Síochána public service vehicle inspectors prior to being licensed.</P>

      <P>The proposals submitted by Tipperary North Riding County Council for a by-pass of Nenagh is at present being considered by my Department which will be in touch with the local authority shortly in regard to it.  Delay arose from the need to give priority to the processing of those proposals which are included in the tentative list of major improvement projects planned to commence and/or be completed in the period 1989 to 1993. The timing of a by-pass of Nenagh, which is not included in the tentative list, will be considered in the preparation of future road construction programmes for the period after 1993.</P>

      <P>As both the existing bridge in Celbridge and the site of the proposed new bridge are located on regional roads, responsibility for these projects rests with the local authority, Kildare County Council.  The cost of such works normally falls to be financed from local resources supplemented by the discretionary grants provided by my Department for such roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discretionary grants allocated to Kildare County Council in 1991 total £1,868,000 including a supplementary grant of £500,000 for improvement works which was allocated because of the <Col N="1209" /> special needs of the county.  The determination of priorities in the expenditure of these grants is a matter for the local authority.</P>
    <P>In February 1989 proposals were received in my Department from Kildare County Council for the construction of a relief road at Celbridge.  The proposed scheme would cost an estimated £1.3 million and would include a new crossing of the River Liffey.  In March 1989, my Department wrote to the local authority drawing attention to the normal method of financing such works and informing them that there were no funds available from which a special grant could be provided.</P>
    <P>During the eighties, the strengthening and widening of the existing bridge was the subject of general submissions by the county council to my Department and a strengthening scheme was undertaken in the mid eighties.  No recent proposals have been received from the council on this matter.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the new statutory procedures set out in the Adoption Act, 1991, a suitability assessment for a proposed foreign adoption may only be carried out by a health board or a registered adoption society and must be approved <Col N="1214" /> by the Adoption Board.  An assessment carried out by a social worker acting in a private capacity is not acceptable for the purposes of the new procedures.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Adoption Board have circulated guidelines to the adoption agencies indicating that the standard of suitability assessment for a foreign adoption should be equivalent to that applicable in the case of an Irish adoption.  The Deputy will appreciate therefore that it will take some time for a health board to complete such an assessment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the particular case referred to by the Deputy, I understand that the North Eastern Health Board are currently putting in place arrangements for an efficient and effective foreign adoption assessment process.  The couple concerned have been informed of the position by the health board, who are arranging an information day for all of the people who have requested it to assess them for a foreign adoption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to family visits to persons with mental handicap in accommodation away from home.  In 1971 a scheme of free travel was introduced for parents and families of children in institutions.  The basic qualification for eligibility was that parents should belong to the lower income group &mdash; medical card holders, or be, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the health board, unable without undue hardship to meet the travelling costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of persons with mental handicap the scheme allowed six visits a year for two parents, or other members <Col N="1217" /> of the family, or 12 visits a year for one parent, or other family member.</P>
    <P>The present position is that health boards do assist families with travel on the basis of need as assessed.  This takes the form of using health board transport, support under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, travel vouchers or support to parents and friends associations towards the cost of organising transport for visiting purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The strict system of statutory control of food additives in this country is exercised at two levels: by means of general public health protection measures contained in the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts 1875-1936 and the Food Hygiene Regulations 1950-89 which prohibit the sale of food which is adulterated, contaminated or otherwise unfit for human consumption; and by means of specific controls found in a series of regulations made under the Health Acts, 1947-70 and the European Communities Act 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The food additives controlled by means of specific statutory regulations in this country are colouring agents, preservatives, emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickening and gelling agents, antioxidants, mineral hydrocarbons, solvents and the sweetener, cyclamate.  Broadly speaking the regulations establish &ldquo;permitted lists&rdquo; of additives and, where appropriate, specify the conditions of use and the maximum permitted levels.  Any additive, belonging to any of the aforementioned categories, other than one <Col N="1223" /> included in such &ldquo;permitted lists&rdquo;, is automatically prohibited from use or sale in this country.</P>
    <P>The regulations in question, with the exception of mineral hydrocarbons, solvents and the sweetener, cyclamate, have the effect of implementing various EC Directives on food additives.  Such directives are drawn up on the basis of the advice of the EC Scientific Committee for Food which has expert representatives from each of the twelve member states and are regularly updated to take account of scientific evidence as to the safety in use of and technological need for such additives.</P>
    <P>The EC is currently undertaking a major review of control of additives which, when completed, will result in a comprehensive scheme of control over a wider range of additives.  This country is participating in this exercise with the assistance of the advice of the Food Safety Advisory Committee, an expert body which ensures the best possible advice to me on all aspects of food safety including the use of additives.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of intolerance to additives, as already indicated, the safety in use of additives is the major criterion which requires to be satisfied before an additive is permitted for use.</P>
    <P>The former Food Advisory Committee considered this whole issue and noted that the incidence of adverse reactions was quite low and not a source of concern. The committee were of the opinion that the best way of addressing the problem was by ensuring that the public have full information in relation to the additives contained in food products and is thus in a position to make informed choices in relation to food purchases.  My colleague, Deputy O'Malley, Minister for Industry and Commerce, has responsibility for compositional labelling of foodstuffs and there is in force a comprehensive system of control in this area which is enforced by environmental health officers and the Office of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.</P>
    <P>The control system now in force will be further enhanced by proposals at EC <Col N="1224" /> level for inclusion of specific warnings on labels for particular additives where such a need has been identified.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170, 171 and 172 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in grievance time on 4 July 1991 the report of the Gleeson Commission clearly underlined the desirability of examining the whole question of the present deployment of the Defence Forces.  It is in this context <Col N="1239" /> that the question of rationalisation of FCA units is being addressed.</P>
    <P>No proposals have yet been formulated in this regard.  Examination of the matter is proceeding and there will be no decision in relation to the number of staff to be retained at any particular location until this examination has been completed.</P>
    <P>At present there are almost 800 Permanent Defence Force personnel attached on a regular basis to FCA Command Staffs, units and formations.</P>

      <Quest>whether his Department sanctioned an increase from £58 to £82.60 yearly for the provision of cable television service in New Ross, County Wexford by a company (details supplied) in Dublin 1; if he will outline the basis on which an increase of 44 per cent was considered to be warranted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>An increase in cable television rental charges for the New Ross cable system from £60.71 to £73.26 &mdash; a 20.67 per cent increase &mdash; was approved by me with effect from 1 March 1991.  This increase took into account the rate of inflation since the last price increase in 1986 i.e. 16.4 per cent, and the fact that the company are in the process of making a substantial capital investment to upgrade the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a copyright charge of £9.36 was approved by me in April in order to allow the cable company to recoup the costs of an agreement on charges between the cable operator and the holders of copyright in the programmes relayed.  Rights holders in the programmes relayed by companies have been seeking copyright payments from cable companies for a number of years. Court action was initiated but the rights <Col N="1240" /> holders and the cable operators settled out of court.</P>
    <P>The cost of the copyright payments had not been taken into account by my Department when authorising price levels for cable before as, until the conclusion of the agreements, with one exception, no copyright payments have been made.  Cable companies were not in a position to absorb the extra costs of the copyright agreement without an increase in charges.  In order to allow cable companies to continue to provide their existing services, there was no alternative but to authorise the companies to increase their charges.</P>
    <P>The increases approved are based on the share of the amount required by the rights holders from the cable industry in Ireland and are designed so that no benefit accrues to the cable companies as a result of the increases.</P>

      <P>On 1 April 1991, O'Brien Shipping Ltd. commenced the operation of a new ferry service between Galway and the Aran Islands using the cargo vessel, the <i>Palbro Pride.</i> The <i>Palbro Pride</i>, which is registered in the United Kingdom, was inspected by officers of the Department of the Marine prior to the commencement of the service.  I am informed that a new custom built cargo/passenger vessel is being constructed for the ferry service and that the <i>Palbro Pride</i> is being used to provide an interim service pending completion of the new vessel.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that it is not unusual for vessels registered in other countries to operate in Irish waters. O'Brien Shipping Ltd. are currently examining the possibility of registering the vessel in Ireland.</P>
