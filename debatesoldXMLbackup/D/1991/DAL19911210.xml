      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business proper I have a number of motions under Standing Order 30 to deal with.  I propose to deal with these motions &mdash; under Standing Order 30 &mdash; which I have received from Deputies Mac Giolla and Gilmore together with one from Deputy Jim Higgins on related topics.  I now call on the Deputies to state the matter of which notice has been given to me in the order in which they submitted these notices to my office.  I call first either on Deputy Mac Giolla or Deputy Gilmore.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I wish to advise you that at the commencement of public business today, Tuesday, 10 December 1991, I intend to request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest, namely, the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evidence given at the hearing of the Committee of Public Accounts on Thursday last that the proposal to initiate the purchase by University College, Dublin of Carysfort College came from the former Minister for Education and that the Taoiseach was <Col N="566" /> directly involved in the discussions; the newspaper reports at the weekend that the Taoiseach had a number of hitherto undisclosed meetings with the Chairman of the Smurfit Business School at which certain undertakings were reported to have been given about the availability of the public funds for the running costs of the school; and the need for the Taoiseach and the former Minister for Education now to give full and unequivocal accounts of their involvement in the Carysfort deal to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In view of the extreme urgency of the matter I hope you will agree to my request.</P>

      <P>I, too, wish to seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the purchase, with State funds, of Carysfort College for the Smurfit Business School and the conflicting statements on the matter by the Taoiseach, the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, and the President of University College, Dublin under the following headings:</P>
      <P>(i)  the denial by the Taoiseach of his involvement in the Carysfort College sale to this House on the confidence motion in the Government on 16 October last when he clearly told the House that the transaction was carried out in a perfectly straightforward manner and was not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="567" /> That the House adjourn under Standing Order 30 to discuss the purchase, with State funds, of Carysfort College for the Smurfit Graduate Business School and the clearly conflicting statements on this matter by the Taoiseach, the former Minister for Education, Mrs. O'Rourke, and the President of University College, Dublin.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The ordering of a later sitting this evening is specifically to facilitate the Government taking, in part, the Second Stage of the B &amp; I Line Bill, 1991.  The Workers' Party are implacably opposed to rushing this Bill through the House; indeed they are opposed to it being taken today in view of the evidence emerging that the Government have not had proper or due regard to the staff/management buy-out proposals and the other matters with regard to the financial deal being <Col N="569" /> presented to the proposed purchaser.  We are asking the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> This Bill is a technical piece of legislation which is required as a consequence of the Government decision in 1989 to redeem all outstanding land bonds for cash.  Land bonds were State guaranteed stocks which were used by the Land Commission to purchase land for the purposes of the land settlement policy pursued by Governments since the foundation of the State.  Interest was paid on the bonds twice yearly by dividends until they were redeemed.  Redemption did not take place on a specified date, as is customary with national loans and other gilt-edged stocks, but by means of an annual draw, similar to a lottery.  If a bond number came up, that bond was redeemed.  Land bonds were traded on the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>When land was sold to the Land Commission, the sellers normally received bonds in payment for the land being acquired.  When these lands were subsequently allocated to new owners, payment to the Land Commission was usually made by means of annuities. These annuities were paid into a fund, the land bond fund and the Exchequer made a similar matching contribution to this fund on an annual basis.  The total resources thus provided to the fund were used to pay the dividends on the bonds and to provide a sinking fund to finance the annual land bond redemptions.</P>
    <P>The Government decision to redeem all land bonds on 3 April 1989 out of Exchequer borrowing meant that the two funds central to the administrative arrangements in respect of land bonds were no longer necessary; these funds to which I refer are the land bond fund and the guarantee fund.</P>
    <P>Statutory authority to redeem the outstanding land bonds was conferred by a series of Land and Land Bond Acts, as set out in section 2 (1) of the Bill.  Unfortunately, neither those Acts nor any of the many other Acts dealing with land bonds provided for the winding up of the land bond fund nor the guarantee fund in circumstances in which they were no longer required.  This Bill is thus a tidying-up mechanism to abolish the funds as they no longer have any function to <Col N="579" /> perform.  Section 4, 5 and 6 of the Bill deal with the necessary provisions relating to both funds, including the transfer of moneys at present in, or due to, the funds into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>About £1.8 million of the bonds redeemed in 1989 were classified as &ldquo;unregistered&rdquo;.  That meant that they had been set aside for eventual registration in the names of persons, from whom the Land Commission had acquired lands, when clearance of title to the lands in question had been completed. The moneys in respect of those bonds are held in trust and will earn deposit interest in a special account in the Central Bank up to the time when matters of title are settled and the moneys due to claimants are paid over.  Section 2 of the Bill makes provision for these arrangements.</P>
    <P>Apart from the provisions relating to the land bond fund and the guarantee fund already referred to, this Bill also makes a provision in respect of a third, related, fund, called the costs fund.  This fund bears the costs which are due to vendors of land in respect of expenses incurred in selling their land to the Land Commission.  Existing legislation provides that such costs are payable in land bonds only, so it is necessary to amend the legislation to provide for payment of costs in cash &mdash; now that all land bonds themselves have been redeemed for cash. Section 3 of the Bill makes the necessary legislative amendments.</P>
    <P>Finally, as a result of the dissolution of the guarantee fund under section 4 of the Bill, it is necessary to take action in respect of what are known as cottage purchase annuities.  These are annual payments due to local authorities and made by persons who have purchased cottages from the authorities.  However, legislation provides that these annuities must be collected by the Land Commission in circumstances where the cottage owners are also paying land purchase annuities to the commission. If arrears of cottage purchase annuities occur, the commission still have an obligation to pay the amounts due to the <Col N="580" /> local authorities, and the guarantee fund is liable for these amounts.  Since this fund is being dissolved, however, new arrangements have to be made in respect of the cottage purchase annuities.  The optimum and most cost effective solution to the problem is to waive the annuities, which total less than £2,500 per annum and are falling every year.  Section 7 of the Bill provides for this.</P>
    <P>In addition, however, since an obligation remains on the Land Commission to continue to pay the annual amounts due to the local authorities, arrangements will be made for the Exchequer to pay over the redemption values of the cottage purchase annuities to the local authorities.  This will cost an estimated £25,000.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is essentially a technical non-controversial piece of legislation which becomes necessary as a consequence of the redemption of outstanding land bonds in 1989.  The main object of the Bill is to transfer the assets and liabilities of the land bond fund to the Exchequer as the fund has now outlived its original purpose.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say this is a non-contentious Bill.  I am sure some Deputies will have some contentious comments to make.  It is obviously the prelude to the dissolution of the Land Commission.  I would have thought the legislation would have come before the House several years ago as it was initiated in the mid-eighties, yet in 1991 we are only taking the preliminary steps.  This Land Bond Bill has to be proceeded with if we are to dissolve the Land Commission legally.  It is interesting that one of the funds being abolished under this Bill is the guarantee fund which was established in 1891, 100 years ago.  We have gone backwards in the interim where land policy is concerned.  A successful effort was made in 1891 and there was subsequent legislation in 1923 and in following years, to devise a land policy for all the land holders and potential land holders in this country, particularly <Col N="581" /> smallholders.  That policy has been abandoned.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with this legislation we will have the dissolution of the Land Commission without any statutory body taking its place.  That is a totally undesirable development.  We must have some form of land authority to ensure that the land is properly distributed and that the maximum number of people can make a meaningful living from the land.  We have seen the preliminary steps here for a free-for-all in which everybody and anybody in the EC and not just in Ireland, whether farmers, multinationals, businessmen or financiers can acquire as much land as they can purchase without any reference to this assembly or to the law of the land. It is disgraceful that the Land Commission is being dissolved without allowing for another authority to take its place. Will the Minister make it clear to this House in the ensuing legislation with regard to the abolition of the Land Commission that we will have some, if not total, control in this House as to how the land is to be utilised and by whom?</P>
      <P>This hits at the very roots of our society.  This legislation will bring about a chaotic situation in the sale and distribution of land.  It is not good enough. The most important thing for any Department dealing with land and agriculture is that a statutory body should see to it that the land is used to its maximum potential. If the introduction and passage of this Bill and the subsequent Bill on the dissolution of the Land Commission stops that from happening we have failed the people.  We must have legislation to ensure that there is not a free-for-all in which the weak lose out and the greedy and powerful take over.  This Bill facilitates such a scenario.  It facilitates the return of a feudal system with massive land owners and tenants having to rent land at any price.  We must have controls. There is nobody in the world better at exploiting their fellow countryman than the Irish and that type of exploitation is being invited by this legislation and by the type of legislation being contemplated by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the specifics of the Bill, <Col N="582" /> I was surprised to see that as much as £1.8 million of land bonds are as yet unregistered.  As far as I am aware the Land Commission have not acquired land since the late seventies for subdivision among smallholders.  A sum of £1.8 million is a lot of money considering that the Land Commission have not been active in purchasing land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>There is difficulty in establishing title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It shows how inefficient the system is.  An interesting aspect of the Bill is that cottage purchase annuities will be waived.  There is no longer any need for the people in question to pay those annuities.  I appeal to the Minister and to the Government to see to it that annuities in general are examined with a view to reducing the burden on farmers, particularly small farmers who cannot meet repayments of land annuities.  I am referring to those farmers who bought land from the Land Commission for very high prices in the late seventies and into the early eighties when land was often sold for as much as £3,000 to £4,000 per acre. At present day values that would probably represent £10,000 or £12,000 an acre.  Farmers are going through an extraordinary crisis in incomes while at the same time having to pay annuities based on purchase prices of that order.  It is neither realistic nor just to expect them to continue to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister and the Government will bear in mind the hardship being caused to thousands of our farmers.  I fully agree with the waiver system for the cottage holders and the people with the acre of ground, as obviously the administration of that scheme costs much more than we would actually take in in receipts from the scheme.  The waiver scheme should be extended to relieve the people who are suffering genuine hardship because of their inability to pay top prices for land whose value has diminished tremendously with the fall in agricultural incomes.  Will the Minister let us know if there is any hope or proposal from the Government to help those people who <Col N="583" /> are genuinely suffering?  Is there any hope that a scheme will be devised to relax the payments they are presently enduring?</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House feel there should be some scheme to relieve the burden of those payments and we may be introducing some amendments on this issue as the debate progresses.  I am sure my colleagues from other constituencies have had the same experience as I in regard to these land annuities.  As time progresses and the real value of farm incomes drops and while these land annuities remain as high as ever, people are in genuine difficulty.  I am asking the Minister to deal with this matter in his reply to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State said, this is a technical piece of legislation and the House should deal with it as such. Its purpose is to give effect to a very substantial institutional transformation in our society.</P>
      <P>This is the centenary of the death of Charles Stewart Parnell, among others. One could write the history of the last 100 years of this State by simply writing a history of the struggle for land.  At the centre of this struggle is the Land Commission, and this technical legislation is necessary to give effect to the decision of a previous Administration to abolish it.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission grew out of a need to resolve a major economic conflict between land owner and worker on the land at a time when agriculture was the dominant economic activity of this country. I would like to know what mechanism the Government will put in place of the Land Commission to manage the resource of land and whether it would be connected to the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of the Environment or to a number of different Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no mechanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that is the case. The agenda that resulted in the creation <Col N="584" /> of the Land Commission over 100 years ago, and that went through successive changes from the annuities campaign led by Peadar O'Donnell and foisted upon Éamon de Valera in the thirties, and right through the economic war with Great Britain, has been totally transformed. However, there is a new agenda and to simply say that the old agenda is over is to ignore the fact that we have moved on.</P>
      <P>There is undoubtedly a need for some kind of land management mechanism and, at the end of the day, the Department of Finance must have a central role because, while the land might not necessarily be primarily an agricultural resource, it is an economic resource and it will remain an economic resource both in the area of primary agriculture in terms of maintaining a lifestyle for rural Ireland which, while numbers might decline, will certainly not disappear, and as an economic resource.  If the work of the European Commission as indicated by President Delors is to be taken at face value, his commitment and that of others in the European Community will be to maintain and consolidate rural society for a variety of reasons &mdash; for its own intrinsic worth to begin with, and for the implications that the absolute decline of such a society would have for the rest of European society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will quite clearly be an array of interventionist measures emanating from the Commission which will have a financial dimension and which could, in some cases, very much distort the market for land here in a manner that could lead to a very unacceptable manifestation of landlordism, of exploitation of one kind or another.  I make this point because the Department of Finance will have a central role providing incentives for different kinds of land activity.  We have seen what happened in Scotland in ecological terms where the Highlands were reafforested with coniferous plantations on a scale that was damaging to the overall ecological balance of the natural habitat of a very beautiful part of the continent of Europe.  Now that we have had the experience of that kind of <Col N="585" /> activity, similar concerns must be expressed in this House.</P>
    <P>In agreeing to a technical measure to provide for the abolition of the Land Commission whose historic role has now ended, it is appropriate that we send a clear message to the powers that be in Government that the mere abolition of the Land Commission cannot be a negative step; there must be an alternative mechanism of land management.  It may be that this area of responsibility could be added to the remit of the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>There are factors that will have an economic dimension to them that would be as important to the fabric of rural society as agriculture originally was.  The conservation of natural habitats may become an economic activity with people living in rural Ireland earning an income from that kind of work.  The ownership of such natural habitats will, therefore, have to be worked out.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance, through the Office of Public Works, is probably one of the largest single owners of such lands.  I refer particularly to an area in Connemara with which I am familiar where the acquisition of additional land is at this moment being discussed.  For some time the State will have both a direct and an indirect role in managing this kind of area which is seen as having intrinsic value and is no longer &mdash; fortunately for those people who had the good fortune to escape it &mdash; inhabited by people living in very meagre and poor circumstances.</P>
    <P>This land is, nevertheless, of extraordinary value from a variety of points of view.  That land will have to be managed. The market for that land will have to be constructed in a way that meets the needs of the 21st century, but in a manner that is dissimilar to the way the Land Commission met the needs of the 19th and 20th centuries.</P>
    <P>Tourism, recreation, marine development and mariculture will impact in areas that were previously the responsibility of the Land Commission.  A positive framework must be put in place to co-ordinate <Col N="586" /> the development plans of the local authorities. As many Members of this House will recognise, large tracts of these lands, particularly in rural counties, are in no way affected by the development plan for the county, which is the development control mechanism.  There is no overall system that monitors the use of the land outside the built up urban areas or the market mechanism that provides for its exchange between a willing vendor and a willing purchaser.</P>
    <P>For those reasons it is necessary to point out to the Department of Finance that the mere abolition of the Land Commission does not absolve the State from the necessity to provide a new framework that will address itself to the needs of the 21st century in terms of managing the land resources of the whole of this island. I would hope that we will get the co-operation of our friends and colleagues in Northern Ireland in that respect.</P>
    <P>I have one or two questions on technical points in the Bill to which the Minister might reply.  From the information that has been given to the House it appears that what we are doing is closing down two or three statutory accounts for which no mechanism was originally provided, and transferring the balances in those accounts to a central fund which will be at the disposal of the Minister for Finance.  It appears that all the outstanding land bonds were redeemed in 1989 at a value of £76 million.  I presume the amount borrowed, which underpins the redemption and is approximately £10 million per year, forms part and parcel of our national borrowing requirement and is not identified as a separate account in the Estimates but rather is included with a number of other items.</P>
    <P>Given that there is an outstanding balance of £1.8 million in relation to property the title of which has yet to be established, is it possible that the title in some instances will never be clearly established and that after a certain period a residual amount of money will effectively be forfeited or be kept in perpetuity? The Minister of State made reference to this matter in his speech.  I <Col N="587" /> would like to know if there will be a cutoff point.  As Deputy Deasy said, the Land Commission have not been buying land for quite some time.  I note also that the registration of title can be a cumbersome, slow and indefinite process but there is a time limit, ultimately.  I wonder, therefore, at what stage will a line be drawn, when we will no longer have any obligation in respect of this matter because a title cannot be established.  Will legislation be needed to resolve the matter at that stage or does this legislation contain within it the necessary legal mechanisms to clear the slate and finalise the accounts?  Will the Minister of State respond to those two questions when replying?</P>

      <P>Land and the ownership of it, has been a major issue throughout modern Irish history.  This Bill in many ways marks the continuation of a policy to allow people to purchase land.  The demand for ownership of land, as stated in the land wars of the 1880s, the consolidation of this State as an independent state and the Land Act, 1923 led to the creation of a land policy which has not served this country well.</P>
      <P>The Land Act, 1923, was pushed through by the then Minister for Agriculture, Paddy Hogan, to transfer unpurchased holdings from landlords to tenants.</P>
      <P>The policy which followed the 1923 Act was characterised as an agricultural policy but it was not such a policy.  Since that time agricultural policy has been concerned with maximising the incomes of farmers but it has wrongly viewed agriculture as an industry in its own right rather than as the first stage of an integrated scheme combined with processing and marketing.  Agriculture is in crisis today not because of the proposed reform of the Common Agricultural Policy but because of the largely misconceived notion about the role of land in such a policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is the latest financial mechanism to enable people purchase land, will give effect to the Government <Col N="588" /> decision of 1989 to redeem outstanding land bonds for approximately £76 million and will establish a system under which annuities will be paid directly to the Exchequer.  Another feature of the Bill is the provision under which annuities will be waived in the case of those who purchased their cottages under the Labourers Act, 1936.  In effect this provision will allow arrears, owed by small agricultural labourers, to be written off. That is a sensible move.  The agricultural policies pursued during the years have tended to help the big farmers only to the detriment of small farmers and have contributed to the disappearance of the agricultural labourers class.  This can be traced back to the Land Act, 1923 and the policies pursued by Paddy Hogan and successive Ministers for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Land bonds issued by the Land Commission in respect of land purchased amounted to, in effect, a mortgage scheme organised by the State.  The 1986 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention to the outstanding arrears of land annuities and the rent collection position due to the high price of land at the time of purchase.  The price of land rocketed during the bonanza years, in the late seventies of the Common Agricutural Policy.  As the Minister is aware, many farmers had to purchase land from the Land Commission at very high prices because people with fat cheque books bid against them.  The Land Commission sold the land at its market value and, as a consequence, people are now in trouble.  The Minister should look sympathetically at this matter.</P>
    <P>On one occasion I advised the Land Commission that there were two smallholders who were interested in a sub-division due to take place a short time later.  They met all the criteria laid down by the Land Commission but on the day of the auction a businessman paid £4,000 an acre for the land.  The two smallholders concerned could not compete. I cite this as an example of what happened at that time.  The price paid for the land was far in excess of its agricultural value.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> The Common Agricultural Policy failed miserably to develop a comprehensive system of industrial and marketing linkage between the producer on the land and the consumer of food, timber or horticultural products.  During the years hundreds of millions of pounds were given to farmers by way of development grants without any agreed targets being set.  The Workers Party have continually argued that what is needed is a land use plan which will maximise the overall contribution of the sector to the economy in terms of income generated and employment created.  A land use plan should specify how all parts of national territory should be used and identify those areas best suited to forestry as against conventional agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Bill which will shortly come before the Daíl to abolish the Land Commission will leave a vacuum.  There is a need to establish a land authority similar to the Industrial Development Authority.  The Workers Party call for such an authority to be established.  The Land Commission deterred inadequate production and the purchase of farms by non-farmers. People are aware that this control no longer exists, while sub-division is under siege.  What is required is a short to medium term response with the aim of continuing the policy of making people aware that there is a lack of funds.</P>
    <P>It should be our aim to introduce a new land policy as the land is our greatest natural resource.  If what we produce on the land was manufactured and marketed we would create jobs in the future.  This has not been happening because we have no policy.  The Minister should consider enlarging holdings, controlling purchases, the position in relation to inheritance and land leasing.  If additional land was made available to people on reasonable terms they would work it.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to do away with the Land Commission.  What then is the plan for land use by the Government?  Will we return to the bad old days of landlordism and gross exploitation of tenant farmers by greedy speculators to drive small farmers off the land?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House.  Its primary function provides for the dissolution of the guarantee fund which was established under the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1891, and the land bond fund established under the Land Act, 1923, and the transfer of moneys from the two funds to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Land bonds were State guaranteed security created and issued by the Minister for Finance for the purpose of paying for land purchased by the Land Commission. At the time the Minister for Finance controlled the fund &mdash; the land bond fund &mdash; which paid all dividends due on land bonds and into which annuities were paid and collected by the Land Commission from persons to whom the land was resold.  If, at that time, the price paid for the land equalled the sum received from its resale and if there were no arrears, the system of land purchased was self-financing.  However, as a result of lower resale prices, the downward revision of annuities and arrears meant that the Exchequer was required to pay approximately half the dividends due on the land bonds.  Arrears on annuities have increased considerably over the past number of years and many farmers in my constituency of Wexford are in arrears to a considerable extent.  The prime reason is the high cost of land annuities because of the high interest rates charged years ago.  It is a very serious problem and a difficult situation for small farmers who have tried to get a settlement for the purchase of land.  They owe considerable annuities and, as I said, their problems stemmed from the high interest rates charged in the early eighties.  I ask the Minister to look sympathetically at their situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ability of farmers to met these high land annuities has been eroded because of a decline in farmer incomes in recent years.  Many farmers are so far in arrears that it is impossible for them to meet their commitments given the economic situation in farming at present.  It is worth pointing out that those facing such difficulties are small farmers who received <Col N="591" /> land from the Land Commission to extend their holdings and to improve their viability.  If a serious effort is not made to resolve land annuity problems many small farmers will have little option but to dispose of land to meet their commitments which would have the effect of further disimproving their viability and, ultimately, forcing such families off the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food set up an inter-Departmental group which are currently examining the land annuity issue with a view to making recommendations to resolve the issue of land annuity arrears.  I hope they will put forward practical recommendations which will provide a meaningful and permanent solution to the problem of arrears facing many farmers today.</P>
    <P>The Bill is winding-up legislation. While I welcome it and compliment the Minister on introducing it, I should like him and the Government to focus on the problem of outstanding arrears and annuities for small farmers.  Week after week in my constituency small farmers come to my clinic in desperation looking for a settlement figure to enable them to get on with farming so that they can maintain their families.  I ask the Minister to take the opportunity over the coming months to solve this problem once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an historic occasion to be able to speak on this Bill.  The guarantee fund, which this Bill dissolves, was established under the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1891, to enable farmers to purchase land from the Land Commission and to ensure that there would be a guarantee fund.  In doing away with the guarantee fund we are effectively dissolving the Land Commission.  However, the Government have not put forward proposals in regard to setting up an authority whereby they would monitor what is happening to land.  I am afraid there will not be any controls in relation to land.  Some controls are required and there should be an essential requirement whereby the Government would be able <Col N="592" /> to monitor what is happening in relation to land purchases, sales and transfers.  In all my time in politics I have never seen as many small farmers in financial difficulties and under such pressure from financial institutions, the associated banks, the ACC and building societies.</P>
      <P>Many farmers are obliged to sell their lands which are being acquired by larger farmers and people in business.  A dangerous trend is developing; I do not have to remind the House of the serious decline in the numbers involved in farming. Since 1980 the numbers have declined from somewhere in the region of 240,000 farming families to 158,000. They may not be the exact figures but I am sure the Minister will confirm the general trend.  The IFA referred to problems confronting farmers in relation to land purchase annuities.  They estimate that 2,000 farmers have a chronic problem because of extremely high payments and that they have a very high level of arrears.  The IFA document goes on to state that 14,000 farmers are in arrears. Many farmers obtained land from the Land Commission at a time when the Commission purchased the land at a cost of £2,000 to £3,000 per acre.  These lands were let later by the Land Commission to farmers at a very high level of annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a regular basis I discuss problems with farmers in my constituency &mdash; I am sure these problems are experienced on a nationwide basis &mdash; some of whom are unable to pay their Land Commission annuities.  They depend on headage payments and other grants, whether for cows, sheep or whatever, to make these repayments.  What is happening &mdash; and I object to this &mdash; is that the Department are retaining those grants in lieu of annuities.  Some people will say, that is business and it is hard luck.  However in my constituency there are farmers who have not got enough food on the table to feed themselves and their families.  The Minister should give very sympathetic consideration to the matter of these deductions against annuities, which should be of concern to the Minister; it is certainly of concern to me.  Many farmers are in serious financial difficulty <Col N="593" /> and I would offer a suggestion to the Minister and his advisers which would perhaps solve the problem of annuity arrears faced by farmers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something that should be in the legislation.  A number of Bills will be dealing with this matter. However, there is an opportunity for the Minister to consider the situation.  To alleviate the problems of farmers who face great annuity repayments I propose that the Minister consider a scheme such as the 1988 tenant purchase scheme introduced by the Department of the Environment and operated by local authorities.  Under that scheme the local authorities calculated the price of a house and gave a 40 per cent discount to tenants, with a further 10 per cent discount for pre-1960 houses, together with a discount of £2,000 in lieu of new house grant.  Many farmers would favour such a scheme which could be set up in co-operation with the Department and the Land Commission.  The total annuities due could be capitalised and a discount allowed if the moneys were paid within a <Col N="594" /> five year period.  Loans could be obtained from the ACC or the banks.  Many farmers will be in serious debt for years to come if a solution is not found.</P>
      <P>I have outlined the decline in the numbers involved in agriculture.  That position will deterioriate even further unless some remedy is proposed.  I have discussed this matter with farmers throughout my constituency of Laois-Offaly who believe that if a scheme of the kind I mentioned was introduced it would go a long way towards solving the problem.  I think the Minister will agree that the decline in incomes is such that something will have to be done to keep farmers on the land.  I can supply the Minister with further details in this regard, although I am sure his officials can obtain these details from the Department of the Environment.  As I have suggested, the amounts due should be capitalised and the farmers should receive a generous discount if the money is paid within five years.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that some funds have not been collected as a result of a title problem, and I can understand that. I would ask the Minister to request his officials to have such problems resolved. In some cases when the Land Commission acquired land the money was held in trust.  Some of the families involved may have since died or the solicitors dealing with the cases may have died with the result that these cases have been left aside and have not been dealt with.  The Minister said that the figure for bonds redeemed in 1989 and classified as unregistered is £1.8 million.  I would ask the Minister to see if those cases can be reactivated so that the people can be paid for the lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem that arises is the considerable delays in the vesting of land. As I understand it, when a farmer was allotted land the Land Commission vested the land in his name.  The Land Commission had to acquire these lands from other people and very often problems arose with rights of way, water, fencing and so on.  I am aware that there is a shortage of staff in the Department and there are problems with mapping and <Col N="595" /> so on, but in some cases the vesting of land takes from five to 15 years.  I know of farmers who, having been allotted land by the Land Commission&mdash;in some cases the rent was fully paid &mdash; built on the land but then discovered that the land had not been vested.  It would be of benefit to everybody if that problem could be resolved.  The Minister may think the problem is not that extensive but as far as I can see quite a few people are left in that position.</P>
    <P>Farming is going through a difficult time.  The situation in agriculture is every bit as serious as it was in 1966 at the height of the farmers' rights campaign. More time needs to be devoted to a discussion on agriculture.  This Bill is of some benefit as it gives us the opportunity to highlight the problems confronting farmers.  I ask the Minister to seek ways to resolve the difficulties that farmers have in paying their Land Commission annuities, and to consider the idea I put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical Bill. I will take the opportunity, however, to express my views and some of my reservations about aspects of the Bill.  The Land Commission have done excellent work over the years and were responsible for setting up many family farms throughout the country at a time when agriculture was a much more attractive proposition than it is today.  Like other speakers, I am very aware of the great difficulties being experienced by farmers at present with their Land Commission annuity arrears.  This crisis is not unique to any county.  The same problems exist throughout the entire country and it is easy to understand the reasons for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Back in the late seventies and eighties, the Land Commission acquired land at a high cost and these holdings were eventually allocated to the farmers in need of additional land.  Naturally, the annuity to be paid had to reflect the price which the Land Commission had paid for the land. People who acquired land at that time find themselves today in an impossible position.  We are all too well aware of <Col N="596" /> declining incomes from agriculture.  It is difficult for any farmer to survive without having to meet repayments on loans from the lending institutions.</P>
    <P>The person who has to pay a Land Commission annuity is in the same position and he is finding it impossible to do so.  The former Minister for Agriculture and Food recognised there was a problem and set up a working committee to look into the area of annuity repayments.  I have advocated for a long time that the Department work out a procedure to offer some relief to farmers in this position. Indeed, we all saw how well the general tax amnesty worked in relation to the payment of tax arrears and the money that accrued to the Exchequer as a result, and I do not see why something similar should not be done about the arrears in Land Commission annuities.  I appeal to the Minister and the working committee that the farmers in this position should be given a general amnesty and also a reasonable period to negotiate a loan so that they could write off their annuities at a reasonable rate.  In the light of the present difficulties, I think that is a reasonable request and I hope the Minister will give it serious consideration when the working committee reports back to him.</P>
    <P>At present the practice in the Department is to withhold grants and headage payments in respect of outstanding annuities.  I seriously question whether it is right, or even legal, to withhold these payments.  Many people are dependent on them simply to exist, particularly coming up to Christmas.  I am aware of many cases where these payments are being withheld and, again, it emphasises the difficulties people are experiencing. Those involved in agriculture were always proud to pay their way over the years but now they are not in a position to do so.  These payments are owed to them and it is very disheartening to have them withheld in lieu of annuity arrears. I hope the Minister will examine my suggestion of some type of amnesty, or at least discuss the problem with the farming organisations so that some arrangement can be reached.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> I have found in the past number of years that there is nobody in the Land Commission to whom one can make a case or who will call on the farmer to discuss his problems.  The previous speaker referred to problems over rights of way and with titles and farmers are being left to rectify these problems themselves. I cannot, for example, ring up somebody in the Land Commission to discuss a problem and there seems to be a great indifference to the farmers who find themselves in a difficult position.  The Department should be able to provide some solutions to the problems facing farmers.  Indeed, I know that Coillte Teoranta found it impossible to deal with the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Land Commission did excellent work but perhaps due to a lack of staff or uncertainty of their position it is now very difficult for a farmer to get satisfaction when dealing with them at present.  I have always maintained that there is a great need for a land authority of some type and it is important that this be given serious consideration.  European cohesion is probably the most important topic at present, but I wonder what will happen to us if we become a part of a united states of Europe as envisaged.  At present foreigners are buying huge tracts of land in Ireland.  I would not like to see this trend of land going out of Irish ownership continuing, but the indications are that it will become much worse. Whatever form the new authority will take, I hope their powers will be strengthened in order to protect the future of Irish agriculture.  The sale of land to foreigners was more prevalent in the west, but it is now spreading to the other provinces.</P>
    <P>I wish to reiterate that the question of Land Commission annuity arrears is the most difficult problem facing people at present.  A very encouraging sign in dealing with the problem was the setting up of the working committee.  I hope that the Minister and the Department, having set up that committee, will ensure that the future of those who were fortunate enough to have received Land Commission divisions but who are the unfortunate ones today because of changed <Col N="598" /> circumstances, will be protected.  I earnestly request that the Minister consider the position most favourably with a view to bringing about a solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the Land Bond Bill gives the House the opportunity to consider related problems. The Bill is technical.  Principally it provides for the dissolution of the guarantee fund established under the Purchase of Land Act, 1891, the land bond fund established under the Land Act, 1923, and transfers the moneys in those funds to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a testimony to all that is wrong because of the lack of a land policy in Ireland.  Not alone do we not have a land policy, but it is my understanding, that neither the Department of Agriculture and Food nor any other Department carry out research for the compilation of a reasonable land policy. That shows a complete lack of understanding by this Government, and many other Governments, about the enormous problems, current and potential, confronting the rural community.  I do not have to point out to the House that it is of paramount importance that the Government themselves adopt a land use policy that will take note of the sweeping changes brought about by reform within the European Community.  It is very important that we work to produce such a policy from here on in.  Although it is late to be starting now, it is better late than never.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle understands this better than most.  The Land Commission was set up at the turn of the century and provided opportunities for many thousands of people by purchasing huge tracts of land from landlords through the land bond system, and subsequently redistributed the land to peasants, as they were then called, people who were landless or very small farmers.  I have to admit, as I have said in the Chamber on many occasions, that that part of the exercise was of tremendous importance to the rural community. In the past 50, 70 or 80 years many people who would not otherwise have been able <Col N="599" /> to purchase an acre of land were given the opportunity to farm.</P>
    <P>While speaking about land bonds, I cannot allow this occasion to pass without saying that, in my view, purchasing by the land bond systems was daylight robbery. I have never been able to understand how land bonds were considered legal or constitutional, and I have no doubt that if, in the present legal climate where everything is questioned, any Minister for Lands, Minister for Agriculture, or any group, tried to bring in the concept of land bonds today there would be a public hanging at dawn because such a concept would not be constitutional.  However, that is all water under the bridge and there is not much point delaying the Chamber by talking too much about it.  Suffice to say that when many people around hear about the dissolution of the land bond system under this Bill they are likely to throw their caps in the air.  Land bonds cost many people a lot of money and caused a lot of frustration. When selling their land they were not able to get the market price but had to accept land bonds; they also had to accept considerably less than they would have obtained on the open market.  That problem was nothing compared to the problem faced by those people when they went to cash their land bonds on the Stock Exchange.  There is no way of calculating how much money was lost down the years because of that policy.  For those reasons I have no difficulty with that part of the Bill which says goodbye to a very bad page in history.  I have no doubt that whatever Government may be in power in the next 50 years or so, they will have nothing to do with land bonds in any size, shape or form.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on all Members who represent rural constituencies to mention several issues in relation to the Bill.  A sum of £76 million is mentioned as being the total value of land bonds outstanding, calculated in 1989.  From my experience of being involved with the Department, I understand there will be a huge bill for <Col N="600" /> the Exchequer the day the Land Commission is dissolved legally.  The Department must be able to calculate exactly what the price tag will be, and when replying I should like the Minister to say what the cost to the Exchequer will be.  I assume what will happen is that all land bonds will cease to exist, thus leading to the huge cost for the Exchequer.  People should be in no doubt that the Land Commission is already dissolved and has been so for several years &mdash; if ever there was a dead duck it was the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>No one seems to be worried about the need for a new land policy, or a new land use policy which would be much more appropriate.  It is very important that there should be a land use programme to give effect to the aspiration of many young trained farmers to earn their living in agriculture.  One issue clouding the subject relates to environmentally sensitive issues, such as afforestation, and that is a matter to which I will refer in a moment.  Many people, particularly those in authority, seem to forget that agriculture in Ireland is still very important; it is not as important as it used to be but it is very important.  If we accept that fact then it follows that those who make up the agricultural industry are equally important.  If we are to compete against the best farmers in Europe and outside, and we will have to do that, then it is important that our people be among the best trained.</P>
    <P>Any land use policy to be introduced in Ireland would have to acknowledge the presence of the corps of young people coming through the system.  It is obvious that we will not be able to compete if we have a nation of elderly farmers; you cannot teach an old dog new tricks.  I am worried that the heart of the matter seems to have been forgotten, but that will have to be brought back to centre stage in a land use policy, which will eventually have to be discussed in the House.</P>
    <P>When I talk about a land use policy I acknowledge that there are conflicting demands now being made on the environment. For instance, for commercial reasons there is a large pro-afforestation <Col N="601" /> lobby.  I have no doubt that it is good for our economy and utilises much bad land inhabited only by snipe over the years but, at the same time, there are certain responsibilities we must honour and checks and balances we must use to ensure we do not overdo it.  I happened to attend a meeting last evening in a little village called Woodford on the Galway-Clare border, with hills surrounding that lovely little hamlet.  Because of the advantageous grants being given for afforestation, in ten years' time, if all of that afforestation is allowed, one will not even be able to see that lovely little village. I do not think that people living in such a village should be encircled by tall trees.  It would appear that this land usage is being encouraged from an environmental point of view but what about people's leisure time about which the Europeans are talking?  For instance, how can we ensure there will be sufficient wetlands &mdash; of which there are plenty in the area I represent &mdash; made available? In striking a proper balance I realise that one would need to be Solomon in all his glory.  It is up to the Minister, his Department, Teagasc and others to consider such matters and have them debated here in the House.</P>
    <P>There are other matters worthy of mention in relation to this Bill and in this respect I want to echo something referred to by all Members, namely, the huge burden land annuities have become on farmers.  When I sat where the Minister is now sitting it was bad then.  I must admit there was not much done about the matter then either; it is not a political matter, as such.  Obviously farm incomes have worsened considerably since the mid-eighties.  We tinkered with the matter on a few occasions.  I remember meeting some officials present today who were involved at that time; I remember having met a group from County Wexford who were paying approximately £180 per acre annually.  The annuities were that high at that time; unless one shook gold dust on the land or collected it, one could not make them pay.  We were able to reduce it slightly but it was not of any real significance.  Market <Col N="602" /> forces being what they were at the time, it is fair to say the Land Commission had to pay for the land at market value before getting it.  There was a great clamour of protest countrywide around 1981 when I had not been a Member of this House for long.  One's clinics were packed with people contending that certain estates were being divided and people wanted a space.  Always the last question to be posed was: will I be able to pay for it, or will it be good for me?  One cannot blame the Land Commission for the fact that the land was dear at that time.  Many people to whom I have spoken over the past seven or eight years, and particularly within the past two, would have been much better off had they never got that land.  They now have it, many of them are vested as such, farming is their livelihood, there is no way one can reverse that engine nor do I think anybody would ask them to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright raised a very good point, one I heard the IFA make on a number of occasions.  I accept that we are always good at spending somebody else's money.  Obviously this is something that will have to be considered very carefully. Given what is happening to the Common Agricultural Policy and in the GATT negotiations, there is no reason to believe that agricultural incomes will be any better next year, or in five years time, than they have been last year or the preceding year; that is the general belief. As long as the Land Commission pursue their policy of charging the rates they are legally entitled to do, it will create enormous hardship and will eventually lead to court cases.  This will mean that the Land Commission will bring farmers to court, something they were always very slow to do; that is the way we are trudging along.  Particularly, when the Land Commission has been wound down, the last or final fling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>If it transpires that there is a fairly big price tag when the Land Commission is dissolved, there will <Col N="603" /> be eyebrows raised at the accumulated losses.  I contend this would be an opportune time to examine the huge list in Castlebar of people now unable to meet their annuities.  On grounds of equity, any fair-minded person would accept the validity of doing something like that.</P>
      <P>I am not talking about eliminating the annuities altogether, not at all.  There is no point in talking about a farmer paying, say, £150, £160, £180 or even £100 per acre even for very poor land.  The commercial reality is that that game is long over.  Rather, I am talking about reducing the annuities to a reasonable figure.  I am not in a position to predict how reasonable because they would vary from one part of the country to another based on the quality of land and so on.  I should like an estimate of the cost to the taxpayer if such a substantial reduction were made at this stage.  In that respect it would be worth examining policy in the Department of the Environment with regard to their sale of local authority houses.  There were good and cogent reasons for people to own their homes.  Similarly, there are cogent reasons for allowing a farmer own his land.  It is a huge subject we have not sufficient time to go into in depth today. Nonetheless there is a case for the Minister and the Government to examine that proposal to ascertain how it could be done in a balanced fashion so that it would not be perceived as yet another charity, a social welfare claim or whatever, but rather done for good reasons, at the end of the day representing good business on the part of the Land Commission because those annuities will not be collected anyway.  It must be recognised that many farmers will be unable to meet present annuity demands on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another matter raised on both sides of the House today, namely, the manner in which the Land Commission decided in recent years to collect grants due to farmers under the ewe premium, cow suckler schemes and so on, in lieu of arrears of annuities on Land Commission land.  If I were ever given charge of a Government Department I might argue that would be a way one <Col N="604" /> could get the money at source in that one could contend it was given out by one hand of the Department, owed to the other, and what is wrong with passing it from one to the other?  I must put down a marker to the effect that I think the Minister is acting unconstitutionally here.  I am not saying there is anything wrong in some cases in that there may be people who could and should have paid such annuities.  Nonetheless, I would have to accept what Deputy Enright said that there are people waiting for these cheques to cover their normal living expenses, particularly where there are children in the family, only to be informed that the money has been siphoned off to Castlebar and they will not now receive it.  That is not fair play.</P>
    <P>About two years ago the Minister for Finance introduced a budget which provided for powers of attachment to be given to the Revenue Commissioners. Under certain conditions, the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to go to the Department of Agriculture and Food or to a livestock mart or creamery and confiscate the money due to a certain farmer. I do not believe the Department of Agriculture and Food have the same right under the law and they are, therefore, acting outside the law in these instances. It is only a matter of time until it is claimed that the power of attachment has been used illegally against an individual and unless the Department change their ways they will be in trouble.  That is a symptom of the problem to which I referred earlier.  An ideal opportunity has arisen whereby a deal can be done for the benefit of the Department and farmers which will allow the latter to get rid of this huge burden.</P>
    <P>There are two or three other important points I wish to raise.  Everything I have said has been directly related to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Some annuities are very small.  There were times when landowners were given the opportunity of paying off a bulk sum because it was not worth sending out a bill for small sums of £2, £3 or £4 per half year.  I assume that a large number of people accepted that system.  There are others who would owe £40 or £60 per half year or maybe somewhat more.  Surely the option should be given to those people to pay off the few hundred pounds, instead of using up computer space and wasting the time of civil servants who should be sending out headage payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill gives a timely warning that the Government are remiss in their attitude to a land policy.  What has happened in important areas such as commonage division?  It is only a trickle at present.  If the Government cannot handle it, why not allow the people involved in commonage to employ their own engineer and draw up a draft plan which could be signed by a Land Commission inspector, if such is to be found in the Twenty-six Counties?  If the Government have not <Col N="606" /> the staff to do this work, they should allow people to do it themselves.</P>
    <P>In the mid-eighties much effort was put into the development of long term leasing, but it seems now to be as dead as a doornail.  There is a place for that system.  It should be considered again, refined and commented upon publicly. The trouble about any change in land policy is that it takes a long time to catch on or die off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many regulations already drawn up in the Department which would allow this system to operate efficiently, given certain financial inducements.  There is certainly a market for it.  It would not suit small farmers but the first and second sons of medium and large farmers could make a living on the basis of long term land leasing, sharing the machinery, the farmyard or the herd.  We are not doing anything about it.  The Minister of State is doing an excellent job in regard to horticulture but I do not hear any talk about land policy.  Nobody wants to touch it but it is as important today as it was 20 or 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>The question of a retirement scheme for farmers is being kicked around Europe.  This is a matter which concerns people who left the land and whose bonds we are dealing with today.  There is an obvious connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is beyond even the Deputy's ingenuity to relate that to the technicalities of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that a hash should not be made of this retirement scheme.  There should be no ambiguity about who is entitled to get the money and there should not be an army of social welfare inspectors running around after them.  The scheme must be <Col N="607" /> clear and well defined, aimed specifically at retiring certain types of people.</P>
      <P>Now that we are getting rid of land bonds, who will carry out the necessary research?  There are not two civil servants who are thinking about a new land policy. It is incumbent on the Government in an agricultural country to ensure that we have a policy fit for the next century. There used to be people in the Department of Agriculture and Food involved in this work and now there are organisations like Teagasc.  Every day people in the research station at Belclare which is outside Tuam carry out research which will be of benefit to people in rural Ireland in the future.  However, all of a sudden we hear that that facility is to be closed. Members on the other side of the House seem to think that integrated rural development, the great white hope, is the answer to all problems.  Even if £20 million, £25 million or £50 million was put into the north-west in the morning how could we be sure that this would be of benefit to the area in five to ten year's time?  Yet the people who care about such matters and are paid to carry out research into such matters will be unemployed in a few weeks' time.  The entire system is crazy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright referred to the question of vesting.  Who will carry out this job when the Land Commission is dissolved? This will affect everyone even though many people will not realise it until the Land Commission is gone.  I want to refer to a case involving a young lad who got a site from his father to build a house. His father had got the land from the Land Commission ten or 15 years ago.  There were some problems with a neighbour &mdash; I will not go into the details now &mdash; who got land but who was not registered. Because everyone has to be registered before vesting can take place, this young fellow, who has nothing to do with farming and never will have, cannot get a loan to build his house.  In order to get a loan he has to have some sort of security and would have to have the deeds which he cannot now get.  Obviously there are many aspects to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> The Bill before us today will not make much difference one way or the other as it is only enabling legislation.  While the points Deputies have raised here today are of fundamental importance to rural Ireland, I am worried that not even one line of what we have said will appear in any of tomorrow's newspapers.  This worries me greatly.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> My contribution will be brief.  I should like to take the debate out of the west of Ireland arena and put on record the problems being experienced by small and poorer farmers in County Wexford and along the south-east coast.  This Bill proposes the dissolution of the guarantee fund established under the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1891, and the land bond fund established under the Land Act, 1923.  I do not think too many farmers will be concerned about the dissolution of the land bond fund as, I think, many of them cursed the payments system.  In many ways it was something of a lottery whether farmers got money for the land they gave to the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last Coalition Government, of which Deputy Connaughton was a member, decided to abolish the Land Commission.  I am not too upset about the abolition of the Land Commission. While they served their purpose, in many cases the price of land was too expensive. <Col N="609" /> There was also a public perception that land was given to people on the basis of political allegiance.  I think that politicans got more hassle and abuse over the alloction of lands by the Land Commission than they did in regard to any other issue.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> There is no doubt that politicians lost the support of many farmers who did not get land.  I had been a Member of this House for only a short time when a Land Commission farm in my area was divided up.  Even though Fianna Fáil were not in Government at the time, for some unknown reason five or six Fianna Fáil farmers got the land.  All hell broke loose because Fine Gael had not looked after their supporters. On other occasions it worked in reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I believe there was too much political patronage in the allocation of Land Commission land. There were queues at politicians' doors whenever Land Commission land became available.  It was only when farmers got the land that they realised how expensive it was and many of them found it almost impossible to make the annual repayments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people I want to make a case for here today are farmers, particularly small family farmers, who got land from the Land Commission, have massive arrears and cannot meet their repayments.  I welcome the setting up by the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, of a working group to examine the question of annuities and the massive arrears accumulated by farmers. I hope they will report back as quickly as possible on how this problem can be resolved.  At present many farmers particularly small family farmers cannot meet their repayments.  As Deputy Connaughton said, repayments on land in County Wexford were as high as £180 per acre.  There is no way small farmers can meet those high repayments.  I do not know how the interest rates operated but <Col N="610" /> they seemed to be based on the interest rate fixed by the banks at that time. During the seventies and early eighties when interest rates were high &mdash; they are probably still too high so far as we are concerned &mdash; farmers accumulated massive debts.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine the possibility of introducing an amnesty or write-off system for those farmers.  Many farmers have told me that they would be prepared to make a once-off payment where the interest accumulated would be written off and the capital reduced to a reasonable amount.  Some speakers have suggested the introduction of a system similar to the 1988 tenant purchase scheme while others have suggested the introduction of a substantial write-off system.  Regardless of what type of system is introduced, it is important that it is done as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Farmers are under severe pressure from the Land Commission to make their repayments and their sons and daughters have to leave the family farm because of this inability to pay.  At a time when there is so much talk about the necessity to keep young people on family farms and the importance of family farms, it is essential that some scheme is introduced without delay.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the working group report back as quickly as possible, taking into account the worthwhile views expressed by Members on both sides of the House. I hope that, unlike other committees who take ages to report back and whose reports are left lying on shelves for a number of years, this working group will put forward a solution to this problem which can be implemented speedily.</P>
    <P>As regards a new land authority, I see a need for some type of system which would enable smaller farmers to acquire lands which come on the market. However, I am not sure whether as members of the EC we could establish a land authority or introduce a selective system which would enable smaller farmers to buy land.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on this point.  At present the land in County Wexford &mdash; and I think in most other counties &mdash; is being <Col N="611" /> purchased by foreigners or big land owners or, as they are known in my constituency, cheque book farmers.  There is no opportunity for the farmer with 30, 40 or 50 acres to increase his holding.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the time has come for the Government to consider making low interest loans available through the banks to small farmers to enable them increase their holdings.  Nowadays, it is said farmers must have a 70 or an 80 acre farm to be viable, yet small farmers are not in a position to purchase land because they are not able to compete on the open market.  Will the Minister clarify whether we can have a land authority system within an EC context?  I am not a farmer but I am aware that many of the decisions in relation to farming are taken in Brussels and not by the Government of the day.  We need to ensure that the family type farmer here is protected in the future.  It appears to me &mdash; I may be wrong &mdash; that there is an unofficial policy in Brussels and right down to the Department of Agriculture and Food and the coops to get rid of the small farmer because they are considered to be a burden when it comes to the collection of milk, grain and so on.  The co-operatives say they want bulk collection of milk, grain and so on and want to bring 40 foot trucks into farmyards.  If this system continues there will be little future for our small farmers.  It is important that the Government and all politicians ensure there is a future for small family type farms.</P>
    <P>I concur with the views of other Members in regard to headage payments. If arrears have accumulated in the Land Commission &mdash; obviously the Minister has recognised the problem by setting up a special committee &mdash; it is unfair that headage payments or grants are withheld because of that.  I hope that will not continue and that farmers who depend on those payments will be paid on time in future.  In many cases farmers must wait for these grants to pay for food for the house or for materials for the farm.  I ask the Minister to re-examine that problem.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to look again at the <Col N="612" /> question of title within the Land Commission. Most weeks sons or daughters of people who acquired land from the Land Commission have problems if they wish to sell a site.  Usually they find the title is not in order which results in delays in loan applications.  As a result young people have to obtain bridging loans thus creating an unnecessary burden.  A special section should be set up in the Department of Agriculture and Food to sort out title problems to ensure that delays do not occur.  I ask the Minister to take on board the views put forward today and to arrive at a solution as quickly as possible particularly in regard to arrears of land annuities which is causing severe problems, particularly for small farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  In conjunction with the abolition of the Land Commission, which was signalled some years ago, this is a major tidying-up operation which has been long awaited. When we come to the stage where the Land Commission will be formally dissolved under the dissolution Bill I hope the Government will replace it with a modern land authority.  There is a need for some statutory interventionist mechanism to regulate the sale of lands to ensure that the smaller land holder, who is under threat at present, and the medium commercial farmer, who is also under threat, have an opportunity to make their holdings viable and to ensure that most of our agricultural land remains in production rather than going to vested interests.  It is regrettable that we do not have a land policy at present.  I urge the Minister to take on board the views expressed today and devise a land policy discussion document so that we can come to grips with the need for regulation and give young farmers an opportunity to enter agriculture with confidence and maintain as many farm families on the land.</P>
      <P>The compensation to estate owners in the form of land bonds has been disastrous financially and cumbersome in terms of administration.  For that reason I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> The most important section &mdash; this has been referred to by many speakers &mdash; is section 7 which gives the Minister power to waive payments in respect of certain annuities.  The fact that the word &ldquo;waive&rdquo; is mentioned in the section clearly indicates that the Minister intends to waive payments.  I welcome the fact that he has set up a working party to examine this matter and report as soon as possible.  I understand about 14,000 farmers are in arrears in respect of land annuities at present.</P>
    <P>The history of the allocation of land by the Land Commission has been politicised in the past.  If one was not connected with the party in Government one could not hope to get a land allocation.  I am glad that is no longer the case due to the decision to dissolve the Land Commission and wind up their operations. Many of us can recall instances where land was bought too dearly and was allocated to farmers who had certain projections in mind at the time of renting and acquiring which no longer stand up because of reductions in market supports from Europe and in prices being paid for traditional agricultural enterprises.  I hope we can get away from land annuities building up because £160 to £180 an acre is being paid for land which is uneconomic. I hope a settlement can be arrived at which will be fair and equitable to the farmers who are in arrears and cannot make ends meet.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to remember that farmers are paying their way in respect of land annuities and that they have a just case in seeking to be treated equitably in regard to arrears.  I urge the Minister to find a solution which will be equitable to all sides.  Some people, through great hardship, are paying their way and there are those who, through no fault of their own, found it exceedingly difficult to make their repayments to the Land Commission over the years.  I regret to say that the sheriff is now calling to many farmers who are in arrears in respect of land annuities.</P>
    <P>The Minister should use his good offices to ensure that this action is called off immediately pending the outcome of <Col N="614" /> the negotiations and deliberations with the working party he set up to find an equitable solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>A scheme similar to the tenant purchase scheme operated by the Department of the Environment has been suggested as one way of dealing with this problem.  I welcome the Bill.  It is urgent for thousands of farmers who are seeking an equitable solution.  I look forward to the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill being brought before the House in the next session so that we can put all the affairs of the Land Commission and land bonds in order.</P>

      <P>Following is a schedule of the charges which apply at Dún Laoghaire Harbour. Dún Laoghaire Harbour is the only commercial seaport operated by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> It will be seen from that schedule that there is a complex range of port charges. As Dún Laoghaire is not a multi-model port, there is, of course, a variety of other charges not covered in the schedule. Details of the full range of charges applying at the ports mentioned by the Deputy are available from the relevant port authorities.</P>
    <P>While comparisons of port charges like those contained in the Sectoral Development Committees: Report and Recommendations on Port Costs, can be useful, they cannot give a comprehensive picture of the effective cost of using competing ports because different arrangements can apply to port users depending on their trade with the particular port.</P>
    <P>It was with a view to moderating port charges at our key commercial and local seaports that the Government, in conjunction with the EC Commission, are promoting port developments costing in excess of £69 million through the operational programme on peripherality.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that for the Irish exporter, access transport costs are significantly higher than those of their competitors in the EC.  This fact has been <Col N="616" /> acknowledged by the Commission of the European Communities and a major study of our sea and air access transport needs was completed last year.  The conclusions of the study, which was jointly funded by the Government and the Commission, have formed the basis of a detailed Government submission which was presented to the Commission last May, seeking Community funding to meet Ireland's access transport needs, in addition to the £69 million investment I mentioned.</P>
    <P>In my consideration of harbour authorities' applications for harbour rates orders &mdash; to increase their port charges &mdash; I am conscious of the different rates applying in competing ports.  However, those authorities in setting their port charges also have to have regard to their commitments to all port users and to their own financial situations.</P>
    <P>My Department's policy is to assist harbours to compete more effectively and efficiently.  I hope to see port charges becoming more competitive in future years through harbour authorities' own endeavours and with Structural Fund assistance.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that large port costs in the Republic are three times greater than costs in Northern Ireland, with particular reference to Larne, Warrenpoint and Belfast?  Will the Minister carry out an exhaustive study why this is so, and will he take steps to ensure that Irish ports are more competitive?  Will he agree that one of the reasons for the differential in costs is that Northern Ireland has 100 per cent capital grant aid, whereas certain ports in the South, like Rosslare, have had to operate totally out of borrowing?  Will the Minister take steps to ensure that within a given timetable the costs of port dues and shipping costs in the Republic will be brought into line with those of our competitors in Northern Ireland to stop the huge amount of traffic which goes from Cork or Kerry to Larne and then from Stranraer to the South of England in order to reduce costs?</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if he has any plans to change the present system of declaring ships' manifests, having regard to the serious public concern regarding events surrounding the collision of the m.v. Kilkenny; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The ship's manifest is basically an inventory of the goods on board a merchant vessel.  In the case of the <i>m.v. Kilkenny's</i> last voyage this computerised document would have been produced following input by an employee of the B &amp; I line in Rotterdam.  Copies of the document would have been transmitted to B &amp; I line in Dublin and given to the Customs and Excise service and the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  In the normal course of events, a copy of a ship's minifest would not be sent to me or to my Department.  When a ship arrives in port it reports to the Customs and Excise service and the manifest is the document used for this purpose.  Customs and Excise have a general role in checking all contents in accordance with the provisions of the Customs Consolidation Acts, and the Misues of Drugs Act and Regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The port authority, and in particular the fire officer, check vessels which are carrying goods as notified to the port under the International Maritime <Col N="626" /> Dangerous Goods &mdash; IMDG &mdash; code. Specialist staff from my Department are also involved in this regard.</P>
    <P>Regarding the carriage of dangerous goods by sea, I have outlined the position to the House in response to Private Notice Questions on 26 November, just a forthnight ago.  The position is that the carriage of dangerous goods by sea is governed by the International Maritime Dangerous Goods code.  This is an international guide prepared by the International Maritime Organisation for use as the basis for national legislation in pursuance of obligations under Chapter VII of the Safety of Life at Sea Convention &mdash; SOLAS.  Ireland implemented the provisions of SOLAS relating to the carriage of dangerous goods by the Merchant Shipping (Dangerous Goods) Rules, 1983.  These rules forbid the taking on board of dangerous goods for carriage in that ship unless the shipper of the goods has furnished the shipowner or master with a dangerous goods declaration. Such declaration shall indicate, with the correct technical name, the identity of the goods and the United Nations number.  The rules furthermore require the master of a ship to carry a specific list, manifest or stowage plan on board, setting forth, in accordance with the information provided by the shipper, details of the dangerous goods carried.</P>
    <P>The difficulty which arose in this case was that a container of groupage cargo consigned to several consignees in Ireland was misdescribed on the original manifest produced by B &amp; I Rotterdam as cartons of furniture.  This was attributed to simple human error.  In the immediate aftermath of the collision this error was spotted by B &amp; I officials.</P>
    <P>I am awaiting the outcome of the inquiry into the causes of this accident and if it indicates a need for any review of procedures regarding the carriage of dangerous goods by sea, I will arrange for this to be undertaken.  In the meantime, while I do not wish to prejudge the outcome of his investigation, the question of the carriage of dangerous goods by sea has been raised at a meeting held since the collision between officials of my <Col N="627" /> Department and the Irish Port Authorities Association.  The whole question will be kept under review pending the outcome of the statutory investigation under the Merchant Shipping Acts.  I will be raising this matter at the EC Transport Council meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, 17 December.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his rather comprehensive reply. Would he not agree that the system in operation is open to abuse?  In this instance we have had drugs and toxic chemicals washed up on the foreshore and even an arms find in Dublin Bay. Would the Minister not envisage introducing some precautionary measure whereby cargo coming into this country in containers is checked not by spot check but in a more thorough way?  Would the Minister agree that the present system is totally inadequate for container traffic?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Drugs and arms were discovered off Sandycove.  However, as of now, there is no information as to where they came from.  The thinking at the moment is that they did not come from the <i>m. v. Kilkenny.</i></P>
      <P>In regard to what the Deputy said about checks, I outlined the checks that are in place as of now.  I agree it is very difficult to search every corner of every unit in, say ro-ro ships.  Customs and Excise is the responsibility of another Minister but we are using what powers we have at the moment to the fullest extent.  I see some difficulties when the Customs and Excise scene changes as a result of what is happening in Maastricht at the moment.  It is for that reason that I intend to raise it next week at the Council meeting to see if something can be done at international level about tighter controls both with regard to dangerous substances and drugs.</P>

      <asker>Mrs. Barnes</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the position of the Irish Fishermen's Organisation that (1) there are major difficulties for stock conservation in the absence of a standardised European policing system and (2) a centralised Community agency would have the operational and legal means to enforce efficient, effective and impartial control on all fleets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern of the Irish Fishermen's Organisation (IFO) that there are major weaknesses in the Community in enforcing conservation rules.  I am aware of the views of that organisation on the best way of tackling those weaknesses.  I am not, however, convinced that their proposals necessarily represent the best way forward. Indeed I see, as I shall explain in a moment, some possible serious difficulties with aspects of their suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of background, I should explain that there is serious concern about declining fish stocks in many areas in the Community.  This is of special worry to Irish fishermen in that by and <Col N="629" /> larger the decline in stock affecting them is the result of overfishing by non-Irish fishermen.  This is especially the case as regards cod and haddock stocks in Area VI to the west of Scotland.  The big one is the North Sea but that does not affect us.</P>
    <P>The factors explaining the fall in stocks as assessed by the European Commission are basically threefold; large-scale over-capacity in the Community fleet, the inherent difficulties in enforcing fisheries regulations and a lack of commitment by some states to the enforcement effort.  It is difficult to disagree in any serious way with this assessment.</P>
    <P>Referring back to the IFO proposals, I would support the concept of standardising offences and penalties provided the standardisation involved brings the levels up to Irish levels which are, I understand, among the highest in the Community.</P>
    <P>I would have serious reservations at this point about the concept of Ireland ceding its legal responsibilities for enforcement in the Irish zone to a central Community agency.  I am not satisfied that such a move would necessarily improve the level of enforcement.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to suggest that a centralised Community agency would enhance stock conservation through greater control.  In fact, the point could be made that national administrations are the most competent in this regard and have the most to lose if such control is deficient, although that perspective may vary from state to state depending on the extent to which their fishermen rely on fishing activities in waters which fall under the jurisdiction of other member states.</P>
    <P>Looking at our own situation in Ireland, a considerable effort is directed very successfully to the monitoring and control of fishing activities both at sea and on land.  Let me take this opportunity to congratulate those involved in our fisheries protection service from my own Department and the Naval Service for a job well done to protect and conserve our valuable fish stocks for this and future generations of fishermen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> Of course no system exists that cannot be improved upon and in this regard my officials are attending a meeting in Brussels today, 10 December, to consider in conjunction with other member states a draft regulation on fisheries control which is aimed at enhancing the protection and conservation of fish stocks in the light of the latest available information on stocks and control measures.</P>
    <P>At this stage rather than raising the matter of a centralised agency I would urge that the Commission step up and further develop its monitoring role in inspecting the effectiveness of member states in fulfilling the enforcement function. I have no doubt that the vigorous pursuit of that role by the Commission would have a significant impact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this is indeed a matter of great urgency?  I am delighted to hear that some of his officials will be taking this point up at the meeting in Brussels.  In the meantime would the Minister not agree that there should be a centralised agency?  How can we move quickly and effectively towards member states eliminating the different systems of control and penalties that obtain at the moment if there is not a centralised agency?  I take the Minister's point that Ireland may be among the highest but, then Ireland is a victim as a result of that.  The fisheries inspectorates are only a fraction of the requirements at European level.  Can we have a commitment at European level that this will be effectively and immediately addressed?  I also take the Minister's point that national legislation is, perhaps, something which we should hold on to, but are the Minister and his Department looking into the legal loophole whereby a conviction of a foreign boat in this country is seen as a first time offence irrespective of the number of times the vessel has been arrested, and what is he doing to prevent it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The meeting in Brussels today will deal with matters under the <Col N="631" /> heading of control at sea, control of landings, integrated control, information campaigns and so on which shows that both my Department and the Council in general are conscious of the need for very strict controls.  An assessment of what has happened over the past 12 months will be an indication of how successful we are at the present moment in our surveillance programme.</P>
      <P>In regard to the penalties being imposed &mdash; and I think there is another question on the Order Paper about that &mdash; they are very severe indeed and result in a very substantial addition to my appropriations-in-aid which I do not refuse at any time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>I established the Review Group on Commercial Harbours and Pilotage Policy and Legislation on 17 October 1990.  The task of the review group is to identify those aspects of existing legislation which need updating and to make recommendations regarding a revised legislative code and policy for commercial ports ad pilotage.  The group will identify those aspects of existing legislation which constrain a modern port; the present structure of harbour boards needs to be examined as does the extent of ministerial and departmental control on day-to-day activities of ports.  As part of that review, I would expect that they will consider the issue of the appropriate management of harbours in the Shannon Estuary where there are currently three authorities, Limerick, Foynes and Cappa Pier at Kilrush.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the group is making good progress and hopes to be in a position to present its report to me early in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Minister that the Second Stage of a Bill to set up a Shannon estuarial authority was discussed in the House in 1987 and, again, in 1989 prior to the dissolution of the Government on both occasions?  Is he now saying, effectively, that those Bills were misdirected or inadequate and that <Col N="633" /> the Government are not in a position to move ahead with those Bills until the review body reports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no implication about the quality of the proposed legislation. I am simply saying that this legislation will have to fit into the scene when I come to take a view of the whole country. I have set up this high-powered committee to examine the matter.  I should say also that the authorities in the various areas warmly welcomed my decision to do so because they think the legislation in both areas, pilotage and harbours, is outdated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>While the authorities may have warmly welcomed the decision to establish this high-powered committee, as the Minister described it, we will have to await their reaction to the committee's conclusions.  While the Minister is aware that numerous reports have been commissioned in relation to the Shannon Estuary and the potential for the development of the deep sea harbour there, is he aware that Shannon Development commissioned extensive reports on this area which is described as having the best potential for the development of a deep sea harbour?  Numerous deep sea harbours in this country have not been developed in recent years and most people are blaming the Government for this primarily because they have failed to introduce the legislation promised in this House on a number of occasions.  Are we likely to see this legislation in the lifetime of this Government?</P>

      <Quest>if he has given any consideration to the development of sea passenger and port facilities in the Dublin area; if he intends to develop both Dublin and Dún Laoghaire ports.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>Dublin Bay embraces two of the most important facilities for freight and passengers in the island of Ireland.  On assuming office as Aire na Mara, I decided that the facilities at both locations required planning and development in an integrated way.</P>
      <P>The ports strategy being followed in the Dublin sub-region is to promote the development of bulk, ro-ro and lo-lo facilities in Dublin Port.  A project in the bulk and lo-lo areas is underway at present, being financed in part through the Operational Programme on Peripherality. A ro-ro project is due to start up in 1992.</P>
      <P>I am aware that Dublin port has an indicative proposal to develop a unified passenger ferry terminal in its current five year development plan.  No particular proposal has, however, been submitted to my Department and the port has no immediate plans to undertake such a development.</P>
      <P>Any proposal to develop passenger facilities in Dún Laoghaire harbour will have to await the completion of the Dún Laoghaire harbour development plan, which is being finalised at present by the Interim Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board, and following this, the Government's consideration of that plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have informed this House previously, following consideration of the interim board's development plan and the comments offered by the public and of other relevant studies and reports in <Col N="635" /> the matter, I will then be in a position to consider the alternatives available in Dublin Bay for the development of berthage and terminal facilities which service the central corridor.</P>
    <P>I would point out that I have indicated my support in this House on a number of occasions for the retention of the ferry service to Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's intention to establish a Dublin Bay authority who would take responsibility for both ports so that they would co-exist under one structure?  May I take it from his reply that it is his intention to develop Dún Laoghaire as a passenger port and Dublin port as a cargo and freight port?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the first part of the Deputy's question, I have no intention of setting up a Dublin Bay authority and in response to the second part, the main work at Dún Laoghaire at present concerns the passenger ferry. The income earned by Dún Laoghaire comes, very substantially, from the ferry which we intend to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Dún Laoghaire port have proposals to develop facilities at cost of £26 million while Dublin port have proposals to improve passenger terminal facilities at a cost of £20 million.  It would be totally illogical for the Minister to abdicate any responsibility in determining which development should take place at each port.  There is a need for orderly development so that both ports can co-exist.  Would the Minister not agree, in that context, that a new structure is required?  If the harbour review group recommend such a structure will he then consider it?</P>

      <P>When the harbour committee report I will consider whatever is contained in their report. Taking due cognisance of value for money invested, either our own or European Community moneys, it is my intention to retain Dún Laoghaire as a ferry port.  I outlined in <Col N="636" /> my reply the developments envisaged at Dublin port.</P>

In view of his stated commitment to retain the car ferry there, is it therefore his intention to invest in the development of a new car ferry terminal at Dún Laoghaire when the report of the interim harbour board has been finalised?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the Minister will, but I am seeking some indication as to his intentions in this matter. Is it his or the Government's intention to invest in the development of passenger facilities at Dublin port and Dún Laoghaire, or is it his intention to invest only in the development of passenger facilities at Dún Laoghaire and in the development of freight facilities at Dublin port?</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if, under the Safeguard Action, EC Regulations (EC) 3796/81, (1) the minimum price scheme for Norwegian farmed salmon will be widened to include larger fish over 4kg in weight, and (2) the price monitoring system will be extended beyond December 1991, when it is due to finish.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to advise the Deputy that following vigorous representations by my Department &mdash; and that is an understatement &mdash; to the Commission in the last few weeks, the minimum import price scheme for Atlantic salmon has been extended to include fish weighing over 4 kilogrammes and, again, at our request the Commission and other member states agreed last week to extend the price monitoring regulation until 30 June 1992 to allow for a full assessment of market developments.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome the action taken by the Commission to protect the Community's salmon market at this critical time.  It is a positive response to the call by me, and by Ministers of other member states, for immediate action to introduce a floor in the market.</P>
      <P>In the last few years the Community salmon market has been seriously destabilised by widespread dumping of low priced salmon by non-EC producers.  The disruption posed a grave risk to Community and Irish investment in the salmon farming industry, to the continued viability of the enterprises concerned and to the valuable employment which the industry has created, particularly in remote coastal areas.  Nor was the disruption in the long term interests of the consumer.  Indeed, I spelt out our grave concerns about the market during wide-ranging discussions with the Norwegian Minister for Fisheries on 29 September last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for action to counter the threat posed by predatory pricing has become paramount in recent weeks as <Col N="638" /> huge stocks of frozen salmon in Norway threatened to undermine prices still further. It was against this worrying background of crisis in the Norwegian industry that we have repeatedly pressed the Commission to take remedial action by, in the first instance, the introduction of a minimum import price scheme for fresh chilled or frozen salmon from outside the Community.  The recently introduced measure will remain in force until 29 February 1992 when the position will be reviewed.  The continuation, in addition, of the price surveillance measure up until June of next year will allow for monitoring of the operation of the import price measure and should ensure full transparency of market conditions.</P>
    <P>The introduction of these measures will help Irish producers through the important pre-Christmas period.  The immediate benefit will be to prevent a flood on to the Community market of the surplus of frozen supplies which have accumulated in the Norwegian system and will help to prevent panic selling in the fresh market.  In the longer term, I am hopeful that a sustained improvement in prices for our producers on the key export markets on the Continent will now begin to emerge, particularly if, as it appears, Norwegian over-production is at last being brought under control.</P>
    <P>We will continue, on behalf of the industry, to be at the forefront of efforts to ensure that the Community market is restored to a balanced state, that a recovery from the rock bottom prices of recent times gets underway quickly and is sustained in the longer term.  Vigilance will continue to be our watchword and if further remedial action is required we will move straight away to initiate the necessary consultations with the Commission and with other member states.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a relief that the measures will not apply to fish weighing more than four kilogrammes.  I am pleased that the price monitoring regulations will be extended until June 1992. Will the Minister say whether there is a constant demand from member states to <Col N="639" /> keep up the pressure because of the short time given?  Will the integrated market of 1992-93 improve matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The significance of the dates is that they are relevant to the marketing of fresh salmon.  The problem was huge as the United States imposed a 26 per cent tariff on Norwegian salmon. Their estimated production is about 165,000 tonnes and the dates are connected with when the salmon come on the market.  We have very strong allies in the Scottish salmon fishery organisation; this year our largest production was about 8,500 tonnes, Scotland produced between 30,000 and 40,000 tonnes and the Norwegians produced 170,000 tonnes.  However, the industry is in serious difficulty in Norway, the banks are in trouble and the Government agency set up to buy the fish have gone bankrupt.  They now intend to sell their salmon to east European countries.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>the amount of money allocated to coast protection in 1991; if he has satisfied himself that local authorities have the ability to adequately protect and maintain our coastline; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation to the Department of the Marine for coast protection in 1991 is £593,000.</P>
      <P>Primary responsibility for coast protection rests with local authorities, some of which have undertaken protection work themselves.  My Department's role is to assist those authorities, financially and technically, in dealing with the problem of coastal erosion.  I am satisfied that these arrangements enable necessary works to be undertaken.  The Deputy will appreciate that progress with schemes is, of course, dependent upon the resources which are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that a National Coastal Erosion Committee, comprising county <Col N="640" /> engineers, are examining the coastal erosion problem in depth at present.  This will show how the issue is perceived by the local authorities and I look forward to receiving their report.  My Department have already identified a number of locations around the coast where valuable property is threatened by erosion. This whole issue is under consideration in my Department at present.  In this context, my Department have written to all maritime local authorities requesting stipulated information and prioritised proposals in respect of coastal erosion in their areas.  When this data, and the report of the National Coastal Erosion Committee are received, I hope to be in a position to decide the most appropriate national approach and mechanism for dealing with this serious problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister is very familiar with the problems in Arklow and Bray, County Wicklow, and he has been helpful in tackling them particularly in Arklow.  Will he agree that the cost of dealing with the problem of coastal erosion or harbour protection works is inordinately expensive and that the finances of local authorities, especially maritime local authorities, are in a perilous condition?  Will he agree that the State, in the form of the Minister's Department, should bear the cost?  No attempt has been made to get money from the European Regional Fund or to negotiate cheaper loans from the European Investment Bank.  Will the Taoiseach in his discussions today ask whether there is a possibility of getting moneys from those sources to assist local authority and the Department which are very badly strapped for cash?</P>

I admit that there are difficulties in regard to financing at present.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, an attempt was made to get European money for this purpose which failed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister concede it is unfair that a non-maritime county &mdash; a midlands county, for instance Offaly &mdash; should have the same support from central Government as a maritime county when, at the same time, a beach like Courtown which maritime county councils are trying to protect is used more by Dubliners and others than by Wexford people?  We are preserving national assets which are available to everyone. Therefore, it should be a national charge rather than a charge on the unfortunate county councils who happen to be maritime counties but have no additional resources.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is wrong in saying that this money is for storm damage.  Storm damage comes under a different subhead.  A substantial sum of money &mdash; out of which Arklow fared very well &mdash; was provided to deal with storm damage.  However, coastal erosion is a totally different matter.  I agree with the Deputy that the 1963 Act is difficult to operate but my Department are considering that matter.  As far as I know &mdash; I have covered this matter already in answer to Deputy Kavanagh &mdash; an effort was made to get money from Europe but it was unsuccessful.

In particular, EFTA is to provide the EC with an additional quota of cod in Norwegian waters, increasing progressively from 6,000 tonnes in 1987 to 11,000 tonnes in 1997.  The internal distribution of these resources will be on the basis of cohesion criteria and Ireland will benefit therefrom. The precise distribution remains to be agreed.</P>
      <P>The EEA Agreement does not provide directly for any increased access for vessels from EFTA countries to Community waters.  However, it is envisaged that the annual bilateral agreement with Norway &mdash; which comes up in this month each year &mdash; will include some provision for increased access by Norway to Community waters but this access will not cut across or reduce the real fishing opportunities available to the Community fleet. The details have yet to be determined.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the aggressive fishing and fish production in countries like Norway gives rise to concern when entering into bilateral agreements or agreements on equal access to waters because the situation will <Col N="646" /> be more to their advantage?  I am sure the Minister and Brussels took that into consideration.  In the long term, after Maastricht, are the implication of present and future applications of Scandinavian countries for membership of the Community being considered?</P>

It will be a matter for slogging it out at the conference table when that time comes.  I should like to tell the Deputy that at the December Council meeting last year, I succeeded in getting the Council and the Commission &mdash; importantly &mdash; to accept that the specific interests of member states should not be compromised in the December bilateral agreement between the Community and Norway.</P>

      <Quest>if, in regard to the fire aboard the B &amp; I vessel, the m.v. Norrona, on 9 April 1990 in which a passenger died, he has yet received the official report of the coroner; if so, if his Department have studied the report for any lessons which may be learned from the maritime safety point of view; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>On Monday, 9 April 1990 a fire broke out on board the <i>m.v. Norrona</i> resulting in the loss of one life. The passenger vessel <i>m.v. Norrona</i> is registered under the Danish flag and the casualty occurred in British waters. Responsibility for the holding of investigations into the incident was a matter for the British and Danish authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently received a summary version of the transcript of the three day inquest conducted by HM coroner for Pembrokeshire.  The verdict of the inquest was one of &ldquo;unlawful killing&rdquo;.  I understand that the inquest transcript plus Dyfed-Powys police report on the <Col N="647" /> incident have, in the past two weeks, been forwarded to the Crown Prosecution Service for onward transmission to the British Director of public Prosecutions for his consideration.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the vessel was on charter to B &amp; I Line and manned by a mainly Irish crew at the time of the incident, I appointed Captain Christopher Davies, a surveyor of the Department, to investigate the incident from the point of view of maritime safety and to report to me on the outcome. Captain Davies' report was prepared with the co-operation of the B &amp; I Line. Following completion of the inquiry my Department met with B &amp; I and improved safety procedures were introduced by the company in the light of the lessons from this incident.  The <i>m.v. Norrona</i> has been replaced on the Rosslare-Pembroke route by the <i>m.v. Munster.</i></P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine are working on an ongoing basis, both with B &amp; I and other ferry operators, to ensure that the highest standards of safety are achieved on all ferries using Irish ports. Following the fire on board the <i>m.v. Norrona</i> the master and crew of the vessel were awarded a certificate of commendation by the chief fire officer of Dyfed county fire brigade in recognition of the manner in which they controlled the fire, effected rescues and ensured the safety of passengers.</P>
    <P>The safety of sea passenger transport has been under review since 1987 when the National Ferry Safety Committee were established.  The committee are chaired by my Department's chief surveyor and include representatives from both Irish ferry companies.  The committee review safety procedures and standards on board Irish-registered ferries, consider any measures necessary to improve safety and make recommendations, as appropriate.</P>

In conjunction with the operators of passenger vessels to and from this country does the Minister have any plans to publish the guidelines on safety measures that apply on these vessels in view of the number of accidents and fires that have occurred at sea and the fact that the travelling public may well be concerned about their safety?</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if, in view of the catastrophic decline in fish stocks around our coast, he will outline whether he proposes to introduce a ban on monofilament nets.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I say that I do not agree generally with the Deputy's <Col N="649" /> assessment that the fish stocks around our coast are in a state of catastrophic decline.  Both scientific evidence and fishermen's catches would not bear this out although I would accept that there is cause for some concern regarding certain stocks and certain areas.  These matters are being actively pursued in my Department at present.</P>
      <P>With regard to the use of monofilament nets, such nets are used in sea fishing for gill netting.  The principal species caught with this method are hake, monk, megrim, dog fish and tuna and some herring and mackerel.  Gill netting is regarded as an effective, efficient and selective form of fishing.  If used properly it can contribute more to conservation than say, trawling, through its selectivity, in that undersized or juvenile fish may pass freely through the net and only the larger fish are caught.  Fish taken through this method are in a better condition generally than fish taken from trawls.  On the other hand if not properly managed fish can be left in nets for considerable periods and not be fit for human consumption when taken from the nets.  Fish may also be eaten by other fish or sea mammals.  Gill nets that are abandoned or break free from their moorings can continue ghost fishing for a considerable period due to the indestructable nature of the monofilament material.</P>
      <P>Large scale draft nets for tuna, greater than 2.5 kilometres, have been banned by the EC recently.  I and my Department are considering the effect of these nets and how best they can be managed to ensure the most efficient method of exploitation taking full account of the necessity to protect and conserve stocks. I am monitoring the position closely and I will take whatever action is deemed necessary.</P>
      <P>The use of monofilament netting for salmon fishing has been prohibited by bylaw since 1985 in the interest of conservation of salmon stocks and, as I said on a number of occasions previously in this House, I have no plans at this stage to legalise monofilament netting in salmon fishing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we should be grateful for small mercies in that the Minister does not wish to turn the clock back on the use of monofilament nets for salmon fishing.  However, the Minister does show an alarming degree of complacency. For example, I am sure he knows that for next year the quota for cod is down by 20 per cent and the quota for whiting is down by 30 per cent.  There are very serious problems.  Would the Minister agree that the fact that monofilament nets are still in use legally in the fishing for certain species provides an excuse for people to use them for catching salmon?  Would he agree that at the moment a person caught in possession of a monofilament net for salmon fishing may maintain that he or she is using it for other purposes and that it is very difficult to prove that that is not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is absolutely no complacency on my part.  The Deputy mentioned in his question a &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo; decline in fish stocks but we do have, for example, a quota of 76,000 tons of mackerel and a quota of 53,000 tons of herring off our coast, so I would say that the world &ldquo;catastrophe&rdquo; does not come into that net.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That one is a little smokey.  The fact is that there has been a serious decline in cod and haddock.  In ICES Area 6 the effect is being felt, but the real impact is in the North Sea where the decline has been catastrophic and about which the Council of Ministers is seriously concerned.  Technical conservation measures have been the subject of strong debate in the Council for some time and it is hoped that the conservation measures taken will be effective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I did mention the point that the Deputy has raised in my reply. Ghost fishing, netting that breaks away at sea and so on, does constitute a serious hazard to marine life.  Very little can be done about that except to instil into those who use the nets a sense of responsibility. It is accepted that occasionally, through no fault of their own, fishermen will lose nets &mdash; there is no question about that and there is nothing we can do about it. However, those who for one reason or another, whether it be because they are involved in illegal activities, deliberately cut nets are very irresponsible.  If those people could be found out they would be suitably punished, but that is a very difficult matter to deal with.</P>

      <P>My Department have undertaken coast protection works at Rosslare Strand this year, involving the construction of six new rock groynes. Jointly funded by the Department of the Marine, for 60 per cent, and Wexford County Council, for 40 per cent, these works will provide extra protection for the valuable tourist infrastructure and amenities at Rosslare Strand.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out to the Minister that the total expenditure this year has been inadequate.  Is the Minister aware that some years ago it was estimated that a £5 million project would be required to protect Rosslare Strand from being completely breached which would ultimately threaten the town of Wexford? <Col N="653" /> while I know the Minister does not like the word &ldquo;catastrophe&rdquo;, such an occurrence would be a catastrophe for the economic well being of the country as a whole.  Is the Minister aware that last week Wexford County Council passed their estimates by one vote because of the pressure on the estimates and that the council have been forced to spend £125,000 on Rosslare Strand because of the inadequacy of State subvention?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The message I wish to give the Deputy for his county is, if he is looking for £5 million from my Department he is going to the goat's house to look for wool.  In 1991 a contract for £213,268 for the construction of the groynes was agreed and very good work was done.  The break-up of that contract was 60 per cent from my Department and 40 per cent from Wexford County Council.  That was in accordance with a study commissioned at the hydraulics research station in Wallingford in Britain.  I have visited Rosslare Strand and I know of the hazards involved. Wooden pilasters have been erected to try to keep the sea from the golf links.  I was very impressed by the groynes that were constructed in that they seemed to be able to catch a good deal of the sand drift and contributed towards the effort to preserve the beach.</P>
      <P>While we must be realistic about the amount of money available we will continue to improve Rosslare Strand because it is a very valuable amenity.  When I had control of the Transport portfolio, CIE were involved in beach nourishment projects there.</P>

      <P>In relation to the latter point, may I ask the Minister whether he considers it fair that Irish Rail are not asked to make a contribution to the 60/40 arrangement when it has been reckoned that the construction of berthage facilities and port development at Rosslare Harbour have been contributory factors to the worsening of the coastal erosion <Col N="654" /> problem at Rosslare Strand?

In the face of the evidence now available would the Minister accept there is a national responsibility to protect national assets that constitute a very significant, financial contribution to our economy overall, like Rosslare Strand?

      <P>I should explain to the Deputy that under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991, the power is vested solely in the Minister for the Marine to appoint pending election all the trustees of the fishing co-operative societies.</P>
      <P>While there is no requirement under the Act on the Minister to consult with any other parties in making those appointments, I decided some months ago that it would be useful and helpful &mdash; apart from being democratic &mdash; if, when I come to finalise the appointments, I had before me any suggestions which the fishery boards and angling organisations might care to make.  Thus, they were invited &mdash; and I would stress that this was by way of courtesy &mdash; to forward any names they might wish to have considered.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that I have received a large number of suggestions from both angling organisations and fishery boards. I wish to acknowledge and express my appreciation of this positive response.  I am satisfied that a sufficient pool of eminently qualified and suitable individuals, together with other nominations I may wish to consider, is available to me for consideration for appointment as trustees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Five of the fishery boards submitted names.  These were the Northern, North-Western, Southern, South-Western and Shannon boards.  Suggestions were not received from two fishery boards, the Eastern and Western boards.  I am given to understand that the Central Fisheries Board did not submit names and that the reason they did not was on the basis that as there is to be no national co-operative, it was more appropriate for the regional <Col N="656" /> fishery boards to nominate persons to be trustees of the co-operatives within their regions.  In any event, I would attach no significance to the fact that the two boards did not submit nominations, and there are no wider implications involved. I have received very valuable advice from two of those boards on the rules to be applied to the societies.  I am grateful for their assistance in this regard.</P>
    <P>As regards the setting up of the co-operatives, my objective is to have these in place for 1992.  In this respect the detailed arrangements are at present being finalised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply disguises the fact that the Eastern and Western Fishery Boards did not nominate trustees because of their unhappiness with the proposed fishery co-operatives and that a number of the other fishery boards also expressed their criticism of the proposed fishery co-operatives. Would the Minister agree that it is a very inauspicious start to the fishery co-operatives arrangement under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1991 that the regional fishery boards, who have central responsibility in this area, are expressing such a degree of criticism and unwillingness to make nominations of trustees at this early stage; that in fact his proposed co-operatives will collapse, as predicted by this side of the House when that Bill was being debated here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been saying very few people would regret the abolition of land bonds.  Many had had land acquired against their wishes, paid for by land bonds which were of only limited benefit to them, because for years the redemption of those bonds was dependent on one's luck in the lottery.</P>
      <P>Over the years the Land Commission undertook great work when many uneconomic holdings were rendered viable. Nonetheless with the changes from traditional areas of production such farms are not viable.  At one time the Land Commission aimed at 45 acres but that size holding is no longer viable.</P>
      <P>With the decision to wind down the Land Commission leading to its ultimate abolition it would be opportune for the Department to ascertain into whose hands that land had been delivered because it would appear now that the aim is to have large farms, herds, machines and co-operatives.  Efficiency is suffering because of the complete emphasis on size.  It is not the amount of land a farmer has that counts but the value he makes of it.  There are some very economic smallholdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission did valuable work and I could indicate a farmer in my own area whose original holding was not <Col N="797" /> viable but who received an allocation from the Land Commission of which he made very good use.  At no time in the Connacht-Ulster region will there ever be sufficient land to meet the demand.  It is the ambition of all small farmers to be big farmers and it is the ambition of landless young farmers to become owners of land.  There are many well trained and ambitious young farmers who are unable to put their skills to good use because they have no land.</P>
    <P>The question of afforestation must be examined very closely.  The Department are hell bent on it.  There is serious resentment among people in the areas involved. In County Monaghan there has been very little afforestation, even, I regret to say, in areas of marginal land, but people in areas such as west Cavan and Leitrim resent the purchase by groups and wealthy individuals of land suitable for afforestation purposes.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have referred to arrears of land annuities, a matter of concern to most elected representatives.  We welcome the Minister's announcement of the setting up of a working party in his Department to examine the question of land annuities and to report back before the end of the year.  He had received representations from farmer organisations and others to do something about the arrears.  Annuities were high in the seventies and eighties when land prices and interest rates were high.  There were also high expectations in regard to food prices in the EC.  The high prices did materialise but they were not maintained. The banks were vying with each other to make money available for land purchase and were almost giving incentives to people to purchase.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that a case by case approach to those people with arrears is no longer effective and that a national approach would be more effective.  If a man is in arrears, the problem steadily gets worse and kills off any incentive to come to terms with it. The arrears then reach uncontrollable levels.  The Minister has said he is looking for a comprehensive and fair solution.  I hope this matter will progress speedily <Col N="798" /> and that those people who are in difficulties with arrears will have their burden reduced in order to enable them to continue in farming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said at the outset that this is a purely technical Bill and a logical follow-up to the decision to cease the compulsory acquisition of land and to abolish the Land Commission. Under the law, lands compulsorily acquired had to be paid for in land bonds but with the demise of compulsory acquisition such bonds are no longer needed.</P>
      <P>In various debates over the past 20 years in this House, Deputies have voiced their opposition to this unfair system of land acquisition.  Usually in the end the seller of the land lost out.  On 22 July, 1969 Deputy Mark Clinton stated:</P>
      <P>Say a man who gets £10,000 for a farm owes the Bank of Ireland £10,000. Will the Bank of Ireland accept £10,000 worth of bonds in respect of this debt?  The answer clearly is that they will not.  Therefore, we are pretending to be paying a price for land that, in fact, we are not paying.</P>
      <P>Speaking the following day on the same Bill Deputy L'Estrange stated:</P>
      <P>The present system of paying in land bonds is unfair and unjust.  It delays, hinders and frustrates the acquisition of land.  At the present time nobody seems to have confidence in land bonds.</P>
      <P>Later that year on 23 October the late Deputy Oliver Flanagan, referring to the then Minister, Deputy Sean Flanagan, stated:</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that, from the point of view of many landowners, the land bonds system is most unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>Several other speakers referred to the matter.  Deputy Kenny will cite his late father's reservations about the bond system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad this system is <Col N="799" /> being dispensed with.  From contact with people who were paid through this system, I realise it was most unfair.  They felt they did not benefit to the extent they should.  The Department of Agriculture and Food claim that at present more than 10,000 farmers owe approximately £4.7 million in arrears on land annuities and more than 1,000 farmers owe £500 or more.  The IFA recently stated that the problem is more serious with approximately £6 million owed in arrears and approximately 2,000 farmers experiencing major difficulties with repayments. It is true to say &mdash; Deputy Connaughton referred to this earlier &mdash; that a number of headage grants and premia payments have been attached by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I am aware of some such cases.  It is most unfair to extract annuities from farmers who are experiencing extreme hardship due to the decline in agricultural incomes.  Deputy Connaughton said the Department were acting unconstitutionally. I do not know whether they are but they are certainly acting in a very unfair and penal fashion by attaching payments without the knowledge and certainly without the consent of many farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that the working party set up by the Minister to examine the problems in regard to annuities and to propose solutions should report as soon as possible and put forward proper solutions.  Reference was made here this morning to various solutions, including low interest loans and Euro loans.  Nevertheless, the system should be properly examined.  The problem really arose during the seventies when land was sold at high, inflated prices.  It is mainly the farmers who acquired land during the late seventies who are experiencing difficulties at present.  I think repayments of £180 per acre were mentioned here today.  This is far in excess of the economic rent one would get from land at present.  As I said, the fall in incomes as a result of the decline in milk and beef prices has meant that farmers cannot <Col N="800" /> afford to pay these unfair, excessive annuities.  I appeal to the Minister and his officials to face up to the problem as soon as possible.  During the past month farmers from all over the country visited the Dáil to lobby various TDs on this very question.  It is important that something is done about this problem as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the setting up of a land authority and the absence of a land policy.  In my contribution on the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act, 1989, I referred to the problems in regard to land annuities and the need for a land policy and a land authority. Unfortunately, very little has happened since then.  We should be planning at least ten years ahead in the area of agriculture. The Government should bring together the main players in the area of agriculture, including the IFA, the ICMSA, Teagasc, the Department of Agriculture and Food and all those who have an interest in farming, to work out a plan over the next ten years.  At a time of changing patterns in Europe and a reduction in the price support systems, we need a proper plan for farming.  We are going into the Maastricht Summit with no farming policy whatsoever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely, but we are going into it with no real negotiating position and we will suffer as a result.  Following Maastricht, the Government have to set out clearly where they stand in regard to the demise of small farmers, an issue which was referred to here this morning.  We have to plan ahead.  If it is our objective to keep farmers on the land then we have to provide them with the necessary supports.  The Government seem to have a knee-jerk reaction to the various crises which arise mostly in Europe and seem to have very little policy or direction of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to add my voice to this debate.  Many speakers have said that this is the beginning of the end of the Land Commission <Col N="801" /> as we knew it.  In this Bill the Minister of State and his senior Minister deal with a very small number of issues of concern to farmers.  I understand that the rent accruing for the year ended 31 December 1991 amounted to £4.9 million and that the arrears for that year amounted to £5.4 million.  The Land Commission collected approximately £4.4 million in annuities, which leaves approximately £5.9 million in outstanding arrears at present. Obviously this is a matter of serious concern to the great number of farmers who demonstrated outside this House because of the high price they paid for land and the consequent reduction in prices since.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the fundamental need for the Minister and his Department to not alone deal with this issue but to put in place a central land authority.  The Land Commission, as they were known in rural Ireland, were the bane of a great number of small farmers. The Land Commission man as he was known gained respect and notoriety and caused divisions in some townlands which lasted for several generations.  It is known in the West that former Ministers for Lands who divided estates in the ashes of country houses would scrub out the ash map and redraw it if the local Cuman Secretary discovered he had not got the field he wished.  I suppose it is appropriate that we should be debating this Bill at a time when there is a very large &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo; sign on the Land Commission building accross the road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>All good things come to an end.  Annuities are not being paid because, on the one hand, farmers find it difficult to make ends meet while, on the other and more importantly, there is a perception among the public that the Land Commission are fast coming to an end and this problem will go away.  This problem will not go away.  The Minister set up a working group about two months ago to examine the problems being experienced by farmers in repaying land annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be in the Minister's interest <Col N="802" /> to introduce something akin to the local authorities scheme.  That scheme was introduced when local authorites had a great number of houses on their hands, an increasing repair bill each year and no money to meet it.  From their point of view if one owned the property one had more respect for it than if one was paying rent to some mysterious local authority who might or might not be in a position to carry out repairs.  I hope the working party, comprising some very capable people, will be in a position to put recommendations before the Minister at a reasonably early date as to how a solution can be achieved for those worst affected.</P>
    <P>The Minister presides over the Land Commission where there are approximately 100 staff employed.  In the records office of the Land Commission there are three or four staff.  This means that those who worked there for a long number of years have been transferred to other Departments and no file can now be retrieved or, a least, only with great difficulty in respect of any estate in the country.  If the Minister of State demands a file relevant to a Land Commission holding in County Louth it might be interesting to see how fast it can be produced. There are three Commissioners in the Land Commission and a very small number of staff in the Records office. The question has to be asked, what are they doing?  The Land Commission still have in their possession a great deal of commonage holding.  The Minister will be aware that farmers and shareholders who are in a majority in terms of wanting these commonages divided have been unable to do so.  A case in my county of Mayo was taken to the High Court.  In that case a majority of shareholders wished to have the commonage divided and a minority did not.  That case was dealt with more than 12 months ago in the High Court by Miss Justice Carroll and judgment was reserved.  There has not been a decision since.  The staff of the Land Commission might have a great deal of work to do depending on that decision.  It is past the time for a decision in that case to be handed down; the people should know where they <Col N="803" /> stand.  It appears that the view is that the Land Commission are on the way out and that this problem will disappear too but it will not.  While we cannot interfere with the courts &mdash; and we have no wish to do so &mdash; it might be no harm to say we would all wish that the reserved judgment be handed down.</P>
    <P>While the Land Commission down the years were never perfect, their restructuring and rearrangement of holdings allowed small farmers and those who had a wish to develop to become more efficient and earn a bigger income from the land.  During that period there was at least a sound rural structure in place.  We are now witnessing the modern turn of the wheel.  An examination of the register of electors in any western county will show a significant increase in the number of EC nationals and others who are now in possession of various properties.  We have no wish to dispute that.</P>
    <P>With the central role of the acquisition of land removed from the Land Commission the paper restrictions still in place are a nonsense.  There are restrictions in place for people outside the EC, US citizens and others; but EC nationals have the right to purchase land here. Deputy Deasy's call for a land authority needs to be examined seriously because the change in rural Ireland over the past ten or 15 years has been astounding. Business people, those involved in various commercial activities or others have the opportunity to acquire &mdash; and are acquiring &mdash; huge tracts of land for forestry development and so on.  Smurfit resources, to name but one, are in a position to acquire whole townlands and where the sound of voices rang out for hundreds of years there is nothing left but the bird call and acres of pine trees. The Minister is presiding over a very serious change in many parts of rural Ireland.  He should ensure that some semblance of an authority is set up in his Department to oversee the distribution of a very valuable natural resource.</P>

      <P>I expect the working party on annuity arrears will have a report before the Minister soon, and I urge him to implement its recommendations.  The people who are genuine in trying to do their best on the land are experiencing severe difficulties in meeting their repayments. One of the reasons these annuities are not being paid and why there are arrears of £5.4 million is because of the assumption that the Land Commission are being phased out and that the problems will disappear with them.  The Land Commission were part of the social fabric of rural life for many years.  In terms of the changes now taking place on the land the Minister should seriously consider making a name for himself by being the person to introduce a new land agency. The Minister has at best only 12 to 15 months to do so.  He should introduce an overseeing agency who would have a supervisory role in the manner in which our land is distributed.  If he does he will be doing a good job for future generations <Col N="805" /> It is much more serious than dealing with the technicalities in the Bill.  While they are important and of great concern to many farmers, the Minister has an opportunity to do something more fundamental and lasting for his Department and the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to address a few points on this Bill.  As the Minister said, it is largely a technical Bill with some practical consequences for farmers.  In his address the Minister did not advert to when he hopes to introduce the Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill.  I hope it will be introduced as quickly as possible and that in his reply the Minister will be able to give a date on which he will attempt to steer that long awaited legislation through the House.</P>
      <P>The great hardship being caused throughout rural Ireland by land annuities has no doubt been brought to the attention of the Minister.  In my constituency there is widespread concern about the amount of arrears that are due and the difficulties being experienced by farmers in meeting these repayments.  It is a pity that while speaking on the land bonds the Minister did not provide the House with some information as to what he proposes to do with the annuities, and the inability of farmers to meet these repayments.  Deputy Deasy and other speakers drew the Minister's attention to the need to restructure payments because of our present economic climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission was originally established to create viable economic holding throughout the country.  Repayments need to be restructured now because of the hardship being caused. Instead of creating economic holdings, in effect what is happening in the nineties is that many of the small holdings are becoming uneconomic and that is exactly opposite to what was envisaged by the original legislation.  A revised purchase scheme akin to the tenant purchase scheme introduced by the Department of the Environment in 1988 is what is needed.  I refer the Minister to Circular <Col N="806" /> HRT2 of 26 February 1988 which outlined what was a very fine scheme to allow local authority tenants engage in the purchase of local authority houses. Such a scheme with a convertible payable option is something the Minister must seriously look at under this legislation and in anticipation of the legislation we expect early in the New Year.  The main feature of such a scheme should be that it would refer directly to the condition of the land.</P>
    <P>Because of the hardship in meeting repayments, individual holdings have suffered because the farmer has not had sufficient funds to improve his lot.  The condition of the land must be paramount in whatever restructuring device the Minister introduces, along with an element of arbitration and a valuation certificate, with perhaps a role for the Valuation Office in determining the period of payment with a substantial discount. The discount in the tenant purchase scheme was of the order of 40 per cent.  If there was a similar discount for the redemption of the land purchase annuities, not only would the Government be engaging in a social act of some considerable benefit to farmers but they would be able to raise some money on the sale of the land at a fixed interest rate, particularly in dealing with elderly farmers in small holdings who cannot meet the current system of repayments. Without a restructuring procedure we will have continuing hardship.  Over £5 million is now outstanding in these half yearly instalments of repayments.  I implore the Minister to give some direction as to what line this will take in the future.  A sum of £5 million now means a substantially greater amount by next May.  I ask the Minister to look at what the Department of the Environment did in the matter of local authority houses and introduce a similar scheme for the land held under the annuities system.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Land Act, 1965 will become meaningless with the dissolution of the Land Commission.  I know it has been some time since this section was used.  Will the Minister proceed by way <Col N="807" /> of repealing that section?  I was disappointed this was not mentioned under the miscellaneous provisions of the Bill. Undoubtedly the consent of the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Land Commission to each subdivision of holdings on the basis that smaller holdings would be uneconomic has outlived its usefulness in practical terms.  Perhaps the Minister could give us the number of applications for section 12 consent that have been refused over the past number of years?  I have rarely come across it. Perhaps in almost 95 per cent of cases this is merely a rubber-stamping process by the Land Commission and the Department. We should get clarification on this. The creation of economic holding was the hallmark of Land Commission practice and yet it is something that in practice has gone by the board over the last number of years.  What is the Minister's policy on that?  Deputy Deasy referred to the need for a land authority of some substance and that is very important.  I know it is for another day but I would like the Minister to address his attention to that issue.</P>
    <P>I would impress on the Minister the widespread hardship being caused by land annuities particularly in midland counties where farm incomes are in crisis and where meeting these twice yearly repayments to the Land Commission is no longer a feasible option.  What is good for local authority tenants should be equally good for the elderly small bachelor farmer who in many cases is almost on the side of the road due to economic hardship.  These Land Commission payments do not reflect the value of the land on a yearly basis to the person involved. The sooner the Minister introduces a reasonable scheme along the lines of the tenant purchase scheme, the sooner we will see an alleviation of this hardship that is stalking the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  Like many other Deputies I have had numerous representations made to me by farmers regarding land annuity arrears.  It has already been said, but it <Col N="808" /> needs to be emphasised on every occasion, that farmers are indeed experiencing great difficulty at the moment because of the decline in milk and beef prices, to name but two areas.  Any measure that would alleviate the difficulties farmers are facing, particularly in the west, would be very welcome indeed.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have at all times been very understanding in their treatment of farmers who genuinely wish to try to deal with this problem but it is a problem which has become insurmountable for many farmers.  Therefore I welcome this Bill with particular reference to section 7 which refers to the power to waive the payment of certain annuities.  This is something the Minister should be commended for and that every Member of this House should support.</P>
      <P>I also want to commend the Minister for being prepared to set up the working party, and I look forward to seeing the outcome of their deliberations.</P>
      <P>I know the question of setting up a land authority is not exactly within the ambit of this Bill but it is perhaps permissible on Second Stage to mention areas that do not come strictly under the Bill at issue.  I would, therefore, like to take this opportunity to say that I believe the Government should have a look at the question of setting up a land authority particularly in the light of the very different farming scenario nowadays with the proposed changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and what that will mean to the poorer farmers particularly in the west.  I look forward to movement on the issue of the land annuity.</P>
      <P>With specific reference to this Bill, I would like to be on record as supporting the Bill and to once again thank the Minister for wishing to attempt to alleviate some of the very real problems particularly of smaller farmers in constituencies such as mine in County Clare.</P>

      <P>A number of people have dealt with the land annuities which are owing to the Land Commission and the Department of Agriculture.  I, like many Deputies in this House, have had representations made to me in regard to <Col N="809" /> this, and the £5.4 million which is still owed is a lot of money.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a technical piece of legislation but basically it is the first step towards the dissolution of the Land Commission. There should, therefore, be some discussion on the question of a land authority.</P>
      <P>With the diminished role of the Land Commission, many farmers wonder what is the point of paying land annuities to a system that is no longer working, to a commission who are not allowed purchase any more land.  This is one of the main reasons the problem of debt has arisen.  Another problem has been the massive fall off in farm incomes over the last number of years.  Anybody who represents a rural constituency is aware of the difficulties facing farmers in just trying to survive.  To give an example, a mountain sheep farmer in my constituency sold a 40 foot container of wool for £14,000 four years ago and last week sold a similar container of wool for £4,000.  That is an example of the massive fall off in farm incomes and is a factor in the non payment of land annuities by farmers.</P>

    <P>The Land Commission may not have been perfect but they did much valuable work.  I am sure that many Members of this House who have been here over the last 20 years and have had many representations made to them regarding the division of land may not be sorry to see a diminished role for the Land Commission because it certainly caused some political controversies within rural areas.  It was set up so that small farmers could increase their holdings at modest cost, become more competitive and be able to stay on the land.  At the moment the Land Commission are not working and farmers cannot purchase land.  This is why I would agree with Deputy Deasy on the importance of setting up some sort of land authority in the very near future.  In the west there are small farmers trying to survive on rapidly diminishing incomes and there are large financial institutions buying large tracts of land for forestry. The plantation of forestry has become big business.  The western development <Col N="810" /> grant for farmers for drainage and land reclamation etc. has been done away with and now the only grant aid available to farmers in the west is the 80 per cent grant aid towards afforestation.  The scale is tipped positively in one direction and people on the land are being asked to leave.  As politicians we are not doing enough to provide alternatives because of our unemployment problems generally.</P>
    <P>One positive step would be to set up a land authority to give young farmers and people who are willing to spend their time in agriculture a chance to upgrade the land and to increase the acreage they already have.</P>
    <P>When this legislation is passed, the next step will be the dissolution of the Land Commission.  If the Minister wants to do something extremely positive and make a name for himself in the short space of time he has left, he should set up a land authority or agency.  Perhaps when the Minister is replying he would tell us when he intends to have a Land Commission dissolution Bill brought before the House and if he has any intention of setting up a land agency or a land authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>First I would like to thank the various Members on both sides of the House who have contributed to the Second Stage of the Bill.  Most prefaced their remarks by saying that this was a tidying up mechanism to wind up the land bond fund, the guarantee fund and the cost fund.</P>
      <P>Section 7 provides for the redemption of cottage purchase annuities.  It is estimated that approximately £25,000 will be paid to a number of local authorities under this heading.  The decision to redeem the land bonds was taken in 1989 and this legislation is a natural follow-on to the changes effected at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will endeavour to deal with the points raised as best I can.  The point was made that a number of cottage owners were finding it difficult to pay the arrears of annuities.  In cases of genuine hardship, every effort has been made to reach a reasonable arrangement.  While I am sure <Col N="811" /> the arrangement reached in each case does not meet the needs and requirements of the individual involved, we have the best of intentions.  We have decided to establish a working group to look into this question and we will await the outcome of their deliberations and their suggestions.  It is worth making the point that, even though some people are finding it difficult to pay the arrears due, there is no penalty clause and no interest is charged on the arrears outstanding.  It comes down to a matter of endeavouring to have the arrears paid off with the current annuity and coming to a suitable arrangement in that regard.</P>
    <P>While the question of a land policy can be related to the Bill, it is not dealt with in any section.  Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government are committed to reviewing all national policies relating to agriculture. The question of land tenure and ownership would come under that umbrella.  In that context, account will be taken of the need to promote structural change in farming, including the promotion of lifetime transfer of land and the early establishment of young well educated and trained farmers on those holdings.</P>
    <P>A number of measures &mdash; two in particular &mdash; have been taken during the past year which should be of help in increasing land mobility considerably.  The income tax liability threshold in respect of land leased by farmers aged 55 or over has been increased to £4,000.  Nowadays there is greater flexibility in the operation of the installation aid scheme for young farmers which should enable a greater number of small farmers to qualify for benefits under that scheme.</P>
    <P>The question of establishing a land authority was raised in a number of contributions. While I do not wish to be disparaging, much of what was said was aspirational.  When one talks about establishing a new land authority one has to deal with the specifics and take account of constitutional requirements, such as owner's rights.  For instance, how would we acquire land which would then be <Col N="812" /> redistributed?  Deputy Connaughton suggested that we should have a waiting arrangement but we have to ask ourselves if it would be practical to implement such an arrangement.  It should be pointed out also that the Bill to dissolve the Land Commission will come before the House in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>If we were to turn back the pages of history and go back to the origins of the Land Commission in the 1800s and consider the way land policy has evolved, we would see that the agricultural scene has greatly changed.  The Land Commission when first established endeavoured to come to terms with the many serious structural problems in relation to land ownership, fixity of tenure, fair rent and so on.  Subsequently, large estates around the country were acquired and redistributed to small holdings.  There is no doubt that during that period the Land Commission performed a significant economic and social role.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion in those contributions which favoured the establishment of a land authority that the State should provide financial resources to ensure that small farmholders can compete on a level playing field when land becomes available and the normal sale arrangements apply.  However I have to ask who would provide those resources. Would the State provide them or would they come from some other source and then be made available to the people for whom we wish to cater?</P>
    <P>On the question of controlling sales, a number of Deputies made the valid point that EC nationals are entitled to buy land in Ireland.  Section 45 of the Land Act, 1965, controls the sale of land to non-community citizens.  Under the Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill this control function will be assigned to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that we should control the way land is used, but the reality is that the Common Agricultural Policy already dictates and determines the way land is to be used today.  It comes down therefore, to identifying what is needed, what is required in the marketplace and making the necessary arrangements for <Col N="813" /> individual farm holdings.  In this context, it is the Government's clear intention to preserve the family farm structure which forms part and parcel of the fabric of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to unregistered bonds, Deputy Quinn inquired if it will be possible, to establish ownership in all cases. The answer is no; there probably will be cases which will never be finalised.  This Bill does not provide for winding-up those accounts.  Clearly this matter will have to be dealt with in the legislation to abolish the Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>They will go back to the Exchequer.  Deputy Quinn also asked how much it cost the Exchequer annually to meet borrowing charges on the £76 million borrowed in order to redeem all land bonds in 1989.  The cost comes to about £8 million per annum.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy asked about waiving the annuities below a certain threshold. Section 4 of the Land Act, 1984, makes provision for waiving the annuities below a certain threshold.  The figure in the 1984 Act was £2 but, by ministerial order, the threshold, which is now at £10, may be increased.  Deputy Enright raised the question of capitalising on land purchase annuities and giving a discount on the total value.  The total value of the annuities is about £80 million and many farmers have already benefited from discount on their annuities over the years.  The committee looking at the whole area of annuities will probably examine that matter even more closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton asked about writing off small annuities.  About 77,000 annuities were written off in the early eighties and about 70,000 were written off since 1989 which leaves 46,000 accounts to be cleared.  Deputy Connaughton also mentioned the cost to the State in relation to the winding-up of the Land Commission; he said there would have been accumulated losses on sales incurred by the Land Commission and the division of estates.  This factor has <Col N="814" /> been taken into account in the redemption of all land bonds covered by this Bill. It is not anticipated that the problem will resurface when the Land Commission are finally dissolved.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for your patience and indulgence in this matter.  I also thank all Members who made worthwhile contributions to the Bill.  I am sure that much of what has been said will be relevant to the dissolution of the Land Commission when the Bill comes before the House.</P>

      <P>Many speakers on this side of the House asked the Minister if he could give us a time-scale in regard to the introduction of the Bill to dissolve the Land Commission.  However, in his reply to Second Stage he did not answer that question.  We have been co-operative but we would like reciprocation by way of information as to when the Bill will be introduced because it is the nub of the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that land purchased by the Land Commission from individuals was paid for in land bonds.  Unfortunately, the people repaying money to the Land Commission &mdash; or to the Department of Agriculture and Food acting on behalf of the Land Commission &mdash; have to pay for it in hard cash and this is what is causing the difficulty.  The Minister dismissed the view expressed not just from this side of the House but from the Government side that there is a necessity for setting up a land authority, to introduce a land policy and to have a land use division in the Department of Agriculture and Food on the demise of the Land Commission.  It is not sufficient <Col N="815" /> for the Minister to say that our agricultural land policy is dictated by the Common Agricultural Policy because that policy is coming a part at the seams. We need something in place to decide how the land should be used, how much should be used for growing cereal, producing beef and milk and &mdash; the biggest and most vexed question of all &mdash; how much will be used in future for afforestation. Will afforestation account for major land use?  If so, to what extent?</P>
    <P>There is a glaring contradiction, which was not alluded to by the Minister during the debate, which pinpoints what I am saying.  At present we are still getting considerable grants from the State and the EC to reclaim mediocre or marginal land while, at the same time, the EC is proposing that people in this country and throughout the EC should be paid considerable sums of money not to farm the best of land &mdash; they call it &ldquo;set aside&rdquo;. That specific example illustrates the contradictions and the necessity for a land authority, land policy and a land use division in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  We do not know where we are going; the Common Agricultural Policy is in its death throes.  We are in a major transitional period at present which will probably last for several years and yet we are refusing to admit in this House that changes are taking place.  The Minister of State should convey to the Minister &mdash; who should have been here for this debate because it is of immense importance &mdash; that the Members of Dáil Éireann expect a policy on land use and on agriculture because we can no longer depend on the Common Agricultural Policy which is disintegrating before our eyes.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to say when the Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill will be introduced.  Naturally, it is under consideration and is on the Dáil Order Paper.  However, I cannot speculate on the date it will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Deputy misinterpreted what I said in relation to the idea of a land authority.  I said that if those <Col N="816" /> putting forward the idea of such an authority got down to specifics of their operation their cause would be much more credible.  It is all very well to have an authority in place but if they cannot effect the changes deemed necessary for the agricultural industry or to pursue a desirable land policy it is pointless.  They should also have the wherewithal to implement proposals.  I said that land use &mdash; as distinct from land policy &mdash; is dictated by what happens in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy.  If our policies are pursued at that level they immediately come back through the system and affect the decision making process of individual farmers here.  As I said earlier, what we are discussing here could be more properly discussed in the context of the debate on the dissolution of the Land Commission when that Bill comes before the House.</P>

We signalled earlier in the day that we do not think it is appropriate that this Bill be taken without the full implications of the sale of B &amp; I to the proposed purchaser, ICG, being fully understood.  There is far more urgent legislation to be taken, such as that dealing with matrimonial homes and spouses' rights, and it would be more appropriate for the Government to rush that legislation through.  This very <Col N="818" /> important legislation dealing with B &amp; I has not been given full consideration.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the House that a very substantial amount of work has been carried out in the intervening period.  The result of this work is reflected in the Bill before us.  The essential purpose of the Bill is to provide for matters connected with the sale of B &amp; I to the Irish Continental Group plc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic terms of the sale are that ICG will, when all conditions relating to the sale of B &amp; I have been completed, pay £8.5 million to the Minister for Finance in return for the entire issued share capital of B &amp; I.  Prior to the sale, the Government will remove accumulated bank and other debt from B &amp; I's balance sheet amounting to £35 million.  The Government may decide to do this either by injecting the requisite amount of additional share capital in the company <Col N="825" /> to enable the debt to be paid off as provided for in section 2 or by assuming direct responsibility for the debt as provided for in section 3.</P>
    <P>Section 3 also provides that the aggregate amount arising under sections 2 and 3 will not exceed £36 million.  This maximum amount includes a contingency figure of £1 million over and above the £35 million Exchequer investment envisaged to provide for any subsequent adjustment which may be required in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the events of the past few months, I believe it is appropriate I should devote some time to the history of the State's involvement with the B &amp; I.  The British and Irish Steampacket Company Ltd., now the B &amp; I plc, was acquired by the State from the private sector in 1965.  The Minister for Finance is the beneficial owner of all of the shares in the company.  The main objective of the acquisition of the B &amp; I was to ensure an adequate level of capacity and to maintain competition in sea transport between Ireland and the UK.  That objective is as valid today as it was then but State ownership is no longer the only way to achieve it.  It is noteworthy that B &amp; I 's main competitor, Sealink, was sold some years back by British Rail and has more recently been acquired by the Swedish-based Stena group.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I were mandated in 1965 to operate on strictly commercial lines.  The company's core objective was to provide and develop a modern, efficient, profitable, national and comprehensive transport system to and from Ireland. However, the shareholder &mdash; that is, the Minister for Finance &mdash; had to inject equity into the company in 1971 and 1972, and has injected further equity each year from 1976 onwards for working capital purposes.  Since their acquisition in 1965, total Exchequer equity injections in the B &amp; I have amounted to £106 million, of which £53 million has been paid in since 1985.</P>
    <P>Despite a major financial restructuring programme implemented by the B &amp; I during 1986, involving substantial <Col N="826" /> Exchequer funding and staff reductions, the company's position continued to deteriorate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In December 1986 the board of the B &amp; I submitted further major rationalisation proposals to the then Minister for Communications.  This was followed in February 1987 by a request from the board for additional equity from the Exchequer to allow the company to continue to meet their trading commitments.</P>
      <P>In May, 1987 the Minister directed the board to submit to him as soon as possible an alternative plan of action aimed at achieving a substantial reduction in the company's losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Following intensive negotiations with all of the unions concerned the board of the B &amp; I presented a plan of action to the Government on 11 December 1987, which plan had &ldquo;across the board&rdquo; support from the company's workforce.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the plan of action and of the company's financial performance, additional equity injections of £6.2 million, £4.8 million and £6 million respectively were made by the Exchequer in the years 1988, 1989 and 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending a final decision on B &amp; I's future, the Government did not approve the injection of further equity into the company in 1991.  In the absence of equity, the Government decided on 11 December 1990 that it was necessary, however, to guarantee the minimum borrowing required to enable the company to continue trading and thus avoid liquidation. The amount of B &amp; I loans subject to Government guarantees at 31 December 1990 stood at £14.7 million. Since then, a further short term facility of up to £8 million has been guaranteed by the Government in 1991.  This cash was needed by the company to meet their commitments, including interest and <Col N="827" /> other charges, despite realising a before interest charges trading profit of more than £2 million.  The total amount of B &amp; I borrowing guaranteed by the State at 31 December 1991 will be approximately £21.4 million.  All guarantees will cease following the sale of the company.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment on the improved operating performance by the B &amp; I and increased carryings under the plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The company are simply not generating enough cash to finance their operations without substantial continuing equity injections from the Exchequer.  It is also clear that B &amp; I have been unable to generate the resources they need for the renewal of their fleet, which will be necessary if they are to remain competitive and maintain market share.  The chairman, on behalf of his board, made these points to me on a few occasions.</P>
      <P>It was against this background that I launched the study of the options for the future of B &amp; I to which I have already referred.</P>
      <P>In May 1990.  I received a submission from the board of B &amp; I setting out options for the future of the company under various scenarios.  The submission made it clear that the <i>status quo</i> could not be maintained.  Further rationalisation and substantial job reductions were necessary to eliminate the unprofitable areas of activity and achieve the improvements in efficiency necessary to enable the company survive.  The board advised that it was necessary to gear the operations of the company for the increasingly competitive conditions in the marketplace for both tourism and freight and highlighted the need for a balance sheet restructuring as part of any long term solution.  The benefits that would be achieved from economies of scale by a merger of the activities of the company with another shipping company were also highlighted together with the potential that such would provide for financing future development needs.</P>
      <P>I indicated to the board that I would seek independent advice to ensure that every possibility was fully explored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>In August 1990, I commissioned Stockes Kennedy Crowley Corporate Finance Limited to advise on the best and most economic means of terminating Exchequer support for B &amp; I at the earliest possible time having regard to the need for adequate capacity and competition in the provision of passenger and freight shipping services to and from Ireland.</P>

      <P>The report from SKC came to broadly similar conclusions as the report from the board of the B &amp; I on the realistic options which were available to meet the objectives as outlined.</P>
      <P>The consultants examined the feasibility of four key options for the future of the company.  These were: continuation of the <i>status quo;</i> redevelopment of the company with major capital investment; liquidation of the company or sale of the company.</P>
      <P>Having assessed the feasibility and financial implications of each of these options, the consultants came out strongly in favour of disposal of the B &amp; I as the best option.  They were of the opinion that the sale of B &amp; I would have a positive effect on access transport services in a situation where the purchaser would bring financial and operational strength resulting in greater competition on Irish Sea routes.  They also believed a sale would secure the future employment of the majority of the company's employees.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of the consultants' report in September 1990 the Government decided that the consultants should be requested to explore the level of interest which existed in the international shipping market for the acquisition of B &amp; I.</P>
      <P>SKC had extensive discussions with a number of interested parties.</P>

A significant reduction in the workforce was also an integral part of each of these proposals.</P>
      <P>Before finalising their recommendations, and at my request, SKC also had discussions with the management of the B &amp; I who had submitted a proposal for a staff/management buy-out of the company.</P>

      <P>Having considered all of the offers made by the interested parties, the consultants strongly recommended that the Government should pursue the offer of Irish Continental Group plc, which trades as &ldquo;Irish Ferries&rdquo;. In their view, this would offer a firm prospect of ensuring a strong strategic shipping line, under the Irish flag, of sufficient scale to compete internationally.</P>
      <P>The Government decided on 16 January 1991 to proceed with negotiations for the sale of the B &amp; I to Irish Continental Group plc.  A Memorandum of Agreement for the sale by the Minister for Finance of the entire share capital of B &amp; I to ICG was signed on 28 February, 1991.  A clause in the agreement provided that it would lapse if, for whatever reason, the sale was not completed by 16 August 1991.</P>
      <P>Following the signing of the agreement, ICG had a comprehensive due diligence exercise carried out on B &amp; I.  This led to further complex and protracted negotiations with my advisers on a range of additional items in respect of which ICG had sought compensation.</P>
      <P>ICG also entered into extensive negotiations with the B &amp; I unions with a view to reaching a comprehensive agreement on rationalisation and work practices prior to completion of the sale.</P>

      <P>However, I regret to say that negotiations with the unions took much longer than was anticipated.  By 16 August 1991, a share purchase agreement had not been concluded and the necessary enabling legislation had not been enacted.  Accordingly, the Memorandum of Agreement with ICG expired on 16 August 1991.  Further detailed discussions took place with ICG after 16 August.  While progress was made, the expired Memorandum of Agreement was not replaced by any new legal agreement.</P>
      <P>While discussions were continuing with ICG during September, I received representations from the Chairman of B &amp; I, acting on behalf of independent board directors, to the effect that in their view the terms of the proposed sale to ICG did not represent good value.  They recommended that in view of the Government's intention to proceed with the sale of the company the way should be opened once more to competitive bids.  The Chairman of the B &amp; I Board advised me that, given a decision to sell now at the best price available, their advice was that fair value is whatever is the best price that can be obtained in the market.</P>

      <P>At the same time, my advisers became aware that a consortium of B &amp; I management and staff, together with their Danish backers, were anxious to make a revised offer for the company. On 2 October my advisers had informal discussions with the Danish backers who indicated the type of offer they would support.  They indicated they would need two weeks to make a final decision.</P>

They asked, <i>inter alia,</i> for permission to carry out a due diligence exercise on the B &amp; I.  As I had not made a decision at that stage whether to re-open the tendering process I refused Mr. Blaesbjerg's team access to commercially sensitive information on B &amp; I.  On 14 October I asked the Secretary of my Department to obtain from the B &amp; I management consortium within seven days an indication of the type of bid they would make for the company.  I obtained this on 21 October.</P>
      <P>I would emphasise that up to this date there had been no trade union involvement in the MSBO consortium. However, when the B &amp; I group of unions requested that they be given an opportunity, in conjunction with the MSBO consortium, to prepare a proposal for the acquisition of the company, I agreed to allow them two weeks to do so.</P>

      <P>Both Irish Continental Group and a consortium of B &amp; I management and staff together with their Danish backers were invited on 25 October to submit fully comprehensive offers within a two week deadline ending on 8 November 1991.</P>
      <P>Following requests for an extension from the management-staff buy-out &mdash; or MSBO &mdash; consortium, the deadline was extended first until 15 November and then for a further week until 22 November 1991.  As a result of the collision involving the <i>m.v. Kilkenny,</i> I agreed to give the MSBO consortium a further extension until 28 November.  Offers were finally received on that date from both the consortium and Irish Continental Group.  A further period was subsequently allowed for clarification of the offers.  In all, over five weeks were allowed.  Both bidders were allowed this five weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appointed an assessment committee comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Finance and Stokes Kennedy Crowley Corporate Finance Limited to examine the two offers.  Following detailed consideration of the offers, the assessment committee made a unanimous recommendation to me, which I accepted, that the sale should be concluded with Irish Continental Group subject to final agreement on all issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter was considered by the Government at their meeting on 4 December 1991.  This allowed seven days for the assessment committee to make its recommendations to me.  During the Government meeting, I became aware of information from the advisers to the <Col N="834" /> MSBO consortium indicating, <i>inter alia,</i> that management and staff had withdrawn from the consortium bid involving Danish interests and wished to have an amended bid submitted on their behalf on terms substantially similar to the consortium bid.</P>
    <P>While the terms of this revised offer were presented as being substantially similar to the MSBO consortium bid, the fact is that only £2 million of the proposed £5 million purchase price offered could be paid immediately.  The balance would be paid on a deferred basis.  In addition, the revised offer proposed that discussions with suitable partners, including Irish Ferries, would take place after 12 months.  The revised offer was in truth worse than the previous MSBO offer which the assessment committee had advised against.  Logically, therefore, the fresh proposals had also to be rejected.</P>
    <P>Having considered the overall position in the light of the report of the assessment committee, the Government decided that the sale of B &amp; I to Irish Continental Group should take place subject to final agreement on all sides.</P>
    <P>In arriving at their decision, the Government noted the view of the assessment committee that the buy-out proposal had represented a welcome initiative in Irish industry, involving an equal partnership between management and staff.  The Government agreed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government agreed with the committee's conclusion, however, that in line with standard practice, the B &amp; I should be sold to the best offer, Irish Continental Group, unless there were other compelling circumstances for not doing so.  On the basis of the two offers received, the Government were satisfied that there were not.</P>
      <P>The ICG bid of £8.5 million is substantially better than the MSBO offer of £5 million with £3 million of that on a deferred basis.</P>

      <P>Both ICG and MSBO consortium sought an Exchequer investment of £35 million to remove the company's debt prior to the sale.  Clearly, the sale to Irish Continental Group will result in a substantially lower cost to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the sale to the Irish Continental Group represents the best prospect for the future development of the B &amp; I.  It will create a strong shipping entity with substantial synergetic benefits, a proven track record and the ability to make the necessary investment in the future of the combined entity.  In this regard ICG are committed to investing £30 million in the B &amp; I over the next five years.</P>
      <P>I would see the following as some of the main additional benefits which can be expected to accrue from the acquisition of the B &amp; I by ICG: the maintenance of vital Irish shipping/maritime skills; the maintenance and development of critical shipping routes vital for tourism and national transport needs; the creation of a platform for an increase in capacity and improvements in the quality of services; competitive market led fare policies; the overall enhancement of B &amp; I's services and, in particular, the development of its central corridor and southern corridor services; removal of the requirement for ongoing Exchequer funding, and the maintenance of B &amp; I's ships on the Irish register.  These benefits should make a substantial contribution to employment creation, both directely and indirectly.</P>
      <P>In essence, the sale will lead to the creation of a strong Irish shipping company with the potential to alleviate the twin evils of under-capacity and high access costs.  It will also preserve competition which is a vital ingredient in achieving these objectives.  The provision of a modern, efficient and competitive access transport network, integrated as far as possible with the rest of the European Community's network, is of vital concern to the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> ICG are committed to the creation and development of a dynamic shipping entity, under the Irish flag, which will be capable of competing internationally &mdash; a company which has committed itself to provide high quality service and secure employment.  The employees of B &amp; I will now have an opportunity of directly participating in this strong new Irish group.</P>
    <P>I would now like to comment on certain issues raised in recent days.  I have previously rejected the notion of a golden share.  This issue has been discussed with the trade unions during the 20 or so meetings held with them.  A golden share is simply not practicable because it would mean the Government going back on their decision to effectively dispose of the line.</P>
    <P>The concept of a golden share entails some Government control for strategic reasons over the future ownership or direction of the company's activities.  The Government's primary strategic concern for the future relates to capacity and ensuring that shipping services to and from Ireland remain competitive.  If a change of ownership were likely to operate so as to restrict competition, the Government would not hesitate to invoke the substantial safeguards that exist in the area of European Community and national law.</P>
    <P>The imposition of a golden share as part of the sale process would have had a number of additional disadvantages.  If it did not put off potential bidders, it would most certainly have lowered the price offered.  This is because potential investors would naturally be wary of potential restrictions on the disposal of shares, thus affecting their saleability. This would be particularly damaging to any company in need of investment finance to make a success of its ownership of the B &amp; I Line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing the Government can do to prevent them selling their shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, let us be very clear on this issue.  Irish Continental <Col N="837" /> Group are an Irish publicly quoted company. Their future is inextricably linked to serving Irish routes.  Irish Continental Group have indicated to me, to the B &amp; I staff, to the public at large through the press and to the Stock Exchange that they&rdquo; will continue to operate all existing B &amp; I shipping routes&rdquo; and that they will upgrade and improve services.  They have also guaranteed to maintain the B &amp; I vessels under the Irish flag.</P>
      <P>Irish Continental Group have also indicated to me that their plans for B &amp; I over the next five years include: the retention of all existing B &amp; I shipping routes; the provision of extra capacity on the <i>m.v. Leinster;</i> the sourcing of an improved vessel to replace the <i>m.v. Munster</i> on the Rosslare/Pembroke route; an upgrade of facilities throughout B &amp; I; the provision of long term sustainable employment in B &amp; I; and share ownership for B &amp; I employees.</P>
      <P>The acquisition is in the best long term interests of B &amp; I, their employees and customers.  It will lead to the creation of an enlarged Irish owned shipping enterprise with the resources to develop and provide an enhanced level of services to Irish tourism and export trade.</P>
      <P>Regarding the suggestion that the management-staff buy-out was not given sufficient time, the MBSO was considered over one year ago and rejected after a detailed consideration by consultants and Government as not being the best solution. In fact, that MBSO was not supported by the trade unions.</P>
      <P>When representations were made to me by the management and by the group of unions, I allowed them, with their Danish backers, a full five weeks to lodge a bid.  Initially, I allowed two weeks from 25 October with a deadline of 8 November.  This deadline was further extended twice to 15 November and 22 November in order to give the consortium every opportunity.  Following the unfortuate collision of the <i>m.v. Kilkenny,</i> I agreed a further extension to 27 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the suggestion that £8.5 million was not good value, I am sure most people would agree that the only <Col N="838" /> way to establish the best value for any company is to seek competitive bids. Over one year ago, we initiated world wide bids for the B &amp; I Line.  We had interest from P &amp; O, Maersk, Cenargo, ICG and MBSO.  However, the only offers received were from Cenargo, the MBSO and ICG.  The ICG bid of £6.5 million was by for the best financial offer. It included the least number of redundancies and it met my concern and the trade unions' concern of having a strong Irish strategic shipping company under the Irish flag.</P>

    <P>I am not satisfied from indications received by me that the MSBO has the full support of the workforce in B &amp; I. In relation to industrial relations problems in both companies, I would point out that ICG have not lost a sailing day <Col N="839" /> due to work action since 1973.  I understand, although this has yet to be confirmed to me fully, that the Seamen's Union of Ireland, for example, were not wholeheartedly in favour of the MSBO and that they favour somewhat more the ICG bid.

      <P>The MSBO bid was for £5 million cash. The MSBO consortium is dependent on the availability of £6 million from the pension fund for the purchase, severance payments and working capital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I come to the substance of my speech I want to comment on the debating arrangements for this Bill on which there have been two divisions today.  I understood that all the Whips had agreed to the commencement of the Bill today but that there was no agreement as to its conclusion.  This is why Fine Gael did not take part in the vote today.  We are totally opposed to the proposal to bring the Second Stage debate to a conclusion at 11 p.m. tomorrow. We are also totally opposed to the guillotine being put on Committee and Report Stages next week.  We do not believe this is the way to give proper consideration to the Bill.  I might add for the information of the public and the House that it was the Government's intention to put all Stages of the Bill through the House this week in the first instance but we totally opposed such a proposal.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael will be opposing this Bill. We believe the deal to sell the B &amp; I Line to Irish Ferries is unsatisfactory from the perspective of the future requirements of the Irish economy, the requirements of Irish exporters and the tourism sector.  It represents very bad value whereby the taxpayer gets the worst of all worlds.  It does not adequately protect any of the staff of the B &amp; I Line and cannot provide the necessary guarantees of continuity of shipping services for an island nation which is more dependent on exports than Japan or virtually any other European country.  We export 70 per cent of all we produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The timing of this deal is not to the advantage of the seller as the turnaround in the company's fortunes will only really be evident in 1992 when it is estimated there will be a trading profit in the B &amp; I Line of £4 million before repayments on borrowings.  Even a cursory examination of the advantages to the buyer will show that a very soft price has been obtained in the deal.  For £8.5 million <Col N="841" /> they get debts of £36 million written off, all the assets of the B &amp; I Line clear of any liabilities &mdash; these are reckoned by independent analysts to be worth approximately £20 million &mdash; the net amount of surplus on the pension funds, the property owned by the B &amp; I and the shipping assets.  I understand they are able to carry over &mdash; the Minister made no reference to this &mdash; corporation tax losses over £100 million to ensure they will not have to pay any corporation tax profits for the foreseeable future.  They will have access to a pension fund with a total investment of over £60 million with a surplus of anywhere between £6 million and £13 million which is acknowledged by all parties to be overfunded.  They have the freedom, as a private sector company, to negotiate away up to 350 redundancies, free of any Government interference, to substantially reduce operating costs.</P>
    <P>They have the prospect of generous EC shipping grants given that Ireland will be the only State in Europe without a land link after the Channel Tunnel is built in 1993.  In addition, they also have the prospect of reducing the purchase price by way of the small print of the deal whereby if on the balance sheet of the B &amp; I Line for 1991 they do not achieve certain trading and asset figures the price will be reduced downwards.  It is only in these special and extremely favourable circumstances that a company the size of Irish Ferries with a turnover of £40 million, 250 employees, assets of £13.5 million and a fleet of two boats can acquire a much larger company, the B &amp; I Line, which has a turnover of between £65 million and £70 million, a fleet of several ships and a staff of approximately 1,000.  This is not a merger; this is a reverse take-over by a relatively small shipping company of one of the two large short haul ferry operators on the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's strong view of the proposed privatisation of the B &amp; I Line is that the price is too low and the circumstances simply too risky in relation to the continuity of essential shipping services.  Fine Gael concede that while <Col N="842" /> the B &amp; I Line have met all their targets in the plan of action submitted to the Government in December 1987, there are limits to the Exchequer and taxpayers' financial commitments to the company.  There is and was a case to involve private sector finance in the necessary investment required by the B &amp; I Line for the upgrading of their vessels and services.  We also accept that Irish Ferries are an Irish registered company, they operate on the Irish Stock Exchange and sail under the Irish flag.  It is desirable and essential to keep the B &amp; I Line under Irish control.  We accept the bona fides of Irish Ferries and their successful operation since 1973 in terms of their growth and expansion of shipping services. We agree that they are a well managed company with positive principles of employee share ownership.  We acknowledge all of these points but for the Government to simply abandon the B &amp; I Line, flog it off and wash their hands in the way now proposed is totally unacceptable. The Minister's decision is shortsighted and seems to be born out of immediate financial considerations rather than long term planning to develop a cost effective and efficient Irish marine sector and have competitive shipping services on the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, Irish Ferries propose to invest some £32 million over the next five years.  Seven million pounds of this will be spent on the upgrading of the <i>MV Leinster</i> which operates on the Dublin-Holyhead route.  It is proposed to construct an extra car deck giving an increased capacity for 120 cars and to put in sponsons to improve buoyancy of the ship.  It is proposed on the Rosslare-Pembroke route on the southern corridor to invest some £20 million to replace the <i>MV Munster,</i> a 20 year old ship.  It is anticipated that there will be losses on this route for three years but that it will make money in the fourth year with a new upgraded ship.  They will also spend £1 million per annum on general upgrading and facilities.  I agree that such investment is urgently needed, particularly at the North Wall terminal where facilities are in a deplorable condition.</P>

      <Col N="843" /> While all of these proposals are laudable and essential to the future of the B &amp; I Line it is important to pose some questions which could arise over that five year period and that we try to foresee the answers to those questions in so far as possible before the State is powerless to act in years to come.  What if Stena Sealink detect a certain vulnerability in terms of the ability of Irish Ferries to compete in a price war on fares and enter into a fares war on the central and southern corridor?  I think it is acknowledged that the <i>MV Stena Hibernia</i> which operates on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route and the <i>MV Stena Felicity</i> which operates on the Rosslare-Fishguard route are super luxury vessels which have been described as floating hotels.  If the <i>MV Stena Hibernia</i> is able to achieve three sailings per day, operating from upgraded facilities out of Dún Laoghaire port, how will the B &amp; I Line under Irish Ferries compete?  They cannot offer a superior quality product and will find it very difficult to maintain their share of the market.  What if Irish Ferries incur exceptional losses?  How will they finance these annual deficits?  In order to pay for the £32 million investment plan they will be up to the hilt in borrowings because they will have exhausted their cash reserves in the purchase price.  I understand such cash reserves currently stand at about £7 million-£8 million.  Within the five year period they will also have to consider replacing their own ships, the <i>St. Killian</i> and the <i>St. Patrick</i> which were commissioned in 1973.  What if Irish Ferries decide that the southern corridor route is uneconomic?  It has to be pointed out that the only previous experience Irish Ferries or the Irish Continental Group have of short haul ferry routes was on the Belfast-Liverpool line which was closed down due to losses.  They do not operate any such short haul on the Irish Sea at present.</P>
    <P>What if they decide in the future to close down European container services which provide vital cargo links from Dublin port to Antwerp, Rotterdam and Le Havre?  What action can the Government <Col N="844" /> take in these circumstances if all shipping companies are absolutely private concerns which do not have any regard to Government policy and the Conferderation of Irish Industry, the Irish Exporters' Association and the Irish Tourism Confederation are knocking on their door asking them to maintain access transport services to the country?  The answer is simple.  The Government will be powerless to act or will be faced with the choice of doing what the then Government did in 1965 in acquiring the B &amp; I line at that time.  I do not think there is any argument that, at the time, the B &amp; I line was acquired, not because of any love of the sea by the then Government nor by any determination to make a profit out of shipping services, but rather to secure a strategic national interest as an island in having a State involvement in shipping services.</P>
    <P>Therefore, Fine Gael's central contention is that the Government should have retained a stake or golden share in the B &amp; I Line as part of any deal with Irish Ferries.  This would have had substantial benefits for the Irish Continental Group, would have increased greatly the credibility of the company in raising finance for fleet investment purposes in terms of taking on a multinational company like Stena Shipping Lines in a competitive arena.  If we had retained that interest in B &amp; I the taxpayer could benefit from any upturn in the fortunes of the company given that they have moved from a loss making position of £9.4 million in 1984, with an improvement each year, to a projected profit in 1992 of £4.2 million.  In that regard it is helpful to read into the record of the House the improved trading performance of the B &amp; I Line.  In 1984, in operating terms, they lost £9.4 million, in 1985, £7.7 million, in 1986, £6.8 million and in 1987, £3.6 million &mdash; an improvement all the time.  However, in 1988 they made a profit, for the first time, of £1.76 million. In 1989 they had a profit of £1.95 million, in 1990 a profit of £1.59 million and, I understand, the figure for this year is £2.4 <Col N="845" /> million while the projected operating surplus for next year is £4.2 million.  In other words, there has been a gradual but definite increase from a minus of £9.4 million to a plus of £4.2 million.  That shows clearly that the taxpayer having invested all this money now faces some prospect that things will get better if the debts are written off, and I appreciate that that is to be the case.  This would allow the Government to ensure that no future resale of the B &amp; I line would take place without their consent thereby ensuring that it could be retained in Irish hands. The rumour on the Stock Exchange and around town is that already there are talks between P &amp; O and Irish Ferries for a merger.  The point of resale arises directly and now in so far as the control, if any, we have in relation to a resale.</P>
    <P>On all previous State privatisation legislation, such as the Acts which enabled the Sugar Company and Irish Life to privatise, the State saw fit to have a gradual process of reducing State share ownership.  Currently Greencore is 45 per cent owned by the Government.  This allows for continuity and stability and allows also for a future opportunity to sell shareholdings if a Government at some stage should decide that that is in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Other than the strategic issues involved, the other major issue is one of industrial relations &mdash; the future welfare of the current staff of B &amp; I, their pension fund and their rights of continuity of pay and conditions in the new takeover. The first point that has to be made in this regard is that as a private company the Government are basically quite happy to throw the staff and management of B &amp; I to the wolves in terms of their jobs, pay and conditions.</P>
    <P>It is an open secret that during the period January to August when Irish Continental Group outlined to the unions, their detailed proposals for job losses and reorganisation there was very little progress reported and some of the talks simply broke down.  I do not believe any group of unions should be given a blank cheque in terms of preserving all their jobs in what is a very competitive <Col N="846" /> and not very profitable sector of the transport industry.  However the extent to which the Government are prepared to abandon these workers is unacceptable. It should have been a condition of the purchase deal that job losses were voluntary.  I understand that the total number of employees at B &amp; I as at 21 February 1991 was 1,000, including 123 temporary employees who have between one and three years service.  The ultimate objective of ICG is to reduce these staffing levels to around 650 under the take over.  Added to this despair for many of the employees and their families is the difference of opinion in terms of pay and conditions for different elements of the staff: between shore based and sea going staff, between white collar managerial staff including ships officers and other staff.  It is no secret that relations are very strained between SIPTU and the Seamen's Union of Ireland.  I am not an expert in industrial relations nor do I claim to know how this matter can best be resolved but it is obvious that the Government and the officials of the Department of Tourism, Transport and communications have made little or no attempt to get to grips with these underlying problems and to facilitate straightforward negotiations to ensure industrial harmony and a consensus.</P>
    <P>The events of last week have made a difficult situation into an explosive one. The way the Government, and particularly the Minister, treated the staff management buy-out smacked of contempt. I have to confess that I was surprised initially when the Government invited such as MSBO to develop, at the 11th hour of negotiations between the Government and Irish Ferries.  It soon became obvious what the Government were at: they said there was only two weeks for such an offer to be put together, then this was extended to four weeks. This contrasts with the fact that Irish Continental Group have been allowed a year to prepare an offer in conjunction with Stokes Kennedy Crowley corporate consultants and a further six months in which to carry out a due diligence assessment and to negotiate a legal contract, <Col N="847" /> and a further four months in which to finalise the purchase.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the staff management offer was given adequate time to develop or that it was given adequate consideration by the Government.  In fact, the Minister was very cynical in this whole exercise, first, in trying to force the hand of Irish Continental Group and, second, by being abroad, in the Far East, when the offer was submitted and then immediately seizing the opportunity to conclude a deal with ICG when the management buy out was at its most vulnerable with the exit of the Danish shipping group who might have reentered a day or two later.  It is possible that the consortium, if given more time, could have made an offer equal to that of Irish Continental Group.  However, the Minister deliberately chose his time for decision, when making any comparison on the two offers, between ICG and the MSBO but was most favourable to ICG.  Nearly everyone would agree that as of last Wednesday evening, the ICG offer was the best on the table.  That is not to say that subsequently a better or improved offer could not have been obtained.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect for the B &amp; I staff and their union representatives is to secure their future.  The fact is the Government have not only concluded a deal but want to railroad all stages of this legislation through the Dáil and Seanad in less than a week.  The Government have access to much industrial relations machinery in the form of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court to oversee meaningful and worthwhile discussions on the future security of as many jobs as possible in the B &amp; I Line.</P>
    <P>It is clear that Irish Ferries propose to make dramatic changes in relation to shore based employment levels.  I understand senior management is to be virtually eliminated, perhaps three middle ranking executives will be retained, and the senior management will be replaced by that of ICG; 42 per cent of clerical jobs are to be got rid of; maintenance <Col N="848" /> employees are to be completely removed and replaced by contractors.  The number of dockers and checkers at Dublin Port are to be greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I Line proposals are well known.  A relatively public document of 12 April 1991, sent to all employees of B &amp; I outlined by category the shore based staff, the sea going staff and those in Dublin Port.  Since then I understand the position has become even worse.  The current number of employees, 877, is being reduced to 253; The maintenance staff in Dublin Port of 25 is being reduced to two &mdash; a reduction of 92 per cent &mdash; road freight staff are being reduced from ten to four and the clerical staff of 240 is to be reduced to 102.  These matters were discussed and no basis was found for anything. The Minister is underwriting the railroading through of that approach in the most disruptive and argumentative way.  There are valid points on both sides in any such future negotiations. However, the level of revision in the term of pay and conditions of employment together with work practices is so stark that there is a risk of the mother of all battles between the group of unions and the Irish Continental Group.  If such a doomsday scenario arises and shipping services are disrupted, or if the B &amp; I Line as we know it, sinks because of industrial relations problems, the blame will lie exclusively with the Minister, Deputy Brennan, who has entered into a dialogue of the deaf with the group of unions to date on these difficulties.  In this instance a minority State interest would have ensured the type of stability and continuity necessary to achieve the rationalisation and reduced operating costs while, at the same time, allowing the staff to feel secure in the knowledge that there would be a full transfer of undertakings in relation to their overall employment.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I pension fund currently stands at over £60 million.  I understand that it is over-subscribed to the extent of approximately £10 million but that there are some provisions in relation to EC equal rights that will reduce this amount <Col N="849" /> slightly.  I also understand that the trustees of this pension fund are the Allied Irish Banks and that there is some pressure from the UK authorities to remove the tax exempt status from the fund.  I would like the Minister to clarify whether Irish Ferries will have a free hand in paying severence deals to staff &mdash; for them to be laid off &mdash; out of the surplus of this fund.  If so, Irish Ferries will have got the company for virtually nothing as the purchase price will be equal to resources available from the pensions fund.</P>
    <P>Many former employees of the B &amp; I Line and others dependent on a pension for their future from B &amp; I must have answers to the future of the surpluses of this fund.  Moreover, the Minister must clarify what steps he has taken to ensure that the surplus of this fund, if, and when amalgamated with Irish Ferries' existing pension fund, will not give a direct cross-subsidy from B &amp; I workers to Irish Ferry workers.  The Minister must also clarify whether the current pension fund arrangement which operates on the basis of a 7 per cent employee contribution and a 7 per cent employer contribution will continue for future B &amp; I employees. It is not adequate for Irish Ferries to state that, simply because pension funds if in deficit are the responsibility of the employer, where there is a surplus and there is a new acquisition in the firm, they would have free access to these funds.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's assurances on these points are not satisfactory we will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage to ensure that some protection is given in this regard.  It would be remarkable if the Government in their panic to be removed from exposure to B &amp; I debts were to give a present of the B &amp; I Line to Irish Ferries, remove all interest charges and debts, facilitate rationalisation, confer huge tax loss benefits, make available EC grant aid and then allow pension fund surpluses to be creamed off as icing on the cake of this deal.</P>
    <P>When Irish Sugar were being privatised there was an industrial relations agreement negotiated by the group of unions and the Sugar Company under the <Col N="850" /> auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. This agreement was endorsed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food by letter.  This was added to by a letter from the Taoiseach, who was then acting as Minister for Finance, confirming the pension arrangements as set out in clause 7 of that agreement.  Amendments were made on the Committee Stage of the Sugar Company Bill on 14 March 1990 based on negotiations between the unions and the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>It is clear that, at the outset, the unions were opposed to the privatisation of Irish Sugar.  They recognised the decision of the Government to proceed and thus every effort was made to influence the shape of the company for the future. This resulted in a satisfactorily negotiated settlement.  There was a clear adherence to the provisions of the European Community's Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings Regulations, 1980.  All this must contrast with the present actions of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications. Why should State employees be treated so differently?  On Committee Stage, we will be seeking to insert some amendments that would give some level of fair treatment to the B &amp; I Line employees.</P>
    <P>I have copies of correspondence from the Congress of Trade Unions, through their industrial officer, Mr. Stephen McCarthy, to each member of the Sugar Company group outlining the text of the industrial relations agreement negotiated by the union group and the Labour Relations Commission.  I have the agreement signed by Mr. Kieran Mulvey for the Labour Relations Commission, by Mr. Tony Heaphy of the Sugar Company and by Mr. McCarthy of the ICTU.  The workers of the B &amp; I Line deserve no less than the workers of Greencore.  If it was possible to amend sections 2 and 6 of the Irish Sugar Company Bill in relation to the rights of employees and the regulations as outlined on 3 October 1980, by the Minister for Labour, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, and Statutory Instrument No. 306 of 1980, all of those requests by the <Col N="851" /> workforce to have them included in this legislation are legitimate, fair and reasonable. It is not fair that workers in one State company should be treated differently to those in another.</P>
    <P>It is essential for the Minister to clarify certain aspects of the small print of this Bill.  What are the details of section 3 of this Bill, specifically subsection (3)?  The media has referred to Irish Ferries purchasing the B &amp; I Line free of &ldquo;liabilities and warranties&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify the situation in relation to the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i> in this regard?  If it transpires that the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i> and the B &amp; I Line were responsible for the recent accident with the <i>m.v. Hasselwerder,</i> who will pick up the bill for the damages claim that will ensue?  Will it be the insurer, the taxpayer or ICG? Similarly, in what circumstances will ICG pay the Government less than £8.5 million? What commitment has been given as to the size of the net assets of the B &amp; I at the end of 1991?  What trading targets have been set for the B &amp; I to achieve in 1991 for which a public balance sheet and accounts are not available as yet?</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable for the Minister to come into this House to give an attempted defence of his position without outlining all aspects of the deal.  I want to know the conditions of the deal as they relate to assets and trading figures for 1991.  The Dáil and the public are entitled to these answers.  It is unacceptable that the Dáil should be asked to sanction a pig in a poke without knowledge of the small print.</P>
    <P>It is only fair in terms of the climate of recent months that the Government should clarify the exact role of NCB in relation to this ideal and what level of political contact there has been between the Taoiseach, NCB and Mr. Dermot Desmond, if any, in setting up this deal? The Minister must give a clear assurance that political preference has not been shown and that all aspects of political contacts on these negotiations as opposed to commercial and administrative contacts have been above board, open and accountable.  I do not have any grounds <Col N="852" /> for making allegations of impropriety, but it is important that no suspicion of political favouritism attaches to this sale.</P>
    <P>My party will oppose Second Stage of this Bill because the B &amp; I have been sold at a knock down price, at the wrong time and in the wrong way.  It is wrong for the State to exclude itself from a vital shipping interest, thus giving no protection in terms of continuity of a shipping service, a return to the taxpayer, or any protection to the workforce and to the development of our access tourism services.</P>
    <P>It might have been possible to pursue the British experience of a management buy-out by Maggie Thatcher in the instance of the National Freight Corporation, but this was jettisoned by the Minister who made a panic decision.  Irish Ferries could have been a suitable partner for the State to develop the B &amp; I Line into the nineties.  Such a joint venture, partnership or even the retention of the minority or golden share would have been infinitely better than the present proposal.  The fact that the Minister was psyched by ICG into thinking there was no alternative, that this way was the only way to have the company, represents seriously flawed judgement.  We believe the ramifications of this deal will be serious not only for the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the relations between the social partners and the Government but also for the economy in terms of a competitive marine transport sector.</P>
    <P>The Government's botched handling of the industrial relations aspect of this negotiations has been appalling and may make a difficult situation impossible.  For these reasons we will be opposing the Second Stage of this Bill and seeking to radically amend it on Committee Stage to insert some continuing role for the State in shipping services; to provide similar protection to the workforce as is provided in previous privatisations of State companies; to allow leverage clauses by the Government in terms of the write-off of debt; to ensure that in any future resale of the B &amp; I Line it will be retained under the Irish flag; and to <Col N="853" /> give adequate protection to all those dependent on the B &amp; I pension fund.</P>
    <P>In these contexts this Bill is seriously defective and it has major gaps.  The Government's handling of this matter has been shortsighted, prejudiced and weak. Only the future will tell how big a price will have to be paid for the Government's mismanagement.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to some points made by the Minister in his Second Stage speech.  In page 13 he deals with the arguments against the golden share and his best line here is &ldquo;a golden share is simply not practicable because it would mean the Government going back on its decision to effectively dispose of the line&rdquo;.  I disagree with that.  It would not be wrong to go back on that line.  It shows the hidden agenda of the Minister which is to get rid of the B &amp; I Line at any cost, at any price, and as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister also rejects it on the grounds that the Government's primary strategic concern for the future relates to capacity and ensuring that shipping services to and from Ireland remain competitive. The Minister cannot give the House any assurances with regard to the competitiveness of Irish shipping or what will happen in the southern corridor.  He does not know what Stena Sealink will do.  He realises their size; he has launched some of their ships, the <i>Hibernia</i> in particular. The Minister knows they are a very large multinational.  We all know they took a bath this year and lost £30 million.  We all know they have debts of £300 million.  However, because of the development of the Channel Tunnel whereby their Dover-Calais service will obviously not be the growth pattern of the future, they will not leave the Irish Sea.  They will dig in and see this as their opportunity.  In the past they have been in a cartel with the B &amp; I Line to try to shore up the southern corridor, so they split revenue.  The Minister will see that they will probably take a different attitude when it is not a State company and when they are not dealing with big brother and the taxpayer in terms of competition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> The Minister points to the disadvantages. I would point to the advantage of Greencore, a very successful company that will make record profits this year.  For years Irish Life had a mix of State and private holdings.  This is a well established practice of mixing the two sectors.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say that he will allow five weeks for the unions to lodge a bid.  With respect to the Minister, five weeks is not a very long time.  It is not a very long time starting from a cold, standing still position.  In fairness, five months would be more reasonable.</P>
    <P>In relation to initiating worldwide bids for the B &amp; I line, that brings me to something that is of deep concern to me and that was brought to my attention no later than today.  In case this is misrepresented, I want to assure the Minister that the people who are advising me are not all mad Workers' Party supporters, and I have spoken to the workers and the staff of the B &amp; I Line and many others. There are many very sensible committed people who do not see this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me clarify that.  The people I am speaking to, who have major reservations about this deal, have no ideological hang-up in relation to State ownership of companies.  They are sound, business people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has the ideological hang-up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's ground is shifting all the time.  I am always interested in any new shift that it might take.  I want to make a serious point here and that is in relation to SKC.  The Minister said that they initiated worldwide bids.  I believe that there was a serious conflict of interest because SKC are the auditors for the B &amp; I Line and SKC, the corporate company, were advisers to the Minister in this matter.  I do not believe that is appropriate and <Col N="855" /> the Minister should have taken that into account when appointing the advisers. It is not my intention to cast any aspersions on the personnel involved on either side, but I believe that was not proper.</P>
      <P>I also have very serious reservations about breaches of the Companies Act that have taken place.  I want to be quite specific about this, and I want the Minister to respond.  Under the provisions of section 131(1) of the Companies Act, 1963, every company must hold an annual general meeting in each calendar year.  Not more than 15 months should elapse between annual general meetings. Therefore an AGM of the B &amp; I Line plc should have been held on or before 25 July 1991.  In accordance with the provisions of section 148 of the Companies Act, 1963, the accounts of a company must be presented to an AGM within nine months of the year end.  This implies that the accounts to 31 December 1990 should have been laid before the AGM before 30 September 1991.  However, the provisions of section 131 have precedence over the provisions of section 148 and, therefore, the AGM of the B &amp; I Line plc should have been held on or before 25 July this year.  Why did that not take place?  Under the provisions of section 128 of the Companies Act, 1963 B &amp; I Line plc is required to file a set of accounts with its annual return at the Companies Registration Office.  Under the provisions of section 127 the annual return must be made up to a date 14 days after the holding of the AGM and the annual return and accounts must be filed within 60 days of the AGM.  As no accounts have heretofore been available the B &amp; I Line plc is in breach of the provisions of sections 131, 127 and 128 of the Companies Act, 1963.  Therefore, when accounts do become available an AGM should be held as soon as possible and the annual return and accounts filed at the Companies Registration Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are very serious allegations that have come to me and I would like the Minister to respond.  As far as I am concerned this is not a matter that is open to <Col N="856" /> debate; these are matters of fact, and I have them from an impeccable source.</P>
    <P>It has also been brought to my attention by share analysts and stockbrokers, after this deal is over and all going well, what the effect will be on Irish Continental Group which is quoted on the Stock Exchange in the smaller equities division.  I understand the present share value of ICG is 12p.  I am told that this will double their share value to 24p; that their capital value at the moment is £20 million and that this will increase to £41 million.  I also understand that their net profit will rise from £2.9 million to £4.2 million for the next year.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the central point being made in that regard which is that it really is a knockdown price whatever way one looks at it.  Even if it goes as low as £8 million from the surplus of the pension fund, when one adds that to the property and the ships clear of all debt charges, if one puts together the variable assets, leaving aside the perks and the tax losses &mdash; and they are making losses somewhere between £2 million and £3 million a year now &mdash; that is a very substantial benefit.  I know there is 10 per cent corporation tax applying to the shipping sector.  That is a substantial benefit, and all the time the Minister and his colleague, the Tánaiste, are making detailed submissions to the EC Commission to extend, because we do not have a land bridge to Europe, a sea bridge, and there is the possibility for the first time of substantial grant aid.  I would have to conclude that one of the principles of privatisation, an open competitive tendering system, has not been established here to our satisfaction, that a precedent has been established whereby through private negotiation a sweetheart deal has been arrived at at a knockdown price.</P>
    <P>We are not opposed in principle to privatisation.  There are other companies where we would positively favour privatisation, where extra investment is needed.  Take, for example the fleet replacement of Aer Lingus.  I would not oppose a measure to do a joint merger with another airline or to inject outside <Col N="857" /> equity into that.  As an overall policy, I have no difficulty with it but the terms of this deal cause grave difficulty, leaving aside the powder keg of industrial relations and the way that matter is being handled.</P>
    <P>I also have grave reservations, and I say this with some regret, about the treatment of the board in this manner.  The people involved are not the type of people to go to the media.  They are not the type of people to brief me in relation to their upset at the way they have been treated.  I understand that it is only today that the Minister has met with them in the context of this deal and the developments at the eleventh hour.  I understand in the memorandum to Government they have had no input or consultation.  At the vital stages of conclusion there was no critical involvement.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's neglect of persons with a handicap and their carers, and calls for an immediate five year programme to deal with the enormous gaps in services which would be based on the recommendations of the report of the Working Party on Services of the Mentally Handicapped, and making similar provisions to meet the outstanding needs of those with other forms of disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important motion.  Any <Col N="858" /> Deputy who has attended meetings of parents' associations who are providing care for people with a handicap would know of the frustration and anguish experienced by parents who find themselves in that situation today.  Those parents feel they have been neglected and let down.  We should put our hands on our hearts tonight and say honestly that we have let down those parents, that the needs of those with a disability have been ignored for a long time, that there are deficiencies in the services provided for people with a handicap, that there are unacceptable regional variations in the services provided and waiting lists to gain access to basic services which people expect to get.</P>
    <P>The cost of caring for a person with disability has not been recognised while parents are being forced to go on caring for a person with a disability even though they may no longer be able to cope.  They do so in the most appalling circumstances when they are stretched to breaking point, often going without sleep or a break and having no chance of a holiday.  Many of us were in the Mansion House last year when a parent gave a most moving description of the position in which she found herself &mdash; she was caring for a person aged 29 years &mdash; when she pointed out that the only thing she had to look forward to was death as a release for herself and her husband from the task of caring.  If we want to call ourselves a Christian community we cannot accept that that kind of situation should continue.  Carers, as they grow old themselves, face the dreaded uncertainty of the future while the waiting lists for suitable places are growing longer by the day.  It is unforgivable that the Government are neglecting these persons because report after report has highlighted the gaps and needs in this area. Their hopes have been raised several times only to be dashed again in a most cruel fashion.</P>
    <P>When I put down a motion condemning the Government's neglect of this area I was not making a mere political statement.  I would like to quote Sr. <Col N="859" /> Angela Magee, chairperson of the Federation of Voluntary Bodies who provide service for people with a mental handicap. She said the federation &ldquo;expresses its deepest concern at the Government's failure to provide the resources necessary to resolve the problems in the mental handicap service&rdquo;.  This area has been neglected for far too long and it is most disappointing that the Government cannot face up to the issue.  It was disappointing also to see the Government trot out, again, commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> now well over a year old; during the course of that year no improvements were made.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, for well over a year the Minister sat on the report of the review group who considered Government policy on those with a mental handicap which was presented to him in 1990 before he released it and when it was finally published he announced he was rejecting the recommended target date of 1994 as the year by which the outstanding problems should be resolved and extended it by another four years.  As a result we are asking those with a mental handicap or an intellectual disability to wait until 1998 before their problems will be resolved.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which was published at the end of last year contains many promises with regard to the development of community care services and commitments to meet the needs of those with a disability but barely a month later when the ink was hardly dry on that document all the promises had been forgotten.  A mere £1 million was provided in the budget of 1991 to meet the needs of those with an intellectual disability.  This amounts to only £30 for each person with a mental handicap.  How could we hope to develop a meaningful response to the Government research document on the needs of persons with disability by providing only £30 for each person?  That caused deep bitterness among those people who finally thought their case was going to be heard.  To put the matter in <Col N="860" /> context, this allocation amounted to less than one-tenth of the amount which the Government's own report described as the bare minimum that would be required to make a start in tackling these problems.</P>
    <P>The problems in this area are deep-seated. Ireland lacks a coherent policy to deal with the needs of persons with a disability.  We have no framework developed to ensure that the needs of persons with a disability are met.  Each element of a person's life is dealt with in a very fragmented way, with responsibility scattered among different agencies. There is no coherent planning.  There are now huge waiting lists even for the most rudimentary of services.  I do not think any other body of people could or would be asked to tolerate those conditions. In addition, there is a lack of statistical information on the disabled.  This is a clear indication of the priority policy makers attach to this matter.  It is true that up until recently many politicians were unaware of the extent of the difficulties being faced by persons with a disability and by their carers.  Were it not for the work being done by the voluntary agen-agencies very few services would be provided but the role of the voluntary agencies as a partner in policy making has not been recognised by the Government.</P>
    <P>People with a disability find gaps in the services provided throughout their lives, from the cradle to the grave.  For example, Ireland stands alone among member states in that it has not developed a genetic counselling service even though this was recommended in mid-1990 in the policy document which the Minister of State has in his hand. Each year 1,600 babies are born with a major impediment of faculty.  It is known that a genetic counselling service could be of help in reducing that number.</P>
    <P>Those who wish to gain access to the services of a doctor are means-tested rigidly on the same basis as the able-bodied while the cost of caring is ignored. According to a recent estimate it costs £150 per week to care for a person with a moderate handicap at home rising to £240 per week in the case of a person <Col N="861" /> with a severe handicap.  By way of contrast, the care allowance provided for parents of a child with a disability is a mere £20 per week.  In regard to the carer's allowance, which was promoted with a flourish by the Government when it was announced, the reality is that less than 5 per cent of carers qualify for that allowance because applicants are subjected to a most rigorous means test.  In other words less than 5 per cent of those providing care in the home for a person with a disability qualify for this allowance.</P>
    <P>Families who provide care become very cynical especially when they hear talk about providing community care services because they know they have had to rely on their own resources and are given very little help.  There are huge deficiencies in the services available.  For example, the speech therapy service is in crisis.  Indeed, we have not developed an effective service.  There are about 30 speech therapists available in the country to provide care for people with a mental handicap.  The number of persons with a mental handicap requiring speech therapy is estimated at almost 20,000.  A reasonable case-load expected to be borne by a speech therapist would be in the region of 50; the idea that we can even begin to cater for the needs of persons with a mental handicap with 30 speech therapists is bizarre.  One would need to double, treble or quadruple that figure to have a realistic service of which we could be proud.  The same applies to physiotherapy.  There is a complete lack of service in many regions and huge variations in the service that is provided.  This criticism also applies to nursing assistants.</P>
    <P>Home help for someone caring for a person with a disability is minimal and it is often not available in a crisis, in the morning, when parents are trying to get other children to school, at weekends or at night.  Respite facilities, designed to give carers a break, are also in crisis; people just cannot get access to respite facilities when they need them.  At a minimum, there is a need for 100 extra respite places if we are to be in a position to <Col N="862" /> offer those who are trying to care the opportunity for a holiday and to have relief in a crisis.</P>
    <P>Families are being asked to go on caring long after they can cope.  The waiting list for residential places is well over 900 for persons with an intellectual disability and 300 for people with a physical disability.  In 1991 the Government provided less than one-quarter of the recommended minimum provision in the area of residential care.  At the present rate of provision a person on a waiting list could expect to wait ten years before being allocated a residential place.  I am talking about people for whom official agencies have clearly stated they are no longer able to provide care in the community. It is a situation we cannot accept.  Those parents have an enormous worry hanging over them because they know there are 1,500 people with an intellectual disability who are wrongly accommodated in psychiatric hospitals.  There is supposed to be a major commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to provide services for the mentally handicapped but it has now been watered down and statements from the Minister and the Department are no longer clear-cut in this regard.</P>
    <P>Persons with or without a handicap have a right to education, it seems to be a pillar of our constitutional rights, but that is not the reality, particularly for children with a severe disability.  Many are accommodated in centres which cannot cope with their educational needs and there is not the necessary back-up of resources to meet their needs in relation to care attendants, therapy or teaching resources, despite two major reports in the eighties which highlighted the need for commitment of resources to this area.</P>
    <P>A report in the eighties highlighted the teacher-pupil ratio and the need for commitment in that area.  Despite that less than one-tenth of the required teaching resources which were highlighted as needed then have been committed in the intervening nine years. Little has changed in spite of these major reports on educational needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" /> When children leave school the situation gets even worse; anyone who has taken the trouble to examine the situation cannot but describe it as a crisis for adolescent persons with a handicap. Apart from the lack of residential places, to which I already referred, there is an enormous difficulty in getting any opportunity for a person with a disability to have an occupation which matches his or her capabilities.  There is no training guarantee, which we would apply to the able-bodied; discriminatory rules are applied in access to training which do not apply to the able bodied.  You have to be on a means tested allowance before you are even considered for training if you are unfortunate enough to have a disability. That rule is not applied to the able bodied.  There are about 1,200 people waiting for placement in day centres and last year no new day centre was provided. There was a recommendation that 450 should be provided but none was in 1991.</P>
    <P>It is virtually impossible to get sheltered employment and where it is available, it does not offer proper terms of employment.  Even European politicians have highlighted the poor conditions of employment in Ireland for people with a disability.  Such centres as there are face imminent financial crisis because, under EC rules, aid is confined to training to allow people to complete in the open market.  The reality is that most of our training centres and sheltered workshops are not training young people to find employment on the open market.  As a result, year in, year out, there is a tightening of the availability of funds from the EC and there has been no substitute funding from the Exchequer to allow the centres to continue.  Over the last 12 months there have been cases where people in training have had to be sent home because of budget constraints.</P>
    <P>People with a disability seeking a job on the open market face enormous discrimination; unemployment among persons with a disability is estimated to be an astronomic 70 per cent, two out of every three persons with a disability available for employment in the open <Col N="864" /> market are out of work.  In the mid-eighties there was a clear commitment to try to tackle this problem and a target was set, 3 per cent of public service posts would be set aside for people with a disability. That commitment has now been abandoned and figures are not even maintained in regard to progress; fewer than one-third of the allocation of posts was achieved.  We have abandoned that target.  It is a very serious problem and Fine Gael are committed to addressing that huge gap.</P>
    <P>Many continental countries operate a system where employers, public and private, either employ a certain proportion of persons with a disability or pay a levy into a fund which is available to provide sheltered employment opportunities for persons with a disability.  We have, in effect, abandoned the 3 per cent quota and put nothing in its place.  Ireland has no policy of providing employment opportunities for persons with a disability.</P>
    <P>Most of us would like to see persons with a disability participating much more widely in community life, but they often face unsurmountable obstacles to such participation to which we all pay lip service. Public facilities are generally inaccessible; you only have to look at this House to realise that if a TD was confined to a wheelchair he or she could not get in or out of this Chamber.  We do not think in those terms which is an indictment of legislators.  The same is true of most polling stations which are not accessible to people with a disability. That applies not just to Leinster House but to public facilities throughout the country.  None of our bus or taxi fleets are accessible to anyone in a wheelchair. Recently when we had the opportunity to allocate new taxi plates in Dublin we made no provision to designate some of them for persons with a disability, and that was a scandal.</P>
    <P>The same is true of access to accommodation. The public housing programme has virtually ignored the needs of persons with a disability.  It was only recently that an effort was made to assess these needs.  There is no real policy to <Col N="865" /> foster independent living by those people.  It has been left to the voluntary agencies in this area to take up that task and provide some support for those people.  Every local authority should set aside a quota of the housing allocation to cater for persons with a disability.  As the public housing programme declines specific categories of people cannot provide accommodation for themselves.  The Government may be right in saying that more people should be encouraged to find accommodation but that rule cannot be applied to persons with a disability, 70 per cent of whom are out of work.  We will have to address these issues very seriously.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the voluntary agencies have to carry most of the burden, but they get little thanks for it.  They are not seen as a partner in this area.  In the last four years the national lottery has siphoned off £50 million from the funds raised by voluntary agencies who cater for persons with a disability.  By contrast those agencies received only £3 million from the national lottery.  In effect we have allowed the national lottery to rob some of the most vulnerable groups in our community of the resources that were available to them.  The alternative lottery, operated by Rehab, is run for agencies providing care for people with a disability.  That lottery labours under enormous restrictions in the Gaming and Lottery Acts.  It is not possible to develop alternative fund raising to substitute for the £50 million loss.  The maximum payout by the Rehab lottery in any one week is a mere £10,000.  On a regular basis the pay-out by the national lottery amounts to £1 million for the top prize alone, not to talk of the other prizes.  That is grossly unfair because it has sucked money from the agencies who provide care and support in this area.</P>
    <P>This House has failed miserably to address the needs of persons with a disability. I published this week a comprehensive programme that addresses all those issues.  It sets about bringing people with a disability in from the cold, to make them equal social partners so that their concerns are met, in the same way as are <Col N="866" /> the concerns of others, in the <i>Programme for Social and Economic Progress</i> and other negotiations.  We propose that a Minister of State should pursue actively a charter for persons with a disability, that legislation be introduced to eliminate discrimination, particularly in the workplace and that clear commitments be given to the rights of persons with a disability in the area of caring, education, accommodation and access to public facilities.  That has to be under-pinned. Most importantly we must give clear recognition to the cost and the burden of caring.  We must relax the terms of the carer's allowance and provide temporary places so that people can get a break from the task of caring.  The children of people with a disability should have access to medical cards so that they do not have to look for payments and allowances that are arbitrarily taken back from them, with no proper appeal mechanism.</P>
    <P>The system that has been allowed develop here is not acceptable.  A five year programme is urgently needed.  I do not think the House will accept the notion that the Government will address these issues over a period of seven years.  A five year programme should have been implemented last year but instead nothing was done.  I do not think any Member will accept the Government's genuflection to the report on hand and their failure to provide solid funding in the 1992 budget.  I hope the Minister of State will have a message of clear commitment to the needs of persons with a disability, both physical and intellectual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. The amendment in the name of the Minister for Health is a complete evasion of responsibility, with pious aspirations of what should be done but no concrete evidence that anything will be done in this regard.  It would be laughable if this was not such a serious issue.  The Minister knows, as does everybody, that the record of the Government in the provision of services for people with a handicap and for their carers is shameful.  That is the reason we put down this motion for debate tonight.  It is also the reason Fine <Col N="867" /> Gael launched their policy document yesterday &mdash;<i>A Coherent Policy for People with Disability.</i>  That document which is available will be the Fine Gael policy when in Government.  It outlines clearly the direction Fine Gael intend to go in the provision of services for people with a disability.</P>
      <P>There is too much fragmentation and duplication of departmental responsibility in matters dealing with the mentally handicapped.  It is a classic case of buck-passing. I am sure the present Minister for Health is well aware of this because she has come from the Department of Education who often passed the buck to the Department of Health and <i>vice versa.</i> I witnessed an example of buck-passing in my constituency this year when a special class for severely handicapped children was closed in Merlin Park Hospital and a special class was opened in Scoil Caitríona, Renmore national school.  The children who attended the class in Merlin Park had a full time carer but when they arrived at school on 2 September in Scoil Caitríona there was no carer and they had to go home because it was not possible to continue without a carer.  We spent three frustrating weeks contacting the Department of Education seeking a full time carer's assistant for the children in this school.  It took the Department of Education three weeks to reply, stating that we should contact the Department of Health and three weeks later that Department told us to contact the Department of Education.  Thus, the buck-passing continued.</P>
      <P>One Government Department should be responsible for the educational needs of children with a disability.  Eventually the problem in this school was solved by the provision from the national lottery of £10,000 on a once off basis for a child carer assistant.  It should not be a matter for the national lottery as to whether those children received the facilities and the care to which they are entiled.  It should be a matter of policy, and one Department should have responsibility for that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without the outstanding contribution <Col N="868" /> of voluntary organisations, there would be serious problems in several areas.  Parents, and in some cases aged parents, are being forced to continue caring long past the time they can adequately cope.  Parents have an in built fear of what will happen their child when they pass on.  In County Galway, for example, 21 mentally handicapped people are awaiting admission to residential care.  Because of the lack of provision in the Government Estimates, there is very little respite care available.  It is essential that carers get a break from caring for somebody 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, but in most cases it is impossible.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance was announced with great fanfare by the Minister for Social Welfare a year ago.  This was to replace the prescribed relatives maintenance allowance and the allowance was raised from £28 to £45.  People's hopes were raised that at last this was a genuine attempt to acknowledge the efforts of carers in caring for people in their own home.  Most people's hopes were dashed, however, when the qualification restrictions were so rigidly enforced.  Indeed, in Annaghdown, in my own constituency, a mother caring 24 hours a day for a severely disabled person in her own home was granted the princely sum of £2 a week, an insult, because her husband had a few cattle and sheep on the land.  She will continue to care for this disabled person and has no opportunity to avail of respite care.  These people want their work to be recognised.  It is very degrading for people to be put through the mill by social welfare officers when their case is so obviously justifiable.</P>
    <P>Children with severe disabilities should have a right to education, but this right does not exist at present in Ireland.  The concept of integrating special classes in ordinary national schools is being pushed by the Government at present, but this is a waste of time if there are not adequate back up facilities.  Indeed, it may be a retrograde step if the appropriate back up services are not provided.  I can give an example in my own constituency: eight profoundly deaf children and one totally <Col N="869" /> blind child attend a special class in Claddagh national school.  They had the assistance of a full-time carer up to the beginning of this year but this was discontinued because the health board had not budgeted for providing the service, yet the Department of Health do not recognise this, nor do the Department of Education.  The problem still exists in that school.</P>
    <P>My colleague dealt with the whole question of the accessibility of public buildings to disabled people; indeed public buildings, toilets and telephone boxes have not been modified to cater for those with disabilties and footpaths have not been dished to allow people with disabilities to go about their ordinary business.  Accessibility should be made a necessary provision in all planning matters.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael was the first political party to treat the disabled seriously.  Our Leader, Deputy John Bruton, appointed me spokesman with responsibility for the mentally handicapped and special education. I have learned a great deal from my year's experience.  I am very pleased to be associated with my party colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, who yesterday launched a policy document <i>A Coherent Policy for People with a Disability.</i> This is the first serious attempt by any political party to address the problems of people with disabilities in the home, in the community, in schools and in the work place.  It is fitting that this document was launched this week following Disability Awareness Week last week when I took the opportunity to visit schools, workshops and residential centres catering for the disabled.  I was greatly impressed by the wonderful work being done in teaching, caring and training.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to compliment the parents, teachers, trainers and the many voluntary helpers and fund raisers who devote a lot of their time and energy fund raising to help finance those schools and projects.  Last week I visited a school for handicapped children in Snipe Avenue, Newcastle, Galway.  This school is comprised of a number of prefabs. Before the general election in 1989 the <Col N="870" /> former Minister for Education came to Galway and with the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, announced amid a great fanfare that the long awaited new school would proceed.  A year later, earlier this year, the Minister of State had to announce that the building of a new school would not proceed and that the pupils would be transferred to the Brothers of Charity School, Renmore. This was resisted by the parents and a campaign to have the promised school built in Snipe Avenue got underway. Then, prior to the local election, a similar proposal was announced, and the school plans were sent out to tender.</P>
    <P>I have been pursuing the matter and in reply to a parliamentary question, I was told the tenders were being considered but the school could not proceed until the finance become available.  This is the answer parents and teachers are getting from the uncaring Department.  They have to work under very difficult conditions. Picture a 21 year old prefabricated building with a felt roof; during the wet weather basins have to be placed on the floor to catch the water, and it is dangerous to switch on a light because water is running down the walls. Yet the Minister told me in reply to my question three weeks ago that a new school will depend on the availability of finance in the 1992 Estimates.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, the only representative of the Government present, to take up this matter again.  I will ask the new Minister for Education to take up this matter from the educational point of view, because it is very serious.  This is repeated in several constituencies throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to be associated with the policy document launched by the Fine Gael Party yesterday.  Some of the main recommendations are:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will establish a National Council comprised of service providers and of persons with a disability.  It will review policy, and will be included as a Social Partner on equal terms.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael proposes to implement a five year programme to tackle the <Col N="871" /> outstanding defects in policy.  Fine Gael recognises that this implies a commitment of extra resources both current and capital to the task.</P>
    <P>However this is a neglected area providing for people who make up 8 to 10 per cent of the total population.  All of our proposals could be comfortably funded by redirecting just 1 per cent of the existing budgets for Health, Education and Labour over the five year period.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>notes the Government's commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to the provision of adequate and appropriate services for persons with a mental handicap (based on the report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services) and those with other forms of disability. That Dáil Éireann also endorses the Government's proposals as outlined in the joint Programme for Government to provide improved services for people with mental handicap and other vulnerable groups and notes the Minister's firm intention to progress this stated Government commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the House to reject the motion tabled by the Fine Gael Party and to support the amendment of the Minister <Col N="872" /> for Health and her efforts to enhance services for people with mental handicap and their carers.</P>
    <P>The first point I ask the House to accept is the fact that, under successive Governments, our services for people with a mental handicap have improved beyond all recognition.  Services have been built up over the years, mainly by lay and religious voluntary agencies.  At the time of the foundation of the State there was only one centre specifically catering for people with a mental handicap. Now there are about 70 voluntary agencies in addition to the statutory bodies providing a wide range of services.</P>
    <P>A substantial amount of money is being spent on a range of services to people with a mental handicap.  In 1991 over £170 million will be spent on these services.  About £140 million is being spent on the provision of day, residential and support services.  The voluntary mental handicap agencies funded by my Department will receive £81 million this year and £33 million is being spent on cash allowances.  The domiciliary care allowance is being paid to 3,500 families and over 10,000 people with a mental handicap are receiving the disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>Relative to other public services, funding for the mental handicap services has been protected.  The allocation to agencies funded directly by my Department increased from £39.5 million in 1981 to £77.2 million in 1990, an increase of 95 per cent.  During the same period the net non-capital expenditure on health services increased by 80 per cent.  I must, however, also acknowledge that the number receiving services during this period rose by 34 per cent to the current figure of 11,500 people.  I recognise this increase in productivity in the services concerned.  These figures demonstrate the commitment of the Government to people with a mental handicap.  I pledge that this commitment will be continued and strengthened.</P>
    <P>The key contribution of voluntary agencies was simple but radical.  The sisters, brothers and committed lay people believe in the dignity of the person with a <Col N="873" /> mental handicap.  They believe that with extra help and love, children with a mental handicap could develop their personalities and skills far beyond what many thought possible.</P>
    <P>The role these agencies played in developing mental handicap services is well known.  Initially they received little support from the State for their efforts. Today, however, the State provides almost the entire funding for services. The voluntary sector continues to play a leading role in pioneering new services and new approaches to service delivery.</P>
    <P>Mental handicap services have changed radically and for the better over the last 20 years.  High standards of service provision have been achieved notwithstanding the fact that our country's economic resources are lower than most of our European partners with whom we tend to compare our services.  This is in itself an achievement, due to the sustained efforts of the voluntary and statutory agencies.  The standard of service provision compares favourably with that of other countries.  We have established an international reputation in the field of mental handicap.  In this way the philosophy and standards of care that are the hallmark of our services are being shared in countries with a different historical experience.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that problems do not exist.  They do and they must be faced. The Minister for Health will outline some specific proposals in her contribution to this debate tomorrow.</P>
    <P>There are about 25,000 people with a mental handicap here.  These people have either a mild, moderate, severe or profound degree of mental handicap.  Some have additional physical handicaps.  The kind of service they need varies with the age, degree of handicap, dependency level and the level of home support available. Some lead independent lives and need little or no special assistance. People with a severe or profound handicap and a physical disability tend to require most care.</P>
    <P>Services currently being provided include the early identification of infants whose development is delayed.  Services <Col N="874" /> of children up to the age of three are delivered mainly in the home.  After this children attend preschools to develop their abilities and prepare them for school.  There is a growing and welcome trend of children with a mental handicap attending local preschools.</P>
    <P>During the school-going age, educational services for children with a mild or moderate mental handicap are available in special schools or special classes. Child educational and development centres cater for children who are unable because of the severity of their handicap to attend a special school or class.  In addition to special schools and classes, 950 children attend at day courses throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Vocational training assists school leavers to acquire self-care, social and work skills.  These skills are essential to maximise the young adult's potential to lead an independent life.  Long-term training centres cater for people who have not been able to find work after vocational training or who are not suited to open employment.  More than 4,500 adults attend training and activation services.</P>
    <P>These services enable people with a mental handicap to continue living in the family home.  However, it is not always possible for the person with a mental handicap to live at home.  Alternative accommodation may be provided in group homes or in foster homes.  Almost 1,500 people live in this type of accommodation.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment to the Department of Health I have had the opportunity to visit several group homes throughout the country and I was tremendously impressed by the way they are managed and the family-type atmosphere generated within the homes.  The running of the group homes is a credit to all concerned.  They make a great deal of difference to the lives of those who reside in them.</P>
    <P>At present most residential services are provided in domestic scale accommodation, often in bungalows in the grounds of a residential centre.  As the more independent people move to the <Col N="875" /> community, these centres will mainly accommodate people with the highest levels of dependency.  At present 4,500 people live in these residential centres.</P>
    <P>The value of respite care has been overwhelmingly demonstrated in recent years in supporting families who want to care for their son or daughter but who find the burden of caring without a break too much.  Respite care takes many forms.  It may be in a residential centre, a hostel in the community or in another family who have offered to care on a short term basis.</P>
    <P>With regard to care on a family basis my experience has been that it will have a great deal to offer in the future.  I have had some recent experience of having been introduced to this type of family care which I found to be most impressive. I feel quite sure this constitutes the way forward in offering further respite care to families in need of this type of support, where the care is provided within a definite specific family setting.  I applaud those at present involved in advancing this process.  Altogether 11,500 people with mental handicap are receiving services funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>I should like now to outline Government policy in relation to people with mental handicap.  This policy is contained in the report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services &mdash; Needs and Abilities, an excellent document published in July 1990.  I understand that the committee who drew up that report were established in 1986 and the four years approximately they spent drawing up that report were put to very good use.  It is my opinion and that of those interested in this issue that it is an outstanding policy document which will act as a blueprint for the future development of the services.  I want to applaud all those who participated in drawing up this excellent report, the first major policy statement on mental handicap since the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Mental Handicap in 1965. The report of the review group outlines the principles which should underly the provision of services and endorses the direction in which our mental handicap <Col N="876" /> services have developed.  Throughout their report the review group emphasise the importance of supporting the family and of providing services locally, believing that, with adequate support services, the overwhelming majority of people with mental handicap could be catered for in the community.  The report also emphasised the need to provide mentally handicapped people with the right services at the right time to ensure they develop their full potential for independence. The report also pointed to the need to meet the growing and ageing mental handicap population.  They recommended the number of residential and day places needed to keep abreast of demand in coming years.</P>
    <P>The Government agreed to the recommendations of the report in principle and, within the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> are committed to their implementation.  The Government approach is contained in that programme with particular reference to services for the mentally handicapped. It is as well to remind the House of the contents of that programme in this regard since it states that additional resources will be made available to enable an appropriate mix of community and residential services to be provided for the mentally handicapped so that those capable of living within the community can do so while those for whom that approach is not feasible can be provided with residential places.  It is said also that community services will be developed by the expansion of the network of group homes, day care places and respite care. In addition it states there are 1,500 people with mental handicap inappropriately placed in our psychiatric hospitals who should be transferred to the mentally handicapped services, which transfer would be facilitated by expanding community-based mental handicap services.  It states further that support services for people with mental handicap and their carers in the community will also be strengthened&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to recent developments, I should say that, since the completion of the report of the review group, positive steps have been taken to meet the needs of the mentally handicapped population. I cannot accept Deputy Richard Bruton's contention that no improvements have taken place since the publication of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  I might point out to the Deputy that in the 1990 budget the Government allocated an additional £2 million for mental handicap services, enabling a number of developments to take place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the particularly serious <Col N="878" /> position which obtained within the Eastern Health Board region, half of the £2 million was allocated to that region for an extra 91 residential places, 184 day places and expanded family support places for 66 clients.  This year a further £1 million was allocated in the budget to build on those developments enabling 20 places to be commissioned in Cheeverstown House and has funded the opening of 25 places in Áras Attracta in Swinford as well as additional respite care in each health board region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>In recognition of the serious position obtaining in the east, my Department have ensured that the bulk of the money will benefit families in that region.  For example, 12 of the places in Áras Attracta were filled by people in centres in the east, people whose families wished that they could return to Mayo. In turn their places were filled by people from the priority waiting list in the east.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the additional allocation of funding which allowed for the commissioning of the extra places in Cheeverstown House.  I want to pay tribute to a number of individuals and organisations who assisted over a long and sometimes painful period in trying to come to terms with problems obtaining with regard to the opening of those additional places in Cheeverstown House.  If my memory serves me correctly the issue of Cheeverstown House and the concerns of Members on all sides of the House at the impasse over a number of years which prevented the opening of these additional, much needed places, was raised on a number of occasions in this House.  I particularly want to pay tribute to the federation of voluntary bodies providing services for people with mental handicap in resolving that dispute. Both the Eastern Health Board and the board of Cheeverstown House are working to the agreement negotiated by the federation in October 1990.  The implementation of the agreement is being overseen by Mr. Justice Declan Costello.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pay particular tribute to Mr. <Col N="879" /> Justice Costello for the time, care and attention he gave the position obtaining at Cheeverstown House, on having used his undoubted skills in overseeing the implementation of the agreement with regard to the opening of the additional places there for which funding has been provided.  In regard to Cheeverstown House I am pleased to announce that a new chief executive officer will take up duty shortly and funds have been made available to open 20 additional places there early in 1992.  The people who will take up these places have already been identified.  They were all on the priority waiting list in the Eastern Health Board area.  They have been offered temporary accommodation while they await the opening of the places in Cheeverstown House.  Therefore, we can now look forward to the opening of all the remaining places in Cheeverstown House and to this important residential centre playing its full part in the mental handicap services in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>All of us who have had an opportunity to visit Cheeverstown will have been extremely impressed by the design and layout of the complex and by the approach of the staff to their work and responsibilities there.  I was interested in the centre long before I came into the Department of Health and had visited it on a number of occasions.  I am particularly pleased that the impasse which had developed has been resolved and that provisions are being put in place to allow for the opening of the extra places so that Cheeverstown can realise its excellent potential.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, well aware that there is still a gap between policy and developments on the ground.  I am conscious of the great burden which families carry in caring for a mentally handicapped member.  I do not under-estimate the challenge we face, with the Minister for Health, in providing for these needs. Plans are being prepared in each health board area, in response to the recommendations in the report and the commitments of the <i>Programme for <Col N="880" /> Economic and Social Progress,</i> which will quantify and prioritise development needs at local level.  These plans are being prepared in consultation with the voluntary bodies providing services in each area.  This is a very important aspect of the drawing up of these plans.  It is necessary at all times to consult fully with the voluntary sector who have provided excellent services in this area and have a wealth of practical experience and knowledge. The Minister and I and the officials of the Department of Health fully understand the need to consult very closely with voluntary bodies who have provided services throughout the country.  We can draw on their experience, knowledge and commitment.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that we have not stood still in relation to mental handicap.  A substantial amount of money is being spent on a range of services to people with mental handicap.  Over £170 million will be spent on these services in 1991. About £140 million is being spent on the provision of day and residential support services.  The voluntary mental handicap agencies funded by my Department will receive £81 million this year.  Relative to other areas of expenditure and the number of people involved, it is crucial that the report be implemented as quickly as possible.  This is part and parcel of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>The main challenge we face in developing services for people with disabilities is to respond to the need for greater family support and for more residential places for older and more dependent people with mental handicap.  The position is particularly acute in the Eastern Health Board area.  We accept that some families are carrying an intolerable burden and have been doing so for far too long.  As the life expectancy of people with mental handicap increases, few vacancies arise in existing residential centres.  People who would have been taken into care ten years ago are still on waiting lists with little or no prospect of placement in the foreseeable future.  Elderly parents fear for the future of their son or daughter when they themselves die.  The Minister for <Col N="881" /> Health will address this specific issue in her contribution to this debate tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Health boards, by virtue of their general obligation to provide services under the Health Acts, have responsibility for the health, welfare and rehabilitation needs of people with mental handicap resident in their areas.  However, these needs are catered for substantially by voluntary organisations.  Most of the larger organisations relate directly to the Department of Health for approval and for resources to develop their services. The Department take account of the views of the health boards in relation to these proposals.  Some of the organisations provide services in more than one health board area.  In addition to the general health and welfare schemes provided by the boards to which people with mental handicap have access, the boards also make available a range of specialist services, either directly or through the agency of local voluntary organisations which they grant aid to varying degrees.  The 1991 allocation to mental handicap agencies funded directly by the Department is £81.6 million.  The 1991 estimated total expenditure on services to people with mental handicap is £171 million.  Since the setting up of the national lottery, £3.844 million has been made available for services to people with mental handicap for the provision of community-based services and renovations to existing facilities.  This excludes grants made by health boards from their 1991 block allocation to mental handicap services.</P>
    <P>People with mental handicap are eligible for any health service on the same basis as other people, for example, general medical services, hospital services, dental services, public health nursing services, paramedical services and welfare services.  Children under the age of 16 are provided with hospital in-patient and outpatient services necessary for their condition, without charge.  Persons with mental handicap can also obtain without charge the drugs and medicines necessary for their condition.  Disposable appliances are also provided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> A monthly allowance of £86, the domiciliary care allowance, is payable in respect of a child aged between two and 16 years with mental handicap who is maintained at home.  Expenditure on this allowance in 1991 amounts to £3.768 million. The disabled person's maintenance allowance amounting to £55 per week is payable to those over 16 years who are not in long term care.  Approximately £29.506 million is spent on this scheme. Recipients of the DPMA are entitled to a free travel pass and provision was made in last year's budget for a companion to travel free with a DPMA recipient.  This was, in the opinion of many, a most enlightened decision.  The case had frequently been made by those close to people with mental handicap that there was a need for such a travel pass and it had been sought for many years.  The welcome decision to allow a companion to travel free with a DPMA recipient has eased the burden for some families who have a DPMA recipient living at home and it has also alleviated a certain amount of pressure and worry.</P>
    <P>An income tax allowance of £600 per annum is available to a family who have a mentally handicapped member.  Grants are available for structural alterations and extensions to houses to improve the living conditions of disabled people.  This very important facility is available to people who need to carry out structural changes of one kind or another to improve living accommodation for disabled people.  It is generally dealt with through local authorities and seems to be working reasonably efficiently.  It has made a great difference to people who wish to improve the living conditions of disabled people.  They are helped by health boards and local authorities to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>The motion also refers to people with other forms of disability.  Government policy in relation to the provision of services and facilities for people with other physical disabilities is designed to enable people with such disabilities to be as self-reliant and independent as possible and to have full equality and integration in all <Col N="883" /> aspects of community life.  This independent living policy was outlined in 1984 in the Government's Green Paper on services for disabled people entitled, &ldquo;Towards a Full Life&rdquo; and was further emphasised in detailed reports on specific areas of the services, for example, the planning for the future report on psychiatric services and the report of the review group on mental handicap services published this year.  We are currently considering the initiation of a review of services for people with a physical disability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put on record the Labour Party amendment to the Fine Gael motion.  I understand I cannot move the amendment now but I will move it tomorrow evening.  I should like to express my appreciation to the Fine Gael Party for accepting the Labour Party amendment which essentially is an addendum to their motion.  We have sought in our amendment to strengthen <Col N="884" /> the Fine Gael motion by making it more specific in terms of the finances which are urgently required and conferring legal rights on people with a mental handicap. In addition, we have suggested that the time is right for the appointment by the Government of a Minister of State with responsibility for co-ordinating these services. We do this with the greatest respect to the Minister of State at the Department of Health.  Nevertheless we are anxious to ensure the co-ordination of services for the mentally handicapped. As the House will be aware there is a vacancy in the Government at Minister of State level.  I cannot think of a more valuable position than that of a Minister of State with a specific responsibility to pull together the many different and complex strands of policy in regard to people with a handicap or disability.</P>
      <P>Our amendment calls on the Government, in the context of the forthcoming Estimates and next year's budget, to begin immediately to provide the resources necessary to implement recommendations in &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo;, in particular to provide minimum capital and revenue resources to meet the needs identified in the report to which the Minister has just referred, together with additional resources to make up the shortfall in funding in the years 1990 and 1991 which we identified in previous debates in this House.  We are suggesting a capital budget of £4.9 million and a current budget of £6.15 million in 1992. In 1993 we suggest a capital budget of £4.9 million and a current budget of £6.15 million.  The needs in 1994 would then drop to £2.9 million for capital programmes and £2.9 million for current budgeting.  We also suggest the adoption of international laws on the rights of persons with a mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier Deputy Howlin moved the First Stage of the International Law (Rights of Persons with a Mental Handicap) Bill, 1991.  Perhaps the Government will accept as Government legislation this Bill which seeks to enshrine a range of fundamental rights for people with a mental handicap in Irish law as quickly as possible.  The Minister of State we <Col N="885" /> suggest should be appointed at the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach is very active in a number of areas and we hope he will turn his attention to the needs of the handicapped.  The appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for the services for the mentally handicapped would ensure the proper co-ordination of services for people with disabilities, the development of new services and the full right of equal citizenship for those with a disability. While this right is enshrined in our Constitution handicapped people have to rely on the voluntary agencies who provide such services.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention that one of the main agencies involved in the provision of services for people with a mental handicap have indicated to the Minister for Health that they are on the point of bankruptcy and have sought an urgent meeting with her.  Although I have been unable to confirm absoultely this rumour which came from a very reliable source frankly it does not surprise me. Every agency working in this field has suffered grievously from the cutbacks made over the past number of years. If what I have said is correct, I would welcome an assurance from the Minister before the conclusion of this debate that she will arrange to meet this agency as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The numerous agencies involved in the provision of services for people with physical or mental disabilities have been under bad management over the years.  I welcome the formal announcement by the Minister that agreement has been reached in regard to Cheeverstown.  We had been told for a number of months that this was the case but when we discussed the matter with those who care for people with a mental handicap we were assured that while progress was being made the problems still existed. We need to ensure that institutions like this are made available and not tied up by bureaucracy.  Many parents involved in agencies both voluntary and otherwise argue that many of the agencies with which they deal are almost too careful in terms of the husbandary of their scarce <Col N="886" /> resources.  If these agencies have to cope with acute financial difficulties there is only one reason for that, that the Government failed to make health a priority and failed to make the health and care of the handicapped a priority in the Health Estimate.</P>
    <P>I have seen reports from the Minister go directly to health boards asking them to ensure that the handicapped were not disadvantaged because of the cutbacks. Yet health boards sit down and debate and argue very restricted budgets and they are unable to keep handicap as the priority which the Minister wants.  I would be concerned that in the Eastern Health Board area, where there is a huge demand for facilities for the handicapped, in any rationalisation of the health services which would encompass all the hospitals, voluntary agencies and everybody else, the handicapped would have to fight within that group of people for what is a diminishing budget.  As a result, because they are not as strong in arguing their case, they could have a problem in ensuring that the minimum priority which they have with the Department at present will not diminish.  At present they can negotiate directly with the Department as regards the needs of the handicapped.  Like the Minister I compliment all the voluntary associations, the parents association for the mentally handicapped, the union of voluntary organisations for the handicapped and many other agencies throughout the various constituencies, who are on the streets begging for charity to ensure the availability of essential services for these people because the Government, in spite of what the Minister has said, have not come to grips with this problem.  The Minister has given an extra £2 million and an extra £1 million and money from from the national lottery but he talks about all that is given to the handicapped as if it was something special.  These are some of their rights.  Why should they not have the right to transport?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Other sections of the community require and receive these facilities. There are special needs for the handicapped which the Minister has not identified as a major priority of this Government.  Since 1987 all the Estimates have been subjected to more and more cutbacks to the point where most organisations can no longer manage on existing allocations to maintain their services let alone meet any possible increase in demands.  This is not the first time we have brought this matter to the attention of the Government.  I compliment the Fine Gael Party for bringing forward this motion.  During a debate on the Estimates on 9 July 1991, at column 1402 of the Official Report I said:</P>
      <P>The level of services provided for people with physical or mental handicap has deteriorated in recent years. We have debated this issue regularly in the House.  The Minister has put forward proposals, plans and figures which seem to indicate that everything is much better in this area but I intend to put on the record of the House some of the specifics in this area which show the way in which we have neglected the mentally handicapped.  The review group appointed by the Minister outline graphically in their report which was published last month the problems in this area.  They say that there has been a standstill in real budget terms while those with a disability or mental handicap and their families have grown older and their demands more pressing.  This is a terrible indictment of any Government in  regard to the provision of services for this very vulnerable group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crisis in this area covers many aspects, the most worrying of which is the lack of a multi-disciplinary, early intervention service for parents and children.  The absence of pre-school <Col N="888" /> services for children with delayed development has meant that parents have to cope alone and children are losing crucial opportunities which they may not be able to avail of again.  The Government need to respond to the crisis in the area of mental handicap. The hardship suffered by people who have mental and physical disability will increase unless approporiate plans are made but planning must take place in the knowledge that resources will eventually be made available.</P>
    <P>On the following day, 10 July 1991, I went on to quote specific needs and deficiencies in County Tipperary which has one of the most vibrant voluntary mentally handicapped associations in the country.  Without fear of contradiction their record stands as a credit to people committed in this area.  They said and I quote from column 1698 of the Official Report of 10 July 1991:</P>
    <P>In the absence of a multi-disciplinary, early intervention service as recommended in the Review Group report, parents of infants with delayed development in South Tipperary are left to fend almost entirely for themselves with the voluntary assistance of members of the Association and other helpers.</P>
    <P>In the absence of supported pre-school services for children with delayed development, parents are left to cope alone....</P>
    <P>The Tipperary Association wishes to draw the attention of the people of South Tipperary to the situation of two schools at Cashel which are providing for a large number of pupils with a multiplicity of other handicaps in addition of their mental handicap....</P>
    <P>There is almost a total absence of educational opportunity for children of school going age with a severe or profound degree of mental handicap and when they are accepted in schools or in the developmental centre no additional provision is made by statutory authorities to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> Those are the words of people involved in the provision of care for people with a handicap, people who work in a voluntary capacity, depending on charity, FÁS schemes, social employment schemes, teamwork schemes and occasional grants from the national lottery. As Deputy McCormack said this is an area that should not be dependent on lotteries or charities but rather is one in which the State has a major responsibility to respond positively by way of a provision in the budget for an adequate and specific allocation for the people about whom we are concerned in this motion and the amendment from the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The cutbacks in our health services have been well highlighted by us in this House.  It gives us no pleasure to do so but we have to keep reminding the Coalition Government of Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats members that there are areas, even in difficult budgetary situations, which must be prioritised.  The health area, and specifically the area of mental handicap, is a priority.  The position of families with a mentally handicapped person has deteriorated in recent years.  The Minister is aware of that because it was graphically demonstrated in the report published by his own review group earlier in the year.</P>
    <P>There is a standstill in real budget terms while those with a mental handicap and their families are still in need.  Parents of children with a disability have been forced to protest on the streets. I have seen them outside the gates of Leinster House, in O'Connell Street, in the rain protesting.  I have attended <i>ad hoc</i> committees with colleagues from all sides of this House to listen to people who are professionally engaged in trying to promote submissions to the Department of Health.  On a number of occasions my party leader, Deputy Dick Spring, and other representatives of my party have met people throughout the country.  We are all aware of the anger and the realisation that a lack of forward planning by this Government is central to their problem.  There are particular <Col N="890" /> groups of parents with profoundly hadicapped people in Cork and in other areas who are frustrated at the lack of response to their needs by the Government parties.</P>
    <P>The most critical problem facing people with a handicap and their families is the acute lack of residential places.  The Minister has indicated his achievements of the past year in improving the number of residential places.  Deputy Bruton has already indicated the total need.  There is a severe need for residential places throughout the country but particularly in Dublin where the central planning committee of the EHB have identified an urgent need for an extra 325 such places.</P>

      <P>This debate is very limited so I will not speak unduly long.  Before we adjourned I was dealing with the issue of the existing board of the B &amp; I.  Whatever may be perceived about hostile or non-hostile parties by the Minister, the fact is that the board appointees and the chairman were Government appointees, and it is not as if we had a change of Government in the last six months.  Will the Minister confirm that the board were seriously upset at the way in which the Minister treated them and that they placed before the Minister eight points outlining in detail their dissatisfaction with the way matters have been handled by the Minister and the Government? Will the Minister also confirm that today the board refused to finalise the deal without further considertion, despite a request by the Minister.  The Minister will have an opporutunity at the end of Second Stage to reply to these points.  I noted from the <i>Irish Times</i> of today's date that the board sent a letter to the staff of the B &amp; I line expressing serious reservations about the handling of the matter.  When the Minister's board are condemning the <Col N="891" /> Ministers we must the gravest doubts about this procedure.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, we will table amendments to seek that SI306 will be included as it is in section 6 of the Sugar Company Act so that there will be a transfer of undertakings for the staff involved.  We will also seek a condition that any ships would always have to sail under the Irish flag.  We will also seek to modify the right over the borrowings so that there will be some leverage clause for a certain period to enable the Government to ensure protection for the participents in the pension fund.  We also want the question of board representation to be looked at and in relation to indemnification, as outlined in section 4 by the Minister for Finance against companies liabilities, this would have to have the sanction of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael have no idelogical objection to part privatisation of the B &amp; I Line.  We do not have any particular objection to Irish Ferries as a suitable partner for the Government in such a merger but we are afraid that the price is too low, that it would only involve a parial sale and that to sell 100 per cent of the shares at this time is unsatisfactory. We also feel that the tender process and the circumstances of &ldquo;behind closed doors&rdquo; dealings was unsatisfactory and that the way that event were handled in the latter days of the deal in relation to the management staff buy-out will lead to industrial relations difficulties.  We feel also that the Government have not made a serious attempt either directly or under the auspieces of the Labour Relations Commision or the Labour Court to try to reach consensus in relation to rationalisation or to set up a reasonable platform on which consensus could be reached on industrial relations issues.  We are not satisfied that disposal will bring about the best future shipping strategy for this country.  There are many loose ends in relation to the small print, in relation to warrenties and liabilities, in relation to discounts and in relation to other aspects of the deal which need to be cleared up.  We do not wish the resources <Col N="892" /> available under the pension fund surplus to be a windfall gain for Irish Ferries and we want the staff to be protected.  For all of those reasons we are obliged to oppose this Bill on Second Stage.  Given that the Government have a majority, we will be seeking to substantially amend the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party are strongly opposed to the hastily arranged sale of the B &amp; I Line for a giveaway price.  Apart from opposing this Billwe will express our opposition to the principal of privatisation of B &amp; I as the appropriage policy in the case of this company.  The indecent, almost obscene, haste with which the Government are pushing this Bill thorough the House is an insult not only to the Members of the House but to the management and workers who have tried to assemble a package which would benefit this country and would save the maximum number of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first concern relates to the acquisition by the Irish Continental Group of the former Irish Shipping subsidiary, ICL.  There was every reason from the national viewpoint to have ICL incorporated into the B &amp; I company.  The Irish Continental Group have on their board two directors of NCB and NCB played a major role in the formation of that group.  Last March a memorandum of agreement for the sale of the B &amp; I Line was agreed between the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and ICG.  Will the Minister say what role, if any, NCB have played in either acting for ICG in the formulation of their bid, or for the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications? Just as ICL was conveniently parachuted into the Irish Continental Group, we have the same game, set and match approach of the B &amp; I company, a company which, within a couple of years, will increase in value by a multiple of two to five times the price the Minister has accepted.  If we took the proposed sale of the B &amp; I Line on the narrow ground of maximising the benefit to the Exchequer, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and <Col N="893" /> Communcations would not now recommend the sale in so precipitous a manner. The B &amp; I Line are currently earning profits of just over £2 million per annum, a turnaround from the major losses experienced from 1981 to 1987.  The workers have contributed considerably to this turnaround by accepting pay freezes, and by the major increase in productivity over the past two years.  The projected profit for 1992, of which the minister is aware, is £4 million.  How can the Minister justify selling this company for a mere £8 million plus debt write-offs of £36 million?  The Minister has responded to questions on proposals to privatise State bodies under his control with bland statements that discussions have taken place and that there are no plans to privatise any of the State companies. In the case of B &amp; I the Minister cannot be accused of planning, for what we are talking about here is the equivalent of a liquidation sale with State owned assests being offered at knock down prices.</P>
    <P>Another major flaw in the proposal to dispose of the company for £8 million is that this valuation ignores the £14 million surplus in the pension fund of which the Minister is making a gift to ICG who can utilise if for investment purposes or pocket it following the break up of the B &amp; I routes.</P>
    <P>I have further question on assurances and grantees or promises included in the terms of sale in relation to a probable claim against the B &amp; I company arising out of its use of facilities at Pembroke. My understanding is that a compenstion claim will be sucessful against the B &amp; I and I would like to know who will pick up the tab.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the manner in which the management and staff buy-out proposal was treated by the Minister who is part of a Government who claim to be in social partnership with the ICTU.  My understanding is that, because of the Minister's deadline, one of the Danish companies who were part of the original proposal, were forced to withdraw as they simply did not have enough time to consider the structure of the equity and <Col N="894" /> loan finance of the proposed new company with the management staff.  Nevertheless. Allied Irish Bank Corporate Finance were sufficiently confident of the viability of the proposals that they were prepared to back this bid without the involvement of the Danish interest.  That poses a question.  If a company like Allied Irish Bank would come up front with this type of money, what was that bid all about?</P>
    <P>The Government are supposedly in the business of job creation.  In this context alone, how can they justify backing the ICG bid which proposes to lay off 100 more staff than the staff management buy-out proposal?  It should be remembered that it was the Minister who initiated the management/staff buy-out proposal.  It would appear now that he has turned his back on this proposal.</P>
    <P>The tremendous effort that has gone into the revamping of the B &amp; I company by the employes over the past number of years must be noted and remarked upon.  The turnaround from an operating loss of £3.5 million in 1987 to a profit of £2.5 million this year must prove to any fair minded commentator the calibre and the determination of the workforce at B &amp; I to save that company.  This workforce have proved their ability, despite the difficulties that surround shipping today. Many of these employees have given long years of service to the company and it is only fair that they now be given a proper hearing which would take into consideration the full facts surrounding their case.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reaction to question in the Dáil last week was indicative of the Government's attitude to the plight of the unemployed when, in a rather cavalier manner, he dismissed the 100 job diference between both offers.  I would like to remind him that any job loss and any job created or saved is vital in the present economic climate and to shrug off the difference is something that must be deplored.</P>
    <P>Did the analysis of the ICG bid carried out by the Minister or the Department of Finance include the additional Exchequer cost of 100 more people <Col N="895" /> claiming social welfare and no longer paying tax?  My estimate is that we are talking of an Exchequer loss of approximately £0.5 million per annum.  That should have been deducted from the price paid by ICG in assessing the merits of their bid over the managment employee buy-out.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister is a supporter of free competition.  What is to prevent Irish car ferries developing a private monopoly on the sea routes between Ireland and the UK, and even between the continent and this country?  We are now totally reliant on private transport carriers to meet the requirements of our suppliers and individuals in terms of sea transport.  Fianna Fáil must have a very short memory if they do not remember that the acquisition of B &amp; I in the sixties from the private sector was due to their failure as a private entity to meet the requirements of this country.  What assurances are there that B &amp; I, which operate a number of strategic routes which are crucial to both trade and tourism, will not ultimately end up in foreign ownership? What assurances or guarntees are there that the necessary investment will be available for fleet replacement and modernisation? What assurances are there that safety will not become a secondary consideration in an under-capitalised private commercial operation?</P>
    <P>When we consider that our Taoiseach is quite properly stressing the need for new policies to address peripherality in the context of economic and social cohesion at Maastricht, what policy is guiding the Minister for Tourism, Tarnsport and Communications to ensure this country is fully serviced in terms of access to transport by sea?  Within the context of a European Community we are the only island nation without a direct link to mainland Europe and the decision to sell B &amp; I to a commercial enterprise leaves us in the vulnerable position of not having any State controlled sea transport between Ireland and Europe.</P>
    <P>There is a further aspect of the extreme haste with which this deal is being pushed through which must be considered.  The <Col N="896" /> Government and the Confederation of Irish Industry have made a strong case that access to transport should qualify for Structural Funds assistance.  I have no doubt that this case will be met after Maastricht, but who will benefit most?  It will not be the Irish travelling public, the workers or B &amp; I but the sharegholders in ICG who will receive European funds and will enjoy the capital growth which the new assets will generate.</P>
    <P>This morning's news of the Dutch proposals put forward in Maastricht for funds to be made available to countries like Ireland for transportation is an indication that that is the method that will be used in the future.  Money will be coming from the Structural Funds and ICG will benefit enormously.  Maybe that is one of the reasons there is such haste to get this Bill through the House.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately and quite consciously dealt with the sale of the B &amp; I company from the very narrow perspective of value for money to the Exchequer.  I have no doubt but that in two to three years time the verdict will be that the Minister preseded over a somewhat murky deal, admittedly with the backing of legislation in this instance. Nevertheless, questions will be asked in two to three years time why this happened.</P>
    <P>I would like now to deal with the interests of all the workers, managers and staff.  The workers in the B &amp; I company have been conned, trussed up and sold off like pieces of furniture at bargain prices in a Christmas sale.  Facts is often stranger than fiction.  I am sure any of the B &amp; I employees who was watching the film &ldquo;Wall Street&rdquo; on RTE Network 2 will identify with the workers who saw financial vultures attempting to raid their pension fund after promising them job security and a share of the profits in return for wage sacrifices.  That film was fiction but tonight's Bill before the Dáil and the deal for the B &amp; I is not fiction, it is fact.  I am sure the B &amp; I workers will be forgiven if they identify the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Brennan, as the villain of the piece, as Gordon Gekko, the guy <Col N="897" /> who did all the wheeling and dealing.  The Minister is the fall guy for the Government. What he is proposing in the Bill is that we legitimatise private greed and its triumph over the interests of the public, the taxpayer and the worker.</P>
    <P>The Minister's concern for the workers' interests was exemplified by the fact that the worker directors in the B &amp; I company read in the newspapers about his decision to hand over the company to ICG.  The trade union representatives who had worked night and day to bring forward the staff-management buy-out proposal were equally shafted.  At the stroke of a pen their conditions of employment, which have already been worsened, will now be cancelled with no guarantees for the future in relation to jobs, pay and conditions.</P>
    <P>Redundancy seems to be the Government's main growth industry.  At every opportunity the State companies were cajoled, treatened and, finally, forced, as in the case of RTE, into laying off workers.  The same kind of sleveen apporach has been adopted in the case of An Post.  This House is sick and tired of the Tadhg-an-dá-thaobh apporach of the Minister on privatisation.  The Labour Party know that he is the operational manager of the Government's privatisation programme.  Perhaps he is just doing a job &mdash; it is not one I would like myself &mdash; but he never misses an opportunity to reassure the business community that privatisation is being considered.</P>
    <P>This hidden agenda to hand over the company to the Minister Deputy Brennan's friends in ICG was the only agenda from the start.  Furthermore, there was a nice piece of insider trading in that the Government were privy to the private discussions on possible EC Structural Funds investment in sea transport.  I predict that tomorrow night, after the Bill has been given a Second Reading, the Taoiseach will be announcing a victory, the establishment of a separate cohesion fund, and I have little doubt that the directors and shareholders of ICG will be euphoric in the knowledge that further investment by them will be bankrolled <Col N="898" /> from this fund.  I also have little doubt that the Taoiseach and his Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications will make a strong case in the years ahead that any matching requirement by ICG be weakened if not removed.</P>
    <P>In the words of the Taoiseach, the Government are considering privatising every company in the State sector.  The people are entitle to ask and deserve a reply to the question, in whose interests is this disgraceful policy being pursued. I say that it is in the interests of the stockbrokers, the bankers, the financial advisers and probably those who attend Cairde Fáil dinners.  It is not being pursued in the interests of the publc, the economy or the workers.  They may have got rid of Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom but no doubt she will be consoled by the fact that her policies are alive and kicking and being pursued by this Coalition Government of Fiann Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that tomorrow and in the coming days the workers who have genuine fears in regard to their future will reach flashpoint because there are glaring gaps in the deal. The workers and management have very forcibly expressed their genuine fears to Members on all sides of the House, both Government and Opposition Deputies.  I have spoken to members of all the trade unions involved and they have expressed their anger that the Bill is being hastily pushed through the House.  Many people are cynical about politicians today.  The last thing we need is a guillotine.  No damage would be done if we were allowed to tease this legislation out, with full consultation, to ensure that the question marks hanging over the legislation are removed.  I ask the Minister at this late stage not to restrict the debate on this very important legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken to some people who <Col N="899" /> have given long service to B &amp; I and they have indicated to me that they would refer to opt out rather than be involved in a deal with ICG.  Given the magnificent achievement of the workforce in turning the company around, it it not too much to ask that their case be givena fair hearing.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that ICG had indicated to him that their plans for B &amp; I over the next five years included the retention of all existing B &amp; I shipping routes; the provision of extra capactiy on the <i>m.v. Leinster;</i> the sourcing of an improved vessel to replace the <i>m.v. Munster</i> on the Rosslare-Pembroke route; and upgrade of facilities throughout B &amp; I; the replcement of B &amp; I's container ships; the provision of long term sustainable employment in B &amp; I and share ownership for B &amp; I employees. We all have our aspirations and want the best for everyone but I am afraid that this is not good enough at this stage.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to go through the Bill line by line and if amendments are needed they will be forthcoming.  While we may not have the numbers to vote the Bill down on Second Stage we will make our views clearly known in the House and to the public.  Rushed legislation is bad legislation.  A good example is the legislation relating to the rod licence. Four years on we have still not resolved that problem.  At this stage we should look very carefully at what we are doing, given that employees of the company have shown goodwill.  Their good work could not be set at nought.  Indeed we could end up with industrial relations problems which would have serious repercussions for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Finally, if labour relations explode &mdash; as I said, workers are reaching flashpoint &mdash; the blame will lie with the Government and the Minister who will have to accet responsibility.  If one tries to railroad legislation through the House and push workers to the ultimate they will <Col N="900" /> react.  I fear for the future of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I require your assistance, a Cheann Comhairle, to keep the so-called official Opposition quite.  We are dealing essentially with retrospective legislation.  The company was sold <Col N="901" /> before this debate commenced.  The outrageous fact is that a sweetheart deal has been done, signed, sealed and con-summated. The Minister is pushing the Bill through over the Christmas period with a declared and stated intention to hand the B &amp; I over to the Irish Continental Group without seriously considering the unique staff-management buy-out proposals.  It is, to say the least, ignorant, arrogant and devoid of any sense of recognition of the incredible efforts and sacrifices made by the B &amp; I workforce, particularly in the years of the company's most difficult times.  The Minister has as much sympathy and respect for the B &amp; I workforce &mdash; many of whom will remember him when they are drawing the dole &mdash; as the butchers have for the turkeys they are slaughtering this Christmas.</P>
      <P>I will explain to the Minister why the management and staff of the B &amp; I are angry with him. They rose to the challenges with which the company were faced down through the years; they agreed to staff numbers being reduced and surrendered pay rises to which they were entitled as their contribution to the survival of the line.  Very few workers anywhere have made as many sacrifices as the B &amp; I workers so that the company would survive.  They were happy they managed to turn the company's financial position around and they were proud that, through their efforts, the shipping line made on operational profit of £2.5 million last year. When the workers rose enthusiastically to the final challenge as a united workforce with full union backing the Minister rejected them in a cold  and brutal manner.  That is why the management and staff of the B &amp; I are so angry; the Minister betrayed them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is the Minister's obituary of B &amp; I.  Like the eerie sight of the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i> lying mournfully on its side with all its human tragedy, it did not have to happen.  Both tragedies could have been avoided.  I ask the  Minister to think again and to turn back from the course he is taking of privatising B &amp; I.  By reopening negotiations with B &amp; I workforce he should reconsider their <Col N="902" /> management-staff buy-out offer and allow them more time to prove to him the benefits and adgantages their plan has to offer.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister so determined to privatise B &amp; I/  Let us look at the remarkable turnaround in the fortunes of the line since 1988 which was possible only because of the incredible efforts and sacrifices of the staff and management of B &amp; I at the time.  Up to 1988 the company were going through a very difficult period; they were faced with mounting financial losses which required the implementation of a plan of action involving major restructuring which had across-the board support from the company's workforce which included a reduction in staff numbers  from 1,464 to 899.  They agreed a pay cut of 5 per cent and a pay freeze until July 1989.  These were voluntary, unique sacrifices.  Even by today's standards in industrial relations, they are still unique and are recorded in Irish labour history.  As a result of these actions and other measures, the compnay's performance improved substantially during 1988 and this favourable trend continued during 1989.  The performance of B &amp; I during 1989 included an upturn in freight and passenger traffic and improved financial outturn.  They also had a good industrial relations record.</P>
    <P>The plan of action, as structured and implemented in 1988, covered five year period.  As we come towards the end of that period everybody, including the Minister, must agree that the turnaround in the company's fortunes has been remarkable.  My party coleagjue, Deputy Rabbitte, in his cpacity at the time as a trade union negotiator, was prominently associated with the negotiations which brought about the plan.  As he will verify, the plan was exceptionally painful for everybody concerned.  It was a unique trial relations; not only did it involve the loss of approximately 600 jobs, it guaranteed industrial peace in the company for the duration of the plan and, <Col N="903" /> most importantly, there was a pay standstill for a period of three years for July 1986.</P>
    <P>Unprecedentedly, the redmaining employees accepted a 5 per cent reduction in their wages.  It goes without saying that this period represented a painful experience for the workforce. They made these sacrifices. not to facili tate the Minister or the Government to make a decision to privatise their company, but as part of a total commitment to the survival of the B &amp; L line.  This participation and the agreements of the B &amp; I workforce enabled the company toi return operating profits of £1.8 million and £2.8 million in 1988 and 1989 respecttively.</P>
    <P>However, the company were crucified by the equity ratio and the extraordinary burden of debt on interest payments.  It is interesting to noe that on 14 March 1990, during the Second Stage debate on the Bill, the Minister said;</P>
    <P>I would emphasise in the regard that were it not for the burden of interest charges on historic debt arising form losses accumulated by the B &amp; I prior to 1998 the company would, at this stage, be recording net profits ... I also think it important at this point to record that the financial results of the B &amp; I have been better than those envisaged in 1988 when the affairs of the B &amp; I were last debated comprehensively in this House.</P>
    <P>It was envisaged at the time that the company would require £17 million in equity in 1998 and 1989.  In fact, the Exchequer was called on to invest only £1 million in the B &amp; I over that period, £6 million less than orginally envisaged. This outcome is due in no small measure to the joint efforts of management and staf in turning the company around.  Not only have the company turned around financially but they have also gained increased busuness in the ro-ro and lo-lo activities.  In each case B &amp; I business grew significantly and even at present further increses are envisaged.  For <Col N="904" /> example, B &amp; I made a significant contributiion to the Irish tourism industry by carrying into Ireland in the region of 320,000 visitors, with 70,000 foreign cars. There are important strategic and economic reasons for retaining B &amp; I in the public sector for the foreseeable future I ask the Minister to be this mind: I will address these issues at a later stage.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I carry 43 per cent of all Irish exports.  With the opening of the Channel Tunnel car traffic from the Continent to Great Britain will increase and Ireland will act as a natural magnet for these tourists.  I have no doubt that many of those people will be an anxious to travel to Ireland.  It is, therefore, likely that there will be an increased demand for shipping services between Britian and Ireland, and B &amp; I would be capable of taking up this projected demand.</P>
    <P>Was the fatal dye cast for privatisation by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition at Cabinet meetings prior to March 1990?  Clearly it was and the record will show, even at that time, who the Government intended should acquire B &amp; I.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, in <i>The Irish Times</i> 13 March 1990 in reference to the B &amp; I Bill, which provided for a £6 million cash investment in B &amp; I, was quoted as follows: &ldquo;The Minister also expressed his disappointment about the need for the Government to make provision to inject a further £6 million into the B &amp; I Group&rdquo;.  He said it was very unsatisfactory and was matter that he has great misgivings about.  He added that the &ldquo;would love to see the end of it as a problem&rdquo;, with the ideal being that the Irish Continental Group take over the company.</P>
    <P>The Minister may remember reading headlines at the time in <i>The Irish Times</i> such as &ldquo;Secret Shipping Merger Plan Shelved&rdquo;.  <i>The Irish Times</i> stated that the £6 million injection was in preparation of the company for privatisation.  According to that paper, discussions had been under way secretly.  It stated: &ldquo;Secret meger proposals between the State owned B &amp; I line and the privately owned Irish Continental Group have set aside <Col N="905" /> while the latter seek clarification from the Government of its plan to inject a further £6 million into the loss making B &amp; I&rdquo;.  It is interesting that Deputy O'Malley openly voiced his support for the purchase of B &amp; I by the Irish Continental Group and that the Irish Continental Group stood back in the sure knowledge, given the known political commitment for privatisation by both Deputy O'Malley and Deputy S. Brennan, that another £6 million sweetener would be provided.  That day has now arrived.</P>
    <P>There are key strategic issues at stake in what is proposed in the Bill.  There is every reason, given Ireland's peripherality and with the ever increasing need in the future for a reliable outlet to Europe and Great Britain for the movement of people and freight, that the Government should have a financial stake, in order to make an input at board level, in what amounts to our nation's jugular vein, our shipping links.  In 1965 the Government clearly considered this to be of significant importance and they took steps to acquire what has now become the B &amp; I Line.  There is now an even stronger case to be made for a controlling interest by the Irish authorities in the question of who runs our shipping lines to Great Britain and Europe.  This controlling interest could be by way of a golden share by way of the company entering into a bond with the State which would guarantee continuity of service, by written agreements or legislative proposals.  The Bill makes no provision for any stake by the Irish State which would be required to ensure that strategic shipping services and routes are kept in Irish hands or, indeed, that they be retained.</P>
    <P>The economic lifeline afforded to Ireland as a trading and tourism nation is dependent on shipping.  The southern corridor is a crucially important link for tourism and trade.  Those who live in the capital city are more than conscious of its importance to industrial infrastructure in the city and of the role the B &amp; I play in sustaining a viable, healthy, commercial and industrial life in the capital.  The <Col N="906" /> B &amp; I would give a guarantee of continuity of service in the central corridor that cannot be given by a privately owned and controlled company whose business it is to make a profit for their shareholders and, if they so wish, sell to shareholders outside the country, thereby weakening further any controls the national Government may wish to apply.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I, contrary to some opinions, are not a lame duck company.  They are a profitable company and have been so since 1988.  Next year's trading profits are expected to be £4 million and, as I said, last year they made a trading profit of £2.5 million.  Of course, debt crucified the company down the years.  The Government are prepared to scrub a debt of £35 million and sell the company for between £5 million and £8 million, having invested £106 million of taxpayers' money in it.  To do that while not retaining a golden share or a controlling interest would be a national scandal, particularly because once B &amp; I's debt burden is removed and rationalisation savings are made in the company as proposed by the ICG and the MSBO, B &amp; I would be an extremely profitable shipping group.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the increased tourist traffic that will be generated with the opening of the Channel Tunnel.  The attractions of Ireland as a holiday destination for mainland Europeans driving through the tunnel to England will make this island a more enticing location for these tourists.  Therefore, it is conceivable that demand in the future for increased capacity on drive-on drive-off ferries will be the order of the day, and B &amp; I would be the natural benefactor.</P>
    <P>Let us consider B &amp; I's competitor, Sealink.  It is interesting that the Minister should refer to Sealink in his contribution. He said&mdash;he used this as an example as to why we should not be concerned about privatisation&mdash;it was noteworthy that B &amp; I's main competitor, Sealink, were sold some years ago by British Rail and have more recently been acquired by the Swedish based Stena Group.  I do not know what point the Minister was trying to prove.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> He clearly had not read yesterday's <i>Financial Times</i> which looked more closely at Sealink.  Sealink are owned by a Swedish company who are threatening to close them down.  They operate in competition with B &amp; I on the Rosslare-Fishguard and Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead routes while B &amp; I operate the Dublin-Holy-head and the Rosslare-Pembroke routes. Will the Minister agree it would be madness for the Government to abandon their role in the company now, particularly with the international developments taking place in Sealink?  The Government should recognise and grasp the wonderful commercial openings being created for B &amp; I at this point in their history.</P>
    <P>We must reflect again on the timescale set by the Minister.  The ICG have been in discussion with the Minister since the summer of 1989.  The memorandum of agreement was signed on behalf of the Minister for Finance and ICG on 28 February 1991 and the sale to ICG was to be completed by 16 August 1991.  Only in mid-August 1991 did the chairman of B &amp; I, acting on behalf of independent board members, express the view that the sale of the company to ICG did not represent good value.  Although ICG had the opportunity since July 1989 to buy out the B &amp; I Line, they were reinvited by the Minister to submit an offer on 25 October, within two weeks of the deadline of 8 November 1991.  The B &amp; I management-staff consortium were also invited to compete for the first time.  If one considers the time factor alone, ICG had a disproportionate time advantage over the MSBO in which to prepare their offer.  The management-staff consortium submitted an amended offer at 4.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 4 December, but the Minister, after cursory consideration, rejected it.  It is as clear as day follows night why the B &amp; I workforce are angry: the unions, staff, and management were not given enough time to prepare their submission.  Why did the Minister wish to rush through the deal?  Why is he forcing the issue at this time?  Why did he sign the share purchase agreement today <Col N="908" /> before this Bill was debated in this House?  Why was he today trying to intimidate the B &amp; I board members to sign the share purchase agreement before the Bill even became law?  We are seeking a great many answers in this debate.</P>
    <P>The noble efforts of workers and management to put together a deal in a short time span resulted in Cabinet members clapping the lads on the back for the good job well done and telling them they were making history, yet at the same time also saying that their bid was not being accepted in spite of all the contributions made by staff in building up the company to what it is today.  Their anger is quite rightly being directed at the Minister. The B &amp; I corporate financial advisers are reported in the newspapers as saying that the two Danish companies backing the MBSO deal did not pull out, as reported, but were keen to increase their involvement.  AIB Corporate Finance, which prepared the B &amp; I SMBO's proposals are reported as saying:</P>
    <P>At the last moment B &amp; I changed its bid from a joint venture with the Danes to a 100 per cent staff and management bid because of a delay in completing a formal shareholders agreement with the Danish companies.</P>
    <P>And that:</P>
    <P>Given time a bid with improved Danish backing would have been presented.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy give the reference for that quotation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was <i>The Sunday Business Post.</i>  They said:</P>
      <P>ICG have succeeded in clinching what is regarded as one of the softest takeover deals in recent times.</P>
      <P>Let us remember that this is the businessman's paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This deal is yet another classic example of a &ldquo;sweetheart deal&rdquo;, which I find most reprehensible.  My concern is shared by <Col N="909" /> the B &amp; I board and staff who quite legitimately are asking the Minister to explain why he did not consider options other than immediate sale which would give a better return to the Exchequer and there was not an effective process of competitive bids.  They also wish to convey to the Minister their disappointment that he did not provide a forum in which the board, through the independent committee, could contribute to the process leading to decisions.  They are also angry and dismayed and there is a widespread sense of disappointment at every level, from staff to management, at the manner in which the decision was made and announced.</P>
    <P>We are now heading into what is usually a happy time for families &mdash; the Christmas season of goodwill.  I will examine the implications of this deal for the B &amp; I workforce.  Did the Minister not consider the merit of the MSBO's proposals for jobs?  Can he dismiss as unimportant the loss of 250 jobs, or can his mirror image, the Minister for &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo;&mdash; the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley &mdash; whose Ministery is usually associated with job creation, going out into the market place and generating jobs, and opportunities attracting foreign companies getting men off the dole, and getting the country moving?  I am afraid the Minister has been a total failure in this regard; the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, has shown great enthusiasm for privatisation coupled with job losses and the history of privatisation in Ireland is invariably linked to job losses.  Does either Minister consider that saving 100 extra jobs means that MSBO's proposals have merit.  Many B &amp; I workers must be asking themselves if all their sacrifices were in vain.  They had not only agreed to shed 600 jobs for the company to survive but by their very survival, 250 more men and women are now destined to join the dole queues.</P>
    <P>What will become of the £17 million surplus in the three pension funds?  Will it also be handed over to ICG?  Do B &amp; I members not have the right to vote on what will happen to their pension <Col N="910" /> money?  What guarantees can the Minister give the workforce that practices in B &amp; I under ICG will not revert to the pre-1987 position?  Will he also give assurances in this House that the protection of the rights of individual staff members and the opportunities for staff participation will be guaranteed?  When will we know the terms and the timing of the proposed completion of the sale to ICG?</P>
    <P>Are there any proposals for industrial democracy?  Will the new company be compelled to comply with modern industrial relations practices and allow trade union worker representation on the board of the company, as already exists in B &amp; I?  What promises are there to the workforce who, in the past, gave up pay increases and took reductions in wages, that their existing pay and conditions will not be adversely affected?</P>
    <P>There are a large number of questions to be asked of the Minister if he is to mindlessly pursue this privatisation proposal. For example, what are the investment plans he has agreed with ICG? What are the details of the proposals? Would he inform the House what, if any, voluntary redundancy packages the workforce will be offered, with, sadly, 250 men and women facing the dole queues?</P>
    <P>I see Deputy Stafford, who represents an inner city constituency and who is conscious of the role of the port and of B &amp; I.  I point to Fianna Fáil backbenchers, backbenchers who rely on working class support in Cork and in Dublin, and ask how any of them could support the Bill without the full knowledge of and a debate on the issues involved?  For example, we should have clarified what was meant in the report featured in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> of 8 December about the B &amp; I buyers gaining by tax relief.  What did that report mean when it stated that the Irish Continental Group would not have to pay corporation tax for two years following the purchase of the B &amp; I Line because about £100 million in tax losses would be transferred as part of the deal?  What did that same report mean when it stated that <Col N="911" /> the ICG deal carried with it warranties and indemnities that could have a further cash exposure for the State at a later stage?</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to know an awful lot about economics, but it does strike me that the Minister needs to explain more openly and in great detail not only to his own backbenchers but also to everyone in the House, just what kind of deal he has struck with ICG.  I ask the Minister particularly to answer the question posed in the newspaper report about warranties and indemnities that could have further cash exposure for the State in the future. A simple reading of that statement to me implies that there is a likelihood that the State will not in fact receive the £8.5 million but will somehow end up being caught out &mdash; in the full knowledge of the Minister &mdash; with other liabilities further down the road.  That question must be answered.</P>
    <P>Again I look to the Fianna Fáil backbenchers who, as I said, relied so heavily on working class support and votes to get into the chamber in the first place, and ask them how they could support the Bill without knowing of, or having explained, a clearly defined investment programme? Such a programme should be spelt out in advance by any new partner or owner. There is also the question of security of tenure for those employees who elect to remain within the company.  It will be important to know whether there is a guarantee to maintain the terms and conditions and company union agreements of B &amp; I employees.  More should be known about whether the Government at this stage intend to maintain a golden share in the new scenario and whether the industrial democracy that exists at present will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to the Minister's speech and in particular to the final sentence in his final paragraph:</P>
    <P>I would also like to thank the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, with whom I share the same vision and goal for the development of a sound shipping <Col N="912" /> industry which will sustain and expand employment for Irish mariners.</P>
    <P>That the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Minister might see eye to eye will be a cause of some concern to workers &mdash; not only to workers in the B &amp; I but also to workers in CIE for whom the Minister promises in the new year the fate now being handed out to B &amp; I workers.  So much for the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commitment to job creation.  So much for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' defence of the public sector.  With such a trade union congress, who can find themselves comfortably on the same wavelength as any Minister in the present Coalition Government, the sad feelings of disillusionment experienced by so many ordinary union members are perfectly understandable.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to reject the claim made by the Minister that they share with him the same vision and goals.  I challenge the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to reassure the workers in B &amp; I that they do not support the Minister's proposals for them.  I challenge the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to come out now in support of the workers in CIE who are facing privatisation as promised by the Minister in his Bus Competition Bill due in the new year and what we sadly see in the Minister's Christmas box to B &amp; I. The CIE group of unions are, in the Minister's words, facing a bleak future, with the Minister's determination to privatise anything in which the State has a role.</P>
    <P>The Minister has to be condemned for his attempt to excuse his role in using the management staff buy-out offer in some way or another to extract from ICG a better financial contribution.  I place on record my belief that the Minister used the MSBO to get ICG to increase their bid.  Without the MSBO, ICG would not have upped their offer of £6.5 million. The Minister used the MSBO as his stalking horse to edge on ICG to up their offer.  He had already made a sweetheart <Col N="913" /> deal with ICG.  ICG knew that, the Minister knew it and ICG played the Minister along right up to the very end, right up to the expiry date of the memorandum of agreement, because they knew that they and they alone would be the only winners in the buy-out proposals.  The Minister twisted their arm just a bit by viciously manipulating the scenario and involving the management staff buy-out offer at the eleventh hour, and he squeezed another £2 million out of ICG.</P>
    <P>The record speaks for itself.  It goes back two years, when the Minister's love relationship with the proposal to sell out the workers in B &amp; I started.</P>
    <P>The Government decision to sell the B &amp; I Line to the Irish Continental Group is one of the worst this Administration have taken.  Already it has been the subject of widespread criticism on the part of a variety of interests.  I predict it will provoke even greater anger when the public begin to appreciate the size of the Christmas gift the Minister has given Irish Continental Lines.  The manner in which the Minister took the decision and the contemptuous manner in which he dealt with worker/management buy-out has angered and alienated the workforce.</P>
    <P>If the takeover goes ahead the new owners are likely to face a hostile management and workforce which is not what is needed if the company is to survive and prosper.  The tragedy is that, through his obsessive ideological commitment to privatisation and his apparent refusal to accept that the workers and management could run their company successfully, the Minister may well turn out to be the person who will have finally torpedoed the B &amp; I Line.  What is happening in the case of the B &amp; I Line is not even a normal type privatisation.  Usually what happens in the case of privatisation is that a company's shares are floated and available for sale on the Stock Exchange so that those who have the money can buy them.  That is what happened in the case of both the Irish Sugar Company and Irish Life.  What is happening in the case of the B &amp; I is a unique form of selective, privileged privatisation in which a State-owned company is to be <Col N="914" /> sold lock, stock and barrel to a private company.</P>
    <P>Nobody would claim that the B &amp; I company was a shining example of a successful semi-State company.  To put it mildly, the company have had a chequered career, some of their problems having been self-inflicted while others resulted from factors beyond the company's control.  Some of those problems were set out in the report on the company produced by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial Semi-State Bodies.  Among other problematic factors identified by that committee was over-expansion in the late seventies, adding enormously to their financial burden, major increases in fuel prices, general depression, intense competition, disruption of services caused by industrial disputes &mdash; by the way, mainly in the United Kingdom &mdash; and the reduction in air fares making sea travel a less attractive proposition for any passengers.</P>
    <P>As the Minister always likes to remind the House, the company has cost the taxpayer a lot of money over the years. The total State involvement since it was bought by the State amounts to approximately £106 million, a lot of money by any standard.  By the mid-eighties, resulting from these problems, the company was in a state of crisis.  A rescue plan was drawn up calling for and receiving an exceptional level of commitment and sacrifice on the part of the workforce.  Six hundred workers were made redundant, reducing the workforce from almost 1,500 to below 900.  There was a three year pay freeze.  In an unprecedented gesture the remaining workforce accepted a pay cut of 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The five year rescue plan has been exceptionally successful largely as a result of sacrifices on the part of the workforce and their enormous efforts.  Since the rescue plan was adopted, the B &amp; I have reported trading profits each year and would be in a healthy financial position now were it not for the high level of debt hanging over the company from previous years.  From trading losses of £3.6 million in 1987, they returned trading profits of £1.76 million in 1988, £1.95 million in <Col N="915" /> 1989, £1.59 million in 1990 and are expected to return profits of £2.5 million in the current year.  The reward for their efforts in saving the company is that it is now to be primed for privatisation.  Not alone that, but their proposed management/worker buy-out proposal has been rejected.  They are to be handed over to a company whose only objective is the pursuit of profit, which has made it clear that there will be 250 compulsory redundancies, that there will be no room for any element of industrial democracy in the company and no guarantee given about the continuation of any routes.</P>
    <P>In many respects the experience of the B &amp; I workers is similar to that of the employees of the Irish Sugar Company. They, too, made tremendous sacrifices, accepted a huge level of redundancies and put great effort into restoring the company to profitability.  They, too, were sacrificed to privatisation in a move that had nothing to do with meeting the needs of the workers or the public but rather was all about satisfying the avaricious demands of a group of senior executives and board members to accumulate even greater wealth.  Given the experience of the workers in the B &amp; I and the Irish Sugar Company, would it be surprising if public sector workers came to the conclusion that if one wants to avoid privatisation the last thing one should do is make any effort to make one's company successful.</P>
    <P>Those who assume that privatisation is an automatic guarantee of success should look to the experience of Sealink in the United Kingdom.  They operated as a successful, profitable company while owned by the British state.  However, Thatcherite economic policy determined that it was offensive to have a state company which made profits and it was privatised. Initially it was sold to a Bermuda-based company, Sea Containers, and subsequently sold to the Swedish private firm, Stena.  According to yesterday's <i>Financial Times</i> Sealink are now heading for losses of some £30 million in the current year and the company will be closed by the end of the <Col N="916" /> month unless their workforce accept a drastic cost-cutting exercise.</P>
    <P>The possibility of the closure of Sealink makes the prospect of the sale of B &amp; I more serious still.  With the completion of the channel tunnel in 1994, Ireland will be the only totally off-shore member of the EC, the only country totally dependent on sea and air links with other member states.  The reliability of ferry and cargo services is absolutely crucial to our tourist industry and our position as a trading nation.  Each year B &amp; I carry approximately 300,000 passengers, the majority being tourists, and some 70,000 cars.  They provide crucial cargo services to the Continent.  If the company is handed over to Irish Continental Lines there is nothing the Government will be able to do to ensure the continuation of these services for example, if the new owners decide that certain routes are no longer profitable or that they can make greater profits by investing their money elsewhere, there will be nothing the Government or anybody else will be able to do to prevent them from so doing. For instance, if the company decide six months hence to sell the B &amp; I to some other foreign company there will be nothing anybody can do to prevent it.</P>
    <P>Even if one accepts the case for selling the B &amp; I, it is astounding that the Government have not decided to retain a &ldquo;golden share&rdquo; which would have allowed it to influence the crucial decisions to be made about the company in the future.  That was the course of action adopted when the Irish Sugar Company and Irish Life were sold off. Does the Minister consider that the B &amp; I is of less strategic importance than the Irish Sugar Company or Irish Life?  Even if the Government had taken an irrevocable decision that the B &amp; I was to be sold off &mdash; and as we all know the sale to Irish Continental Lines was not the only option open to them &mdash; there was a viable proposition for a management/worker buy-out.  After all, it was the combined effort of the management and workers which had put the B &amp; I back into shipshape condition.  Indeed, there is every <Col N="917" /> evidence to suggest that that unique proposal would have meant a great success in their taking over the firm.</P>
    <P>An earlier proposal on the part of management and workers had provided for the involvement of two Danish firms.  The Minister used the non-participation by the Danes to effectively scupper the proposal. Even with the non-participation of the Danes the worker/management buy out would have been a viable proposition in many respects making it more attractive because it would have ensured 100 per cent Irish ownership.  In addition, it would have ensured that the company would be run by the same team who had succeeded in turning it around.  Given that the workers themselves would be putting up the money, and the proposal had the overwhelming support of the staff, very likely those involved would have left no stone unturned in making the buy-out a success.  Instead, the workforce are now angry and disillusioned.  They are convinced the Minister never gave their proposals any serious consideration. They believe, with good reason, he used their proposal simply to strengthen their bargaining position with Irish Continental Lines, and what a bargain they got.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill we are now being asked to pass will virtually wipe out the company's debts, the company and its assets being handed over to Irish Continental Lines for just £8 million.  As I said earlier, <i>The Irish Times</i> described it as an exceptionally good deal for Irish Continental Lines, noting that once the B &amp; I's debt burden is removed, when rationalising savings are effected, the B &amp; I will be an extremely profitable shipping group.  In addition, <i>The Sunday Business Post,</i> a paper not exactly known for a pro-worker or pro-State enterprise stance, said that the sale was made in undue haste and that, on the face of it, Irish Continental Lines had got a very good deal.  The editorial stated that the £8.5 million price tag appears tiny in the context of what it could cost to assemble such a shipping line in current conditions. The <i>Sunday Business Post</i> also pointed <Col N="918" /> out that ICG will not have to pay corporation tax for years because about £100 million in tax losses will be transferred as part of the deal.  The newspaper puts a value of at least £20 million on the company which the Minister is presenting to ICG for £8.5 million.</P>
    <P>What does this deal make of the solemn commitment given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that any change in the ownership structure of particular State companies will only take place if it is in the public interest and in the best interests of the company and their employees and following consultation with the social partners? The company and their employees clearly believe that what the Minister is proposing is not in their interest or in the public interest, yet the Government are going ahead.  What consultation has there been with the social partners, especially with the trade union movement?</P>
    <P>Lined up against the deal are all the Opposition parties in this House, the workers and management of the B &amp; I, the board of the company, the trade union movement, most of the newspapers and the majority of those who use the services of the company.  Lined up in favour are Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the board of Irish Continental Lines.  This may make the Minister the hero figure he clearly wants to be among what has been described as the small golden circle who control so much of our commercial and business life.  It also means he will be remembered by the workers and the trade union movement as the Minister for betrayal and treachery who considers the objective of enhancing the profits of Irish Continental Lines to be far more important than ensuring the permanence of sea routes to and from this country or protecting the jobs of workers who have done so much to save the company.</P>
    <P>I will summarise briefly the position of The Workers' Party.  We support the notion of the State being involved in the strategic shipping lines operating between Ireland and Great Britain and the Continent.  We believe primarily there should be a golden share, some <Col N="919" /> influence on the decisions that will have to be made at some future date, because of the nature of our island State.  Realistically we are being faced with two options. One is the sale to ICG and the other, the preferred option, is the worker-management buy-out.  Those of us who are politically astute should not be surprised that the Minister has opted to sell the company to ICG, with the resulting effects on the workforce of 250 men and women in B &amp; I for whom the news is very bad this Christmas.</P>
    <P>We will be fighting this Bill tooth and nail.  We will not stop battling on this Bill and on the future proposals for the privatisation of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  With a bit of luck, the ICTU will be seen to be on the side of the workers in battling with the Minister on these issues.  I thank the Chair for his indulgence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>The B &amp; I Line is probably one of the most important enterprises not just in Dublin port but in Dublin generally and along the whole eastern seaboard.  It provides a very important link to the UK, particularly through Holyhead, and to mainland Europe.  Some years ago the B &amp; I were a very fine company with six ships but today they own only one ferry and one cargo ship.  Obviously they need investment. Those working in the company, their competitors and the people who use their services know that there is a shortage of shipping on the Irish Sea route.  When an offer was made for the company it was incumbent on us all to consider it.  Last year, when the management buy-out was suggested, there were to be 250 or 300 redundancies.  The second offer involves fewer redundancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the record of ICL.  That company was launched in 1972 or 1973 and many of those who went to work there had been employees of Irish Shipping and had been put out of work by an act of a previous Government.  I remember attending lectures about what a State company could and should do.  We were <Col N="920" /> told in the course of the lectures to look at the wonderful things Irish Shipping were doing.  Shortly afterwards, they were bankrupt.  Many people still suffer from the way that dreadful business was handled.  Some of the former employees of Irish Shipping obtained good jobs with ICL on Irish-registered ships.</P>
    <P>Before the problems started at B &amp; I, it was wonderful to see so many people working in the docks &mdash; suppliers, truckers and seamen.  The B &amp; I staff worked extremely hard during the past few years. Not only did they take a 5 per cent wage cut but they agreed to a three-year pay freeze and did away with extra payments and overtime.  The seafaring staff had to work very long hours.  There is no doubt, however, that the B &amp; I Line would have collapsed had the Minister not taken action.  I have no doubt that with the co-operation of everyone concerned this new arrangement will be successful.  It has been suggested that the MSBO take-over would have been more acceptable. That is possible and I probably would have preferred this option, but it must be remembered that the best efforts of the staff of B &amp; I have not resulted in resolving their problems.  More and more redundancies were demanded.  I have often met the staff and they all feel there is no continuity of employment.  I hope the ICL buy-out will enable people to have proper employment, proper salaries and proper conditions.</P>
    <P>I am not altogether sure of my information but I believe the B &amp; I Line are at present chartering ships which do not have Irish crews.  I do not know the nationality of the crews but they are not Irish.  It is absolutely essential from an Irish point of view that at least one shipping line is crewed by Irish crews and that the ships are registered in Ireland so that we will have a decent shipping line. Recently my colleague, Deputy Joe Doyle, and I raised the decision by Sealink to pull out of the ro-ro section of Dublin Port.  They sent a telegram the day they held a press conference to announce their decision to pull out of Dublin Port.  As far as I am aware, that <Col N="921" /> was the only lift-on lift-off line between Dublin and Holyhead.</P>
    <P>The original management-staff buy-out proposal was that 50 per cent of the company would be owned by a Danish company, another foreign company. Who is to say they would not decide to pull out at any stage because the proposal was not what they thought?  So far as I am aware, approximately 70 per cent of the Irish Continental Group is owned by Irish investors, whether individuals or institutions.  This company seem to be owned and fully operated by Irish people. We need more Irish ships and we should be looking at investment for the purchase of new ships.</P>
    <P>The Irish Continental Group have said they will spend over £30 million during the next five years improving the B &amp; I Line.  However, at least £70 million will have to be spent over the next ten years improving the fleet on the Irish Sea. Some of the existing ships are quite old and, because the Irish Sea can be quite stormy, a special type of ship is needed. The journey from Dublin or Rosslare to the Continent can be very hazardous.  If new ships are not provided and there is no continuous investment, problems will arise.  The Irish Continental Group have said they will provide investment on a regular basis and build up a good business. If they have a good business and good back up, they will have no problem getting investment.  However, they must at all stages be supported by the staff of the B &amp; I Line.  Deputy Yates repeatedly said there will be trouble with the unions and the workers.  The last thing anyone wants is trouble which can lead to the loss of more jobs.  Nobody in this House wants to see this happen.  Last year the unions were totally opposed to the management buy-out proposals and I believe the Seamen's Union of Ireland are opposed to the present proposal.</P>

      <P>I am not really inviting them; I am simply saying that when Members on the other side of the House make certain points, we can see the other side of the argument.  I can see both sides of this argument.  As I see it, this proposal will take the B &amp; I out of the past and bring them into the present.  They will be a wholly owned Irish company.</P>

      <P>To date, £106 million of taxpayers' money has been invested in the B &amp; I Line.  However, in spite of that investment, they only own two ships today.  I accept they gave good employment but that is all that has been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that this company is a bargain at £8 million.  I am not a stockbroker and I have not spoken to stockbrokers but I know that if one puts a bargain on sale people will come out of the woodwork to buy it.  I did not hear of anybody going mad to buy the B &amp; I Line.  It has been suggested that this company is a steal at £8 million.  It has also been suggested that it should be sold for £5 million, with only £2 million being put up front and the remainder being paid over a period of time.  It was further suggested that this is a sweetheart deal and that the Minister manipulated the management to put forward their proposal so that the price would be <Col N="923" /> increased.  There is no logic whatever in that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is absolute logic in it.  <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> said that the deal was&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> is an amazing newspaper, maybe The Workers' Party make a contribution to <i>The Sunday Business Post.</i>  My good friend, Deputy Byrne &mdash; I think Deputy Yates said the same &mdash; referred to the tax losses.  When the debate was adjourned I checked on the tax losses and how they would affect the Irish Continental Group.  Three points were made to me in this respect.</P>
      <P>The accumulated tax losses are locked into the B &amp; I Line and cannot be surrendered to the Irish Continental Group or a subsidiary.  In this way the effect of the tax losses on the Irish Continental Group will be no different than if the management and staff had bought the company.  As Deputy Yates said, the nature of that shipping company's business is such that profits are usually low relative to their capital base.  This is absolutely correct.  Therefore, as a result of the combination of capital tax allowances on the existing assets and new investment, shipping companies would not generally have to resort to accumulated tax losses.  This is normal in view of the risks involved in the shipping business.</P>
      <P>Virtually all the activities of the B &amp; I Line qualify as shipping trade under the Finance Acts and are, therefore, subject to a reduced 10 per cent tax rate up to the year 2010.  This limits the value of accumulated tax losses.  As a much better person than I once said here, we are not responsible for what appears in newspapers; they can put anything they want into an article and say this is what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that the B &amp; I Line are a success and if possible, they should be almost 100 per cent Irish owned.  This is what is contained in the proposal.  I hope a staff share capital <Col N="924" /> arrangement can be set up within the structures of Irish Ferries or one of the other companies so that the staff can have a share in the company which I hope will be successful.</P>
    <P>In regard to the management-staff buy-out proposal I was concerned to learn from the Minister's statement that the consortium were depending on £6 million of pension funds.  We should be wary of anybody wishing to interfere with pension funds.  They should not have access to that fund so far as I am concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy saying they will not have access to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the management-staff buy out suggestion was that they would depend on £6 million from the pension funds to pay for some of the redundancies and for other expenditure. That is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Who does the Deputy think should own&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that as being acceptable because of the dangers involved.  We need only have regard to what happened across the water to realise what can occur in the case of large pension funds.  Reference was made to a sum of £61 million in the pension fund.  I would ask the Minister when replying how he views that.  I have no doubt he will answer that question clearly.</P>
      <P>How does one fund a shipping company? There is only one way in which that can be done and that is by charging the users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Operating costs across the Irish Sea are among the most expensive in the world because of the cost of harbour dues.  I was always interested in the ports and when I was elected to this House a few years ago I approached the Government and asked whether they would consider funding major works in the harbour and they agreed.  That was the first time Dublin Port had ever been funded and it has not had to make repayments on that £28 million investment.  That funding, EC <Col N="925" /> or otherwise, has helped with operating costs.  Because of Ireland being on the periphery of Europe we have got to keep our costs down.  Suggestions have been put forward regularly, in this House, that the purchasers are buying the company now because the EC will fund mobile assets, in other words, shipping, after relenting and deciding that a tug is a mobile asset.  Strictly speaking one could refer to it as a mobile asset.</P>
    <P>Tugs, particularly the tractor tugs which are built today, normally operate within the harbour area.  We did receive some funding, approximately £3 million but why should we not try to get some funding for shipping.  There should be a subsidy for building new ships.  If you could buy new ships there is no way you could make huge profits because of operating costs.  If funding was available it would help towards the purchase but it does not cut down on operating costs. We keep a large crew on our ships, and rightly so.  We have always had a higher crew rating than most other countries.  In that context I might refer to the two ships which collided recently in Dublin Bay. One of them was leased by B &amp; I and the other was on charter to B &amp; I, one had practically twice the tonnage of the other and yet had a much smaller crew.  I take this opportunity to extend my sympathy to the families of those lost at sea on that occasion and I compliment the crew of the <i>Leinster</i> for their efforts to the rescue operation.  I went to the scene at 1 a.m. and was very pleased to find an Irish ship the <i>Leinster</i>, organising the rescue operations.  The ship on charter was operating with a foreign crew while the other was operating by an Irish crew. There is no doubt that at times when a company are busy that would happen but we will have to make provision, perhaps with EC funding, to have our fleet replaced.  I am confident that the company who have come in to purchase B &amp; I will have the expertise to look at the whole business, to fund it properly and to have a successful fleet in the next ten years.  Mention was made earlier of the fact that we must have a State owned <Col N="926" /> company and in one sense that may be a good idea.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Minister is keen to privatise everything including Dublin Bus.  The Deputy will be aware that we in Dublin Corporation proposed the idea of late night buses for Christmas but we were told that the company could not afford such a service.  However, the Minister stepped in and said that if they would not provide the service somebody else would.  We in Dublin Corporation put forward the proposal but the Minister was the one who put the pressure on and now there is a late bus service in Cork also and in various other places because that is what was necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <P>Sealink made a total mess of their schedules in Dún Laoghaire last year by changing times.  Truckers did not know whether they were coming or going and people who were travelling did not know what was happening.  The company have a beautiful ship but one is reminded of the light house and the bog analogy: brilliant but useless.  They have a most beautiful ship in Rosslare but when the wind blows it steams up and down off Cullenstown for two days because it is some 20 floors high.  In high winds it is totally unsuited to come in and out of Rosslare.  I am not worried about what this company or any appropriately managed Irish company will do.  At times I would love to be on the other side of the House.</P>

      <P>Opposition Deputies can say that they will do this, that and the other but they do not have to do anything. Some Deputies referred to the rush with this Bill but the problem had to be sorted out quickly in order to assist tourism, which is one of our major industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>How can travel agents arrange to bring people in and out of Ireland if they do not know what shipping line will be operating?  As Deputy Byrne suggested, the channel tunnel provides an ideal opportunity for continental tourists to go through England and straight to Ireland.  At this time of year travel agents set up their schedules and they want to know now how to get tourists to this country.  The motoring tourist is probably our best tourist.  We have space for him and he spends more.  Because of our short holiday season the motorist is <Col N="928" /> the ideal tourist.  Last year during the high season there was a shortage of cars for hire.  To encourage more tourists we should have an aggressive sales pitch from our shipping lines.  Aer Lingus did a fantastic job advertising Ireland throughout Europe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>A good shipping company can keep their ships filled.  When the staff consider this proposal and realise that it is in the interests of their jobs they will endeavour to make sure that it works because they will not want another Irish Shipping problem.  This company have a proven record and they are not likely to offer £8 million without having considered all the angles.  They will not get any more money from the Government.  We do not have the money to spend.</P>
      <P>I have always supported Dublin Port for its employment potential.  The port keeps the city alive.  I have been unpopular for supporting a port relief route. When ships arrive in Dublin Port, the freight carriers on them should be able to get on to a proper roadway out to the periphery of the city.  When I support such a strategy people point the finger and say that I am doing it for a personal reason, just as people have said that to the Minister here today.  We are trying to do what is best for Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Emigration has been with us for generations and the economic situation which has prevailed here has built into it an acceptance that emigration is inevitable.  Our budgetary policy takes into consideration the approximate number of our young people who are forced to seek work abroad.  It is ironic that in many cases the educational qualifications of our young people benefit Britain and the US.</P>
      <P>It appears that once we educate these young people our responsibility ends. But I put it to the House that we have taken the easy way out.  We have not provided the jobs for them and in some cases we have actively encouraged them to go.  At home we have failed to give to them what they are entitled to, to live, work, rear their families and grow old in their native land.</P>
      <P>Our emigrants are citizens of this country and as such we have a responsibility to them.  That responsibility does not stop at the airport or seaport.</P>
      <P>The present state of the British economy has now made the plight of our people abroad much more difficult and the report of the Irish Support and Advice Centre in Hammersmith spells out very clearly the problems our people faced particularly in London this year. The report states that many of our people in west London who are in serious circumstances are women, single parents and travellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this borough alone 20 per cent of the families placed in emergency accommodation are Irish and coming up to Christmas their position got worse.  Irish support groups are now strained trying <Col N="931" /> to alleviate the hardship they are experiencing.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Finance, Social Welfare, Environment and Labour have a duty to try to get to grips with this massive problem.  I am calling on the Minister to channel some emergency funding from these Departments to the recognised Irish aid groups to ease the severe hardship our people will suffer during the Chrismas period.</P>
    <P>It is apparent from the various reports from Britain that the Irish in Britain are being discriminated against.  It is disgraceful that we have to depend on the various charities in England to give them the bare necessities of life.  We have reneged on our responsibilities to our people.  The sooner the Government acknowledge this and act accordingly the better for everyone.  It is obvious that the Irish agencies are not getting sufficient funding to look after those who have fallen on hard times.  I appeal to the Government to immediately make funding available to the Irish centres throughout Britain who are doing a magnificant job in looking after Irish people.</P>
    <P>Those emigrants saved this country countless millions of pounds in social welfare benefits alone by emigrating.  I ask that some small portion of that money be channelled to the groups in Britain I have spoken about during the Christmas period.  Things are so bad in Britain that people are squatting in buildings in London, Birmingham, Sheffield and other major centres of population.  Irish agencies should be given extra funding this year to alleviate that hardship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I apologise for the unavoidable absence of my colleague, the Minister for Labour, Deputy O'Kennedy, who is abroad on Government business.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's concerns have been prompted by the report of the Irish Support and Advice Centre, Hammersmith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection I should like to say that, on the recommendation of DÍON, <Col N="932" /> the London-based Advisory Committee on Emigrant Services, the State grant for the Hammersmith Centre has been increased every year from £4,750 in 1983 to £48,000 this year.  The provision of £500,000 in the Department's Vote for 1991 has already been expended on grants to 32 organisations, including the Hammersmith Centre.</P>
    <P>I have seen the centre's last report and noted its comments on the position of emigrants.  I understand that a new director, Ms. Susan Cosgrove, has recently replaced the Rev. Jim Kiely at the centre and that DÍON will be meeting with his replacement shortly.</P>
    <P>I should explain that, through its regular contracts with all the emigrant welfare organisations, DÍON are very conscious of, and sensitive to, the changing needs and problems affecting our emigrants.  As a result, their priorities and criteria for grant-assistance are reviewed annually and all the emigrant welfare agencies are kept fully informed of any changes contemplated in grant conditions.  DÍON also keeps the Department abreast of developments affecting the general welfare of emigrants.</P>
    <P>As regards Government aid for voluntary organisation the Deputy will be aware that the allocation in the Department's Vote for grant assistance was doubled in 1989 from £250,000 to £500,000, in response to the rise in net emigration to around 46,000.</P>
    <P>Despite the increasing pressure on the Exchequer in the meantime the Government, as an earnest of their concern, have consistantly maintained the same level of funding since then, even though net emigration had dwindled to 1,000 in the year up to April 1991.</P>
    <P>Despite the dramatic decline in emigration some emigrants still encounter difficulties and DÍON grants are intended to tackle these problems.</P>
    <P>Towards that end, DÍON are concentrating on developing and improving support services through grant-aiding the employment of professionally-qualified workers operating front-line information, advisory and welfare services; initiatives and ventures forgoing closer <Col N="933" /> links between the voluntary emigrant services and local and statutory authorities which are responsible for the provision of housing and accommodation to meet local needs and the development of information projects and surveys for detecting and identifying the changing needs of emigrants or the specific needs of particularly disadvantaged groups.</P>
    <P>In this way, DÍON aim to secure maximum co-operation and also to extract the maximum benefits.</P>
    <P>I am fully satisfied that, with these arrangements, DÍON keep themselves appraised of the situation and are able to monitor and assess the changing needs of emigrants and to ensure that grant-aided facilities respond accordingly.</P>
    <P>DÍON take the view that the provision of housing and hostel accommodation is the responsibility of local authorities.  For that reason, they do not recommend grants for capital expenditure.  This view has been accepted by successive Ministers for Labour, particularly since the funding involved would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the dramatic decline in emigration does not mean that emigrant's problems have disappeared.  I am satisfied that, in the prevailing circumstances, the level of funding provided by the Government this year should go a long way to meet the most pressing needs and most urgent cases.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy, and the House, that the Minister is keeping in constant touch with the situation through contacts with DÍON, the Federation of Irish Societies and other organisations representing emigrants' interests, all of whom do excellent work.  If, at any stage, it appears that a serious deterioration has occurred in the situation the Ministers will not hesitate to review the funding arrangements, in consultation with DÍON.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Tá mé an bhuíoch go bhfuil an deis seo agam an cheist a phlé leis an Aire because many of us were aware even in a minor way, <Col N="934" /> the trauma experienced by parents who wished to adopt Romanian babies last summer.  The problem arises in relation to any foreign babies who may be adopted later.  Those of us who know what went on will recall that it was a trying time for those parents, many of whom had set about the long and arduous task of putting things in order.  For some, it was an occasion of great joy when they found that they could go to Romania &mdash; during the summer, in particular &mdash; and come back with a baby of their own.  I suppose we could say also that it was an occasion of joy for the baby in that it would be looked after in a loving and caring home.  For others, however, it was not a very enjoyable time; they were near but yet so far.  They started preparing the documents early last year and almost adopted a baby.</P>
      <P>The reasons for this are that changes were made in Romania and in the Adoption Act passed in the House in May of this year.  Up until then prospective adoptive parents could ask a social worker to carry out a family assessment which was acceptable in relation to foreign adoptions.  However, under the Adoption Act the health boards have been entrusted with this task.  This is fine if the system works but, from my discussions with parents who are anxious to adopt babies, we have a serious problem in Carlow-Kilkenny because it appears no progress is being made.  While those two made an application once the Adoption Act was passed received an acknowledgement and were told what would happen, unfortunately no visits or assessments have been carried out.  While I accept that it can take between six to 12 months to complete an assessment, given that nothing has happened in the six months since the enactment of the Adoption Act, those parents who, as I said, were sure last summer that they would be in a position to adopt foreign babies must feel very frustrated.</P>

    <P>Perhaps the South Eastern Health Board are unique &mdash; I am not so sure about this &mdash; but it should be pointed out that until the summer social workers did not carry out assessments.  These were <Col N="935" /> carried out by the Church body.  The health board social workers were then asked to take over but it seems &mdash; I can only go on the information which has been given to me &mdash; we have reached an <i>impasse</i> in view of the fact that the social workers are not doing this work because no extra resources have been provided and they are already up to their tonsils with other work.</P>
    <P>The matter has to be brought to a head. I hope when the Minister of State replies he will not point out what functions the Adoption Act impose on the health boards and what the health boards must do.  I hope also that he will outline what the factual position is in the South-Eastern Health Board, with particular reference to Carlow-Kilkenny and assure me and, more importantly, the parents who have been waiting for a long time that the assessments will be carried out very shortly.  If they are not carried out shortly, even if the position in relation to the Romanian basis is clarified in January, it could be well into the summer before they are carried out.  Even if they wished to adopt a baby in some other country apart from Romania, it would still be well into the summer before an assessment could be carried out.  We are being grossly unfair to the parents concerned as well as I suppose to the babies in foreign countries who are not being well looked after and who could be cared for in nice homes in Ireland.  I appeal to the Minister of State to offer some consolation to the parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Adoption Act, 1991, requires the health boards to carry out assessments of the suitability of people living within their functional areas who propose to adopt abroad.  I am satisfied that the health boards are well aware of their statutory duties under the 1991 Act and that they have been taking appropriate steps to fulfil those duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Adoption Board, who have a central role in the administration of the legislation, have issued detailed guidelines to the health boards and the registered <Col N="936" /> adoption societies in relation to the procedures to be followed in the assessment of persons for a foreign adoption.  These guidelines emphasise that part of the assessment process must involve counselling and advising the proposed adopters on the complexities and potential hazards of inter-country adoption in order to ensure that their decision to adopt is a fully informed decision.</P>
    <P>I understand from the South-Eastern Health Board that up to 30 September last they had received 70 requests for assessment from individuals and couples living in their area.  The health board are endeavouring to have all the outstanding assessments commenced and completed as expeditiously as possible in accordance with the terms of the guidelines issued by the Adoption Board.</P>
    <P>I understand from the South-Eastern Health Board that particular difficulties have arisen in certain areas of their region.  These difficulties are partly due to the fact that the health board have not traditionally operated an adoption service in the areas concerned.  I have been assured by the health board that they are urgently working to resolve the difficulties.  The Adoption Act, 1991, empowers a health board to make arrangements with a registered adoption society to undertake foreign adoption assessments on their behalf and the South-Eastern Health Board are currently exploring this possibility.</P>
    <P>My Department are in regular contact with the South-Eastern Health Board with a view to effecting an improvement and are closely monitoring the situation. I intend to involve myself personally in seeking a resolution of this difficulty at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter and the Minister of State for coming into the House to reply to it.  This issue, like the issue raised by the previous speaker, involves the anomalies and difficulties <Col N="937" /> encountered under our adoption laws. The substance of this matter is that our adoption procedures are not coping with significant emerging developments which involve people who were parties to legal adoptions in years past and who are now trying to trace their blood relatives.  It is mainly adult adoptees, who were legally adopted as babies, who now want to make contact with their birth mother. However, mothers, who gave their children up for adoption because they were either unmarried or very young when the baby was born, now want to get in touch in greater numbers.  Because neither our adoption laws nor our structures can cope with this development, our system is blind and deaf to these people.  Others, therefore, whose sole motive is profit, are providing a tracing service which is not being provided by the State.</P>
      <P>These private investigators will take on the job of finding a relative.  They will go to great lengths and search through parish and birth registers in an effort to put people in touch with each other.  This is a hard-faced and insensitive system, because, by its nature, it cannot meet the sensitive and caring needs of the people in question.  However, because the State and its agencies are not involved these private or freelance operators are the only options available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that because no guidelines have been laid down under which agencies can provide this post-adoption service a very patchy approach is adopted by individual agencies.  There is no voluntary contact register in which people could indicate their wishes in regard to future contact.  Neither is any special counselling service available for those who are contemplating making such contact or who have made such contact. These services have been available in Britain and Northern Ireland for some time &mdash; as we are all aware, the law has been changed there &mdash; where a uniform approach is adopted in tracing relatives following adoption.  This can and does prevent distressing situations where a woman, whose child born out of wedlock was adopted, suddenly finds this adult offspring on her doorstep wanting to <Col N="938" /> develop a relationship with her, and she cannot cope with the shock.</P>
    <P>Legal adoption arrangements were entered into over the years with a surety of privacy and confidentiality for all concerned &mdash; the adoptee, the adoptive parents and the natural mother.  This confidentiality must be respected while recognising that there is a need to facilitate people who want to go along this difficult path of discovery.</P>
    <P>The measures I propose on behalf of the many agencies who have contacted me and the Minister for Health would cost very little but the suffering and distress saved would be considerable.  There are more than 20 adoption agencies and individuals in an informal group determined to work to put this arrangement in place.  They are deeply concerned at what is happening and at the lack of departmental action.  They have indicated their support for an initiative and promised to facilitate the setting up of such a register and service in every way possible.  Action is long overdue and I hope the Minister will give a greater commitment than the one given in answer to a parliamentary question last week.  I hope action will be taken in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I will be able to outline two reasons for not agreeing with the Deputy that cost or lack of departmental action are factors in not proceeding in this regard.</P>
      <P>As recently indicated in response to questions from the Deputy, I am aware from the reports of the Adoption Board and from other sources of the increasing number of tracing inquiries, not alone from adopted persons seeking to trace their birth parents, but also from birth parents seeking to make contact with children they placed for adoption.</P>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by professionals working in the adoption services about the involvement of private investigators and other individuals in this extremely sensitive and delicate area.  I particularly deplore the tactics used by some of these individuals and their utter disregard for the feelings and sensitivities of birth mothers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> While it is wholly inappropriate for non-professional individuals to involve themselves in work which has such potentially harmful consequences, the position appears to be that they are not acting outside the law.  There are, of course, appropriate legal processes open to any birth mother who feels that she is being harassed.  However, it should not be necessary for a birth mother to resort to legal action in order to safeguard her right to privacy.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement among the various organisations involved in the adoption area as to the desirability of a formal arrangement to facilitate contact between adopted persons and their birth parents.  It has been suggested that a contact register might be an appropriate mechanism for facilitating such contact.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in principle with the concept of a contact register.  Such an arrangement would indeed be of assistance to adopted persons and birth parents seeking to contact one another.  It would also have the effect of helping to curtail the activities of non-professional private individuals in relation to post-adoption inquiries.</P>
    <P>However, a fundamental difference of opinion has emerged between the relevant interest groups in relation to the purpose and scope of an adoption contact register.  One group have expressed the view that the disclosure of identifying information and contact should only be facilitated with the consent of both the adopted person and the birth mother, whereas another group consider that a request by the adopted person should be sufficient to entitle that person to identifying information and to have his or her birth mother traced.</P>
    <P>I recently had an opportunity to meet <Col N="940" /> four individual adoptive parents; three of them indicated that they would agree with the establishment of a contact register but the fourth expressed very grave personal concern regarding the creation of such a register and what it would mean to her personal and private circumstances. Therein lies the dilemma in relation to this issue.</P>
    <P>This fundamental difference illustrates the complexities of the issues involved and the need for a full and careful examination of all those issues before a final decision can be reached.  Of prime importance would be the manner in which identifying information about a party to legal adoption proceedings would be recorded and the circumstances in which such information would be disclosed. Great care would have to be taken to ensure that the right to privacy of adopted persons and birth parents is not undermined.  It would also be necessary to examine whether a contact register should have a statutory basis and who would be the most appropriate body to operate it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate that is taking place within the adoption services on the question of access by the parties involved to information.  This is a particularly complex and sensitive issue.  In putting any new structure or arrangements in place, great care will have to be taken to avoid causing upset and anxieties among the parties concerned.  It is particularly desirable that there should be a broad measure of agreement among all the agencies and groups involved on the approach that should be adopted.  I sincerely hope that a consensus can quickly emerge so that we can make further progress.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 11 December 1991.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations to be made under the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, will, primarily, give effect to the five Annexes which comprise the MARPOL 73/78 Convention viz., Annex 1 which relates to the prevention of pollution by oil; Annex 2 to the control of pollution by noxious liquid substances; Annex 3 to the prevention of pollution by harmful substances carried by sea in packaged forms or in freight containers, portable tanks or road and rail tank wagons; Annex 4 <Col N="659" /> to the prevention of pollution by sewage from ships; and Annex 5 to the prevention of pollution by garbage from ships.  In order to become party to MARPOL 73/78 states must adopt Annexes 1 and 2.  Annexes 3, 4 and 5 are optional.  However, as I mentioned in the passage of the Bill through this House I propose to give effect to all five Annexes in due course.</P>
      <P>Priority at this stage is being given to the drafting of the regulations to give effect to Annexes 1 (oil) and 2 (noxious liquid substances in bulk), namely, the obligatory Annexes so that the State can ratify the convention as soon as possible. I am also committed to early adoption of Annex 5 which relates to garbage.  I would hope to have the regulations to give effect to Annexes 1, 2 and 5 introduced within 12 months.</P>
      <P>Annex 1, 2, 4 and 5 require port and harbour authorities to provide reception facilities for the discharge of ships' wastes.  Such facilities must be adequate to meet the needs of the ships using them without causing undue delay to the ships. There will always be a need for facilities for the disposal of oil, oily mixtures and oily residues and for those wastes which comprise garbage, viz., plastics, synthetic ropes and fishing nets, oily rags, food wastes, crockery, glass, bottles and packaging, but as the number of Irish ports at which noxious liquid substances are loaded or unloaded is small, facilities for receiving residues will only need to be provided at such ports.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department will be discussing the detailed arrangements with regard to the precise reception facilities to be provided, initially with the commercial harbours and the fishery harbour centres.  Efforts will be made to have joint undertakings on ultimate disposal of wastes and to encourage recycling where possible.</P>
      <P>Food wastes or &ldquo;swill&rdquo; must be disposed of in accordance with the requirements of the animal diseases regulations of the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless expressly provided otherwise, <Col N="660" /> the provisions of Annexes 1 and 2 apply to all ships, the provisions of Annex 5 apply to all ships.  I have not as yet decided to exempt any class of ship from Annexes 1 or 2.  The matter needs careful consideration in consultation with experts in the shipping and environmental spheres.</P>

      <P>While the question of the transfer of the management of the Moy Fishery to the North-Western Regional Fisheries has been raised with me from time to time by a number of bodies I have had no specific request from the Ireland West Regional Tourism Organisation.  On this issue I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 6 November 1991, in which I stated that a group was established earlier this year to consider the future management and development of the Moy fishery and the system as a whole.  I do not wish to pre-empt the report of the group in this matter and this being so, the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to make a comment at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> I would add, however, that I am satisfied with my Department's management of the Moy Fishery to date and the development/conservation measures introduced by them.  Furthermore, I would like to point out that the State purchased the Moy Fishery at a considerable cost to the taxpayer and the State has a responsibility to ensure that this investment is recouped.  In this regard I have no end of offers to take over the fishery from my Department, but on a free gratis basis.  Similarly I have no end of suggestions that my Department should reduce the commercial catch and thereby its income from the fishery to the benefit of other owners in the catchment.  I must stress, however, that a key element of any transfer of management for this fishery or changes in the commercial fishery will have to be the securing of adequate financial return for the State on its investment.</P>
    <P>My reply to Questions Nos. 34, 36 and 40 on 10 July 1991, gave information on (a) the number of salmon taken by trap and net since the State acquired the fishery up to 1990 and (b) the value of fish caught by the commercial operation in the same period.  The total number of salmon taken by trap and net in 1991 is 13,049 and the income realised from this operation is £166,989.</P>
    <P>The number of staff employed full-time is one, with a further four employed for up to ten months of the year.  In the summer period of commercial fishing 18 persons were engaged on a temporary basis this year.</P>

      <P>In 1990 the proportion of Irish trade with mainland Europe amounted to 41 per cent of our total intra-Community trade and increasingly this traffic is being transported by direct sea routes.  It is also estimated that only a fifth of traffic with a continental destination is carried via the landbridge.  It may be expected that an element of this traffic will be diverted to the Channel Tunnel route.  In this regard we are pressing for improvements in all facets of the transport network in the UK so that any disadvantages faced by through traffic from Ireland and minimised.</P>
      <P>The longer term impact of the Channel Tunnel on the proportions and levels of Irish trade conducted via the landbridge with the continent as against the direct sea routes will depend on a complex range of factors and in particular the relative cost, taking account of the time factors involved, of the different routes. I would not, however, anticipate any reversal of the trend towards the increasing use of the direct sea routes.</P>
      <P>We are nevertheless concerned that these developments overall will increase Ireland's peripherality and weaken our competitiveness, and thus we continue to press the case for support from the Community for Ireland's access transport needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also in anticipation of that increased peripherality, our policy in relation to commercial seaports is to concentrate aid on the key ports of Cork, Dublin, <Col N="665" /> Rosslare and Waterford.  That aid is being provided through the operational programme on peripherality in order to facilitate those ports in the acquisition of necessary infrastructure and handling equipment to service the current and projected needs of port users and shipping operators.</P>

      <P>I should advise the Deputy that the established policy is that each harbour authority, including Waterford, should be operated as a commercial undertaking and should be financially self-supporting. Harbour authorities should conduct their affairs so as to ensure that revenues are not less than sufficient to remunerate capital and repay borrowings.  It is not the policy to State guarantee borrowings by harbour authorities.</P>
      <P>Because of the importance of the location of Waterford for British and other EC trade, I am anxious to ensure that the Belview harbour development plan proceeds.  The Waterford project is now being re-evaluated in the light of the request from Waterford Harbour Commissioners for a State guarantee.  I expect that the re-evaluation will be completed shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 36 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As outlined in the Review of the Programme for Government 1989-1993, the Government will continue to promote and support the development of our marine resources with special emphasis on a number of areas including the seafish industry where the development of fish processing, improvement of facilities at fishing ports, modernisation and restructuring of the fleet, expansion of manpower development programmes for fishermen, improvement of fish quality and hygiene the monitoring and surveillance of fishing activities and increased productivity, competitiveness and employment in the aquaculture sector, will be effected, <i>inter alia,</i> through significant EC support frameworks underpinned by Exchequer and industry funding; commercial harbours where <Col N="668" /> specific measures and projects under the EC Operational Programme on Peripherality will promote growth by developing our port infrastructure which is a prerequisite for increased trade and efficient access transport; and fishing ports and harbours where improvement of facilities at fishery harbour centres and other harbours are being effected under a development programme with assistance from the European Regional Development Fund.  Improvement works under this programme were undertaken during 1991 at Killybegs, County Donegal; Howth, County Dublin; Castletownbere, County Cork; Dunmore East, County Waterford; Rossaveal, County Galway; Greencastle, County Donegal; Dingle, County Kerry; Kilmore Quay, County Wexford; Clogherhead, County Louth and Burtonport, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>As regards shipping the Government have made a submission to the European Commission which, <i>inter alia,</i> seeks allocation of funds to aid a total of seven ro-ro and lo-lo ships and a response is awaited. In addition, the sale of Verolme Cork Dockyard to Damen Shipyards of Holland has been completed and the yard will expand its ship repair activities on completion of necessary refurbishment work which is underway.</P>
    <P>In relation to inland fisheries in particular, the Government intend to pursue an integrated programme of measures for the development of our inland fishery resource availing of financial assistance under the appropriate schemes from funds such as European Regional Development Fund, LEADER, INTER-REG and IFI.  The habitat for our inland fish stocks will continue to be protected by a wide range of environmental protection measures which will be intensified as necessary.  Protection of the stocks from illegal exploitation, especially at sea, will be intensified with more intensive use of the Naval Services peacock class vessels and the high speed RIBs of the fisheries boards.  The new fishery protection plane recently put into service by the Air Corps with great success in the sea fishery area will be deployed as <Col N="669" /> necessary in the drive to protect inland fish stocks.</P>
    <P>The fisheries development co-operatives being established under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991, for the development of trout and coarse fisheries will further support growth in the sector.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that all the measures outlined above will create the conditions for further sustained employment growth in the marine area.</P>

    <P>The declared ocean going all weather lifeboats are stationed as follows: on the east coast, six, on the south coast, five and on the west coast, four.</P>
    <P>Also available for response to ocean incidents as additional resources are first, Naval Service Vessels: While the Naval Service have no resources dedicated to search and rescue &mdash; their primary roles being defence and sea fisheries protection &mdash; any of their seven patrol vessels at sea on fisheries protection duties, will respond to a Mayday broadcast or notification of a vessel in distress in accordance with international law.  The location of patrol vessels at the time of an emergency is a factor.  Normally the vessel closest to the incident responds.  The time taken to reach an incident will vary in each situation.  Second, likewise, all other vessels which include merchant vessels, fishing vessels, foreign naval vessels, etc., in the vicinity are obliged to respond to the incident.</P>
    <P>In relation to (b) planes &mdash; fixed wing <Col N="671" /> resources &mdash; a CASA CN 235, the primary role of which is fisheries protection-maritime patrol, is generally available at Baldonnel subject to serviceability at the time, to respond to requests for the search aspects and &ldquo;Top-Cover&rdquo; element of search and rescue operations.  The crew for this operation are on one hour call at home and would expect to be airborne within two hours call.</P>
    <P>In relation to (c) helicopters, since 15 July 1991, the Department of the Marine have employed Irish Helicopters Limited to provide a medium-range search and rescue helicopter service from Shannon. The helicopter, a Sikorsky S6IN with a crew of four, responds to marine emergencies on a 24 hour basis, both on the west coast and nationally, with 15 minutes notice by day and 45 minutes at night to be airborne.</P>
    <P>To complement the Shannon based medium range helicopter, the following Air Corps resources are dedicated for search and rescue (SAR) purposes:</P>
    <P>East Coast &mdash; located at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel: one Alouette III helicopter and crew of three respond to daylight search and rescue requests in visual meteorological conditions.  Their response time is to be airborne in 15 minutes, day only, after receipt of call.</P>
    <P>West Coast &mdash; located at Finner Camp, Donegal: one SA 365F Dauphin and crew of four on 24-hour call for search and rescue in the north-west area.  The response time of this aircraft is 15 minutes from receipt of call by day and 45 minutes by night.</P>
    <P>The resources of the Alouette III and the SA 365F Dauphin helicopters are located as indicated but they can also be tasked to any geographic area within normal operating parameters as required, in order to respond to specific requests from MRCC.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the difference between the rates of EC aid available to some ports in Northern Ireland and the rate currently available here under the operational programme on peripherality.</P>
      <P>Within the allocation available to them at the time, the Government decided that the goals of the programme &mdash; of offsetting the impact of Ireland's peripheral location and assisting sub-regional development &mdash; could best be achieved by spreading the allocation over the optimum number of our key ports.  The programme currently provides that our harbour authorities can receive grant aid of up to 50 per cent of their approved project costs.</P>
      <P>As far as Structural Fund aid is concerned, there is an absolute limit of 75 per cent on the EC grant assistance that can be provided to projects.  The possibility of increasing the rate of EC aid going to port projects is being actively pursued by me.</P>
      <P>Member states can, of course, provide additional aids to their own ports.  I am aware that ports in the Community have received such aid from their own authorities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that because of the limited resources available to the Exchequer here, funding for port projects must be tightly rationed.  Factors such as the harbour's ownership, financial status and the priority attaching to projects, are taken into account in determining the level and necessity of State investment.  In the current operational programme on peripherality, for instance, port projects at Drogheda, Dundalk, Foynes and Waterford are being part funded by the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the answer given to a grievance question on this matter on Tuesday, 3 December last.  As was pointed out on that occasion, this case involves a change of ownership within the fleet.  As a result, the individual in question was not required to withdraw any vessels from the current sea fishing boat register as replacement tonnage and horsepower, as is the case when an application is made to bring a vessel into the fleet for the first time.  As the vessel was over 65 feet in length, however, the issuing of a new sea fishing boat licence was necessary.  Under present policy licences to fish for herring and mackerel are generally only granted where the vessel being transferred or replaced had not only an entitlement to fish for these species but also an active history of fishing for them. This was not the case with this particular vessel.  Accordingly, a licence was granted to the applicant but it contained a condition precluding fishing for herring and mackerel.</P>
      <P>The policy in relation to the granting of herring and mackerel licences exists for the very good reason that there is already over-capacity in this section of the fleet.  The granting of such a licence to a vessel which may have had an entitlement to fish for these species, but had not been actively used for that purpose, would effectively increase capacity in this section of the fleet.</P>
      <P>I should remind the Deputy that the individual in question was allowed to transfer the herring entitlement of his other vessel, which is temporarily out of commission as the result of a fire, to this vessel on an interim basis.  As a result he has been allowed to take part in the autumn fishery in the Celtic Sea.</P>

      <P>The Government's Environment Action Programme, launched in January 1991, announced the Government decision to ban all dumping at sea of industrial wastes from 31 December 1995.  This accords with the decision of the Oslo Commission, taken in Dublin in June of 1989, to cease the dumping of industrial waste in the North Sea by 31 December 1989 and in the rest of the Oslo Convention area by 31 December 1995, unless it could be shown that there were no practical alternatives for disposal on land and the wastes caused no harm to the marine environment.</P>
      <P>The three Irish based companies which have been authorised to dump industrial waste at sea expect to have switched to land-based disposal by the end of 1992. Details of recent dumping operations by those companies are as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ADM Ringaskiddy are authorised to dump the waste from their own plant and that of Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Production Corporation at a site off the coast of County Cork.  The company dump the greatest quantity (99 per cent) of industrial waste from Ireland at sea and is currently authorised to dump up to 750,000 tonnes per annum.  A new land-based treatment plant is currently receiving waste.  The treatment is by anaerobic <Col N="675" /> bacterial digestion and results in release of methane gas which is used in the company's manufacturing processes.  It is intended that the dumping of the waste at sea will be phased out progressively during 1992 as the plant's digestion capacity increases.</P>
    <P>Wyeth (Ireland) Limited are authorised to dump up to 3,300 tonnes per annum of sludge effluent arising from the manufacture of infant food at a site in the Shannon Estuary.  The company's proposed alternative means of waste disposal involves drying and concentration of sludge for use as a fertiliser.</P>
    <P>Irish Refining plc. dump about 1,300 tonnes of spent caustic waste every two years at the industrial dump site off Cork harbour.  The waste is in liquid form and is stored in a tank until a load sufficient for dumping is accumulated.  The company last dumped the waste in March 1990 and have since selected an acid neutralisation system as a suitable treatment alternative which they hope will be installed and operational during 1992.</P>
    <P>The companies are obliged under the permits granted to carry out sampling and analyses of the waste at regular intervals. The results are checked and monitored by the Department.  In addition, the <Col N="676" /> dumping operations are regularly inspected by my Department's engineers.</P>
    <P>A study of the Cork dump site was carried out in 1988 and confirmed that there were no adverse environmental impacts in the vicinity of the dump site. The report of the study concluded as follows:</P>
    <P>The REMOTS reconnaissance survey of the industrial dump site confirmed the findings of the previous surveys. It reaffirmed that there was little physical disturbance of the seabed, which was colonised by a fauna characteristic of an unstressed habitat.  It was thus concluded that the area was one of high habitat quality.</P>

      <P>My Department have seen a copy of a report by the laboratory in England on tests which were, I understand, commissioned by BIM on behalf of a number of salmon dealers in the Foyle area.  The tests were carried out in February 1990 on a number of salmon captured during the 1989 fishing season and were intended to trace the cause of an alleged taint or mustiness in the fish.</P>
      <P>The tests revealed the presence in significant quantities of geosmin a naturally occurring substance which can give rise to a musty smell and/or taste.  Minute traces of some halogenated compounds were also found in the samples, the significance of which was unknown according to the reports.  There is no evidence that the tainted salmon were unsuitable for human consumption.</P>
      <P>The Foyle Fisheries Commission working in collaboration with the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment have been unable to establish any point source of discharges containing such compounds in the Foyle area.</P>

      <P>I would raise strong objections to any proposals by the European Commission that the decision making powers governing the issue of licences to fish Irish quotas should be vested in the Commission rather than in the Irish authorities. I am not aware, however, of any specific formal proposals from the Commission in this regard, although there may be thinking within the Commission that the granting of such powers to the Commission could be useful in the context of conserving stocks and managing the control and reduction of fishing fleets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards an appeals mechanism for unsuccessful licence applicants, I am satisfied that the existing system provides sufficient opportunities for an aggrieved person to have the decision in his or her case thoroughly reviewed.  In the first instance, the process involved in taking a decision to grant or refuse a licence is designed to ensure that the decision is justified on the basis of the policy objectives and guidelines in place.  Second, a person may, in the normal way, question the decision and, if so questioned, the decision would, of course, be fully reviewed.  I should mention in this regard that I, as Minister, would personally review the facts in all such cases.  If an <Col N="679" /> applicant at that point is still not satisfied, he or she may, of course, raise the matter with the office of the Ombudsman and I would pay very close attention to the views of that office.  Finally, the applicant could pursue the matter by means of seeking judicial review.</P>
    <P>In my experience the issues raised by persons who have not been granted licences tend to be related mainly to the questioning of the policy in place rather than to the fairness of the treatment of their applications.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for enforcing Community regulations in regard to sea fishing is a matter for each member state in the waters under its jurisdiction.  There are no powers under either national or Community law which could be availed of to transfer or share this legal responsibility with the enforcement service of another member state.</P>
      <P>The granting to another member state of enforcement power such as the arrest and detention of fishing vessels operating within the Irish jurisdiction would represent a significant departure and raise serious legal and operational issues, and any proposal in this regard would have to be assessed very carefully.</P>
      <P>I would stress, however, that member states may and do co-operate with each other in the exchange of information relating to fisheries surveillance.  In this respect a meeting of experts in this area was called, on the basis of an Irish initiative, by the Commission last April to discuss unauthorised fishing activity in Community waters and procedures were put in place at this meeting to enhance co-operation between member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this general regard I should mention <Col N="680" /> that the Commission is formulating a new sea fisheries control regulation to improve enforcement both at sea and on land and this is being considered by all member states at a preliminary meeting today, Tuesday, 10 December, with the Commission in Brussels.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that no report of a collision was received by me and that no collision took place between this ferry and a submarine on 13 June.</P>
      <P>What may have given rise to this question is an incident which occurred in the English Channel on 13 June last which did involve the <i>St. Patrick II.</i>  On that date the Irish Ferries vessel was plying between Rosslare and Le Havre when it was asked &mdash; as the closest vessel to the scene &mdash; by the UK authorities to deviate from its normal course to stand by a submarine distress beacon which was floating on the surface some 28 miles south of Plymouth.</P>
      <P>A submarine distress beacon is a safety device carried by submarines for alerting the emergency services when a submarine is in difficulty.  When a submarine is in distress the beacon can be released from the vessel to travel to the surface trailing a line attached to the stricken vessel.  When the beacon breaks the surface it emits a continuous radio signal on the distress channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Ferries vessel deviated from its course and after sighting the device steamed around it for between two and a half and three hours at a distance of half a mile approximately.  The ferry remained on the scene until it was released by the UK Coastguard and resumed its voyage which it completed without incident.  At no time during the <Col N="681" /> incident did the vessel have any contact with a submarine or a submarine distress beacon.</P>
    <P>I trust that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Day to day financial transactions are a matter for each regional board whose responsibility it is to manage their finances in a prudent fashion to ensure that they live within the resources available to them.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the difficulties experienced by the board arose in any way from the actions of my Department. In particular, I reject the suggestion that the difficulties stemmed from a failure by my Department to issue a letter of comfort.  The letter required in this case would have involved an indication by my Department that the board would be provided with funds additional to those already budgeted for.  No such funds were available to my Department at that time and this was made quite clear to the board.</P>
      <P>I would add that it is not general policy, in any event, to issue letters of comfort and the consent of the Department of Finance is required to the issue of such letters which would normally only be given in exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, however, I announced in mid-November that I was making available an additional £250,000 to the central and regional boards to cover safety expenditure costs arising from the Ballycotton inquiry report.  The Shannon Board received £35,000 of this allocation.  I expect that the Shannon Board will avail of this funding and make whatever other arrangements are necessary to manage their finances so that there is no repetition of the difficulties which arose in October.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the practice of large scale removal of sand from beaches has increased substantially, in pace and scale, in recent years.  Apart from direct amenity losses, such removals can have a deleterious impact on the seashore generally.  It follows that the preservation and protection of our beaches and sea-shore is now an important environmental priority.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Government's environment action programme, my Department have been working on proposals for Government in this area. These proposals, which have been the subject of detailed consultations with other Departments, are designed to strengthen substantively the State's capacity to protect the foreshore and sea-shore. The approach envisaged includes the creation of appropriate offences and penalties in connection with unauthorised removals and will deal with the key question of the use of mechanical diggers and the like.  I hope to have draft proposals for amending legislation to the Foreshore Act, 1933, ready for the Government's consideration early next year.</P>
      <P>In the meantime I shall continue to deploy all the existing powers available to me under the 1933 Act to protect beaches from large scale depradations.  Only where I am satisfied on the basis of consultation with, <i>inter alia,</i> local authorities that the removal involved would pose no threat to the local environment and is otherwise in the public interest, will licences be issued.</P>
      <P>The serving of prohibitory notices or the making of prohibitory orders are additional control mechanisms at my disposal where the situation warrants.  These will be utilised to the full as, for example, in the case of Ballybunion in County Kerry, and Donegal where a prohibitory order was made in 1990, and a licence to remove beach material was revoked by me earlier this year.</P>

      <P>Most of the plastics discarded on our coasts are generated by land-based domestic refuse or by the throwing overboard from ships and fishing vessels at sea of what are termed operational wastes viz. plastic garbage disposal bags, food containers, household products such as disinfectants, bleach and washing up liquid, synthetic ropes and nets.</P>
      <P>Mindful of the damage a seafarer can cause to marine life, my Department, in conjunction with the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works, launched a poster campaign to discourage seafarers from &ldquo;dumping over the side&rdquo;.  The poster graphically highlights the adverse effects ships' garbage, especially plastics, can have on marine life and on safety at sea.  My Department has sought to achieve the widest possible circulation of the poster.  It has been circulated to all schools in the country, to fishing vessel owners, fishery co-operatives, yacht clubs and merchant vessel owners.  I am gratified with the response the poster campaign has generated and am satisfied that increased awareness of the problem, particularly among the younger generation, has been achieved.  The question of a &ldquo;follow-up&rdquo; poster is now under active consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately following enactment of the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, my Department established an interdepartmental group comprising representatives of the Department of an Taoiseach, Education, Environment, Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works and my own <Col N="686" /> Department to advise me on a comprehensive awareness programme for protection of the marine environment with particular reference to the implications of adoption of the annexes which comprise the MARPOL 73/78 Convention. Annex 5 strictly prohibits the disposal into the sea of all plastics.  Facilities must be provided at ports for the reception of such wastes.  These are the aspects which my Department will be highlighting in its awareness campaign.</P>
    <P>I concur with the Deputy's view that people need to be better informed on the damaging effects which plastics which are both bio-degradable and extremely persistent can have on fish, seabirds, marine mammals and marine life generally.</P>

This funding will support and complement existing expenditure by my Department on fish stock assessments and other research to support development of the fishing sector.</P>
      <P>A key measure under the investment programme will be the provision of specialised navigational measuring and sampling equipment for the national marine research vessel, the Lough Beltra.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view expressed by my predecessor at the recent World Bank annual meeting that there is need for much greater international co-ordination and a greater focus of public attention on the continuing dangers to the environment. One of the greatest dangers is the destruction of tropical rain forests.  I will be very supportive of measures to restrain this destruction.  Accordingly, it will not be my policy to support the financing of projects, by the World Bank, which have a proven detrimental impact on the environment.</P>
      <P>I should point out that a World Bank Operational Directive on Environmental Assessment was approved in October 1989.  This directive requires that an environmental assessment be carried out for all projects that may have a significant impact on the environment.  It enables the Bank and its borrowers to detect and remedy any problems early in the projects cycle.  This directive has been revised and strengthened this year to increase the level of consultation with the local population affected by any project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of possible deforestation the World Bank are particularly concerned with the forestry area and have this year produced a policy paper on &ldquo;The Forest Sector&rdquo;.  This paper stresses the importance of appreciating the effect of tropical moist forests.  These forests not only have a role in the carbon cycle and in global climatic change but also in protecting biological diversity.  The Bank are making a major effort to check deforestation and included in this is the Bank's stance of no financing of commercial logging in primary tropical moist forests.  I support these efforts by the World Bank and I share their view that there are great <Col N="692" /> challenges faced by the world community in addressing forestry issues, and that progress in arresting the current trends requires concerted efforts by governments and many international organisations, of which the bank is only one. Policies and programmes need to be directed toward changing the incentive and institutional structures that are leading to excessive deforestation and that discourage rural people for planting trees and practising good forest management. In addition, the global external costs, particularly those related to the preservation of tropical moist forests, need to be internalised into local actions through international co-operation and assistance.</P>

These changes arose from the elimination of circular transfers resulting from the enactment of the Local Loans Fund, (Amendment) Act, 1987 and the incorporation, as a credit in the national debt statement of liquid assets which were previously shown in the statement of capital assets in the <i>Finance Accounts.</i>  The national debt figures back to 1982 have been revised to take account of these changes.  For years prior to 1982, the figures have not been adjusted for these changes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 60 together.  Officials of my Department briefed the Taoiseach in early December 1990 on procedural issues that arose in connection with the Supplementary Estimate for third level education required to provide funds towards the cost of the purchase and refurbishment of Carysfort College by UCD.  At the time of the briefing, another separate Supplementary Estimate for third level education was necessary because of a delay in receipts from the European Social Fund, but this had not been moved in the Dáil. The 1991 Abridged Estimates Volume, which was about to be published, included, in its figures for 1990, the latter Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>Two questions then arose, namely whether the two supplementary Estimates should be combined and the publication of the Abridged Estimates Volume deferred to allow for incorporation in the 1990 figures of the expenditure proposed on Carysfort.  It was decided to have two Supplementary Estimates and not to delay publication of the abridged Estimates Volume, but to publish it as planned at the time planned.</P>
      <P>The 1990 figure for Third Level Education included in the Revised 1991 Estimates Volume, published after the budget, includes both Supplementary Estimates.</P>
      <P>No other briefings of the Taoiseach by officials of my Department took place and no presentation was made to the Taoiseach by such officials.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the vehicle in question is liable on importation to excise duty at a rate of 21.7 per cent.  This is charged on the recommended retail selling price of the corresponding model on sale new in the State reduced by 60 per cent to take account of the age of the car.  In this case the duty amounts to approximately £1,165.</P>
      <P>It is also liable to VAT at a rate of 21 per cent.  However, the Revenue Commissioners cannot determine the exact amount of VAT payable without sight of the vehicle and supporting documentation. Partial credit may arise for VAT already paid in another EC member state in certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that import charges may, at the option of the importer, be paid by bank draft, by money or postal order, by guaranteed cheque up to certain limits, by cash or under a direct debiting arrangement agreed with the banks.  The direct debiting arrangement applies where traders participate in a scheme (known as the deferred payment scheme), whereby payments due in any particular month may be deferred until the following month (the direct debiting arrangement does not apply in the case of exise duties on oils, liquid petroleum gas, video machines or table waters).</P>
      <P>Normal practice is that receipts are issued by customs for the payment of all import charges.  If the Deputy is aware of an incidence where this practice was not followed, I will ask the Revenue Commissioners to examine the matter on receipt of details of the case.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The Community Support Framework for Ireland 1989-1993 (CSF) provides that each sub-regional review committee shall receive regular progress reports and financial statements on current and planned implementation of operational measures in, or significantly affecting, the sub-region concerned.</P>
      <P>Financial and written reports on the implementation of each operational programme under the CSF are being supplied regularly to the sub-regional review committees.  These are supplemented in most cases by oral reports and presentations by the representatives of lead Government Departments to the committees at their request.</P>
      <P>In addition composite financial tables entitled &ldquo;Breakdown of Structural Spending All Sub-regions&rdquo; are circulated to the sub-regional review committees twice per annum.  These show progress in implementing the CSF, broken down by operational programme, in actual terms for past years and on a forecast basis for future years.  The most recent edition of this booklet was issued to the committees in August 1991 and was placed in the Dáil Library on 16 September 1991 for the information of the Members of the Oireachtas.  It is proposed to issue a further edition shortly showing the outturn figures for the period ending June 1991 and forecasts for the remaining period of operation of the CSF.  Copies will be placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>As indicated in reply to Questions Nos. 25, 65 and 99 on 19 June 1990, it is not proposed to go beyond the requirements of the Community Support Framework and provide a breakdown of expenditure on a county basis.</P>

      <P>The residences in Killarney National Park are mostly located in the former Muckross Estate which was given to the nation as a gift by Senator Arthur Vincent in 1932.  The Bourn Vincent Memorial Park Act, 1932, gives statutory effect to the acceptance of the gift and to the conditions which apply to it.  One of these conditions prohibits the State from permanently disposing of any part of the estate and for this reason it would not be possible to dispose of any dwellings therein to any other party.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the majority of the residences are allocated to park employees by virtue of their being employed in the park and for the better performance of their duties.  The occupants are fully aware that the residences were allocated to them on the basis that they will be required to vacate the premises on their ceasing to be employed in the park or when requested to do so by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out however that retired park employees who wish to remain in occupation of their park accommodation <Col N="705" /> are facilitated when the residence in question is not required immediately for another employee or for other management purposes.</P>

    <P>The World Conservation Union defines a national park as &ldquo;a relatively large, outstanding natural area managed by a nationally-recognised authority to protect the ecological integrity of one or more ecosystems for this and future generations, and to eliminate any exploitation or intensive occupation of the area and to provide a foundation for spiritual, scientific, educational and tourism opportunities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The main criteria for selection and management of a national park are: (i) a relatively large area containing samples of major natural regions, features or scenery, and where plant and animal species, geomorphological sites and habitats are of special spiritual, scientific, educational and recreational interest. (ii) It contains one or more ecosystems that are not materially altered by human exploitation and occupation.  (iii) The highest competent authority has taken steps to prevent or eliminate, as soon as <Col N="706" /> possible, exploitation or occupation in the area and to enforce effectively the respect of ecological geomorphological or aesthetic features which have led to its establishment.  (iv) The ecosystems are managed so as to sustain tourism and educational activities on a controlled basis.  (v) The area is managed in a natural or near natural state; visitors enter under special conditions for inspirational, educational, cultural and recreational purposes; sport hunting is not permitted but culling for management purposes is an accepted practice.</P>

      <P>A total of four claims for compensation for damage to fisheries have been received by the Commissioners of Public Works, arising out of their works on the Bonet CDS.  Three of these claims have been settled and negotiations are ongoing in respect of the fourth.  As the settlements involved were comprehensive, including matters other than fisheries, it is not possible to give the amounts involved in respect of the fisheries aspects of the claims.  In any event, these are considered confidential between the Commissioners and the claimants.</P>

      <P>The aim of arterial drainage is to effect an overall improvement in conditions in a catchment, by reducing the incidence of flooding or waterlogging.  The provisions for the payment of compensation for any loss or damage arising as a result of the carrying out of arterial drainage schemes are contained in sections 14 to 17 and section 51 (2) of the Arterial Drainage Act 1945, a copy of which is available in the Dáil Library.  In the assessment of the amount of compensation payable regard is had to all relevant damages and benefits resulting from changes in the flow patterns of the rivers concerned.</P>

      <Col N="719" /> It is the responsibility of the prospective employer to apply for a work permit if he or she wishes to employ a non-EC national.</P>

    <P>My Department may also consult appropriate trades unions and professional and other bodies to ensure that no Irish/EC national is being deprived of employment by the granting of a work permit.  The current work permit policy is a very restrictive one and must be operated in that way, particularly when so many Irish people are unable to obtain employment.</P>
    <P>I understand from my Department that no employer has made an application for a work permit in respect of the person who is the subject of the question.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>I recently appointed independent consultants to carry out a technical-economic study into the feasibility of continuing operations at the Arigna power station by using a blend of local and imported coals as proposed to me by the Arigna Action Committee.  I expect the report will be finalised by Christmas, and after I have had an opportunity to examine it, I shall make a statement on the findings.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Arigna Task Force report, which was made public on 13 August, 1991, there is no reference in it to other reports being made public.  The task force report concerned itself with initiatives for job creation in the Arigna catchment area arising from the closure of the local mines and the ESB's decision to close the station in the future.</P>

      <P>The disabled persons maintenance allowance is a health board payment for people who are unable to work and who do not qualify for disability benefit from my Department.  The allowance is terminated at age 66.  The rate of disabled persons maintenance allowance for a married couple is higher than for an old age pensioner with a spouse under age 66.  A spouse over 66 is entitled to claim pension in his or her own right.  The question of streamlining the rates of payment for dependent spouses under these schemes is currently being examined in my Department.  However, because of the cost implications involved, any proposals in this area would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>My Department have two offices in Tullamore. One of these deals only with claims from the unemployed.  It is managed on a sub-contract or agency basis. The payments for the agency service include an allowance for the maintenance and upkeep of the premises.</P>
      <P>The second office has departmental staff whose main duty up to now has been investigative work.  There are facilities at this office for interviewing claimants and general advice and information can be obtained there.</P>
      <P>My Department are introducing a modernised and overhauled system of management at regional and local level. Recently a regional manager was appointed to cover the midlands area, including County Offaly.  Under the new system the provision of services at local level will be integrated and brought up to date.</P>
      <P>My Department are also bringing in new payment methods which will, in time, mean that persons will not have to attend local social welfare offices to receive their weekly payments.</P>
      <P>While the precise details for improved and more modern arrangements at Tullamore have not yet been defined, I am confident that the modernistion processes now under way will alleviate problems generally for persons who attend local offices.</P>

      <P>Social Welfare legislation provides for the assessment of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by an applicant for unemployment assistance.  In practice this generally means the value of free board and lodging and most often arises in the case of applicants living in the family home with their parents.  The assessment of free board and lodging has been a feature of the unemployment assistance scheme since its inception.  Its purpose is to achieve a degree of equity between applicants in different family circumstances.</P>
      <P>The value of free board and lodging enjoyed by an applicant is determined by reference to the parental income, for example, after deductions for tax, PRSI, union subscriptions, rent or mortgage payments and a parental allowance.  This is then allocated equally among the non-earning members of the household and becomes the assessment applied to any son or daughter who claims assistance. The maximum assessment that can be applied to any applicant is limited to 17 per cent of net parental income.  In the absence of any limit many applicants from families on average incomes with a low number of non-earners would not be entitled to any payment.</P>
      <P>The only thresholds as such which apply in the assessment of free board and lodging are those relating to parental allowances and the maximum limit on assessments.  The operation of the parental allowances was reviewed and revised in 1986 and in 1989, and the maximum limit was revised in 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this year's budget the position of unemployment assistance claimants with board and lodgings assessment was improved by the introduction of a minimum weekly payment of £5 for those claimants whose current entitlement is less that £5 and whose only means is the <Col N="726" /> yearly value of free board and lodgings at home.</P>
    <P>In cases where a parent declines to reveal his/her income, the circumstances of the applicant's residence in the family home, the occupation or business of the parents and any other material circumstances would be taken into consideration. It is a matter for the deciding officer, having regard to the facts placed before him/her, to assess the value of free board and lodging enjoyed by the applicant.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of a lone parent's allowance of £55 per week until 31 October 1991.  The amount payable comprised a personal rate of £27 per week and child dependant allowance of <Col N="727" /> £28 in respect of her two dependent children.</P>
      <P>The elder of these two children is no longer in full time education.  As a result, her rate of lone parent allowance had to be reduced by £14, which is the amount of the dependant allowance payable in respect of the child concerned.  This reduction was made with effect from 1 November 1991.  However, an administrative error occurred in making this reduction, which resulted in her being issued with a payment book at the rate of £13 per week in total.  Arrangements to correct this error have now been made. A replacement book for £41 has been issued to her local post office for collection, and payment, in Friday, 13 December.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is due arrears of £187.60 and arrangements have been made to have this cheque issued to her immediately.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a number of measures specifically designed to deal with the unauthorised taking of motor vehicles have been put into effect. These include legislative changes which considerably increased the penalties for this type of offence.  In addition, the Garda authorities deal with the problem by intensively patrolling areas at risk and by encouraging car owners to take precautions in parking vehicles and ensuring that they are locked and made as secure as possible when left unattended.  I am satisfied that these measures have proved to be effective in that statistics relating to the unauthorised taking of motor vehicles for 1990 indicate that the level of such taking has decreased by over 50 per cent since the problem peaked in 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that incidents involving, among other things, the burning of stolen cars have been of particular concern in certain urban areas recently. <Col N="731" /> An interdepartmental group has been brought together recently by the Government to look at difficulties being experienced in such areas and to make recommendations.  The group has already commenced its work.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 144 together.  The arrangement whereby my Department recoups to local authorities the full capital cost of approved major courthouse renovation projects was introduced only this year.  Under that arrangement a total of £23,000 has been recouped to Tipperary (South Riding) County Council to date in respect of professional fees related to the planning of Phase II of the Clonmel courthouse restoration project.  Phase I of the project predated the new arrangement and was financed by the county council them selves with the assistance of local loans fund borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building in question is one of a number of courthouses throughout the country which require renovation. Because of the limited availability of financial resources, priorities have to be <Col N="732" /> established between the different courthouses requiring attention.  I cannot indicate at this stage what priority can be given to Phase II of the project.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the indications are that there has been an increase in the level of indictable crime recorded in the Cork west Garda division so far this year by comparison with the same period in 1990.  They have also informed me that there has been a corresponding increase in the number of detections.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that a strategy to deal with the problems in the area has been drawn up by the divisional officer.  The House will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to go into details on precise Garda measures as to do so could be counterproductive. However, I can say that the strategy includes the frequent use of checkpoints at various locations at unpredictable intervals, the surveillance of suspects, the use of patrols and the targeting of Garda resources to meet specific needs in certain areas.  The number of gardaí assigned to the Cork west division has been increased this year by eight and the rural policing scheme has been introduced into one district in the division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that they have intensified their efforts <Col N="734" /> to encourage the public to take crime-prevention measures and are actively involved in the promotion of the neighbourhood watch and community alert programmes in the area.  There are now 38 community alert and three neighbourhood watch schemes operating successfully in the division and further schemes are in the process of being set up.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that all possible steps are being taken to deal with the problem.  The situation in the division is being monitored very carefully and the strategy adopted is being kept under constant review.</P>

      <P>Scott medals are awarded by the Garda Commissioner to members of the force who, in his opinion, have shown exceptional courage and heroism involving risk to life in the execution of their duty. Nominations for the award of Scott medals are made by Garda divisional officers to a reward board, established by the Commissioner, normally consisting of the two deputy commissioners and one assistant commissioner.  The board examines each case on its merits and makes recommendations to the Commissioner. The final decision in each case is a matter for the Commissioner and it would not be appropriate to me to intervene in any way.</P>

      <P>Laois County Council have submitted a preliminary proposal for the construction of an inner relief road in Mountmellick, along the route of national secondary road N80, and discussions regarding the proposal are taking place between the local authority <Col N="740" /> and my Department.  Subject to the outcome of these discussions, and without prejudice to any statutory procedures that may arise, funding for the project would have to be considered in the context of the funds available for improvements on national secondary roads generally and the competing demands for such funds.</P>
      <P>The cost of works on footpaths in Mountmellick falls to be met, in the case of the N80 from the local authority's maintenance grant for national secondary roads and, in the case of non-national roads, from the authority's own resources, supplemented by the discretionary road grants provided annually by my Department.  In 1991, the maintenance grants for national secondary roads to Laois County Council amount to £166,000 and discretionary road grants to the council amounted to £1,745,000. It is a matter for the council to settle the allocation of these grants to particular works.</P>
      <P>The submission of a revised preliminary report for the proposed Mountmellick sewerage scheme, based on the results of a survey of the existing sewer which has recently been completed, is awaited in my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose <Col N="741" /> to take Questions Nos. 154 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a contracting party to the EMEP Protocol to the UN ECE Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution.  This protocol is concerned with the collection and evaluation of data on a range of atmospheric pollutants, including acid rain precursors, in the entire ECE region.  Data collection is achieved through a network of strategically located sampling stations.  The meteorological station at Valentia Island is a designated EMEP station, and a second EMEP station is at present being set up in the Wicklow Mountains.</P>
      <P>In addition, the environmental research unit of my Department are involved in monitoring programmes, which include acid deposit monitoring, at locations covering the north, west, midlands and east of the country.  Reports on aspects of this work have been included in the publication &ldquo;Water Quality in Ireland &mdash; The Current Position&rdquo; (An Foras Forbartha), a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library.  The environmental research unit will shortly be updating this publication and in addition will publish a detailed report entitled &ldquo;Acid Sensitive Waters in Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The results of the various monitoring programmes do not indicate significant acid deposition in Ireland.  Further ECE research in relation to critical loads for acid deposition confirms that acidification does not pose a significant threat to Ireland's environment at present.</P>
      <P>It is nonetheless desirable to minimise acid deposition in Ireland and measures to be taken shortly will include accession to the Helsinki and Sofia Protocols to the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution and application of relevant EC directives on emissions from large combustion plant, vehicle emissions and fuel standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the debate on the ozone layer depletion held in this House on 15 November 1991.  The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone <Col N="743" /> Layer, as adjusted and amended at the meeting of the parties in London in June 1990, provides for the phasing out of certain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other substances by 1 January 2000.  EC Regulation 594/91 of 4 March 1991 requires the production and supply for sale of CFCs to be phased out within the Community by the earlier date of 1 July 1997, with similar provisions for carbon tetrachloride by 1 January 1998.</P>
      <P>We have already indicated our full support for the earlier phase-out date adopted by the EC for CFCs and carbon tetrachloride, given the threat that these substances pose to the ozone layer.  The Montreal Protocol will be reviewed next year and this is expected to lead to proposals for an even more accelerated phasing out of ozone depleting substances. This should be feasible within the industrialised countries at least, and Ireland would support such a proposal.</P>
      <P>My Department have had contact with Irish industries using CFCs and I welcome their positive response to the phase-out proposals.</P>

      <P>I have recently made building regulations which set out a series of requirements in relation to the design and construction of buildings, including requirements in relation to the conservation of fuel and energy.  The regulations will come into operation on 1 June 1992.  In addition, I have published 12 Technical Guidance Documents which give guidance on how the different requirements in the regulations may be met.  Copies of these are available in the Oireachtas Library.  The application of Technical Guidance Document L, which deals with the requirements relevant to the conservation of fuel and energy, should achieve an increase in insulation levels in buildings of up to 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>Methane has not been implicated to any significant extent in the depletion of the ozone layer.  Total emissions of methane from waste disposal sites in Ireland are estimated at 22,000 tonnes annually. Landfill gas, which has a methane content of about 50-60 per cent has potential for use as a fuel if it can be recovered and used in sufficient quantities.  There are currently about seven sites in Ireland which may have potential for landfill gas usage and there is a development proposal for one of these sites, in the Dublin area.  Gas migration controls have been installed at the main Cork city landfill site, and the gas is currently being flared. It is however intended to investigate developmental possibilities for this gas in 1992.</P>

      <P>The principle of self-sufficiency in waste disposal established within EC policy is that the community as a whole should become self-sufficient, with member states moving towards that aim individually, taking into account geographical circumstances or the need for specialised installations for certain types of waste. The Basel Convention (under UNEP auspices) on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal requires parties to ensure adequate disposal facilities to the extent possible and minimisation of transboundary movement of hazardous and other wastes, consistent with the environmentally sound and efficient management of such wastes.  The Basel Convention, however, clearly contemplates the transboundary movement of hazardous and other wastes if the State of export does not have the technical capacity or necessary facilities to dispose of the wastes in an environmentally sound and efficient manner.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 185, 186, 199, 200 and 201 together.</P>
      <P>A scheme for the Curlews by-pass is currently at design stage and an environmental impact statement is being prepared by Roscommon County Council. Pending a decision on the EIS, it would be premature to proceed with land acquisition. The proposed by-pass is unlikely to commence in the period up to the end of 1993.  Construction would take three years.</P>
      <P>Preliminary proposals for the Drumsna-Jamestown scheme were approved by my Department on 14 November 1989.  Subject to the outcome of the statutory procedures involved, the project is scheduled to commence in 1992 and to be completed in 1994.  A public local inquiry will open on 17 December into objections made against confirmation of the relevant compulsory purchase order.  Because of my quasi-judicial role in the determination of this order, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the scheme at this stage.</P>
      <P>The construction of a new dual carriageway between Carraroe and Collooney is scheduled to commence in 1992 but this is subject to both my decision in relation to the environmental impact statement submitted by Sligo County Council and the outcome of any statutory procedures that may arise in relation to the acquisition of land.  I will announce my decision in relation to this environmental impact statement as soon as possible. The duration of the scheme would be four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed new route from Carraroe to Collooney is being planned in association with Sligo Corporation's proposal to provide a new four lane single carriageway road &mdash; the Sligo relief road &mdash; from Michael Hughes Bridge to Carraroe. This project is at planning and design stage and an environmental impact statement is currently being prepared by Sligo Corporation.  Implementation is subject to both my decision in relation to the environmental impact statement and the outcome of any statutory procedures that may arise in relation to the acquisition of land.  The scheme is <Col N="758" /> unlikely to commence in the period to the end of 1993.  Construction would take three years.</P>
    <P>Work on the Kilcock, Maynooth, Leixlip by-pass will be undertaken in two main civil engineering contracts.  Contract one involves the provision of approximately 10 kilometres of two lane motorway, 1.3 kilometres of single lane carriageway, an interchange at Straffan Road, five other bridges and associated works on the line of the by-pass between the Maynooth-Celbridge Road and a point about 3 kilometres west of Kilcock. The acceptance of a tender was approved by my Department on 12 August 1991 and it is now a matter for Kildare County Council to complete legal formalities and get work under way.  Contract two will involve the balance of the civil engineering work.  Contract documents for this work are being examined by my Department with a view to an early invitation of tenders.</P>
    <P>A tender for the Mullingar by-pass was approved on 18 October 1991 and it is now a matter for Westmeath County Council to complete legal formalities and get work under way.</P>
    <P>A preliminary report for the Longford by-pass was approved by my Department on 10 April 1990.  The project is scheduled to commence in 1992 and to be completed in 1994.  A public local inquiry has been held into objections made against the confirmation of the relevant compulsory purchase order and I hope to be in a position to give my decision on the order at an early date.  Having regard to my quasi-judicial role in the matter, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further in the matter.</P>

While it would be possible to consider approving standard grants of £700 per house and £500 per farm, it would not be practicable for my Department to contribute further to this high unit-cost scheme in present budgetary circumstances.</P>

      <P>The proposal that there should be a recognised grade of auxiliary dental worker legally entitled to design, fit and make artificial dentures for the public and to do so independently of the registered dental practitioner has been in existence for very many years.</P>
      <P>In 1982, the Restrictive Practices Commission issued a report on their inquiry into the statutory restrictions on the provision of dental prostheses.  The majority of the Commission recommended that the existing legislation should be amended so that the general prohibition on the carrying out of dentistry by a non-dentist would not apply to the supply of dentures to a person aged 18 or over, provided it did not involve work on living tissue.</P>
      <P>A provision was included in the 1985 Dentists Act which would allow the Dental Council to bring forward a scheme which would enable the Commission's recommendations to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1989 the Dental Council examined <Col N="765" /> the need for denturists and came out against their introduction.  The Minister for Health then met with the President of the Council and asked that the council take an objective look at the need to establish here a class of denturist such as already exists in some European countries and in many other countries.</P>
    <P>This review was carried out by the council as requested and a number of strategies were considered but no recommendation was made.  As I indicated on 19 November 1991 in reply to a Question from Deputy Allen I will be meeting the President of the Dental Council shortly to discuss the establishment of a scheme for denturists as auxiliary dental workers under the Dentists Act, 1985.</P>

      <P>The information in the format sought <Col N="770" /> by the Deputy is not available to my Department.  As I indicated to the House recently I am concerned to ensure that action is taken to tackle the most pressing problems in this area.</P>
      <P>As a first step, I consider it vital that accurate and reliable data is available to my Department from all the agencies concerned.  In this context the Deputy will be aware that the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, under the chairmanship of Professor David Kennedy, focused on the management and review of waiting lists and general strategies to improve waiting times for treatment.  The group in their recently published report recommended that a number of important steps should be taken as follows; comprehensive, standardised information should be maintained and reviewed by each hospital concerning the numbers and types of patients awaiting admission; validation to establish meaningful waiting list data should be adopted as a firm policy in each hospital and that such policies ensure that appropriate management and clinical action is taken on foot of such reviews; hospitals should carry out bulk postal reviews of waiting lists where patients have been on waiting lists for more than an agreed period of time; hospitals should target lists by ensuring that explicit account is taken of waiting times of scheduling admissions, including theatre lists, and that specialty teams have reasonable activity targets to guide their attempts to minimise waiting by patients.</P>
      <P>The group have recently been re-convened and part of their new remit is to pursue the implementation of the recommendations in relation to waiting lists in the Dublin hospitals.  In addition, health boards and hospital authorities in the area outside of Dublin have been asked by my Department to consider the good practice recommendations contained in the report and to report back to my Department on their plans for the implementation of the recommendations, including those in relation to waiting lists.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the consultant orthodontist with the Eastern Health Board recently submitted her resignation to the board.</P>
      <P>The provision and management of the orthodontic services in the Eastern Health Board area is a matter for the board in the first instance.  The board did appoint a full time consultant orthodontist in May 1991 but apart from this the Eastern Health Board had greatly extended their orthodontic service in the past three years through arrangements with a number of consultant and specialist orthodontists.  The Eastern Health Board have for some years had an arrangement with the Dublin Dental Hospital for the provision of consultant orthodontic services.</P>
      <P>Some 2,250 patients completed treatment in 1990 and 3,660 patients are currently receiving treatment.  These increased service levels will not be affected by the resignation of the consultant orthodontist.</P>

      <P>The charges apply after 30 days continuous hospitalisation or after several periods totalling 30 days within the previous 12 months.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that on 30 May 1991 my predecessor informed the Dáil that he proposed to have a review carried out of these regulations because of a number of problems which have emerged in respect of their applications.  This review is at present being carried out.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 226, 227 and 228 together.  St. Mary's Hospital, Castlebar serves as an in-patient psychiatric facility for the population of County Mayo.  At present there are 363 patients accommodated at the hospital.  In line with the report of the study group on the development of psychiatric services, &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; published in 1984, the development of community based facilities for the care of the mentally ill in County Mayo has accelerated in recent years.  This has led to a decline in the number of patients in St. Mary's Hospital and an increase in the number <Col N="776" /> receiving care and treatment in community settings.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the report &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; the Western Health Board have brought into operation from psychiatric day centres, two day hospitals, 12 hostels and a community workshop in County Mayo as part of their programme to develop community based psychiatric facilities.  The reduction of in-patient numbers in St. Mary's Hospital from 583 in 1984 to the current figure of 363 is mainly accounted for by the provision of these facilities.</P>
      <P>I understand that the health board's programme of development of community facilities in County Mayo is set to continue in 1992.  This will lead to a further decrease of in-patient numbers in St. Mary's Hospital by the transfer of patients to facilities which are more appropriate to their needs.</P>
      <P>It will be necessary however to ensure that in-patient facilities for County Mayo are available in the years ahead and St. Mary's Hospital is expected to continue to provide such facilities.</P>
      <P>The statistical information requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>

      <P>The latest consultant manpower survey carried out by Comhairle na nOspidéal on 1 May 1991 indicates that there were 1,046 consultants employed at that date in the public health services of whom some 140 or 13.4 per cent of the total were female.  The report further indicates that 236 consultant surgeons were employed of whom six or 2.5 per cent of the total were female.</P>
      <P>While some progress has been made towards achieving a more equitable male-female ratio in overall consultant employment, as evidenced by the appointment of an additional ten female consultants since 1 May 1990, an increase of 7.7 per cent as recorded by the report of Comhairle na nOspidéal, it is apparent that a good deal of progress remains to be made, particularly in the surgical specialties.</P>
      <P>The role of my Department in securing such progress is in monitoring adherence to equal opportunities legislation in relation to recruitment procedures, and in encouraging the professional bodies and employers to ensure that any perceived obstacles to progress are removed.</P>

An additional provision of teachers is made related to remedial teaching, special curricular needs and generally in relation to particular areas of disadvantage.  There are some 100 teachers allocated under these special arrangements at both the primary and post-primary levels.</P>
      <P>Such allocations are made to schools on the basis of need and priority following full investigation of the situation in all areas.  The Deputy may be assured that the needs of schools in the Dublin districts to which he refers receive the fullest consideration in determining the allocation of teachers under these special arrangements.</P>
      <P>Improvements have been effected in the pupil/teacher ratio in the current year under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and I am satisfied that the arrangements for the allocation of teaching posts achieves the most equitable distribution of the teaching resources available to schools.</P>

      <P>In relation to (a), there is no question of a reduction in the service at present being provided to particular clinical groups, as will be seen from my predecessor's reply to Question No. 71 on 30 October 1991.</P>
      <P>With regard to (b), I take it the Deputy is referring to the committee to review the 1972 report on The Education of Hearing Impaired Children.  The position here is that the report of the Primary Education Review Body recommended the establishment of a special committee to examine and report on special education generally and such a committee has now been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the committee's brief includes consideration <Col N="789" /> of all children with special needs, including those with hearing impairment, it was decided that it would be inappropriate that two such review groups should function at the same time. Instead, it has been arranged that the group with the broader remit will proceed and that submissions to the committee on hearing impaired children will be considered as contributions to the wider study.  It is intended, also, that the latter committee can resume their deliberations when the special committee has reported.</P>

      <P>Under the Defence Forces (Pensions) schemes, a soldier's pension consists of: (a) a basic pension in respect of 21 years' qualifying service; (b) in the case of soldiers discharged on or after 1 August 1990, and subject to certain conditions, an addition to basic pension in respect of military service allowance of 40 per cent of the rate of that allowance; (c) where the qualifying service is 31 or more years the addition referred to at (b) is increased to 50 per cent of the rate of the military service allowance; and (d) an additional increment of £3.28 a week in respect of each year of qualifying service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years.</P>
      <P>The basic pension and the addition at (b) in respect of military service allowance are paid for life.  When the pensioner becomes entitled to a social welfare retirement pension at age 65 or a contributory old age pension at age 66, the additional increment at (d) and the 50 per cent addition in respect of military service allowance at (c) no longer apply.</P>
      <P>These arrangements are in accordance with the principle of co-ordinating occupational pensions in the public sector with social welfare entitlements in the case of employees who are fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts. The addition in respect of military service allowance flows from a recommendation of the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces, which did not, however, recommend any change in the arrangements regarding the additional increment at (d).</P>

      <P>While I am prepared to consider this case sympathetically, I cannot agree to the exemption sought in view of my responsibility to ensure the orderly use of the radio frequency spectrum.  As the Deputy knows, equipment used by people without a basic knowledge of radio could cause social and international interference. However, because of the Deputy's special interest in this case and because of the person's disability, I have arranged for an examination in radio and equipment use in his own home for the person mentioned.</P>

      <P>In the course of my consideration of proposals for the liberalisation of the bus industry, I have put in place liaison arrangements between my Department and all the interested parties to elicit the widest range of views in relation to the future development of the bus industry. Officials of my Department have had discussions with Córas Iompair Éireann, the Private Association of Motor Bus Owners (PAMBO), the Federation of Transport Operators (FOTO), the Irish Transporters Consociate, the State Licensed Operators Group, the Irish Congress of Trade unions and the National Rail and Bus Workers Union.  I receive regular progress reports on discussions with all these parties.  I will meet <Col N="795" /> with interested parties myself as appropriate.</P>
      <P>I expect to be in a position to submit detailed proposals for a Bill to the Government shortly.  One of the major objectives of the proposals will be to improve the levels and quality of bus services available to the general public and to introduce competition into the bus industry on a sensible and orderly basis. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific aspects of the proposals in advance of their consideration by the Government.</P>
