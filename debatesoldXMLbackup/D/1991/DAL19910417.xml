      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 4, 5, 13 and 14.  It is also proposed that under Standing Order 41 statements shall be made at 3.45 p.m. in connection with the special informal European Council meeting in Luxembourg.  By agreement, there will be no Private Members' Business this week.</P>

      <P>I want to put it on the record that it was agreed at the Whips meeting that Fine Gael would take Private Members' Business this week and it was only subsequent to that meeting <Col N="2" /> that they unilaterally decided not to take up that time.  I wish to protest at the loss of this valuable time.  Private Members' Business is a very scarce commodity in this House particularly for our group.  I regret that this valuable time is not taken up by parties when it is available to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate that the Order of Business allows for statements to be made at 3.45 p.m. on the special informal European Council meeting held last week on the Middle East situation and the plight of the Kurds, events have moved on since then, particularly the statement made by President Bush last night.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that we need more than just statements in this House on these issues.  Would the Taoiseach agree to a much fuller debate on these issues, after discussion by the Whips.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek information from the Taoiseach in relation to Item 10 on today's Order Paper and the setting up of a foreign affairs committee.  I understand that decisions in regard to the setting up of a select committee on crime and a select committee on foreign affairs have now effectively been taken out of the hands of the Whips and will be decided on by the Taoiseach.  May I ask the Taoiseach if it is his intention to set up these committees during this session?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the number of questions down to the Taoiseach &mdash; I think there are 40 &mdash; it is obvious that questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs will not be reached today.  May I ask if we will have to wait for another two months before we can ask questions of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or can some special arrangement be made whenever there are an inordinate number of questions down to the Taoiseach and a Minister cannot, therefore, be questioned on particular matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we have ever had a situation where 40 questions were put down to the Taoiseach.  There are no two ways about it.  They will not all be answered today.  I am just asking if some provision will be made to bring forward questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, rather than us having to wait another two months.</P>

      <P>When will various Ministers publish legislation which this House can work with during this long session?  Does the Taoiseach not agree that the programme available to us at this stage is very scarce?  There are no more than seven or nine items of legislation, the majority of which are at a very advanced stage.  Four items are at Committee Stage.

In relation to the Housing Bill, is the Taoiseach or the Minister for the Environment aware that there is rampant confusion because the policies announced in the programme on housing have not yet been enacted, nor the necessary circular sent to the local authorities?</P>

      <P>I am sure we will have more substantial matters to dispute. However, the serious issue involved is that this legislation to regularise the position regarding fishing and rod licences has been a very long time coming.  There is a very anomalous situation at the moment whereby the old legislation is still in place and a blind eye is being turned to its enforcement.  Even those of us who are unhappy about the Bill had hoped legislation would have been put in place to regularise the position before this year's fishing season.  I have a copy of the Bord Fáilte publication, <i>Ireland of the Welcomes</i> March-April 1991, which shows a gentleman and his dog heading out to fish, no doubt intended to give the impression that Ireland is all ready for the fishing season this year.  I do not see sticking out of the man's pocket a rod licence or share certificate in a co-operative. The only thing missing is an indication that the position regarding fishing this season has not been regularised.  It is not going to be regularised before this summer.</P>

      <P>Section 2 which deals with the bringing into effect of the legislation is what I am addressing.  My point is that this legislation is not going to be in place for this year's fishing season. That is a matter of regret to me certainly and the Minister, and the Government, have to take responsibility for that.</P>

      <P>I support fully the thrust of the amendment.  I agree with the last speaker's views that it is a little unfortunate that we are moving forward only because the lack of this legislation has impeded the tourist industry and the hotel industry over the past three years since the fishing licence issue first arose. Like the last speaker and as an angler I am glad the legislation is before us, but I cannot understand why it took so long to do such a simple job.  No matter what we say at this stage, the season is already well in progress and will be well advanced before the Bill is passed.  If there is a lesson to learn from the entire affair it is that if a mistake is made we should take the corrective measures at an earlier stage and not wait until damage is done before we decide to climb down, do a Uturn or whatever is usually done in such situations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">

      <P>This amendment is specific in that it signifies a date, a time. I support it because since 1987 we have had this legislation, which everyone has agreed was bad.  It should have been <Col N="20" /> amended earlier.  I regret the Minister has said &ldquo;rubbish&rdquo;.  It is not rubbish. It is a fact of life that hoteliers, anglers, the general public and our image abroad have suffered.  This amendment specifies a day by which to have this legislation amended and through the Dáil.  Had common sense prevailed in 1987 we would not have this mess.  The amendment states &ldquo;not later than the 30th of April&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The matter is like <i>The Forsyte Saga</i> in that it is continuing session after session, year after year.  Again, I regret the Minister has said &ldquo;rubbish&rdquo; to the amendment and to the co-operation he has received.  I agree with Deputy Gilmore when he said that if simple amending legislation had been brought forward it would have been out of the way long before now and we would be back to where we were prior to 1987, and looking for co-operation from angling groups in order to promote angling as one of our greatest tourist attractions.  In my view 30 April is a satisfactory date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Members on this side have drawn the Minister's attention to the anomalous position we find ourselves in at the beginning of a very important fishing and tourist season.  The fishing season starts around 30 April.  Certainly, at the beginning of May, one of the most important angling festivals takes place with mayfly fishing.  Yet, as my colleagues have pointed out, we find ourselves in the middle of April with no legislation that will indicate to local and visiting anglers here what are their legal entitlements. We are in limbo with regard to legislation. I appeal to the Minister to consider what is being put forward by other Members.  The amendment is the most definite, satisfactory and adequate way to deal with this, considering the deadline we face and the unsatisfactory legislation being introduced to replace other unsatisfactory legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We fear this legislation will not remove the difficulties, anomalies or frustrations that have been expressed about this Bill by the angling groups.  We will face more confusion and rejection of the Bill.  I <Col N="21" /> appeal to the Minister to deal effectively with this by repealing the legislation and giving more thought to the response to this Bill from the angling fraternity and sorority.  I am attempting to point out in amendment No. 6 that the Bill is running late.</P>
    <P>There is tremendous dissatisfaction and the Opposition parties have the greatest fears about the acceptance and full implementation of the Bill.  It has a sad history which we do not wish to repeat.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this amendment which is designed to deal with the deadlines with regard to the fishing and tourism season this year. People will face great difficulties if they are not able to advise visiting anglers of the exact legal position.  The Minister should take the amendment very seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I said at the outset that I very much appreciated that Deputy Branes, in tabling this amendment, intended to show an urgency with regard to the Bill.  Immediately the Bill is passed by both Houses and signed by the President its provisions will come into effect. This Bill is the fruit of long, detailed and punctilious conversations with the whole angling fraternity and sorority, as Deputy Barnes correctly puts it.  The question of acceptance does not arise.</P>
      <P>With regard to my stating that what Deputy Gilmore was saying was rubbish, the following is my reason.  A licence is something imposed from above.  The structure which I have built into this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives them specifically the power in the co-operative to decide whether a share certificate is needed.  If <Col N="22" /> the Deputy is anxious to have this whole matter expedited, I would ask him to read section 3 which provides that a licence under the Principal Act shall not be required for trout or coarse fishing. That is the next section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make some brief remarks particularly in the light of the Minister's last contribution.  This section states that a licence under the Principal Act shall not be required for angling for trout or coarse fish.  I agree absolutely with this provision and I do not believe it would be opposed by anybody on this side of the House.  If the Minister agrees to withdraw the rest of the Bill and perhaps reintroduce its provisions at some later stage in another Bill, he can walk away after section 3 has been passed with a Bill which he can put to the Seanad and send to the President for signature.  It would then be enacted in time for this year's tourist season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the most significant section of the Bill since it abolishes the rod licence. This is the section we have been waiting for.  The controversy will be over.  The <Col N="23" /> sections putting in place the co-operative system, the backdoor method of introducing charges for fishing by the issue of share certificates are, the Minister claims, the result of very detailed discussions.  It is a clumsy compromise which will become unworkable.  I can agree with section 3 and am quite happy to leave it at that.</P>
    <P>The 1987 Act provides that people going to fish must have a licence.  That legislation is in a bizarre, unprecedented state of limbo in that it has been effectively suspended.  A nod and wink arrangement has been arrived at between the Government and the enforcement agencies indicating that they are to turn a blind eye to it.  The Minister has acknowledged that the legislation before us will not be in place before this year's tourist season.  Even if it were passed today the procedures for establishing co-operatives, issuing share certificates and so on could not possibly be put in place. The Minister should state clearly the legal position regarding people going out to fish this year.  Are they required to have a rod licence in the summer of 1991?  Will there be prosecutions in respect of people who do not have rod licence?  Will the fisheries officers enforce the 1987 Act?  It would be preferable if the Minister would agree simply to abolish the rod licence. The questions of establishing co-operatives, dealing with share certificates and the wider development of fisheries could be returned to at a later stage.  The advantage would be that for 1991 the position would be regularised and we would not have the bad example of legislation on the Statute Book not being enforced at the nod and wink of the Government and the Minister responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to leave this section intact and to abolish the rest of the Bill.  In 1989 I introduced, on behalf of the Labour Party, a Bill providing specifically for the abolition of the rod licence.  The Minister stated that he had discussions and negotiations with the angling groups.  We also have had discussions and we are aware <Col N="24" /> that these groups, having looked very carefully at the proposed legislation, have grave reservations about some aspects. Since 1987 we have continued down this road.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us abolishes the licence for coarse and trout fishing.  That is the kernel of the Bill; the rest is bureaucratic padding designed to create more confusion for angling groups and inland fisheries people.  The fisheries boards will become the gamekeepers because they will have to enforce the legislation.  They must decide whether to enforce the 1987 Bill or wait for this new Bill to come into force.  Angling is in limbo and we do not know where we are going.</P>
      <P>The Minister would be doing a tremendous job if at this stage he agreed to the suggestion.  We could pass the Bill in five minutes, walk out of the House and say we have done what we set out to do, we have amended the legislation.  The Minister having discussed this at length will I am sure understand the feelings that are running high in angling groups. The Minister would be tackling the kernel of the problem by abolishing the licence for coarse and trout fishing.  As I have said previously, that is the way forward and it would be very productive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>As other Members on this side of the House have said, section 3 is the kernel of the Bill.  It allows us to reach a consensus on resources for development that is not there at present. I have no problem with section 3.  If we stopped the Bill at this point we would be saving a lot of time and an immense amount of trouble.  The remainder of the Bill will not give the Minister, or his Department, the resources for the development to which we are all committed.</P>
      <P>As other Members have said, we are in a difficult position in that we are into the fishing season of 1991.  Further consultation would allow us to take all aspects into consideration.  I am sure the Minister has been told in the course of his consultations that the fisheries boards are not in a position without further resources from his Department to take part in overseeing, regularising and developing inland angling to which they are committed.  We may be over optimistic in asking the Minister to accept our views on section 3 and apply them to the rest of the Bill but that could be the beginning of building a consensus which is so badly needed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 33 to 36, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Fishery co-operative societies may be established in each fisheries region to promote the development of trout or coarse fisheries or both in a specified area in the region, and such co-operative societies shall be registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in replying to our discussion on section 3, spoke about the thrust of this Bill being the establishment of co-operatives, contending that it would enable anglers themselves to control the overall position, leading to greater democracy and so on.  The general theme of the Minister's contribution right through this Bill has been that he was allowing anglers to have control, to set up co-operatives.  All the fine language of the co-operative movement &mdash; comhar na gcomharsan and so on &mdash; has been drawn down to justify the position he has taken.  However, the first line of section 4 tells us who is going to establish the co-operatives.  It is very clear from that section that the co-operatives will not be established by the anglers themselves but by the Minister. Section 4 states:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall by order establish in each fisheries region one or more fisheries co-operative societies....</P>
      <P>That defeats the whole principle of the co-operative movement.  The very essence of the co-operative movement is that co-operatives are established voluntarily by the interests themselves.  How can you have a co-operative established from on high?  How do you establish a co-operative by order?  These are not co-operatives; they are bodies, they are some kind of extension of the Minister's arm which he is establishing in each fisheries region for the purpose of raising money.  This is about abolishing the rod licence.  The Minister needs a vehicle to raise money by a different name so he establishes for himself a toe hold in each fisheries region and calls it a co-operative. He thinks that by calling it a co-operative it will be publicly more acceptable and easier to sell and he dresses it up in all the fine language of the co-operative movement.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 in my name will call the Minister's bluff.  If we are to have co-operatives let them be co-operatives.  My amendment states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fishery co-operative societies may be established in each fisheries region to promote the development of trout or coarse fisheries or both in a specified <Col N="31" /> area in the region, and such co-operative societies shall be registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies.</P>
    <P>That is how co-operatives are established: they are established voluntarily by people in industry, by people in agriculture, by people in any walk of life. These people come together, establish a co-operative, draw up rules and register it with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, who is established for the purpose of registering bodies such as co-operatives. He looks at their rules, approves them and agrees to register them.  That is the way co-operatives are established, not by ministerial order.  I am saying in this amendment that if this Bill is about more than simply abolishing the rod licence &mdash; which is clear from the Minister's contribution on the last section &mdash; and that we want to establish co-operatives, I would have no problem with that; I am very much in favour of the establishment of co-operatives.  It would be very much part and parcel of my political philosophy that we have co-operatives established in any walk of life&mdash;&mdash;</P>

You cannot have a co-operative established by ministerial order because that defeats the purpose.  If the Minister wants co-operatives he can have co-operatives, but they must be established in the way we all understand co-operatives are established, voluntarily, by the interests themselves and registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies in the normal way.  Let us forget about this business of the Minister establishing co-operatives by ministerial order.</P>

      <P>This section provides for the establishment of co-operative societies in the regions and is in accordance with item No. 1 of the formula I worked out with the anglers.  Subsection (1) <Col N="32" /> provides for one or more societies to be established in each fisheries region.  I have tabled an amendment to subsection (2) about the title and it will be covered by rule.  Subsection (3) provides for an order made under subsection (1) to be revoked or amended.  Subsection (4) enables the societies to be exempt from payment of tax and expend all their funds on the purposes for which they have been established.  Subsection (5) provides for trustees to be appointed to manage the societies when they are established, in accordance with item No. 8 of the formula of settlement worked out with the groups of anglers.  Subsection (6) empowers the Minister to fill any vacancies which may arise among the appointed trustees.  That, of course, relates to the trustees in the interregnum, in the period between the establishment and the democratic elections to the boards of management.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore talked about the Minister establishing the co-operatives.  As I repeated over and again, the anglers told me they were anxious to have a vehicle through which they could contribute to the development and protection of fisheries. They were their words to me.  As I mentioned, and have now written into the record of the House, the co-operatives are being set up in accordance with the articles of agreement which were drawn up.  Nobody is exercising any compulsion on persons to be members of co-operatives. Membership will be voluntary. I cannot understand the idea that somehow or other it is being imposed upon them when the anglers are anxious to have these co-operatives for the purposes I have mentioned, namely, the protection and development of fisheries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that the co-operatives will be voluntary but I do not think that will be the case, nor do the anglers to whom I have spoken.  A number of questions have been posed regarding the setting up of these co-operatives.  What role will the fisheries boards play in the setting up of the co-operatives?  Like Deputy Gilmore, my idea of a co-operative is something <Col N="33" /> coming from the community, something voluntary and not set up by ministerial order.  The Minister emphasised that there will be a voluntary commitment by angling clubs and that they have asked for some vehicle through which to contribute. Angling groups have contributed enormously over the years because it is in their interest to do so.  What was sadly lacking was that, despite their contribution, there was no co-ordinated effort by the Department of the Marine to do something positive.  There was no advertising and nothing was done to bring the angling groups together.  They agree they must contribute and will do so on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>The amendment before us is very important.  It provides that these voluntary co-operatives must not be affected by ministerial order, and that is the whole thrust of the argument this morning.  I have spoken to some of the groups, as I am sure has the Minister, who have outlined very serious points of consideration. For instance, how many co-operatives is it envisaged will be set up? I know that is a mathematical problem which the Minister probably cannot go into, but the rules and regulations governing co-operatives have not been spelled out clearly.  Deputy Gilmore's amendment would bring the co-operatives within the realm of friendly societies, which would be very important.  A proper structure could then be set up whereby the co-operatives would be controlled and operated through the friendly societies.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that trustees would be appointed in the interim and would be democratically elected later.  In theory that is acceptable but in practice it may not work out very well.  I hope the Minister will practise what he preaches as regards the voluntary aspect.  If there is any coercion by the Minister or the Department it will dissuade those people who have co-operated so far.  This is a very important amendment because it would lay the ghost once and for all that the Minister has a heavy-handed input into the setting up of these co-operatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael position is that co-operatives are an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy.  There are structures in existence that can be expanded and financed to deal competently with the question of the contribution of anglers and the development of inland fishing by, for example, the fisheries boards and the angling clubs.  The amendment by Deputy Gilmore seems to be a true concept of our understanding of co-operative societies.  The section as it stands leaves many unanswered questions and a lot of ground uncovered.  For instance, how will the Minister and the Department define the role and authority of the fisheries boards <i>vis-à-vis</i> the co-operatives?</P>
      <P>I would repeat the question asked by Deputy O'Sullivan with regard to subsection (1) because it is very important: what will be the criteria under which the Minister will establish one or more co-operatives?  If it is left completely to the discretion of the Minister will the anglers and the regional fisheries boards have any say?  Will their experience and expertise be called on or will it be totally at the discretion of the Minister?  There is a huge, vague area in regard to subsection (1).  If there is even a perception by anglers in certain regions that the Minister is imposing this we will run into all the difficulties which led to the former Bill being rejected.  The anglers want to feel that they have autonomy, independence and indeed an acknowledgment of the contribution they will make regarding the future development of angling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore's amendment clarifies some of the questions in relation to this section.  It says that fishery co-operative societies may be established in each fishery region to promote the development of trout, coarse fisheries, or both, in a specified area in the region and that such co-operative societies shall be registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  In this amendment Deputy Gilmore is endeavouring to return to what the Minister himself said should be the whole foundation and concept of co-operatives, a willingness, a coming <Col N="35" /> together, an agreement, a consensus and, particularly, sharing of decisions and authority.  That whole concept which underlines co-operatives, as we know and accept them, would be completely undermined if that is done on the authority of the Minister and if it is at his discretion as to what numbers shall be set up, how they will act, etc.</P>
    <P>There are more pressing questions in relation to the following subsections. What will be the autonomy of the members and of each co-operative society <i>vis-à-vis</i> the authority of the Minister? Will they be established and run within their own shared agreement as to how a co-operative should operate in a specific area?  Will there be an overall imposition of ministerial orders which may not allow co-operatives within certain regions with particular demographic needs?  Will they be able to operate in an independent and autonomous way as the co-operative see fit?  Will they be part of the region and not part of a national or Department of the Marine authority?</P>
    <P>The autonomy of the members must be defined and I hope the Minister will respond in that regard.  Under subsection (6), the Minister may appoint the persons to fill vacancies among the trustees so designated and may remove any such trustee from office.  The Minister, in his reply to Deputy Gilmore's amendment, indicated that his appointment of trustees and the powers exercised in this section by the Minister over such trustees, would be exercised only during the interim period to allow the co-operatives to be established, to be democratic and to use their own powers of election in regard to their own trustees, shareholders and all the other structures which co-operatives now exercise fully and independently within themselves.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable conflict between the proposed ministerial orders and directions, the whole foundation and concept of a co-operative society, the independent running of each co-operative society to the best of their ability within their region and what they <Col N="36" /> should be allowed to do.  Therefore, the whole section is under question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that angling clubs and groups have substantially contributed to the development of angling.  I have never missed an opportunity to put on record my appreciation of the clubs for what they have done in the past, what they do, and what, I presume, they will do in the future.  A careful reading of the Bill will indicate how much importance is attached to, and special provision made for, clubs.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Barnes' contribution, it is a much more simplified process under the Fisheries Acts to establish the co-operatives than by any other method and it was purely for the purpose of simplification it was introduced in this way.  Deputy Barnes also mentioned the regional boards which, of course, have their own statutory existence and duties laid down in law.  I am glad they have got substantially increased funding from me as Minister for the Marine.  Deputy Barnes asked a highly relevant question about the autonomy of the co-operatives; their autonomy is absolute, they will make the decisions &mdash; very important ones &mdash; as stated in the Bill for their co-operative areas.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise that the trustees originally appointed will hold office only until such time as the committees of management have been elected by individual co-operatives.  It is important to remember that.  There is provision for two members out of seven of the board of management to be appointed by the Minister. However, in the universe of discourse mentioned by Deputy Barnes, we were referring to the interim trustees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to two contributions from the Minister on this amendment; may be I have missed a critical comment he made but I must confess I still do not know his position in relation to my amendment.  Are we getting the standard rejection of an Opposition <Col N="37" /> amendment or is there scope for the Minister to accept it?  I should like the Minister to directly address the question.</P>
      <P>We have all made our comments in relation to the Bill but nobody in the House is opposed to the idea of co-operatives being established.  The amendment means that co-operatives may be established. The issue between us is twofold. One is in relation to how they will be established.  The Minister's formula is that they will be established by ministerial order but there does not seem to be any discretion in that because the Bill states the Minister shall, by order, establish in each fisheries region one or more fisheries co-operatives, etc.  My reading is that irrespective of whether the clubs, the anglers or the fisheries board in a particular region went a co-operative the Minister shall, by order, establish a co-operative in that region.  That seems to defeat the principle of the whole idea of a co-operative and, as an alternative, I suggest in my amendment that we should go back to the voluntary essence of the co-operative idea, that if the angling clubs, the anglers or the fisheries boards in a particular region, or part of a region, want to establish a co-operative they can do so and register it in the normal way.</P>
      <P>The second area about which there may be a difference of opinion is the question of the primary purpose of these co-operatives.  The Minister's formula says that co-operatives will be established to raise and disburse funds.  My formula is that fishery co-operatives should be established to promote the development of trout and coarse fisheries which does not preclude the co-operatives raising money.  If, as the Minister says, there are angling clubs straining at the leash to contribute to the development of fisheries, there would be no obstacle to those clubs doing so and making those contributions in the way I have proposed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know, first, if the Minister is accepting or opposing my amendment, and if he is opposing it, can he clarify what section 4 (1) of the Bill means?  Does it mean, as I believe it to mean, that whether the clubs want it or <Col N="38" /> not in a particular region, the Minister will set up co-operatives?  If that is his intention, is he not setting up some kind of a closed shop arrangement?  I have some experience of closed shops and know some of the pitfalls involved in such arrangements.  I know, for example, that there is a whole body of law dealing with the right to be or not to be a member.  If the Minister is going to set up by order a co-operative in every fishery region and then at a later stage of the Bill everybody who wants to go out and fish has to purchase a share certificate in that co-operative, is that not a closed shop, and is there not a legal difficulty, having regard to all of the legal precedents that exist about closed shops and the right not to belong and so on?  Will this not be open to legal challenge by somebody who says that they want to fish but do not want to belong to a co-operative, that they have a right not to belong and the right not to purchase a shares certificate?  Will this legislation not therefore come down like a house of cards?  We have to decide whether these co-operatives are voluntary bodies.  I have no problem with that.  I am quite happy to have a co-operative established on a voluntary basis, and that is what my amendment is about.  Are they voluntary bodies or are they, as I understand the Bill to mean, bodies being imposed by ministerial order which will result in a closed shop situation and a possible legal challenge to the entire legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting the amendment.  With regard to the establishment of co-operatives, I indicated time and time again to this House that the decision to establish them was made as a result of the anxiety of anglers to have some method, other than by paying a licence fee, to contribute to the development and protection of fisheries. Deputy Gilmore read selectively &ldquo;to raise and disburse&rdquo; but he did not continue with &ldquo;for the public benefit&rdquo; or &ldquo;funds for the development of trout and coarse fisheries&rdquo;.  The co-operatives are being offered as something which is desired by <Col N="39" /> the anglers to enable them to develop their sport.</P>

      <P>I received a number of communications in regard to the form of name proposed to be adopted for the individual co-operative societies being set up under the Bill. The burden of the representations was that it might cause confusion within existing fisheries co-operative societies.  As the House knows, there are many co-operatives in the sea fisheries sector.  My idea in taking subsection (2) out of the Bill is lest there be confusion within the existing fisheries co-operatives societies.

      <P>I am glad the Minister decided to delete the name of the society.  I hope now they will not be called co-operatives as, whatever they are, they are not co-operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 deals with subsection (3) which says that the Minister may by order revoke or amend an order made under this section.  In other words, the Minister may set up a co-operative under subsection (1) and if he sees fit under subsection (3) he may dissolve it. This issue is very much in line with what we have been talking about for most of the morning, that the co-operatives do not have autonomy or independence, and <Col N="42" /> that they are effectively extensions of the Minister's will.  If the Minister does not like what a co-operative are doing he could, under this subsection, revoke the order and effectively abolish the co-operative, or amend the order changing the rules or do any of the things Ministers tend to do when they do not like how autonomous bodies are behaving.  The Minister could decide to reduce the membership of a co-operative or change the number of trustees.  In fact, the Minister could do anything under this subsection.</P>
    <P>We should stop calling these bodies co-operatives since the Minister has successfully moved amendment No. 9. These Uncle Tom organisations that the Minister proposes to establish in each fisheries region will not be able to do anything without fear of being abolished or having their rules changed by the Minister. That degree of ministerial control should be deleted.  The Minister should explain why he wants to have this kind of power.  The Minister has made very fine statements about the co-operative movement generally and the whole idea of co-operatives. What is the rationale for this subsection?  Why would the Minister want to revoke or amend an order establishing a co-operative?  This subsection is to give the Minister the tight, firm, central grip that is running right through this Bill, and the proposal should be deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On reading the draftsman's original version of the subsection and on taking into account representations made to me indicating that subsection (3) as drafted would permit the Minister for the Marine to revoke or amend orders setting up co-operative societies, I decided to introduce amendment No. 11 in my name.  I will continue to call them co-operative societies and hope for co-operation in the societies.  It is the one thing that I did not find in this area when I became Minister.  The original subsection meant that I could revoke or amend orders in an arbitrary way, so I am moving amendment No. 11. It was not my intention that there should be arbitrariness about it.  This is not a <Col N="43" /> society for the new case.  The Deputy mentioned tight, firm, centralised control, but that does not belong to the philosophy under which this State works.  I would not like the House or the people to find a reflection of that kind of philosophy in the legislation.  The purpose of this subsection was to enable me to set up additional co-operatives where these were deemed to be warranted.  The proposed new formulation meets the case that has been made to me.  I have been advised that it is necessary to have this power of revocation, as indeed the Registrar of Friendly Societies has.  I do not accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment.</P>
      <P>In the initial stages and under the terms of the arrangement I worked out with the anglers, I as representing the people, the taxpayer, will supply certain funds to the co-operatives and I have responsibility to see to it that public funds are used for the purposes for which they are intended. While the rein is a light one and the control in its original form was light, it is now even lighter as a result of amendment No. 11.  I am simply discharging my responsibility to the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>I normally do not hesitate in relation to a Minister's control in certain things but the thrust of the argument from the beginning related to the voluntary and co-operative aspects of the Bill.  The Minister did a brilliant job this morning in defending his policy and while unfortunately, he has the numbers in the House, he is on a hiding to nothing in relation to this.  This basically says that the Minister controls and will continue to have control.  I agree that where taxpayers' money is involved the Minister should have a certain responsibility.  If we are sincere about giving control to voluntary people in relation to fisheries, the Minister should back off from this type of heavy-handedness in the setting up of this co-operative movement.  It appears the Minister wants control and will keep control.  When the anglers met the Minister, there seemed to be a certain amount of co-operation.  When the anglers met me and other Deputies in the <Col N="44" /> House they certainly aired their views and reservations about ministerial control. It does not give me any pleasure to stand here this morning and reiterate my reservations about this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister was made aware not just by Members but by interested people outside that not only was subsection (3) heavyhanded but would give him undue power.  In an effort to amend it he has sought to insert the words, &ldquo;after such investigation or inquiry as he thinks fit&rdquo;.  However, as has been pointed out by the other Members, the difficulty is that he would be left in control.  The amendment does not outline the type of investigation.  There is no point in the Minister claiming, on the one hand, that he is going to establish co-operatives and that there is consensus and agreement if, on the other hand, subsection after subsection of the Bill gives him power.</P>
      <P>Would the members of those societies have the right to make a case if an investigation was carried out because it would seem from the amendment that such an investigation can be as cursory or as restricted as the Minister sees fit?  I argue that these co-operatives will not be effective if the Minister retains complete control. I would like to ask the question therefore, what rights will the members of those societies &mdash; particularly in dispute &mdash; have?  Would they, as I said, have the right to make a case to the Minister if an investigation is carried out?  As things stand, the Minister will be able to outline the boundaries of the investigation.  He is not honouring in any way the principle of independence and autonomy for the co-operatives we all agree is essential if they are to be effective and work well with the Minister and his Department.</P>

I have also received representations from the Munster Regional Angling Council.  I ask the Minister to come clean on this matter. He is imposing this Bill on anglers.  If this is what he wants to do, good luck to him but he should not say he has the agreement of the anglers because that is not so.</P>

      <P>I would first like to take up the point made by Deputy Garland. The Minister would need to think again about whether he has the agreement of anglers on this Bill.  I understand he sat down to negotiate with anglers and opponents of the rod licence and concluded an agreement with them but, from what I have heard, he is exaggerating in claiming that he has the agreement of anglers on this Bill.  I do not know if this Bill is at variance with the agreement reached with the anglers, whether some anglers changed their positions since their discussions with the Minister or whether the general principles agreed between the anglers and the Minister were one thing and the general principles fleshed out in the Bill another.  Quite honestly, the Minister is out of touch when he says he has the agreement of the anglers on this Bill.  This will become more evident as time goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are fighting a losing battle on the question of how these bodies will be established.  They will be established by ministerial order and the Minister will retain the right under subsection (2) to amend or revoke that order.  It will be a question of hiring and firing and it is the <Col N="46" /> Minister who will be doing the hiring and firing.  While the amendment he has proposed will improve the text of the subsection I am not sure it progresses us very far.  It states that an order may be revoked or amended &ldquo;after such investigation or inquiry as he thinks fit&rdquo;. I would expect a Minister to at least conduct an investigation or inquiry, if only to ask the local cumann what they thought, before revoking or amending an order.</P>
    <P>The nub of the matter is that the investigation or inquiry will be the kind of investigation or inquiry the Minister thinks fit.  Therefore, if he thinks that no investigation or inquiry is warranted, or that a cursory inquiry is warranted, that will be at his discretion.  Ultimately, an order setting up a co-operative can be either amended or revoked at the Minister's discretion.  This over-centralises the control, is unnecessary, defeats the whole purpose of these bodies and places the Minister's heavy hand on their shoulders. He will be breathing down their necks and keeping an eye on what they are doing.  It is a classic case of &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not know to what anglers Deputy O'Sullivan was speaking in Cork.  Cork people from both the county and city played a big part in establishing the broad agreement we had about the establishment of these co-operatives, and some of those people were from Cork, his own city.  I agree with Deputy Barnes that the original, before I put down my amendment, gave a false impression of ministerial control.  There is no way the Minister has anything, in the words of Deputy Barnes, such as complete control in any section of this Bill and he does not want to have such control.</P>
      <P>Deputy Garland raised the question of the anglers.  I have spoken to all the representative groups.  Accepting the bona fides of all sides in this dispute, there were people who thought the best vehicle for the provision of funds for the protection and development of fisheries was the licensing arrangement.  I gathered from the contributions made by Deputy Garland and others that they did not want to go down that road, yet they are coming in and indicating to me that they have some kind of rapport with them.  I cannot understand where people stand on this.</P>

      <P>In page 3, lines 11 and 12, to delete subsection (6).</P>
      <P>This is very much along the same lines as the previous proposal.  The Bill provides that &ldquo;The Minister may appoint persons to fill vacancies among the trustees. so designated and may remove any such trustee from office&rdquo;.  Subsection (5) which preceded that and which relates to it provides that &ldquo;The order establishing a society shall designate the persons who shall be the trustees of the society on its establishment&rdquo;.  I understand from the Minister's previous contributions that what is intended here is that the initial trustees shall be identified in the order establishing the bodies and subsequently they will be elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like some clarification on this. It is not stated how many trustees it is envisaged to appoint.  That the Minister is appointing the trustees seems to me to defeat the purpose of the voluntary nature of co-operatives.  We have an order establishing the body; the Minister can revoke or amend that order; he now appoints the initial trustees, he can appoint replacement trustees if somebody opts out or, worse still, he can, remove a trustee from office.  It is incredible.  There is no co-operative, no voluntary organisation, I would even go so far as to say there are few semi-State <Col N="49" /> organisations where the Minister exercises such rigid control.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to delete the provision enabling the Minister to appoint the trustees and giving him the right to dismiss them.  It is very much hire and fire and, as we all know, he who hires and fires controls.  The purpose of the amendment is to take away that control from the Minister and put it back where I believe it rightly belongs if we are to have these bodies, which is in the hands of the membership of the co-operatives themselves.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the repetition does not occur on the one section but, as we come to section upon section the repetition must be written in.  The points we are making are relevant to each of the sections and the amendments are put down in an attempt to remove some of the difficulties we are all experiencing on this section.  Regarding Deputy Gilmore's amendment to delete subsection (6) altogether, the fears are well founded. This Bill is in contrast with the fundamental principles of co-operative societies when under section 4 (6) we find the Minister has incredible powers not just to &ldquo;appoint persons to fill vacancies amongst the trustees so designated&rdquo; but to remove any such trustee from office. That can be seen as a great intrusion into the business of the co-operatives, all of them having been set up under the guidelines and terms of reference of the Bill, which really is intended to provide for the <Col N="50" /> development of trout and coarse fisheries and to benefit the public.</P>
      <P>My difficulty with regard to the powers provided to the Minister here is that there seems to be no recourse for people, through right of reply or representation and so on, to take up what they see, rightly, as an unjust or unfair move against them. Let me say, Sir, before you intervene, that the point is relevant to this subsection when I draw the House's attention to section 7 of the Bill regarding membership.  There it states that any such trustee shall cease to be a member on ceasing to be a trustee.  Not alone would the Minister have the power to remove a trustee but, in doing so, he would have the inherent power to deprive that person of membership of the co-operative as well. The trustee might wish to remain a member.  If the Minister has the power to appoint and remove, it leaves the trustee in a very vulnerable position with regard to the basic right of membership. I view this with grave misgivings and hope the Minister will take this into consideration when he responds to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I will not be repetitious or boring but rather brief and to the point.  It is frustrating to discuss once again the matter of the Minister's control. I have no doubt that this Minister, being a man of integrity, will not in any way abuse the position but he will not always be in office and we do not know who his successors will be.  Angling groups are worried about who these trustees will be and whether they will be political appointees.  Perish the thought.  It is possible that there could be abuses over the years.  This legislation will probably be in place for a long time unless there is another dispute.  I share some of the doubts and reservations expressed by previous speakers.  The Minister would appear to have the power to decide who the appointees will be.  The angling groups are anxious to know who they will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Mindful of what the Chair <Col N="51" /> has said, I will be brief.  Deputy Gilmore rightly picked up from the earlier part of the debate that we are dealing here only with the people who are appointed trustees in the interregnum, the intervening period.  That will be only a matter of months.  They are facilitators of the establishment of the co-operative societies.</P>
      <P>I get a little nervous when Deputy O'Sullivan says that the Minister may not always be here, especially if he does not give me another few months.  Taking account of the fact that the trustees will hold office for a very short time, it seems we are taking a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.  If some of the trustees died or wanted to resign, unless by some process of parthenogenesis, I do not see how I can replace them other than by picking other people and telling them to get on with the job of establishing the societies.</P>

    <P>(3)  Any dispute arising as to the amount apportioned to an angling club under <i>subsection (2)</i> shall be referred jointly by the angling club and the regional board concerned to the Minister whose decision shall be final.</P>
    <P>(4)  The fraction to be determined under <i>subsection (2)</i> shall not, in any case, exceed one-eighth.</P>

      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to remove subsection (1) of section 5. Subsection (1) is another example of ministerial interference in the rules of these societies.

These bodies will be established by ministerial order, the people will be appointed to them by the Minister and the Minister will maintain the power to dissolve them.  The bodies are being established for the purposes of raising funds.  These bodies will not write their own rules, these rules will be written for them by the Minister, or at least be made by him.  No voluntary organisation or co-operative have their rules written for them by a Government Department or by a Minister.  This suggestion stands the whole co-operative idea on its head.</P>
      <P>This is a general section and gives the Minister very wide powers to make rules setting out the functions of the societies. The rules set down the functions of the management committee, the forum for meetings, who may be members, the determination of ordinary and corporate membership and how they will conduct their business.  The questions of balloting, how they will manage their money and how they will disburse their money are also covered.  They will have wide ranging powers and the rules will be written by the Department, made by the Minister and handed down to the society.  If these bodies were co-operatives, the members would democratically decide the rules of their organisation.</P>

It has been reported to me that the Minister has communicated already with at least some of the objectors to the rod licence setting out for them what the rules of the new co-operatives will be. Since we are debating this section dealing with the rules of these bodies, I think the Minister should put the draft rules of these bodies on the record of this House. It is critical that we should know this.  We are being asked to give the Minister a blank sheet of paper to enable him to write the rules of bodies which will control who will fish on our rivers and lakes for the foreseeable future.  These bodies will have powers to decide the level of charges and who will be prosecuted.  We are entitled to know the composition of these bodies, of the conditions of membership and the rules which will cover the annual meeting, the election of the management committee and how they will be governed.  We want to know what kind of bodies are actually being established. I am very glad the Minister volunteered that he has decided the rules will be borrowed from ICOS; I have been informed that the Minister has already been discussing the rules.</P>

      <P>I do not think this House can agree to an all-embracing section allowing the Minister to make these rules himself.  We are entitled to be told what these rules will be.  The Minister has already let the cat out of the bag.  I certainly know he has already been discussing these draft rules with some of the people who had been involved in the rod licence dispute. I want the Minister to tell us what these rules will be because we cannot leave all this to the Minister.  If these rules are in draft form, they should be presented to this House and we should know on what we are voting.</P>

      <P>I advise the House that we are discussing in section 5 a proposal that the Minister will have power to make rules.  We have one amendment which would take that power from him and another amendment proposing to substitute a subsection.  I do not think we can require the Minister to do what is not in the Bill or sought in any amendment.</P>

      <P>It would be an excellent idea if the Minister could introduce or inform Members of the draft rules pertaining not only to this section but to the Bill in its entirety.  The feedback to Members is that there is a great deal of fear, even suspicion, about various sections of the Bill, in particular with regard to who will be the trustees.  We know the Minister will have the last word or control in respect of these co-operatives which is giving rise to much concern and suspicion.  If the Minister could give us some indication of what will be the rules, it would allay the suspicions of Members on this side of the House and <Col N="58" /> also those of the many anglers who have drawn our attention to the matter.</P>
      <P>We observe that the Minister has tremendous powers under the provisions of this Bill.  Not alone may he draw up the rules and regulations of the co-operative societies but he will have much power and influence on their internal structure and day-to-day running of the co-operatives. Not alone may he draw up the rules &mdash; and we do not know at present what those rules will be &mdash; but a co-operative society, with the consent of the Minister, may revoke or amend their rules.  That is highly dangerous, perhaps leaving it wide open to a group within a society attempting to revoke or amend rules which they do not like.  Such a group could appeal to the Minister's discretionary powers to aid them in revoking or amending the rules of their co-operative society without having had the full consensus of everybody within that society.</P>
      <P>In addition section 5 (4) reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister may appoint not more than two persons to be members of the management committee of a society in addition to its elected members.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said he will select trustees in an interim period only.  I take it that the provisions of section 5 (4) will not comprise any interim arrangement but rather form part and parcel of the Minister's power of appointment of members of the management committees of such societies.  Bearing in mind all the control and discretion available to the Minister, why then must he also appoint two persons other than those already selected by a society?  The provisions of this section overall call for allaying many fears held about them.  That could best be done by the Minister responding to the many questions posed but particularly by responding to Deputy Gilmore's amendment.  Perhaps the Minister would consider informing the House at least of the basic principals of the rules he hopes will accompany this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that this part of the Bill is causing major concern to some angling groups.  I take <Col N="59" /> the point made by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that the provisions of this section merely enable the Minister to draw up and introduce the relevant rules. Angling groups, clubs and co-operative societies feel strongly that they should have some input into the drawing up of those rules.  Indeed, it was a fundamental part of the agreement they reached with the Minister that they would have such input before the relevant legislation was passed.  A most important aspect of this Bill is comprised of the rules governing co-operative societies, clubs and so on, I have met two or three different groups, not alone from Cork but representing other areas also, when they made the point forcibly that they do not know what will be the rules governing their co-operative society or whatever.  They contend the Bill should not be passed until they have been consulted and have had some input into the rules and regulations being drawn up.  They contend that a copy of the proposed co-operative rules should be made available to them and others before the legislation is passed since those rules form a fundamental part of that legislation.  I thoroughly agree with those sentiments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this respect there has been much concern expressed by Members and the public in general.  We do not want to see circumstances devolved in which any confrontation could arise through misinterpretation of the relevant rules or through any lack of consultation with the relevant groups.  At the very least there is a certain amount of disquiet felt about the establishment of the co-operative societies.  The groups with whom I have met have emphasised that the rules governing the relevant legislation must be submitted to them for consideration before proceeding further.  The Minister may have a somewhat different outlook, he may be speaking to different groups, but this is one of the most important aspects of the entire Bill.  While the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has pointed out that the provisions of this section merely enable the Minister to draw up rules for the regulation of co-operative societies, <Col N="60" /> it is important that we be made aware now of what those rules will be.  Until such time as we are made so aware at the very least there could be much confusion and, worse, confrontation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 14 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the statement by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the House of Commons on 14 March, I conveyed to the British Prime Minister the Irish Government's full acceptance of the formula for the substantive talks and our profound hope that the talks would get under way and proceed to a successful conclusion.  On 26 March, the Secretary of State informed the House of Commons that, following extensive discussions with the main constitutional political parties in Northern Ireland &mdash; the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, the Ulster Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Unionist Party &mdash; and with the Irish Government, a basis for formal <Col N="64" /> political talks now existed.  I wish to avail of this opportunity to pay tribute in the House to the personal qualities of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Brooke, and also the combination of realism and vision displayed by the political leaders in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government are encouraged by these developments and regard them as providing an historic opportunity for both traditions on this island, to achieve peace, justice and prosperity for all the people. The talks will deal with all the relationships involved and this shared appreciation of the nature and scope of the exercise undoubtedly helps to strengthen the prospects of a positive outcome.  As the Government have already made clear, they look forward to a substantive and vibrant dialogue with Northern political leaders.  With goodwill and a constructive approach all round, there is potential for a major move forward in our relationship.  The Government look forward to contributing to the realisation of this potential and also to the further improvement in Irish-British relations that would inevitably be associated with such an outcome.</P>
    <P>I wish to reiterate the Government's hope that the sense of a new beginning will help to signal the end of the strife and human suffering that have bedevilled Northern Ireland for so long.  With the political process now offering the opportunity of a new way forward, the futility and irrelevance of violence must increasingly be apparent and the permanent cessation of support for campaigns of violence must surely now be considered by all those who wish to participate in the building of a new, agreed Ireland.</P>
    <P>The talks process was considered at the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in Belfast last week at which the Government were represented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice.  Both sides agreed that the Conference would meet again on 26 April after which the gap in Conference meetings would begin. The Conference noted that it was expected that talks would commence by the end of April.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> Deputies will appreciate that, given the extremely sensitive nature of the process now being embarked on, it would be premature and inappropriate to indicate now the position to be taken by the Government in the talks.  I have indicated on a number of occasions that it will be open to any party to the talks to raise any germane matter they wish.  As soon as I am in a position to report to the House, I will do so.  This is the normal procedure for enabling members of the Opposition to comment on Government policies. The composition of the Government's delegation is a matter for the Government who will decide on it at the appropriate time, in the light of the general structure of the talks decided upon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will find agreement to his own sentiments welcoming the opportunity which now presents itself on this island in relation to the talks which are about to commence at the end of this month.  May I seek some clarification from the Taoiseach, first, in relation to the composition of the Government negotiating team on which there has been an unseemly row in the newspapers over the past number of weeks?  I would have thought the Taoiseach owed it to this House today to clarify the composition of the Government team.  Secondly, may I remind the Taoiseach that it was consistently his view in the run-up to the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in the process of the New Ireland Forum that the only way of making progress in relation to Northern Ireland was through the medium of an all-party all-Ireland constitutional conference? Has the Taoiseach now some reason for going away from that concept? He is obviously saying today that there is no role for the Opposition parties in this House in the course of those negotiations, but can I say to the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Sorry, Deputy Spring, there are a lot of questions tabled to the Taoiseach today.  Deputies are anxious that their questions would be answered.  There are 14 questions being <Col N="66" /> replied to presently and the Chair does desire, and think it essential, that we have brevity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will co-operate. I would remind you that there are five questions in my name.  Would the Taoiseach not consider it more appropriate now, as there is much talk about an agreement being reached between the communities on this island, that the Opposition parties here in the South should be represented at those negotiations; otherwise the Taoiseach and his colleagues may arrive back to this House with an agreement and force us to make a judgment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I said in my reply that the composition of the Government delegation will be decided upon by the Government and announced in due course.  It is early days yet to decide on the exact composition of such a delegation because the final structure of the talks and the number of persons participating from the different parties has not yet been decided.  I do not think there is any need for me at this stage to anticipate the structure of the Government delegation, and I would hope that the Deputy would not be attempting to muddy the waters in that respect.</P>

      <P>With regard to an allround constitutional conference, that is still my view.  It is not in any way exclusive to this process.  In due course, arising out of this process of dialogue, such an allround constitutional conference might be a natural sequel.  Finally, I think it would be entirely inappropriate and unprecedented to have the parties in this State participating in the talks at this stage. The parties to this process of dialogue <Col N="67" /> are quite clear: they are two sovereign Governments on the one hand and the constitutional political parties in Northern Ireland on the other.  The British Government will conduct the talks on behalf of the British Government.  I do not anticipate that they would attempt to bring Opposition parties along as part of their delegation.  The Irish Government will conduct the talks on behalf of the Irish Government, and the different political parties in Northern Ireland will conduct the talks on their own behalf. Anything else would not be appropriate nor, indeed, would it be very practicable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I directed two very specific questions to the Taoiseach today and I note he has not replied specifically to them.  However, I accept that in the times in which we live, with the Brooke initiative about to be debated, perhaps it is not appropriate for the Taoiseach to answer these questions in detail, so I will not press him further.  I would, however, ask him to give serious consideration to allowing members of the Opposition parties to accompany the delegation to London or wherever the talks may be.  In this unprecedented situation it would be a magnanimous gesture on the part of the Taoiseach.  This should not be a party issue.  It is something on which we should all reach agreement and show magnanimity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputy I have no wish to exclude the parties in this House from the political process in any way.  It is my intention that they will be, in some way yet to be decided, fully informed and to the greatest extent involved.  That is only commonsense.  I would point out to the Deputy that in the course of the discussions on the Anglo-Irish Agreement the negotiations then were conducted exclusively by the Government and the political parties were not involved until it <Col N="68" /> came to the role of this House in either accepting or rejecting that agreement.</P>
      <P>With regard to the actual construction of the dialogue process I do not believe it would be practical to depart from the position I have outlined.  After all, this is a major policy matter.  So far these talks have been conducted by the Government and they have been brought to this stage successfully by the Government conducting the talks.  To the greatest extent possible this House was kept informed, and that is the practical and sensible way to proceed.

I am always interested to find Deputies on the opposite side of the House appealing to me to be flexible. Nobody in this process so far has been more flexible than the Irish Government. I do not mind saying at this stage that were it not for our flexibility we would not have arrived at this successful stage. We have overcome a lot of technical, procedural and other kinds of difficulties so far, and I am sure we will overcome whatever others may arise in future.</P>

      <P>First, I agree fully with what the Taoiseach said that it is the wish of everybody in this House and, indeed, on this island that there will be a successful conclusion to the talks that are now commencing.  I want to assure the Taoiseach that nothing I or, I am sure, any Member of the Opposition says will in any way be designed to trip up the Taoiseach or the Government in their negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards my question about the involvement of the Opposition parties, this was prompted by a very clear statement by a member of the Progressive Democrats who said that Deputy O'Malley, Minister for Industry and Commerce, had been given an assurance that the Progressive Democrats, as opposed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, would be involved in the talks.  If political parties are to be involved it is quite reasonable that other political parties in this House should also ask to be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having put down the question and then seeing the same idea being put forward by Dr. Paisley on the following day made me feel a little like Mr. de Valera with regard to <i>The Irish Times</i>, I began to examine my conscience.  However, the Progressive Democrats have clearly said they had been given an undertaking that the party as opposed to the Minister will be involved.  I fully recognise the Government's right to decide what their own <Col N="71" /> membership should be but not if the political parties are to be involved.  There is a difference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is becoming over-wieldy and over-long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say one other thing in response to a point and ask a question.  The Taoiseach drew the analogy with the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the fact that political parties were not involved in that, but that is not correct. The Anglo-Irish Agreement flowed from the New Ireland Forum in which all parties were involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would dissuade the Deputy from making statements of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement was negotiated between Governments and no parties North or South were involved.  The Taoiseach has given an undertaking that whatever agreement is reached will be brought back to this House.  Will he accept the proposition that whatever is agreed should be put to referenda to take place on the same day in both parts of this island?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter proposition has been put forward.  I am not sure that at this stage I would go that far but I am certainly not ruling it out.  There are various ways in which we can have agreements of that kind accepted on as broad a base as possible.  I do not want to go over old ground but I would disagree with Deputy Barry that the Anglo-Irish Agreement process flowed from the New Ireland Forum.  We all remember the famous occasion when the New Ireland Forum report was put out in London.  I am not sure that that is an historically accurate reference, but I do not think we need argue about that.  I see now the reason Deputy Barry, and his colleagues, are raising this matter.  It is not correct for anybody to say that I undertook that any party as such would be involved in <Col N="72" /> the talks.  The position is that the Government team will be a Government team and not a party team.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach some supplementaries relating to Question Nos. 11, 12 and 13 in my name.  I do not think anybody in this House under-estimates the significance of the stage we have reached with regard to the negotiations about Northern Ireland.  Indeed, all the parties involved, including the Irish Government, deserve all credit for bringing matters this far, and that needs to be said in this House.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach, bearing in mind his statement that any party to the talks may raise matters that are germane, if he proposes to raise questions with regard to the Irish Constitution or to make offers with regard to the Irish Constitution, particularly in relation to Articles 2 and 3?  Will he also clarify the reference in his initial statement in the House today with regard to the cessation of violence as I am not sure if I heard him <Col N="73" /> correctly?  Will he repeat the part where he seemed to be implying that if those now engaged in violence cease they may be involved?  Perhaps he will clarify this because there is a very real risk at the moment, which has been evident over the last few days, that the terror veto is being exercised by the Provisionals and the UVF&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot allow that to gain currency.  The Taoiseach said he will consult the Opposition parties in the House but that the mode of consultation has not yet been decided.  Will he meet the other party leaders and me to discuss how that process can be put in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be glad to again read what I said about violence.  With the political process now offering the opportunity of a new way forward, the futility and irrelevance of violence must increasingly be apparent and the permanent cessation of support for campaigns of violence must surely now be considered by all those who wish to participate in the building of a new, agreed Ireland.  That is common sense and self-evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Deputy should be seeking information at this stage about the specific proposals which the Government will put forward.  The first thing is to have exploratory talks; the idea is that everybody will state their position and we will then see the requirements, priorities and wishes of the different participants. We can then see how we can best discuss these issues and perhaps &mdash; I hope &mdash; reach agreement on them.  I always said that we would hope to be forthcoming and oncoming and I am sure that, as the talks proceed, we will have our own imaginative ideas to put forward.  The Deputy, I am sure, knows my view that if we can come up with some new type of arrangement covering the island as a whole it would certainly require a new Constitution, or an amendment to the present one.  These matters will all face <Col N="74" /> us in the future and I would not like to be committed to a particular stance in regard to any issue at this stage.</P>

      <P>I congratulate all the parties who have managed to reach the conference table and I wish them all the best for speedy success.  Will the Taoiseach accept my personal experience that, as a result of recent murders by extremists on both sides, fear stalks the land in a way that has not been the case since the mid-seventies? Therefore, all Members of this House have a responsibility to be extremely careful in regard to what they say and do.  Whatever the eventual outcome in terms of an agreement reached about the existence of two states on this island, a unitary state, a federal state or a confederal state, will the Taoiseach accept that the existence of an administration in Northern Ireland is central to all of them, where the two sections of the community can work together because it is only by working together that reconciliation will be brought about?</P>

      <P>I am sorry I was not present for the earlier discussion and I understand that the Taoiseach turned down the request to have other parties involved. Will the Taoiseach rethink his position in view of the fact that history tells us that the Treaty was not so bad?  Sunningdale fell because of lack of co-operation and the complaint in relation to the Anglo-Irish Agreement is that people were not consulted.  Any settlement which will meet with the approval of all the political parties should come about by means of an input by all the constitutional political parties on both sides of the Border.  Bearing in mind that the Unionist leadership have requested this, will the Taoiseach agree that an involvement of all the political parties in Dáil Éireann would be a wise move on his part?</P>

As Deputy Harte said, we must learn from the mistakes of the past.  The Taoiseach said that we may be facing into an agreement with constitutional implications; will he again consider the question of the Opposition parties being involved?  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware of the call from the Unionist leadership in Northern Ireland for the involvement of the Opposition parties down here.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with all these matters.  However, I reiterate that the parties in this House will be fully informed and involved, which is what this House is for.  It is the Government's duty as the Executive to conduct all types of negotiations of this kind, subject always to the authority of this House, to their duty to report to this House and to having their decisions in negotiations accepted or rejected by this House.  There will be no departure from that normal and correct precedent.  It is a different matter to organise a process of dialogue and talks on a tripartite basis and I am absolutely clear in my own mind that, apart from the proper constitutional and parliamentary precedent, the right way to proceed on this occasion is for the Government to conduct the talks on this side, the British Government to do it on their side and the political parties in the North to conduct it on their side, the difference being that they do not have a Government to speak on their behalf. That is why all the parties in the North of Ireland must be included, there is no Executive to speak for them.  That is the sensible logical and practical way to proceed.</P>
      <P>It will be very difficult, in any event, to structure these talks with the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland as they all have different agendas and priorities with the British Government and ourselves.  To add another layer of parliamentary participation &mdash; valuable though it might be&mdash;would impede the whole process.  It also raises the question that if the political Opposition parties in this State accompany the Irish Government, should the political parties in Great Britain not accompany the British Government?  Whatever about the next phase &mdash; and I am sure there will be one &mdash; at this stage we should stick to the established procedure and precedent that, where there are Governments, they negotiate on behalf of the people in their jurisdictions and that where there are no Governments the political parties negotiate on behalf of their people, we will see where we go from there.</P>

If agreement is reached by the parties in Northern Ireland and between the two sovereign Governments, and if the agreement is subsequently endorsed by referendum in the two parts of the island, would the Taoiseach not consider that it is time to clearly signal to the Provisional IRA that the will of the people will not be subverted and that the Government are prepared to take any step, as his predecessors were, including internment, to ensure that the Provisional IRA will not subvert this initiative?

As I said in my main reply, if we can, through this process, move everything forward to a more satisfactory stage from everybody's point of view, then the futility of violence in so far as it has any relevance at all will become totally irrelevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 to 19, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The matter of integration of the Western European Union and the European Community member states was not discussed at the special informal meeting of the European Council in Luxembourg on 8 April 1991 and consequently the question of the Irish Government taking a position on that occasion on any such integration did not arise.  Following a brief discussion of the long term implications of the Gulf War for the definition of the future Political Union, it was simply agreed that this aspect should be pursued actively in the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union and the major options set out for the meeting of the European Council fixed for next June.</P>
      <P>As I shall be indicating in my statement to the House later today, the European Council agreed to get food and other humanitarian aid to the Kurdish refugees immediately.  Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the nine countries which are members of the Western European Union held a brief meeting in the margins of the European Council and decided to avail of the logistical support of that organisation to deliver the aid to the Kurds.  At my proposal, in the European Council meeting, it was accepted that non-members of the Western European Union, including Ireland, would supply civil aircraft to transport aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not considered appropriate for <Col N="80" /> the Minister for Foreign Affairs to attend the Western European Union meeting, as an observer, because that body is a military alliance of which Ireland is not a member.</P>
    <P>In regard to the personal views expressed by Commission President Delors, I repeat what I said in replying to a Question here on 20 March last, that a wide variety of proposals in regard to aspects of a common foreign and security policy have been tabled and are being considered by the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union which is at an early stage, at which it would be premature to speculate on the eventual outcome.  The Government's objective remains to ensure that Ireland will be able to participate in and contribute to the Community's foreign and security policy on a basis that respects our longstanding policy positions in regard to European Union and to membership of military alliances.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be assured that the Government will take all appropriate steps, when appropriate and useful, to facilitate a timely and broad-ranging debate on all the issues emerging in both Intergovernmental Conferences, following the initial phases which involve a great deal of discussion and clarification, after which the actual remaining questions will be sufficiently clear to provide the basis for a productive debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 15, can I take it from what the Taoiseach said that he does not consider it timely to have a broad-ranging discussion on the whole question of European security and defence policy at this stage?  Second, would the Taoiseach not consider that if a committee on foreign affairs of this House was set up immediately it could undertake valuable work in this area because of the many complex issues involved and because of the debate which I think we should be having in this country in relation to decisions we will have to face up to in a very short period of time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that <Col N="81" /> we will have to have a broad debate on this whole question of the future of Europe and particularly on the question of common foreign defence and security policy.  I am looking forward to the time when we may very likely have to have a referendum on the issue, so it will be necessary over a period to have as wide-ranging a debate as we can among ourselves and among the general public.  It is just a question of trying to decide when such a debate would be most fruitful and most productive.  The Intergovernmental Conferences are at an early stage yet. We could have a preliminary debate and parties could express their positions and set down guidelines.  However, I really think it would be more helpful for us all, for the parties in particular if there was something more specific emerging out of the Intergovernmental Conferences which we could consider but that is a matter which the Whips can discuss from time to time.</P>
      <P>On the foreign affairs committee, I told the Deputy this morning that we hope to get that into operation fairly soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i>: Let me ask the Taoiseach two questions arising out of the remarks attributed to President Jacques Delors.  First, is the Taoiseach aware of the anxiety that arose as a result of the remarks which suggested that the EC could turn into a two track Europe, that Ireland would be on the second or slower track and that the differentiation would be between those who participated in a common security and defence policy and those who did not and that he expected Ireland not to participate? Second, could the Taoiseach state what the Government policy is at present on the suggestions made by President Delors and if he is aware of any federal or confederal political system anywhere, at any time, where one participant refused to be involved in the security or defence of that entity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the exact import of the last part of the question. We are not dealing with a federal or confederal situation so that speculative question does not arise as far as I am <Col N="82" /> concerned.  President Delors is a very able President of the Commission and I yield to no one in Europe in my respect for him.  I attribute to him a great deal of the credit for the success of the major move forward which Europe has been experiencing now for some years. However, on that occasion President Delors was speaking personally and giving his own view and I would not fully agree with his view.</P>
      <P>A number of people have from time to time put forward suggestions of dividing the Community into first and second tiers.  On one occasion a prominent banker thought we could divide the Community on the basis of economic performance. There were some other suggestions that it should perhaps be divided on the basis of military predilections. I reject both of those suggestions.  We are a fully committed, good member of the Community.  I do not think there is any member state where there is such public support for membership of the Community and for progress in the Community as in Ireland.  We have demonstrated all along the line &mdash; and I give due credit to the previous Government for this &mdash; our full commitment and our anxiety to move forward as rapidly as anybody else in Europe, and as European integration proceeds we intend to be there right up front in the process.  That will be our continued position.  It is the duty of the Government, acting on behalf of the people of Ireland, to negotiate at the forthcoming common security policy discussions so that the views of our people and our best interests can be fully accommodated in the context of European integration and political union.  I believe we can achieve that.  We have a great deal of goodwill in Europe among the Heads of State and Government.  I believe they that as the Intergovernmental Conference proceed and consider different formulae we will be able to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion.</P>

      <P>I want to refer first to the March meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the European Council.  Am I right in saying that nine Foreign Ministers of the countries which are members of the Western European Union attended, that the Foreign Ministers of Greece and Denmark, countries not members of the Western European Union, also attended as observers and that we were the odd man out in that we were the only one of the Twelve which did not attend?  Am I right in saying that the meeting was held with the Turkish Ambassador for the purpose of making logistical arrangements about the delivery of emergency aid? Why did we not attend the meeting? What is the relevance of the comment made by the Taoiseach that he did not consider it appropriate for the Minister to attend at this stage?  Does he envisage circumstances in the near future when he would consider it appropriate for the Minister to attend such a meeting?  Can I clear those points first before I move on to the next issue?</P>

Would the Taoiseach not accept that it would be helpful to the country as a whole, and to all of us in this House, if we knew where the Government stood in relation to <Col N="84" /> European political union?  We believe the Government are proceeding by way of a policy which is made up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, the back of the match box&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>These are all very relevant points, Sir.  Some time ago I proposed that the Government should issue a White Paper outlining where they stood on these issues.  Will the Taoiseach take that suggestion on board and issue a White Paper so that we will know what the Government are negotiating on behalf of Ireland in relation to European political union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Western European Union meeting in Luxembourg, this was a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Western European Union.  The Western European Union are not coterminous with the Community; they are a separate organisation with different membership.  Nine members of the Community are members of the Western European Union and other states which are not members of the Community are members of the Western European Union.  I want to make it clear that they are two separate and distinct organisations: one is a military alliance while the other, so far, is an economic and social community.  There is a perfectly clear distinction in our minds between our participating in Community affairs and Community Councils and participating in the affairs of Western European Union.  That would be a major change on our part, and it does not arise at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Intergovernment Conference, we do not know yet what formulae or formulations may be put forward, when all these issues will have to be considered.  The simple fact is that as the Western European Union is a military alliance, in accordance with our policy of military neutrality we did not deem it appropriate to have an observer present at Western European Union.  Other <Col N="85" /> countries which are not members of Western European Union do not have the same view of military alliances as we do and they did not see any objection to having their people present as observers. Deputy O'Keeffe kept referring to people attending the meeting; they did not attend, they were present as observers, which is a distinct difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as the Deputy knows, something can be very significant at that stage.  The Foreign Ministers of other countries outside the Community attended the meeting as members because they were members of Western European Union, which we are not.  That particular meeting was called to see if Western European Union could help in implementing the decision of the Community to transfer aid to the Kurds.  As I explained in my reply, when that matter was discussed at the Council meeting I suggested that those countries which are not members of Western European Union could and should supply that aid by civilian aircraft.  That suggestion was accepted.  Therefore, from that point of view there was no reason for us to be present at that Western European Union meeting; we had already agreed that we could send our supplies by civilian aircraft.</P>

That was my position a long time ago and it has not <Col N="88" /> changed; I believe that would be the position of most parties in this House.

      <P>Some months ago the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated, as the Taoiseach has done, that he recognised the need for a major national debate on the issues before us in regard to political and economic and monetary union.  On that occasion the Minister promised that there would be a series of debates in this House on these issues and promised as well, that if necessary the House would sit on Fridays in order to facilitate these debates.  Does the Taoiseach propose to make any arrangements to have these debates take place because there is clearly a lack of information and debate about the issues before us?  It is important to get that debate under way. With regard to the Western European Union, why is it that at this point the European Community find it necessary, when they have never done so before, to use the logistics of Western European Union?  It is extraordinary that it has been found necessary at this point; is it not simply a question of establishing a <i>de facto</i> relationship between the Western European Union and the EC for now, with the purpose of establishing a <i>de jure</i> position in the future?</P>

      <P>The Deputy can read the situation whichever way he likes but the simple position was that there was an <Col N="89" /> urgent situation there.  The Community were providing food and medical aid. Members of the Western European Union already had their military transports in operation in the area and it seemed to be a very logical answer &mdash; to have the military transport capacity put at the disposal of the Community to get the aid to the Kurds.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i>: All of us including the Taoiseach, when we are talking about these matters, use the terms European defence and European security. Does the Taoiseach see the terms as synonymous or will he differentiate between them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has often been said in this House that I do not see them as synonymous.  There is a great deal more involved in security than in defence. &ldquo;Defence&rdquo; is used by most people as a code word for &ldquo;military&rdquo;&mdash; military defence, armaments and so on.  Security has a far wider concept.  The security of the Community would rest on all sorts of things, such as pursuing disarmament policies for instance, action through the UN and so on.  The Community could <Col N="90" /> have a major security policy which does not necessarily involve military defence capacity.  All European countries except Albania are committed to a common security policy through the CSCE but there is no question of having a defensive capacity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, the Law Reform <Col N="91" /> Commission prepared a programme for submission by the Taoiseach to the Government for the examination of different branches of the law with a view to their reform.  The programme was approved by the Government, and copies were laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 4 January 1977.</P>
    <P>To date the Commission have formulated 34 reports, as well as 11 working papers and three consultation papers.</P>
    <P>These reports and papers cover a broad range of topics, such as family law, property and conveyancing, the law of evidence and rules of procedure in court, criminal law, rape, the law of defamation, collection of debts and taxes, compensation for personal injuries, the statute of limitations, receiving stolen property, etc.  Legislation to implement the recommendations of the commission, as appropriate, is brought forward by the Minister concerned in accordance with the Government's legislative programme.</P>
    <P>As soon as possible after the end of each year, the Taoiseach submits to Government the report of the commission on its activities during the year. The report is then laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Even such annual reports have been issued to date, the last of which is for the year ending December 1989.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The recent visit to Ireland by His Holiness the Dalai Lama was private, and therefore the question of invitations or of a meeting with him did not arise.  While here, the Dalai Lama opened an exhibition at the Chester Beatty Library. Among those present were the Ministers for Education and Labour who, as guests of the organisers, had the opportunity to meet the Dalai Lama informally.</P>
      <P>As I made clear in this House on a previous occasion, the Dalai Lama is a respected and revered religious leader of Tibetans.  In my view he deserves the highest credit for his continuing commitment to a peaceful approach, through dialogue, to the problems faced by the Tibetan people.  In relation to human rights in Tibet, the concerns of Ireland and its European partners were raised as recently as 27 February last at the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</P>

      <P>As I have stated before on a number of occasions, Ireland has never recognised the annexation of the Baltic states by the USSR which occurred in 1940.  However, the question of recognition of the Baltic countries as independent, sovereign states is a separate matter.  None of the Baltic countries exercises that degree of control of its domestic affairs or the capacity to conduct independent foreign relations which are generally accepted as necessary for international recognition as a sovereign, independent state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government view with considerable sympathy the efforts of the Baltic countries to satisfy, by peaceful means, the legitimate aspirations of their peoples and, in conjunction with our partners in the Community, have called for dialogue between Moscow and the elected representatives of the Baltic <Col N="97" /> peoples with a view to satisfying the legitimate aspirations of the latter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>When I raised this issue with him on a previous occasion the Minister told me that it was our practice to recognise states only and not governments. What I cannot fully understand is that while, I presume, we recognised the three Baltic states before 1940 as independent states, the Minister tells me we never recognised their annexation under the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement. Should we not therefore under international law continue to recognise these three countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct when he says that we recognise states rather than governments.  I am advised that the definition of a state for the general purposes of international law is a territorial unit containing a stable population under the authority of its own government and recognised as being capable of entering into relations with other entities with international personality and that it is a precondition for recognition as an independent sovereign state that the entity concerned be in full control of its domestic affairs and of its foreign relations.  It is our policy to recognise states and not governments or parliaments. Therefore the question of recognising a Lithuanian, Latvian or Estonian government or parliament does not arise.  However we accept that these bodies are composed of the democratically elected representatives of the Baltic peoples.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 42 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>The meeting of EC Foreign Ministers which took place in Luxembourg on 26 March and to whom I take it the Deputy's question refers, was one of a series of informal, so-called Gymnich type meetings. Because of their informal nature these meetings do not produce formal conclusions.  There is therefore no formal conclusion on behalf of all the Twelve that there can be no common foreign policy without a defence policy.  The view attributed to Foreign Minister Poos that a common foreign and security policy must include defence is just one of the views being expressed on this subject in the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union.</P>
      <P>The speech which the President of the EC Commission, Jacques Delors, delivered to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London on 7 March addressed the question of a common foreign policy and a common defence policy. President Delors expressed the view that the treaty which will be prepared by the IGC &ldquo;should allow for common defence issues to be dealt with by the European Council&rdquo;.  He went on to say that, in proposing this outline, the Commission was remaining faithful to the guidelines set by the European Council in Rome last December, which set out a list of issues &mdash; arms control, the CSCE, the UN, non-proliferation &mdash; in the field of security and defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>President Delors is of course entitled to express his view about how policy should be developed.  In fact the Conclusions of the December European Council to which he refers distinguished between security and defence and the items he cited are among those set out in the paragraph specifically devoted to common security.  In so far as defence as <Col N="99" /> such is concerned, what is to be considered is the prospect of a role for the union, with a view to the future, and without prejudice either to the commitments of member states who are members of the Atlantic Alliance or to the traditional positions of other member states, which, of course, includes Ireland.</P>

I can also say that it is no secret that the President of the Council of Ministers did not reflect as accurately as he could or should have the views of the other members present at that meeting.  At least four member states out of the Twelve hold the view that I am offering to the Deputy this afternoon.</P>

      <P>I would like to repeat some of what the Taoiseach said during the course of questions this afternoon. <Col N="100" /> All aspects of security are being discussed at the intergovernmental conference but this does not necessarily mean that they have the support of all members.  The conference is negotiating what may or may not emerge at the end of it.  Therefore nothing has been concluded.  It is not a question of anything having been concluded definitively at the meeting which the Deputy refers to in his question. As I said, it was an informal meeting of the 12 ministers where everything was discussed but nothing concluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 44, 50, 54 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland considers that the Kurds in Iraq have a right to an identity, language and culture within Iraq and that the Iraqi Government has an obligation to reach an internal settlement which guarantees respect for the legitimate aspirations of all the people within Iraq.</P>
      <P>Ireland has joined with other Community member states in condemning Iraq's brutal repression of the Kurdish people, in calling for an immediate end to violence against civilians and in supporting moves to ensure that refugees can have an assurance of security and that they can receive and benefit from the international humanitarian aid being provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland fully supports the French-sponsored UN Security Council Resolution (688) which cited Iraqi aggression against the Kurds as a threat to international peace and stability in the region.  The resolution insisted that Iraq allow access <Col N="102" /> for international relief organisations and demanded that Iraq ensure respect for the political and human rights of all citizens. The resolution sent a clear message to Iraq that the international community would not stand by while large numbers of innocent people suffered from repression in all its forms inflicted by the Iraqi authorities.</P>
    <P>A way has to be found to ensure that the Kurds suffer no further repression and that badly needed supplies can reach them safely.  Ireland will continue to support every effort to this end.  It was the clear view of the informal meeting of the European Council on 8 April that the provision of humanitarian aid to the Kurds is not a sufficient response to their situation.  The meeting considered the establishment in Iraq of a zone or zones where refugees could feel secure from repression and that humanitarian aid could effectively be supplied to them. The Twelve do not have in mind the dismantling of Iraq as a state: it is necessary to maintain the territorial integrity of that country, but against the background of numerous deaths of innocent people exposed to extreme conditions in which delivery of adequate assistance is very difficult, the Heads of State or Government were convinced of the need to provide refugees with adequate security in which they could benefit from the aid now being massively supplied.</P>
    <P>Ireland welcomed the news of the visit to the region of the UN Secretary General's personal representative to study the tragic situation there.  I believe that the establishment of the presence of the UN in the region, and perhaps also that of the Red Cross, may establish a <i>de facto</i> security zone for the Iraqi Kurds.  The Secretary General yesterday expressed optimism along these lines.  The deployment, announced yesterday, of US, UK and French troops to assist with aid distribution may also help to establish the necessary confidence.  For our part we would welcome all such efforts which are consistent with the UN Security Council resolutions and with the UN Charter.</P>
    <P>The most immediate need in this <Col N="103" /> regard is the provision of urgent humanitarian assistance.  The refugees must be provided with food, shelter and medicines now and Ireland is playing its part in this effort.  At a special European Council in Luxembourg on 8 April 1991 it was agreed that the Community and its member states would provide 150 million ECUs immediately, equivalent to £120 million as part of the international relief effort to assist the Kurdish refugees.</P>
    <P>As indicated by the Taoiseach in Luxembourg, the Government are providing £1 million of which about £700,000 will be provided through the Community budget and close to £300,000 bilaterally.  We are therefore providing our <i>pro rata</i> share of the Community contribution in full and we may in fact exceed what is required under the agreed Community key.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Deputies have been moved, as I have been, by the graphic and harrowing media coverage of the plight of the Kurdish refugees.  This dreadful suffering, in particular the suffering of the weakest among them, the very young and the very old, has touched us all; effective and speedy assistance must be organised in such a way that this tragedy is ended as speedily and completely as possible.  There have been signs, within the past 48 hours, that improvements are being made &mdash; more aid is getting through, at least some refugees are being brought to a more hospitable and welcoming terrain, and a basic organisational structure and capacity for distributing food and medical attention is being established. It still remains the case that actual implementation of better co-ordinated programmes and full and speedy delivery of the resources pledged are clearly needed.</P>
    <P>The first consignment of Irish official assistance arrived in Teheran yesterday on an Aer Turas flight.  It was organised by the Irish Red Cross to whom the Government have given £200,000 towards their appeal for funds to purchase emergency relief supplies.  On arrival, this flight was met by the Irish Ambassador and by the Iranian Red Crescent Society.  The supplies were <Col N="104" /> unloaded immediately and put on trucks for despatch to the refugees in the north-west of Iran.  A Red Cross volunteer will remain some time in Iran to liaise with their Red Crescent Society.  We plan to make a further allocation of about £100,000 from the Disaster Relief Fund within the next few days.  As Deputies will be aware, the Irish effort is part of the major international relief operation now under way.</P>
    <P>The Government will keep the situation under review and will consider further action in the light of developments. I would also wish to note that the Irish people have responded magnificently once more to yet another call on their sympathy and generosity.  Private individuals, public service organisations and business firms have provided resources for those in direst need and have organised help in practical and concrete ways.</P>
    <P>The Government have no plans at present to provide asylum in Ireland for Kurdish refugees.  We will, of course, continue to keep this matter under review, but it is the Government's belief that the proper solution to the Kurdish problem is not mass emigration but rather the setting up of arrangements which will allow them return safely to their own homes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take the five questions together.</P>
      <P>A copy of a photocopied document which was handed over to a journalist by a person claiming to be a representative of the Provisional IRA has been made available to the Garda authorities.  As the House will be aware by now, a senior Garda officer has been appointed to investigate allegations that the document in question is a copy of an internal Garda document.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Commissioner that, on the face of it, the document appears to be an extract from a recent edition of a regularly produced internal Garda document on criminal matters known as <i>Fógra Tóra.</i> The edition in question, which dealt specifically with matters of a subversive nature, received appropriate circulation within the Garda Síochána at the beginning of the year and contained information on 46 persons wanted by the Garda Síochána in connection with murder and other serious crimes, some on warrant and others for interview.</P>
      <P>The 46 persons are believed by the Garda Síochána to be members of subversive organisations or, at least, connected with such organisations.  The edition of <i>Fógra Tóra</i> to which I refer contains details on 28 alleged members of the Provisional IRA, 11 alleged members of the Irish National Liberation Army, four alleged members of the Official IRA, one alleged member of Saor Éire and two persons believed to have Loyalist sympathies.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have now specifically drawn the attention of the RUC to the fact that particulars concerning a person believed to have Loyalist sympathies are included in the document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will appreciate, it is essential that criminal intelligence and other information which is necessary in the investigation of serious crimes receive appropriate circulation within the Garda Síochána.  It is also essential, of course, <Col N="110" /> that such circulation be properly controlled and this poses certain difficulties when the fundamental purpose of circulating the information in the first place is the need to bring it to sufficient appropriate attention.</P>
    <P>With this in mind, the senior Garda officer investigating this matter has been asked to produce recommendations about the procedures relating to the circulation and custody of such documents as well as investigating the possible criminal offences arising from the unauthorised possession of such documents in this particular case.</P>
    <P>While fully acknowledging the seriousness of the situation which has given rise to the investigations now commenced, I do want to add that we in this House should not allow ourselves to be drawn into the trap of losing sight of the underlying reality here, which is the vicious and callous behaviour of the Provisional IRA in this whole matter.  They have perpetrated a brutal murder &mdash; one of a long series of murders they have been responsible for.  Their primary tactic in disclosing the fact that this document has come into their hands is to seek to draw a cloak of spurious legitimacy over that murder and try to direct attention from the fact that what has actually happened is that ruthless terrorists have arrogated to themselves the role of judge, jury and executioner on the basis that the victim was somebody whom the gardaí wanted to interview.  These are the same people who would be first to claim the full protection of the rule of law and of the principle of innocent until proven guilty for their own members.  It is sickening hypocrisy that at the same time they blatantly deny that protection to others day in and day out with the horrific consequences that we are all only too familiar with.  Their secondary tactic in this matter is to try to make mischief for the Garda Síochána, and indirectly the Government, hoping thereby also to distract public attention and awareness from their murderous campaign.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the House, side by side with its expression of understandable concern about the Garda investigation <Col N="111" /> and what gave rise to it, will join with me in condemning in no uncertain terms the appalling deed which these murderers are now attempting to justify.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I join with the Minister in adding our condemnation of the brutal acts of violence daily occurring on both sides in Northern Ireland. There is no suggestion of criticising in any way the excellent work of the Garda Síochána.  Would the Minister agree that this is perhaps aimed at torpe-doing the forthcoming talks on Northern Ireland?  Is it his opinion that this leakage took place via the security forces in Northern Ireland and not from any source connected with the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The secondary tactic of the Provisionals is to try to make mischief for the Garda Síochána and the Government, hoping to distract public attention and awareness from their murderous campaign.  There are probably other side issues as well.  Regarding the source of this document, it would be appropriate to wait for the very thorough, wide ranging and complete inquiry and investigation which will be carried out by a chief superintendent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In agreeing entirely with the Minister in his comments with regard to the tactics and intent of the Provisional IRA and re-echoing his view that we cannot be deflected from the first base proposition of the callous murder of an innocent person by the Provisional IRA, is the Minister satisfied that the inquiry should be an internal one within the Garda Síochána or is there any point in suggesting that an independent source, such as a senior judicial person, or an expanded role of the Garda Complaints Board would be more appropriate for inquiring into these matters?  Is the inquiry likely to be of a cross-Border nature in attempting to establish the source?  Will the co-operation of the <Col N="112" /> RUC be sought in the course of the investigation? Finally, does the Minister propose to make any recommendations to the chief superintendent in the course of the inquiry because it seems to many of us in this House and elsewhere that the circulation of this document, while necessary, appears to be on a wider basis than perhaps is good for security?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic allegation that an unauthorised person was in possession of an internal Garda document is on the face of it evidence of a criminal offence and it is necessary that such an allegation be investigated by the Garda Síochána. The wider implications of the allegation are matters which are relevant to internal Garda procedures and it is entirely appropriate that this matter be investigated by the Garda authorities.  I am satisfied that the investigation which has been initiated by the Garda Commissioner will be thorough, wide ranging and complete, as I have already said, and they are the appropriate people to carry it out.  The Garda Complaints Board, for example, would be totally inappropriate.  As far as cross-Border co-operation is concerned, of course, the chief superintendent will accept and welcome information from whichever source that will help him in his inquiry into what is on the face of it a criminal matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree with the condemnation of violence irrespective of what side it comes from.  Will the Minister confirm whether the file referred to had been passed on to the RUC and if it had, will he be pressing the authorities in Northern Ireland to carry out a parallel investigation in their jurisdiction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The circulation of <i>Fógra Tóra</i> is to the officers and stations of the Garda Síochána.  A certain number of copies also go to the RUC because some of the people who are wanted could be on that side of the Border.  Some copies also go to police forces around the world because they work in close co-operation in tackling terrorism from whatever source and in whatever country it comes <Col N="113" /> from.  We will welcome assistance from whatever source it comes in relation to the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that incidents like this are a risk to the security of the State?  Does the Minister accept his responsibility as Minister for Justice, and the responsibility of the Government, to see to it that confidential documents of this nature are not circulated in such a way that it can possibly be made available to subversives? Will the Minister accept his responsibility in seeing to it that the inquiry will be completed as quickly as possible?  Will the Minister give us an assurance that if he is not satisfied that the inquiry is proceeding as quickly as he would like he will take a personal interest and see to it that other steps are taken to clearly clarify who is responsible in this instance?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that serious damage is done to the morale of the rank and file members of the Garda Síochána when the good name of the Garda Síochána is dragged into an incident like this? Does the Minister accept that the trust that has been built up between the Garda Síochána and the RUC in trying to deal with subversives and suppress terrorism can be seriously damaged if we are not prepared to face up to our responsibilities and deal with them quickly?  Does he accept that the Minister and the Government should be seen to be to the forefront in ensuring that this incident is cleared up as quickly as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that on learning of a journalist from Derry being given a photocopy of this document I was involved immediately. The Commissioner nominated a chief superintendent from the Dublin region to commence an investigation into the matter.  I treat this as a very serious matter but, of course, I must say to the Deputy that one should not over state the situation in relation to this being damaging to the good name of the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána are doing an excellent job across the country and <Col N="114" /> all Members recognise this.  With regard to the damage that can be done to the State by this incident, the Garda Síochána are there to protect the State.  I can assure the Deputy, and the House, that the Government will make every resource available to them to come to a speedy conclusion of this investigation. However, it is important that we have a full, thorough and complete investigation. We do not want to have a rushed or incomplete investigation.  It is essential to get to the bottom of this and whatever lessons learned from it will be taken on board and acted upon in relation to the security of documents.</P>
      <P>The one thing the Deputy must remember in relation to this document and documents of this type, is that to be effective and bring about the effect for which they are designed, they have to have a wide circulation.  I can give an assurance that whatever action is necessary on my part, I will take it on behalf of the Government and the people of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I still have one Private Notice Question and I hope Deputy Enright's question will be the last supplementary question on this topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other speakers, and the Minister, in condemning the atrocities committed by the Provisional IRA throughout the length and breadth of Ireland and atrocities carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force and other such groups.  Is the Minister in a position to state the number of Garda and RUC personnel who would receive this document?  Is it furnished to all stations? Will the Minister furnish us with that information?  Will the results of this inquiry be made public?  Will the Minister come before the House when the report of the inquiry is presented to him?  Does the Minister intend to issue a directive to the Garda Commissioner to ensure that the maximum safety precautions for such a document are adhered to?  That is essential. Finally, does the Minister support me in totally refuting and contradicting the statement made by the mid-Ulster <Col N="115" /> MP, Rev. William McCrea that many Unionists have grave suspicions that collusion is rampant between the Garda Síochána and the IRA.  I ask the Minister to refute that statement strongly, as I do.  The Garda Síochána have made a wonderful effort and members have lost their lives in tackling the Provisional IRA.  Such a slur on the Garda Síochána should not be allowed pass without being refuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Commissioner is well aware of his responsibilities and carries them out to the letter in relation to the confidentiality of information in his possession. With regard to the publication of the report, as it will be a Garda report into what on the face of it is a criminal offence that element of the report will be private because it may go to the DPP but, eventually, it will be published.  However, whatever recommendations in relation to the handling of such documents are made by the chief superintendent, I can assure the Deputy will be the subject of statements if appropriate.  With regard to the good name of the Garda Síochána, we are very fortunate to have approximately 11,000 men and women working on our behalf on a 24-hour basis, 365 days of the year in close co-operation with the community.  I have absolute confidence in the way they serve the people here.</P>
      <P>This matter will be fully investigated by the chief superintendent and his backup team.  I do not want to make any premature statements in relation to what may be his conclusions on the termination of this investigation.</P>

If the Deputy has a question I will agree reluctantly to hear it because normally Private Notice Questions are confined to those Deputies who initially place a question having been given permission to raise it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Before posing my question I would like to express my appreciation and offer the Minister my congratulations on the manner in which he dealt with this matter in his initial reply.  I want to place on record that the Minister has my full support in this matter.</P>
      <P>The one matter that appears to be annoying the family, particularly the father, as spokesman of the family, is that, while apparently this young man was wanted by the police force in Northern Ireland and by the Garda authorities here and crossed the Border between Castlefin and Castlederg very frequently, almost daily, when asked to produce his driving licence, which included his photograph, he was never arrested.  This is puzzling his family enormously.  Can the Minister say whether there is an explanation for that: if he was on the wanted list why was he not arrested?</P>

For example, if it is not completed within a certain period, of say a week, will he please return to the House and tell us what further steps he proposes taking so that we can debate this matter in the interests of the nation as a whole and not allow people to achieve their sole aim which is to see the talks about to commence break down and to use every occasion to endeavour to drive a wedge between the two sides before they even commence talking to one another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agreed, following consultation with my colleagues, the Ministers for Finance and Labour, in October 1990, to a request from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for the establishment of a liaison group involving senior officials of my Department and representatives of the ICTU unions concerned.  A series of meetings of the liaison group have been held over recent months in a positive and co-operative spirit.</P>
      <P>For my part I have made substantial concessions from our opening position in response to the legitimate concerns which the ICTU group have expressed.  I accept that the ICTU group have also made corresponding concessions.  I am confident that, with continued goodwill on all sides, we can reach a satisfactory solution which will enable us all to achieve our common goal, which is a strong and competitive Irish company on our major trading routes utilising Irish maritime expertise.</P>
      <P>The trade union representatives confirmed in a joint press statement with my Department issued on 5 April that they were prepared to positively co-operate with the sale of B &amp; I to Irish Ferries provided they got adequate assurances on key conditions affecting their members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me briefly comment on each of these issues: the first is a clearly defined investment programme.  Irish Continental Group have given the trade unions a clear indication of their investment plans for the company.  This amounts to an <Col N="120" /> investment of over £30 million in upgrading and replacement of ships over the next three to five years which will be funded by borrowings and by Irish Continental Group's cash flow.  This represents a substantial investment in the future of the company and is concrete proof of the commitment of the new owner to the development of a strong Irish company on all our major trading routes.  In fairness, I must say that the trade unions accept it as such also.  Therefore, I am convinced that this key demand is being met.  The second condition relates to security of employment.</P>
    <P>The Irish Continental Group have presented their proposals to the trade unions for the reorganisation of B &amp; I.  These involved gross redundancies of 269 and net redundancies of 253.  This is the lowest number of redundancies of any proposal I have received in relation to the acquisition of B &amp; I.  The Irish Continential Group informed the trade unions that their proposals will secure the future by making B &amp; I a competitive company, providing a top class service to customers and security and good conditions for all its employees.</P>
    <P>The third condition relates to terms and conditions of employment.  We all accept that changes must be made in this area if the company is to become more competitive and survive.  The changes needed are a matter for agreement between the trade unions and the Irish Continental Group who must take account of their commercial implications.</P>
    <P>However I must express my disappointment at the fact that a strike has been called by the trade unions without any negotiations on the Irish Continental Group proposals which were presented to them on Friday last.</P>
    <P>The fourth condition relates to our strategic national shipping interest.</P>
    <P>I want to assure this House, as I have the trade unions concerned, that the Government accept the need for the protection of our strategic national shipping interest.  Following some positive suggestions put forward by the B &amp; I Group of Unions, we have agreed to produce a mutually acceptable formula which will <Col N="121" /> recognise the common interest we both share in this area.  The final key condition relates to industrial democracy.  Again this is a problem which can be solved amicably.  ICG, Irish Continental Group, have offered to consider a sub-board structure to meet this condition.</P>
    <P>Overall I am sure the House will agree that substantial progress has been made on this issue.  The General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions wrote to me on 11 April last stating that ICTU were convinced that the current discussions between all interested parties on the restructuring of B &amp; I could be dealt with peacefully and constructively provided certain issues were addressed.</P>
    <P>I responded to him expressing my confidence that, with goodwill on all sides, a satisfactory solution could be reached which would enable all concerned to achieve the common goal of creating a strong and competitive Irish shipping company on our major trading routes utilising Irish maritime expertise.</P>
    <P>That is my stated public stance and my firm belief.</P>
    <P>We have a company which everybody, including the trade unions' financial advisers, agrees is facing major cash difficulties. We have a unique opportunity to preserve all that is good in that company, and there are many good things in it, in a new strong and development oriented Irish shipping line.  We all want to achieve this but if we cannot get agreement on how it can be achieved, then we will have to reassess our position.</P>
    <P>In view of the severe constraints on the public finances, the Government have decided to end Exchequer support for B &amp; I at the earliest possible time. Having examined all the options for achieving this, the Government are convinced that the sale to ICG offers the best prospects for securing the future of the company and its employees.</P>
    <P>Let me be clear about one thing.  This is the best deal possible for B &amp; I and the taxpayer.  It offers a future for B &amp; I as part of an enlarged Irish company strong enough to meet competition.  Over £100 million has been invested in B &amp; I by the taxpayer, with a similar sized <Col N="122" /> estimate required over the next decade. This had to stop.  I appeal to those involved to call off the strike tomorrow, to talk out the situation urgently and to see this deal through.  The alternative is very bleak and I could not guarantee that B &amp; I would remain in business if this sale were not to proceed immediately.</P>
    <P>To conclude, let me say again that I am confident we can resolve current problems relating to the future of B &amp; I. I am today inviting the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to meet with my Department as soon as possible to see how this matter can be progressed.</P>

      <P>Regrettably, the earlier part of the Minister's contribution is unrecognisable from the version I received today from the group of unions involved.  May I refer the Minister to article 84 of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which specifically requires that there will be no change in the ownership structure of any commercial semi-State company unless it is in the best interests of the employees and there is the consultation to which the Minister referred?  Does the Minister agree that there can be no negotiations with the unions when only the unions are prepared to negotiate?  Is he aware of the correspondence issued to every worker in B &amp; I at the weekend setting out in unequivocal terms the new conditions which are drastically inferior to the conditions they now enjoy, and that these new conditions are on a take it or leave it basis.  Contrary to what the Minister has said about commitments in the area of an investment programme, there are no commitments that in any way assuage the fears of the unions.  There are no commitments to investment in the company or to industrial democracy nor, indeed, is there any assurance that certain routes will not be sold off.  Therefore, the strategic interest of the company in the shipping sense has not been assured. In terms of his commitment to meet the Congress of Trade Unions on this matter now will the Minister agree to meet the trade unions directly concerned so that what appears to be an extraordinary gulf <Col N="123" /> in his information on this dispute can be put to him directly?</P>

      <P>Quite the contrary, I think the Deputy's information is way behind, I have met the Congress of Trade Unions on this matter and I have met the group of trade unions.  I had a meeting arranged for today but unfortunately the officials involved in the unions had to change it but they are coming to see me very shortly.  There was a liaison group between my Department and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions going back to last October which met on a regular basis. I doubt if there has ever been an issue in which there has been so much consultation between the unions and the Department concerned.  There has been day-in day-out consultations between my Department, the unions involved, the Department of Labour and the company. The Deputy must understand that the company involved in the proposed purchase of the B &amp; I company are a privately owned company and there are certain limits to which any Minister can go in dictating to them.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister confirm that the statement I have here &mdash; this was issued yesterday by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions&mdash;makes quite clear the version of events I have outlined and is seeking the involvement of the Minister to cause negotiations to happen, because there have been no negotiations across the table that in any way reassure the union concerned; it has been a take it or leave it situation?  Specifically, may I ask the Minister whether, on the other conditions that he chose not to put on the record of the House, there is any movement on the part of the Government? For example, will the Government at this stage confirm, agreeing to the union demand, that there ought to be a special share retained by him when this company are privatised as happened in the case of the Sugar Company?</P>

Would the Minister agree that the goodwill is forthcoming from the group of unions and that the strike which is about to take place tomorrow is the result of the lack of goodwill on the part of the Irish Continental Group and the Minister's Department.

Over the next few days I will be looking forward to a meeting with the group of unions and we will see how we can progress the matter.  I must remind the Deputy that the future of the company was looked at very carefully and professionally.  A number of options were examined.  Invitations were sought from the marketplace to look at the future of the company.  The one that best suited and gave B &amp; I a future is the one which is on the table.  The Deputy needs to concern himself with the possible alternatives to seeing this operation through.  I am determined that we will see it through and that we will see a strong Irish company operating our major strategic routes.  I appreciate that the company workforce have made substantial sacrifices over many years.  I am trying to preserve a company, to put it on strategic routes and ensure its continuance on those routes.</P>
      <P>I am trying to ensure the future of the company.  After looking at the entire marketplace I am satisfied that this is the only sensible way forward involving the least number of redundancies.  I again appeal to the unions involved to work with me to secure the future of B &amp; I.</P>

Does the Minister consider it reasonable that one of the <Col N="126" /> proposals put to the unions is that 95 per cent of the entire white collar staff would be put on a recruitment grade at an average pay reduction of about £5,000 per head?  Are they the kind of reasonable negotiations the Minister is endorsing in the House?</P>

    <Title>European Council Meeting: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the meeting of the European Council with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gerard Collins, in Luxembourg on 8 April last. Since the meeting was informal, there were no formal conclusions.  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the Gulf War and its consequences for the Twelve. The situation of the Kurdish minority in Iraq became critical in the days immediately before the meeting.  As a result it was this aspect of the consequences of the Gulf War which became the major topic at the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meeting condemned the brutal Iraqi repression of large sections of its own population, in particular the Kurds, and considered that the resultant situation might be considered a threat to international peace and security.  This view of the European Council is a reflection of the seriousness with which the 12 Heads of State or Government view the repression of millions of its own population by the Iraqi leadership.  Once it is determined by the Security Council that a threat to international peace and security exists, the UN Charter provides for a number of means which will enable international peace and security to be restored.  For their part, the Twelve consider sanctions imposed on Iraq because of its invasion and annexation of Kuwait should be maintained if the Iraqi repression continued.  Since the 8 April meeting, the Twelve have agreed at Foreign Minister level to investigate the personal responsibility of the Iraqi leadership for possible breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and of the <Col N="278" /> Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in connection with their treatment of their own population, and the Twelve will be in touch with the UN Secretary-General in this regard.</P>
    <P>There was a unanimous determination by the European Council on 8 April to act rapidly in order to provide humanitarian aid to the refugees, of whom it is estimated now that there are a total of up to two million, resulting in human suffering of truly appalling dimensions.  The European Council decided that a total of 150 million ECUs should be provided for immediate aid, 100 million ECUs from the Community budget and 50 million ECUs by the member states.  This means that, between our share of the Community budget contribution and our own national contribution to the Community programme, the Irish Government will be providing aid worth £1 million to help the Kurds.  In addition to the Government's contribution, a further £550,000 has been raised by the Irish Red Cross, and further very significant amounts are being generously provided by other charitable agencies.  These further sums are composed of gifts by the public.  In addition, there is significant aid in kind both from the State and from private sources.</P>
    <P>The Heads of State and Government were determined to get food aid to the Kurds immediately.  Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the nine countries which are members of the Western European Union held a brief meeting in the margins of the European Council and decided to avail of the logistical support of that organisation to supply aid to the Kurds. At my proposal, it was agreed that those countries which are not members of the Western European Union, including Ireland, could use civil aircraft to transport aid; and Deputies will have noted that an Irish Government-Red Cross plane with substantial quantities of shelter items, clothing, medical supplies and food has already flown to the area.  As my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has pointed out, the plane arrived safely on schedule and was met by our <Col N="279" /> Ambassador in Teheran.  The cargo was unloaded immediately and put onto trucks to be sent to the refugee areas in the north-west of Iran.</P>
    <P>It was the clear view of the European Council that the provision of humanitarian aid to the Kurds is not a sufficient reponse to the situation they are now facing.  The meeting considered the establishment in Iraq of safe havens or zones where refugees could feel secure from repression so that humanitarian aid could effectively be supplied to them. But against the background of numerous deaths of innocent people exposed to extreme conditions in which delivery of adequate assistance is very difficult, the Heads of State or Government were convinced of the need to provide refugees with adequate security in which they could benefit from the aid now being massively supplied.</P>
    <P>I welcome the news of the most recent development in this desperate and unprecedented situation, the establishment in a purely humanitarian spirit of about half a dozen encampments in Northern Iraq for the orderly distribution of supplies to Kurdish refugees.  I believe it is legitimate to take such measures, which might not in more normal circumstances be contemplated. The idea of such enclaves received the unanimous support in Luxembourg of the European Council.</P>
    <P>So far there is no specific proposal as to how this will be arranged but the question will be pursued through the United Nations.  It will be for the United Nations to determine the precise modalities of its implementation.  The Secretary-General has sent a representative to Iraq, Turkey and Iran in pursuit of his humanitarian efforts.  This representative is to report forthwith on the plight of the Iraqi civilian population, and in particular the Kurdish population, suffering from the repression in all its forms inflicted by the Iraqi authorities.  The Secretary-General's representative arrived in the region last weekend.  It is anticipated that more than 50 relief workers will be in position by the end of this week, thus providing a UN presence on the ground.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> The meeting also discussed the situation in the Middle East in the aftermath of the Gulf War.  The European Council paid tribute to the irreplaceable role which the United Nations had played throughout the crisis.  It was agreed that the three conditions for peace in the Middle East are, first, a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian issue; second, greater democratic legitimacy of Governments in the region; and, third, economic development as well as the reduction of the great inequalities of income there.  There is now, perhaps, an opportunity to promote a definitive peace settlement in the long running Arab-Israeli dispute.  The Community is prepared to play its full part in promoting such a settlement and the Twelve are operating in close co-ordination with the United States to this end.</P>
    <P>The European Council, therefore, confirmed that it is important that the Community should have a role in the search for peace in the region and expressed support for the efforts currently being undertaken by President Bush.  It is essential that now, in the aftermath of the war, there should be political progress.  The principles which must be observed are incorporated in the UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, concerning the Arab-Israeli conflict and the principle of territory being exchanged for peace; the right of Israel to secure and recognised frontiers and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. There was also emphasis on respect for human rights and the improvement of living conditions in the Occupied Territories.</P>
    <P>The meeting considered that, as regards security after the war, this is principally a matter for the states concerned. The importance of a check on the accumulation of conventional armaments was underlined.  Ministers for Foreign Affairs are to be asked to formulate proposals concerning the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the region.  We are all conscious now of the fact that an important contributory factor to the outbreak of war in the Gulf on 2 <Col N="281" /> August last was the massive arms buildup over the last year by Iraq.  Far from promoting stability in the region, this build-up was a very significant element in the instability which finally resulted in war.  It will be necessary to make a special effort to reduce the level of armaments, especially of weapons of mass destruction, in the region as a whole.</P>
    <P>The European Community will be contributing to the economic development of the area and in particular to the emergency efforts at reconstruction and at responding to the grave pollution problems in the Gulf.</P>
    <P>There was a discussion of the long term implications of the Gulf War for the common foreign and security policy of the Community, and it was agreed that it was important to pursue actively the negotiations on this subject in the Inter-governmental Conference on Political Union.  These negotiations are going ahead according to the time-table laid down at the European Council in Dublin in June of last year.</P>
    <P>I also had a brief meeting in Luxembourg with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, at which we discussed matters of interest to our two countries in the Community and bilaterally.  We agreed in principle to meet again in the near future for a more substantial discussion on Community issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Summit in Luxembourg was important in that it gave the necessary impetus and EC backing to the British proposal for the establishment of safe havens in Iraq for the displaced Kurdish refugees living &mdash; and unfortunately dying &mdash; in appalling conditions on the Turkish border.  It also approved an aid package of 150 million ECU, of which two-thirds will come from the European Community budget, and the balance from the national budgets of the Twelve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that safe havens for the Kurds are now being established in northern Iraq.  I am thrilled with the generosity of the Irish people in their magnificent response to the appeal for funds.  However, I am ashamed of the <Col N="282" /> contribution of the Irish Government by way of official aid which has been so meagre and miserable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is exactly in proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a moment.  All civilised people are utterly appalled at the situation of the Kurds of whom at present upwards of 1,000 per day, mostly babies and the elderly, are dying.  Every humanitarian instinct cries out for support to be given to them and the generosity of the Irish people has resulted in very substantial sums flowing to the aid agencies, in particular to the Irish Red Cross, Concern and Trócaire. Unfortunately, it must be said that the generosity of the Irish people has not been matched by the Government whose official contribution at national level has been pretty miserable.</P>
      <P>I accept that a contribution has been &mdash; or will be &mdash; made because of our share of the European Community contribution. In relation to that, the Taoiseach's statement is somewhat confusing &mdash; two-thirds of the Community contribution will come from the existing EC budget and I am interested in what element of additionality there may be.  I now find that the £1 million which has been talked about at Government level includes taking credit for the existing EC budget contribution, the additional sum which is being paid because of the inter-governmental agreement, which is one-third of the EC contribution and it is not clear whether the £200,000 contributed at home is also included.  The position of the sum of £100,000 mentioned by the Minister for Foreign Affairs is also not clear.  The situation is very confused indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to make is that in relation to the funds made available at home &mdash; as opposed to taking credit for what may go through the EC budget &mdash; which would probably go to the Sudan if it did not go to the Kurds, the amount pledged so far at official level is £200,000 to the Irish Red Cross.  By comparison with the sums of money generously <Col N="283" /> donated by individuals and companies all over the country &mdash; and even taking into account our EC contribution &mdash; this is a very meagre sum.  Putting it in perspective, the £200,000 is less than the amount spent from the Exchequer to cover one hour's social welfare which costs £7 million per day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is £300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the perspective of what we are prepared to do and my criticism of the Government in that regard is well merited.  The implication that further money is not needed would be laughable if it was not for the seriousness of the problem.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, said on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on Tuesday: &ldquo;If there is a further need we will play our part in it&rdquo;.  The needs are so enormous and the requirements so urgent that it is difficult to understand how the Minister could make such a statement.  The Irish Government should match, pound for pound, the contribution of the Irish people which would provide additional encouragement to those contributing who would then know that £2 worth of food and blankets would be available to the Kurdish refugees for every £1 they give.</P>
      <P>Following Question Time today, it now appears that a sum not exceeding a further £100,000 will be made available by way of official aid here.  I am not satisfied with this; I know there are a number of applications before the Department for assistance, the total of which is more than £100,000.  For instance, Trócaire have an application to the Department at present for an immediate contribution of £50,000 and Concern have an application to the Department for a contribution of £100,000.  Those two agencies alone have applications for immediate contributions which are greater than the amount which will be donated from official sources by way of aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be difficulties for the Government in the light of the savage cuts which have been inflicted over the <Col N="284" /> last three years in the official aid budget. I invite the Government to submit to the House immediately a Supplementary Estimate &mdash; I guarantee support on the Opposition benches &mdash; which will enable the Government to provide a reasonable sum by way of support for the Kurdish people.  I emphasise that any such support should be for those not just on the Turkish border but for those on the border of Iran.  It is fair to say that in the past Iran attracted a fair amount of international criticism but it is also fair to say that it has shown enormous generosity in the way in which it opened its borders to a huge number of refugees and attempted to cope with the almost overwhelming problems which confronted them.</P>
    <P>Needs are absolutely enormous and urgent.  The Irish people are speaking with their contributions which are mounting by the hour and by the day.  Let us all follow that lead given by the Irish people and ensure that the moneys contributed so generously and voluntarily will be matched at official level pound for pound.</P>
    <P>I do accept that as pointed out at the summit, there are enormous problems at the political end in providing security for the Kurds.  I notice that the usual propaganda mills are now churning out views and comments seeking to blame the United States, the United Kingdom and even the United Nations for the awful situation in which the Kurds now find themselves.  Some of those comments are from those who a month ago criticised the allies for enforcing the UN writ in the liberation of Kuwait and claimed at that time that they were exceeding the scope of the UN resolution; they are now blaming them for not going as far as Baghdad to depose Saddam Hussein.</P>
    <P>Let us be blunt about the situation. The 100 per cent cause of the problem is the brutal ruler of Iraq, Saddam Hussein. It is not the first time he has shown such savagery to the Kurds.  I note the latest proposal in the European Community to have him tried for war crimes, but who will arrest him and bring him before an international court?  The principles of the 1945 London Charter that established that court were unanimously confirmed <Col N="285" /> by the UN General Assembly in 1946 and they were than spelled out by the UN International Law Commission in 1950.</P>
    <P>The 1948 Assembly also adopted an international convention pledging all signatories to prosecute and punish all persons guilty of genocide&rdquo; whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private individuals&rdquo;.  It did not, however, say how they should do it. Thus the concept of international crime and universal jurisdiction exists, but there is no mechanism to implement it. Despite massive violations of international law the principles have never been applied since Nuremberg.</P>
    <P>I would be quite happy to see Saddam Hussein tried for war crimes but I do not want this proposal to distract in any way from the 100 per cent effort that must be given to providing an immediate solution to the problem of Kurdish refugees.  In many ways, even though the numbers are greater on the Iran border, political problems there are somewhat easier.  The difficulty there is aid and support for the efforts of Teheran.  These efforts must be fully supported particularly bearing in mind the enormous numbers involved.</P>
    <P>Political problems have been more difficult on the Turkish border.  These difficulties arise because Turkey has not opened its borders.  Before we rush to condemn Turkey we must bear in mind that this country did so three years ago and took in 68,000 refugees who are still there, with little or no assistance from the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>Turkey is not a wealthy nation; in fact quite the contrary.  I would hope that financial indemnities could be given to Turkey by the wealthy nations to cover the cost of refugees allowed into that country.  Turkey has, of course, also internal political problems because of its own indigenous Kurdish population.  One way or the other, there is no future for the refugees up in the mountains where such enormous numbers are dying at present.  If they are not to go in to Turkey, the only place for them to go is back to Iraq.  Needless to say, they are terrified of the vengeance and brutality of Saddam Hussein and this is the background to <Col N="286" /> the safe haven proposal of British Prime Minister John Major.</P>
    <P>I am glad the European Community, and now the United States, supported this proposal for the creation of safe havens in northern Iraq.  Part of the difficulty has been the international law aspect of providing such safe havens even on a temporary basis, but many experts will argue that the rule of law flowing from the enforcement of the 1948 Convention against Genocide is sufficient to justify their establishment.  The present proposals are, in any event, regarded as being within the terms of United Nations Security Council Resolution 688.</P>
    <P>In any event, it was clear that the civilised world was crying out for a solution. Shakespeare's comment that desperate situations require desperate remedies was never more appropriate.  I believe that Baghdad's condemnation of the proposal must be ignored.  In so far as Ireland can play any role in helping to implement a solution, it must be in the forefront of so doing.</P>
    <P>In the medium term I believe there is need for development of international law and an amendment of the UN Charter. At the moment the undue emphasis on national sovereignty has resulted in the Pol Pots, the Idi Amins and the Saddam Husseins of the world having free rein to commit appalling crimes against humanity within their own borders. Ireland could and should take a lead in proposing changes that will allow international action to be taken against the worst of these excesses in the future.</P>
    <P>Dealing with other aspects of the Summit in Luxembourg it originally was to have a three part agenda, all of which was to deal with the lessons to be learned and action to be taken in the wake of the Gulf War.  In fact, the Summit was initially called because of the fractured and divided response by the European Community to the crisis in the Gulf.  The agenda was to include the future of the Middle East and the maintenance of security in the region; a solution to the political problems there and the extent of the backing to be given to the initiative set in motion by the United States.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> Because of the focus on the problem of the Kurds, the broader problems of the Middle East were not dealt with.  That has not meant that these problems have been resolved and it will be necessary for the European Community to get back to these problems and establish a coherent and positive role in the search for solutions in the region.  I agree with the Taoiseach that this should be along the lines suggested in the UN Security Council's Resolutions 242 and 338.</P>
    <P>It is also to be noted that at the same time as the Summit meeting Foreign Ministers of the nine EC countries that make up the Western European Union held a meeting that included the Turkish Ambassador with the aim of co-ordinating military and logistical help to distribute the aid to the Kurds.  For the first time a member of the Commission, Frans Andriessen, also attended the meeting. Greece and Denmark who are outside the Western European Union agreed to send their Foreign Ministers as observers. The only country not represented was Ireland.  The only excuse given by the Taoiseach was that it would not at this stage be appropriate for us to be present.</P>
    <P>This kind of situation where we were not even able to attend the meeting which was for the purpose of co-ordinating help and distributing aid to the Kurds shows how ridiculous our present stance is.  It further highlights the need for a clear sighted approach on our part to the questions of European Political Union, the need for clarification of the various options, the need for a full examination of our present policy of neutrality and the need for a White Paper setting out policy options for the future.  At the moment we are groping in the dark on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis which is no benefit whatever to the country.  The case for a White Paper on Europe becomes more urgent by the day.</P>
    <P>We now know what the Government are against on the question of political union in Europe, but we have no idea what the Government are for.</P>
    <P>We have no idea why the Government consider that European defence should not be considered at this stage and &ldquo;is <Col N="288" /> one of the areas that should be left for a further stage&rdquo; in the words of Foreign Affairs Minister Deputy Gerry Collins. Why it will be in order at a further stage and cannot be considered now is not explained.</P>
    <P>The ambiguous position of the Government is similar in proposals to increase the powers of the European Parliament. The Minister resisted these proposals at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting on Monday.  However, he has not specified why or indeed what additional powers, if any, this Government would like given to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Government to clearly establish their policy on these and other issues of European Political union.  In that situation there might be some hope that a clearly established and well argued Irish viewpoint would be taken into account in the negotiations at the Inter-governmental Conference.</P>
    <P>Finally, there was, I understand, a ten minute meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister on the margins of the Council meeting at which it was agreed in principle to meet again. To be honest, it is difficult to see how much more could be agreed at such a brief meeting.  The point I would make at this stage is that it highlights the need for a top level meeting between our two countries.  It was interesting that the meeting between Deputy John Bruton, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, and John Major, the British Prime Minister, last week was the first meeting in Downing Street between leaders from our two countries since 1986.  I think the present Taoiseach will find that there is a lot in common both in relation to Northern Ireland and the future of Europe which would warrant the elected leaders of the two countries having a full and detailed discussion.  I would recommend that there be no further delay in arranging such a meeting.</P>

      <P>I stand corrected. <Col N="289" /> The Taoiseach confirms that historically the point made is not correct but I do believe that issues in relation to Northern Ireland, in relation to the future of Europe on which we have so much in common and in which there are areas to be teased out where there are differences between us make it the most absolute sense that there should be full and regular meetings between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister.</P>
      <P>The Dáil should be able to keep the awful plight of the Kurds under review. The Taoiseach saw the frustration of both back-benchers and frontbenchers in the House today at their inability to pursue the issue at Question Time. Therefore, I urge the Taoiseach to agree to a full debate on the issue as it unfolds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed the Gulf War in this House on 18 January last before the land war had started and when the number of casualties was small.  On that occasion I said I believed that before the debate would be over upwards of 20,000 people would be dead, thousands would be maimed and injured in the Gulf, that the dead and injured would include soldiers, civilians, men, women and children, that one in ten would have died from extensive burns, that up to half would have died from brain damage and that many of those injured would suffer from psychiatric conditions for the rest of their lives.  I predicted that the statistics in relation to death and suffering would grow and they would be compounded by the abject horrible terror with which hundreds of thousands of families in the Gulf would have to cope.  I said that we were debating the Gulf War in the relative comfort of this House and from a distance and we could have no real concept of the suffering the war and causing and would cause for years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points I made in that contribution in January was wrong because it is now clear that when the casualties of this war are counted, if they are ever counted, they will run to many tens of thousands of people, perhaps even to 250,000 people.  The fact that most of the <Col N="290" /> casualties will be on one side does not alter the horror of the carnage now visible in the Middle East.  Those casualties include tens of thousands of unwilling conscripts, many of them killed in retreat, and perhaps tens of thousands of civilians.  That, of course, is only part of the story.</P>
    <P>The ecological damage has been immense and it will last for many years. Hundreds of thousands of families will be homeless and hungry and the cost of rebuilding will run to billions of pounds. Perhaps the most ironic twist in this unfortunate saga is that this war to protect the oil supplies of the West has led to billions of barrels of oil being burned off into the atmosphere on an hourly basis.  As the construction companies jostle for contracts and as armament suppliers wonder how they can get in on the act the world has to count what may be the greatest cost of all, the arrival of a new world order which was shepherded into being by Cruise and Scud missiles.</P>
    <P>The greatest tragedy has been that the new world order has been so far largely incapable of dealing with the catastrophe which has befallen the Kurdish people. Until the television and newspaper reporters and cameramen of the world began to show the true horror of the genocidal war against the Kurds &mdash; I want to take this opportunity in passing to pay tribute to our newspaper reporters and, in particular, RTE whose reports have been both moving and accurate &mdash; it seemed that the great powers of the world were willing to let the whole issue be swept under the carpet.  I have to say that I cannot understand how the greatest and most sophisticated nations in history in terms of the technology available to them can mount an incredibly complex operation to ensure military success in respect of the rescue of Kuwait and yet dither for weeks in respect of the rescue of the Kurdish people.  The truth is that the cost of continuing the Gulf War for one day more would have done a great deal to minimise the agony being suffered by the Kurds at present.  History will harshly judge the failure of the world to respond to their most pressing need with the same <Col N="291" /> sense of urgency as was applied in the case of Kuwait.  If the world continues to fail to act meaningfully history will conclude that it was only when the economic interests of the West were involved that the West was capable of moving quickly and that humanitarian considerations were always, sadly, secondary considerations.</P>
    <P>The Kurdish issue raises all sorts of fundamental questions of principle for us. In the last Dáil debate I argued that I would be prepared to offer landing rights and refuelling facilities to any aircraft of any nation which wants to use such facilities for humanitarian purposes.  If those aircraft are carrying medical supplies or personnel to a war zone or carrying wounded personnel away from that zone they should be made welcome here. We do not need to know in whose cause they were hurt.  All we need to know is that people who are wounded or dying must never be turned away.  Let there be no misunderstanding about this.  In view of the announcement by President Bush last night, if there is any question of facilities being required in Ireland for over-flights or landings in carrying rescue to the Kurds they must be granted immediately and without question.  I would go further.  If it is necessary for reasons of saving the Kurdish people for a United Nations military force to be interposed between the Kurds and the Iraqi army I would urge strongly that such a role is entirely in keeping with the United Nations peace-keeping mandate and that we should be prepared to support any such mission and participate in it.</P>
    <P>Considerations of national sovereignty are always vital.  The United Nations would not survive very long if we were to adopt a cavalier attitude to these considerations. However, it is both absurd and immoral in the face of a campaign of total genocide by Saddam Hussein to argue that consideration of national sovereignty must outweigh the rescuing and protection of a threatened people.  I repeat that these views are entirely in keeping with our vision of Ireland as a military neutral country, honouring its <Col N="292" /> international and moral obligation to those who are oppressed.</P>
    <P>This brings me to our other obligation, to contribute effectively and meaningfully to the relief of the suffering of the Kurdish refugees.  The Government have shamed our country in recent years by their attitude to international relief which has resulted in cut after cut in the overseas aid budget.  I say to the Taoiseach that this has to stop.  The least we are entitled to is that our Government are willing to reflect the generosity of the Irish people who have contributed in such large amounts not only to this cause but to many other causes over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>We should distinguish between what we have to do and what we want to do. There is no point in the Government boasting about the extent to which they meet their mandatory obligations as a member of the European Community. The Government should be prepared to announce here and how that they will match pound for pound the voluntary contributions of the Irish people.  Indeed, I would go further and say that the Government should introduce a positive incentive in the Finance Bill by way of tax relief to encourage people to give to the Third World and the crisis in the Middle East.  It is entirely arguable that charitable contributions are not the appropriate way to enable people to secure their rights at home but giving to charitable organisations is often the only way in which people can help to alleviate the suffering which we are witnessing in the Third World.  The cost of such an incentive would be very small to the Government and, if nothing else, would enable the Government to meet some of their obligations in this regard, obligations, which regrettably, have been shamefully neglected.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to come back to the fundamental question of principle which the Gulf War threw up.  I have never had any interest in defending the tyrant of Iraq or his activities in invading Kuwait.  I have always accepted that he would have to be stopped in his expansionist ambitions but the new world order <Col N="293" /> in rejecting a patient step by step approach to increasing pressure on him by economic sanctions has made the wrong choice and that it is a choice whose consequences will only be clear after years of bitterness and conflict in that troubled part of the world.  Furthermore, I believe that the world order has compounded that error by having turned its back for so long on the tragedy of the Kurdish people.  I would like to think that arising from the war there will be a new determination to address all of the problems and flashpoints of the region in the round, not by imposing solutions from the West but by the slower and more painful process of encouraging people to come together.  If there is a role in that process for us we should play it.  The only way we can do that is by committing ourselves afresh to the process of peace, including the peace-keeping role which we have always been prepared to play in the United Nations.</P>

      <P>I want to concentrate primarily on the issue of the Kurdish refugees.  I regret very much that the Government have decided to use what is a fairly restricted format of debate in the House, the procedure under Standing Orders for statements, in relation to the informal EC Summit in Luxembourg and the crisis now facing more than one million Kurdish refugees on the Turkish and Iranian borders with Iraq.  The format restricts participation to the Taoiseach and one speaker from each of the Opposition groups.  The Taoiseach indicated on the Order of Business this morning that he was prepared to consider a wider debate.  I hope he will initiate such a debate as soon as possible. It will give all of the Members who are anxious to contribute on this matter an opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties experienced by me and other Deputies in raising issues relating to the Gulf War illustrated very clearly the extremely restrictive nature of our procedures in this House and our inability to respond speedily to matters of great importance.  The fact that we are discussing a Summit that took place ten <Col N="294" /> days ago has already been referred to.  In relation to the Gulf War, apart from the initial special sitting, we failed to discuss the matter in any substantive way until the conflict was over.  I hope the House will not be similarly restricted in regard to the Kurdish crisis.</P>
    <P>The exodus of the Kurdish people from Iraq is on a scale virtually unprecedented in modern times.  Nobody is quite sure how many people have fled, but it is certainly believed to be in excess of one million.  While much of the public attention in the West has focused on those refugees on the Turkish/Iraqi border, there has been a similar influx of Kurds into Iran and that country has also had to cope with a huge number of Shi'ite refugees from the south of Iraq.</P>
    <P>Turkey and Iran are, by European standards, relatively poor and under-developed countries and cannot be expected to cope alone and out of their own resources with this influx of refugees. This is a problem for the world and there is a responsibility on all members of the international community, including Ireland, to respond in a responsible and generous manner to this crisis.  So far, the response of the international community has been too slow and too little.  The response of our own Government has been most disappointing and, once again they seem to be relying on voluntary organisations and the generosity of the Irish people to save our face.</P>
    <P>While there is of course a key role for voluntary organisations and individual contributions, the scale of the problem is such that it cannot be solved by voluntary effort alone.  What is needed is a combined effort by the wealthy, developed countries, under the co-ordination of the United Nations.  There is a particular obligation on President Bush, who encouraged the Kurdish people to rise up against Saddam Hussein, to now assist in the provision of the humanitarian aid necessary to cope with one of the consequences of his advice.</P>
    <P>People want to know how it is that virtually limitless planes, helicopters, personnel and money were available to <Col N="295" /> launch the Gulf War, while only a fraction of these resources are made available to deal with this appalling human disaster. How is it that it was possible to feed and provide shelter for half a million troops in the Saudi Arabian desert without undue difficulty, yet it is beyond the capacity of the same countries to mount anything more than a token effort for those dying of hunger on the side of a Turkish mountain?</P>
    <P>The immediate priority must be humanitarian aid; the search for a political solution must not be used as an excuse for tardiness on aid.  If the world does not provide the necessary resources to feed and clothe the refugees and to attend to their medical needs, then a large section of the Kurdish poulation will be wiped out.  Already there has been a substantial death toll among those on the Turkish border, and this is likely to increase as hunger, cold and lack of sanitation take their toll.</P>
    <P>One way in which this country could help would be to make available some of the huge quantity of food held in intervention. The Minister for Agriculture and Food told me in the Dáil in December last that a total of 326,000 tonnes of meat and dairy products, with a value of more than £290 million, were held in intervention by this country.  The cost of simply storing this huge hoard will, it is believed, amount to around £80 million this year.  These figures put Ireland's contribution of around £1 million to the Kurdish relief operation into perspective.</P>
    <P>Much of this food will remain in intervention until it is no longer usable and there is nothing to be lost by diverting it to the Kurdish relief operation.  While the 79,000 tonnes of butter is not likely to be suitable, ways could be found of using both the 92,000 tonnes of skim milk powder and the 155,000 tonnes of beef.</P>
    <P>When suggestions were made in the past that intervention stocks should be used for famine relief, the Government pointed to transport problems and the lack of a proper infrastructure in the African countries affected by drought. However, this situation is quite different. <Col N="296" /> Both Turkey and Iran have more developed infrastructures than the African countries, and are within easier reach.  It is immoral to allow this food remain locked in warehouses, while desperate Kurdish families are fighting for scraps of bread on the side of a Turkish mountain.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to give a commitment to make these stocks available. If the political will is there, ways can be found to overcome the technical problems.</P>
    <P>One of the factors which is exacerbating the plight of the refugees on the Turkish side is their physical location on the side of a mountain.  All of the problems of feeding and clothing them and providing shelter and sanitation are made more difficult as a result.  The Iranian authorities have been the subject of much international criticism in recent years, but they should be given credit for their humanitarian gesture in allowing all Kurdish and other refugees from Iraq into their country.  The Turkish Government on the other hand have resolutely refused to allow anything more than a small number of refugees into their country.  I deplore the fact that the Minister pointed out in the Dáil at Question Time that there were not any plans to facilitate the location of any of the Kurdish refugees in Ireland.  That is a gross dereliction of our humanitarian responsibility.  Part of the solution to the immediate problem of the refugees on the Turkish border must involve removing them from the mountains to a less hostile environment, where their needs can be tended to.</P>
    <P>The main proposal which seems to have emerged from the informal EC summit on which the Taoiseach has just reported which has gathered momentum up to today was the British proposal for the establishment of a UN controlled Kurdish enclave in Northern Iraq.  While the proposal was apparently supported by the other leaders, it does not seem to have been very well worked out, nor has much consideration been given as to how it could be implemented.  This morning we read in our newspapers that President Bush has announced that rather small <Col N="297" /> numbers of Americans, French and British land and air forces would establish five or six encampments in northern Iraq in a purely humanitarian effort for the orderly distribution of supplies to Kurdish refugees.  I have just been informed of a news item just broadcast that the US have announced that between 5,000 and 10,000 US troops are being used to set up refugee camps in northern Iraq.  That can hardly be described as quite small. The main point is that once again, any question of direct United Nations control or even participation has been dispensed with.</P>
    <P>It would be very unwise to ignore the dangers in moving non UN military personnel into northern Iraq.  The Iraqi authorities have already expressed their opposition to this proposal.  The worst possible development would be to restart the Gulf War with one million Kurdish civilians on the front line.  This must be avoided at all costs.</P>
    <P>We should also be wary of so-called solutions which involve placing large numbers of people in refugee camps or enclaves on a temporary basis.  In the past, temporary arrangements of this nature have tended to become permanent solutions.  Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, driven from their homes more than 40 years ago, remain scattered in refugee camps around the Middle East and 300,000 Cambodians have been living in refugee camps for the past ten years.  We do not want one million Kurdish refugees still in miserable refugee camps ten years from now.</P>
    <P>The only acceptable permanent solution is the return of the Kurdish people to their homes with a guarantee that they be allowed to live in peace and security, and all possible peaceful pressure must be maintained on the Iraqi authorities to allow this.  I understand that the political demands of most Kurds is not for a fully independent state, but for a degree of autonomy and self government within Iraq.  Clearly this is a matter to be resolved between the Iraqis and the Kurds and we should exert pressure on both sides for a cessation of all military <Col N="298" /> activity and the opening of negotiations on a political settlement.</P>
    <P>The United Nations has faced something of a dilemma as to how it should respond to the Kurdish crisis.  The principle in the Charter which prevents the United Nations from interfering in the internal affairs of any member state is basically a good one, but how can the organisation then respond when faced with the cruelty and savagery of a regime like Saddam Hussein's?  The Iraqis have consistently refused to allow United Nations observers to monitor the plight of the Kurds, just as Israel refused to allow observers to monitor the plight of Palestinians in the Occupied Territories.</P>
    <P>One amendment which should be considered to the United Nations Charter would be to allow the Secretary-General to send unarmed civilian observers to member countries, without the consent of the member state, in certain well defined circumstances, such as where there is substantial evidence of genocide or extensive human rights abuses.</P>
    <P>The ill-treatment of the Kurds by Saddam Hussein is not a new development, although it has not received as much attention in the past.  When Saddam Hussein's forces gassed some 5,000 Kurdish men, women and children at the town of Halabaja near the Iranian border in 1988 &mdash; with gas supplied by Germany &mdash; the rest of the world turned a blind eye.</P>
    <P>Attempts have been made by right wing politicians and commentators to suggest that the treatment of the Kurds in the past few weeks has given some sort of <i>post facto</i> justification to the Gulf War. More bizarre, some of them have tried to suggest that those who opposed the Gulf War are in some way responsible for the plight of the Kurds.</P>
    <P>I am appalled but not surprised at the treatment of the Kurds by Saddam Hussein. The savagery and brutality of Saddam Hussein was never in question, as far as I or my party were concerned. The only matter at issue was how the world community should respond to the illegal and immoral invasion of Kuwait. We argued very strongly that the correct <Col N="299" /> approach was the firm and consistent application of sanctions against Iraq: this course could have secured Iraqi withdrawal with little or no loss of life, either in Kuwait or Iraq.</P>
    <P>The United States and its allies chose instead to unleash war.  The Secretary-General of the United Nations stated quite clearly yesterday in the European Parliament that it was not a United Nations war.  He said &ldquo;that the distinguished General Schwarzkof never wore a blue helmet&rdquo;.  That war brought appalling suffering to the region.  We warned in this House that the war would destabilise the entire region and launch an unpredictable chain of events.  The Kurds are just the latest victims of that war and regrettably there will probably be many more before a full and lasting peace is secured for the region.</P>
    <P>The two leaders who must share responsibility for the current plight of the Kurdish refugees are Saddam Hussein, whose forces have treated them with such brutality, and President Bush who encouraged them to rise and then ignored the consequences of his advice.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to refer very briefly to a concern which arises from the informal summit which the Taoiseach reported on here today, in particular the decision of the Ministers to ask the Western European Union to distribute aid. This has never happened before.  As we are all aware, the Western European Union were revived a number of years ago to establish a political wing for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, a forum where there could be a link with the European Community with the ultimate aim of establishing the Western European Union as the co-ordinating military body for the European Community. It is unreal for the Taoiseach to come into the House to say that we can put our own interpretation on this event as we see fit but the fact is that the European Community has for the first time decided to ask the Western European Union, who have no formal connection <Col N="300" /> with the European Community whatsoever at this time, to distribute aid on behalf of the European Community.</P>
    <P>That is a significant policy decision and it is not good enough for the Taoiseach to come into the House to say that it is of no significance and to argue that the decision was taken simply because the Western European Union have access to military planes.  Could I remind the Taoiseach that his Government gave permission for numerous planes, transporting troops to and from the Gulf area, to land at Shannon?  All the planes requisitioned by the military authorities for use in the war were civilian planes.  There is no shortage or absence of civilian planes to transport aid to the Kurdish people.  What we are seeing here is the cynical use of the crisis facing the Kurdish people to establish a <i>de facto</i> position where there is a link between the Western European Union and the European Community. It is time the Government put their cards on the table in this House and explained where precisely they are taking us with regard to political union, its implications for Irish neutrality and the future of the defence of the European Community.</P>

      <P>We were talking about the procedural rules for co-operatives.  The co-operatives, when established, will be involved in streamlining the rules to run the co-operatives. The society can, of course, amend the rules under section 5 (3).  I would like to reject the idea put forward by Deputy Gilmore that the co-operatives will be the new landlords.  This is the kind of sensational language in which Deputy Gilmore occasionally, despite <Col N="301" /> well balanced contributions, indulges.  I am tired of indicating to people inside and outside this House that there is no question of ownership.  The legislation before the House is not concerned with ownership.  This has to be repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> because some bona fide objections were raised in the belief that this legislation had something to do with ownership.</P>
      <P>I also want to emphasise the fact &mdash; I am sure, as a democrat, Deputy Gilmore would appreciate this &mdash; that the decisions of the co-operative societies will be taken by a 60 per cent majority. That is a sound democratic majority.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan also concerned himself with the rules.  They are the ordinary rules of a society and it is important to have them.  Once the co-operatives have been set up, the management committee will have an input into developing and streamlining the rules.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure Deputy Barnes that the rules are procedural.  She mentioned the trustees but as I indicated earlier in the debate, the trustees &mdash; facilitators &mdash; will be in place to oversee the setting up of the co-operatives.  They will go out of office in a few months time.  There will be two trustees plus five elected members on the management board.  I have already indicated &mdash; and I think Deputy O'Sullivan agreed with this idea &mdash; that where State money is involved there is a financial responsibility and it is perfectly natural for trustees to see to that.</P>

I hope the Minister did not attempt to avail of the break in the debate to evade some of the issues we were raising.  The section empowers the Minister effectively to make the rules for the committees of the various regional boards.  It seems the Minister is prepared to talk about anything except the section. To give an example, he has just put up another smoke screen.  He says the society may amend the rules and refers us to section 5 (3).  Of course, that is not <Col N="302" /> what section 5 (3) provides.  It provides that the Minister or a society with the consent of the Minister, may revoke on or amend the rules of the society.</P>

      <P>That is a different matter.  The Minister's big presence still looms large in this section.  We were attempting to extract some information from the Minister before we broke on what the rules will consist of.

      <P>Yes, and I know what is on the record.  The Deputy said that in the ordinary course of the setting up of a co-operative society it would be the members of the society who would draw up the rules.  I indicated that in those circumstances the rules would be given to the people who were setting up the co-operative from ICOS.  I was providing, as they are not registered with the friendly societies' people, that I would be performing the role <i>vis-à-vis</i> the fishery co-operatives that ICOS perform with regard to the other type of co-operative. I want to put that on record.</P>

      <P>Yes, of course.  In no way do I depart from that at all, but I am anxious to establish not so much the source of the rules as what the rules will contain.  In the course of his contribution immediately before he break the Minister acknowledged that he did have discussions about the rules with some of the interests involved in this dispute and, as I understood him, he stated that the content of those discussions related to the various paragraphs contained in section 5 (2).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very difficult to accept that the Minister would have confined himself to reading out the headings contained in section 5 (2).  I want to find out from the Minister what draft rules are being considered for these bodies.  We need to know that before we can vote on a section of this Bill which will give the Minister wide-ranging powers to make the rules for these bodies.  The amendment I have proposed would give the right to make the rules to the bodies themselves.  If they are going to be co-operatives they should have the authority to draw up their own rules and have them submitted in the normal way for approval by the Registrar of Friendly Societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> If the Minister is not prepared to accept my amendment, and I understand from his earlier contribution that he is not, he is saying he wants to reserve to himself the right to make the rules.  If he is reserving that right to himself this House is entitled to know what those rules are, otherwise we are voting to give the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> to write whatever rules he wants.  I do not think that is what we should be doing.  We should know what the rules of these bodies are going to be because they are going to have very extensive functions indeed, including the right effectively to exclude people from fishing, the right to decide that an individual who wants to go out to fish will have to hold a share certificate, functions in relation to prosecution of people, functions in relation to raising money for fishery development and functions <i>vis-à-vis</i> the regional fisheries boards.  Those functions will be quite extensive and we need to know more than the headings. The headings in section 5 (2) could be in for anything but they are not the rules. We need to know what the rules are going to be.  For example, it is stated that they will deal with the membership and functions of a management committee, appointment, election, terms of office and so on, and we need to know what they are.  They will deal with the question of membership and termination of ordinary and corporate membership of the society.  We need to know what the rules are going to be.</P>
    <P>For example, let us take the question of membership.  Will it be the case that a rule of the society will be that anybody who applies will be granted membership? What will the criteria for membership be?  Who will decide who is to be admitted to membership or be expelled from membership, if such should arise?  They are the rules we need to know.  The Minister at this stage has a fair idea what those rules are going to be because I understand he has discussed the detail of them with some of the interests in this dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand he has <Col N="305" /> tossed the thing around with them and I would like him to put on the record of the House the rules he has in mind for these bodies, not just the headings we have here.  I can understand it is probably not at the final stage, that there is not a final draft of the rules or anything like that, but if he is rejecting the idea of the societies drawing up their own rules, subject to approval by the Registrar of Friendly Societies, he should tell us the board outline of the rules he has in mind, otherwise we are voting on something in the dark.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he wanted simple legislation going through the House, direct, clear cut and, above all, workable legislation that was acceptable to the angling community and tourists. We agree with him and support him all the way with regard to that type of legislation.</P>
      <P>Sections such as section 5 absolutely exclude the possibility of effectiveness.  I would see subsection (2) as the foundation stone of these co-operative societies. All of us who have been involved in committees and societies are aware of the hard lesson that, unless boundaries are definitely set and there is sharp definition of the rules, particularly with regard to the allowing and disallowing of membership, there can be great difficulties, possibly involving legal proceedings when a group or individual feels that in natural justice they have a case.  The last thing the Minister wants is legal cases with regard to rulings.  If the Minister could give an indication of the rules which will be drawn up as a result of this legislation, all of us here and the representatives of the anglers might be able to look with a more positive eye at this Bill. We are worried that unless we have some indication of the rules we could be accused as public representatives of not carrying out our responsibility to safeguard the rights of people who do not have a vote in this House and who rely on us to protect them.  If the Minister would agree to indicate the rules he could allay some of the fears and answer some of the questions which have been raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> The defining of membership could raise incredible difficulties.  Section 5 (2) (d) states that the rules will apply to membership and termination of ordinary and corporate membership of the society. I have come late to the debate on this legislation.  Perhaps other Members know to whom corporate membership would apply.  I do not.  Apart from the difficulty of defining the rights of individual members, there could be huge problems here.  Could corporate membership be taken up by a multinational for its employees?  Could it be taken up by a trade union, a tourism group or a hotel group?  Could the corporate membership influence a co-operative society to such an extent that it would be a closed shop?  We are conscious of the fact that 60 per cent of the membership of a co-operative society can make very definite decisions with regard to access to membership or exclusion from it.  The Minister should indicate definite rules which will ensure that block voting, corporate membership and undue influence on the part of a group could not be used against the rights of a smaller group or an individual. We must have some indication that the rules will take these matters into consideration. We do not have any written proof that the rules of existing co-operative societies will obtain.  We know that the Minister will make the rules, but we have no indication of his intentions in this sensitive area.  There was tremendous difficulty in getting consensus in the first place.  Many of the problems which are being raised could be cleared up and our fears removed with regard to the rules if the Minister would give us some information and justify his claims for this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister had long discussions with the people involved and it is a pity that since Second Stage the rules have not been framed, with some input by the interested parties. Then all of us would have some contribution to make.  The headings governing the rules are not sufficient.  We are being asked to pass legislation without knowing fully what that legislation entails with regard to the day-to-day running of the co-operative societies.  The Minister will acknowledge that this is a sticking point with the angling groups. They want to study the rules and give their opinion as to what is workable.  The mess has been made because of lack of consultation with outside groups.  Somebody must have a copy of the rules.  If not, valuable time has been wasted which should have been more productively used on behalf of the fishing groups, societies and clubs.  The person who wants to go out with his daughter or son to fish on a Sunday afternoon will be excluded.  I said this to the Minister before but he does not agree with me.  The people will be bound by the rules and regulations of the society.  The rules and regulations will be laid down by the society.  People ask me whether they will be banned from fishing in the River Lee or in the Blackwater, but genuinely I do not know and I will not know until the rules and regulations are laid out before us.  Perhaps the Minister will make the rules and regulations available to the House before Report Stage.  At present, we are being asked to vote on something we do not know about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual I will be brief and try to stick to the point at issue.  I find it very difficult to enthuse over any of this section because as Deputy Gilmore said earlier, we on this side of the House would like to see this Bill finished at section 3.  Be that as it may, we are now dealing with section 5 and more particularly with section 5 (1).  Having listened to the debate and the Minister's response to the first round, if I may use that expression, I am afraid there is nothing in his reply which in any way alleviates my concern about this sub-clause, which clearly gives the Minister very sweeping powers.  The Minister is basically asking us to buy a pig in a poke. Like Deputy O'Sullivan I wonder if the Minister would make the rules of the societies available on Report Stage and in which case we might accept them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have two alternatives, first to go down the road which I am proposing, which is simply to delete this subsection. That is probably not the ideal solution. Second, we could look at Deputy Gilmore's suggestion, which is also not quite ideal, and involves the Register of Friendly Societies.  I feel the balance of advantage lies with Deputy Gilmore's <Col N="309" /> amendment.  I do not know whether this concludes the debate on my amendment but if it does I will withdraw my amendment No. 14.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 13 to 15, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Each fishery co-operative society shall, before it is registered, draw up rules for the society and submit these rules for approval by the Registrar of Friendly Societies.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the Chair has rightly said we have been fishing in this pool for some time now.  It is a pasttime that requires a great deal of patience but the unfortunate thing is that the Minister has not been taking the bait.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could cast out one more time and suggest that if before Report Stage the Minister would be willing to issue us with the rules, or with draft rules or even guidelines for the rules, I would be happy to hold my amendment until then.  However, if he is not prepared to do that I do not see any option but to press my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore in his initial contribution talked about rules in the context of excluding people from fishing.  The rules have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with that.  As the Bill indicates, neither the Minister nor the rules have any competence in this regard at all.  The co-operative, deciding by what I regard as a substantial majority, have the competence in that regard.  My contention, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is that this is a sound democratic approach to this problem.  Neither have the rules anything to do with the membership fees for the co-operative.  Deputy Gilmore referred to them as money collecting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> This again has nothing to do with the rules of the society because these are incorporated in the Bill itself.  Another point, and this covers matters raised by other contributors as well, is that membership is open to all who purchase share certificates.  There can be no exclusion of any citizen or any person living in Ireland. Deputy Gilmore rightly said that the final draft of the rules has not been settled and they will not be finally settled as the rules of the society until the societies themselves have an opportunity of looking at them, amending them and approving them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>How can that be?  How can you have a society without rules?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely why I have rules.  The rules will be taken to the management committee and their observations will be taken into account.  I have other discussions scheduled with regard to the rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>But you would have to have the rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barnes suggested simple procedures and I agree with the Deputy that that is what we are looking for.  The rules we are talking about are procedural rules.  Deputy Barnes had a difficulty with the reference to corporate membership and I will tease that out. This is covered by section 8.  The angling clubs can become corporate members and indicate the number of members from the club who want to be individual members of the co-operative.  It is in accordance with the number of membership fees that the club will pay.  With regard to the Deputy's reference to the corporate membership of multinationals, hotels and such institutions, that is also spelled out quite clearly in section 8 where such bodies are entitled to one particular membership certificate, so there will be no question of flooding the co-operative society by a big buy up by multinationals although I am sure that the co-operative societies themselves will <Col N="311" /> be only too glad to get substantial sponsorship from whatever source for the laudable purposes of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan that consultation is important.  I can inform him that the rules are being worked on.  They could not possibly be included in a Bill; it would be ridiculous to include here what would constitute a quorum for meetings and so on.  I can inform him that anglers will be consulted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Garland is opposing everything. I do not know what my approach should be to that.  He says he is concerned about the overall aspect, but he lacked specifics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore talked about Report <Col N="312" /> Stage.  I am afraid I am opposing the amendment as of now.  I want to assure the House that there is no question, in these procedural rules, of any pitch on the part of the Minister for the Marine or on the part of my Department; they are purely procedural rules.  I would ask the House to accept that.  There is no question of buying a pig in a poke, or any other animal, vegetable or mineral&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (2) (f), lines 30 to 32, to delete &ldquo;,including provision for payments to the appropriate regional board to promote the purposes of the society&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 5 (2) (f) provides a sort of throw away at the end of the subsection.  Paragraph (f) states:</P>
      <P>the establishment and management of a development fund for the receipt of payments to the society and the disbursement of moneys of the fund&mdash;</P>
      <P>That part of the paragraph stands on its own&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash; including provision for payments to the appropriate regional board to promote the purposes of the society;</P>
      <P>I wish to have the latter part of paragraph (f) deleted because it pre-empts decisions.  If it is appropriate to have these payments, then quite clearly it should come under a separate section.  It is vague and it is in the wrong place.  It is just slipped in there by the Minister.  It is a very important issue on its own.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say; he may succeed in convincing me that he is right but I doubt it.</P>

      <P>The purpose of section 5 (2) (f) is to promote the closest possible <Col N="315" /> co-operation between the regional boards and the co-operative societies.  It is very important for many reasons, including the healing of wounds and so on, that the legislation should be seen to promote that kind of co-operation. I cannot accept the amendment.  It is important that co-operatives and boards should dovetail their efforts because they have the same objective, that is the development and protection of fisheries, and co-operation between them is very important indeed.  Deputies should not forget &mdash; Deputy Garland should note this &mdash; that this is an enabling provision. There is no compulsion on the societies; they have freedom of action in the matter.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 17 in the name of Deputy Garland. Amendment No. 18 is an alternative.  I propose therefore, with the agreement of the House, that for discussion purposes we take amendments Nos. 17 and 18 together.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 39 and 40, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Minister with the consent of the society may revoke or amend the rules of the society.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) states that the Minister or a society with the consent of the Minister may revoke or amend the rules of the society.  You have to read that a few times before you come to grips with it.  What that means is that the Minister, without the consent of the society, can revoke or amend the rules of the society, but the converse does not apply.  If a society wish to revoke or amend the rules they must obtain the consent of the Minister.  That <Col N="316" /> is a typical example of the way this Bill is drafted.  It is taking everything and giving nothing.  There is a clear imbalance there and hence the need for an amendment.</P>
    <P>There are two separate suggestions here, one from me and one from Deputy Gilmore.  My amendment reads: &ldquo;The Minister with the consent of the society may revoke or amend the rules of society.&rdquo;.  If that amendment was accepted it would clearly exclude the Minister from having the right to amend or revoke the rules without the consent of the society.  If we contrast that with Deputy Gilmore's amendment, the intention is similar.  He, like myself, does not wish to give the exclusive right to the Minister to revoke and amend the rules. His amendment reads: &ldquo;The society, with the consent of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, may revoke or amend the rules of the society.&rdquo;.  I am sure Deputy Gilmore will do more justice to his amendment than I and, therefore, I will not refer to it further.  I will listen to the debate and see which amendment appears to be the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment follows a consistent line of thinking about co-operatives. I had hoped the Minister would agree to allow genuine co-opertives to be established, laying down their own rules, registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies and so on, but that unfortunately, as we have learned from a couple of sections, is not to be the case. The Minister is to establish bodies which will represent his interests in the respective regional boards, but it is not clear how the relationship between these bodies and the regional boards will work. I am not optimistic that the Minister is going to accept my amendment. However, he said in an earlier contribution that the societies would have the right to amend the rules.  He has taken upon himself the right to make the rules. He should have another look at the question of amending the rules.  Once the rules are made the society should have some discretion in amending them.  The provison the Minister has built into the <Col N="317" /> Bill is that he may amend the rules without consultation with anybody or the society may amend them with the consent of the Minister.</P>
      <P>We have had a very bad day on this Bill; we got nothing.  We are fishing here since 10.30 this morning but we have caught nothing yet.  This is an opportunity for the Minister to throw some little fish to the Opposition.  I would ask him to give some serious consideration to this matter.</P>

      <P>In supporting the amendment I would ask the Minister to give us more information.  Does the Registrar of Friendly Societies enter into this scene at all?  It is important that we know that.  The Minister has indicated already that the co-operatives will be groups with one aim, making money which would be disbursed among the fisheries boards to develop fisheries in their areas.  Is the Registrar of Friendly Societies involved or is the Minister taking complete control?  If we had the answer to that we would know where we are going.  It was Deputy Gilmore who mentioned the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  I have been involved with various groups which had to register with the Registrar of Friendly Societies who had strict control over them.  If the Minister indicates that he is the sole arbitrator of anything that is done under this legislation, then we will know where we are going.  We can call votes here all night but we will get nowhere.  We should ascertain whether the Registrar of Friendly Societies is involved or if the Minister will adjudicate on everything and do everything his way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House.  I hope the Minister agrees with the thrust of these two amendments.  I would remind him that earlier he indicated that he does not wish to take too much control and that he will undertake <Col N="318" /> discussions and enter into agreements with the societies, but then subsection (3) comes down like a sledge-hammer.  As Deputy Garland said, the Minister can revoke or amend the rules without the consent of the society but the converse does not apply.  That is contrary to everything the Minister wishes will evolve from this Bill.  It certainly does not tie in with the principal thrust of the rules of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  The Minister may not allow us to trawl in any productive way but if he even gave us a minnow in this regard we would be grateful for small mercies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I liked the reference to trawling in relation to sea fisheries.  I indicated in an earlier discussion with Deputy Gilmore that the co-operative societies under the Bill were being formed in accordance with the Fisheries Acts.  The Registrar does not play a part arising from that position.  We decided that we would rely on the establishment of the co-operatives through the Fisheries Acts rather than through the Registrar to make it more simple which, as all sides in the House agreed, should be the case. For that reason, amendment No. 18 is not acceptable, and I made a case in that regard when we discussed amendments Nos. 8 and 15.  I have no wish to arrogate to the Minister &mdash; who happens to be myself at the moment &mdash; but as was said in ten years' time, more than likely, I will not be in office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 41 to 43, to delete subsection (4).</P>
      <P>I call this the greedy amendment because the Minister is giving himself everything in the Bill, the right to set up these societies, write the rules for them, change the rules and in subsection (4) he is also giving himself the right to nominate two members to the management committee of the society in addition to their elected members.</P>
      <P>The Minister earlier referred to the principle of democracy but it is not very democratic if a society, through its corporate and individual members, elect a management committee and the Minister then appoints two additional members.  I do not see why he should want to do that. What is he looking for?  Does he want to have two spies at the meetings of the management committee to report back to him or does he want two further opportunites to offer consolation prizes to some of the many failed local election candidates who will be knocking on his door after 27 June?  What is the purpose of this?  It does not in any way add to the Bill or to the effectiveness of these societies to give the Minister the right to appoint two additional members.  It is undemocratic and should be deleted.</P>

      <P>We managed to keep this discussion at a fairly high level and I resent Deputy Gilmore's remarks about spies.  Two people out of seven will be chosen for their interest in the protection and development of fisheries and they will represent the Minister on the management committee.  It is unworthy of Deputy Gilmore and of the high standards of debate which he usually follows to use those words in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="320" /> With regard to consolation prizes for defeated candidates in local elections, I bet my bottom dollar that more members of my party will be elected to local authorities than members of The Workers' Party.  However ambitious Deputy Gilmore is, that is a safe bet.  In an earlier part of the debate I mentioned that these two people can play a useful role in looking after the taxpayers' contribution to the funds of the co-operative societies. Deputy O'Sullivan agreed with me earlier when I mentioned this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because I already referred to this on an earlier section.  As we all recognise, the Minister has tremendous control and discretion under this Bill, if we are to entrust the fair and autonomous running of these societies to elected people whom they trust. there is really no need for the Minister to appoint two others.</P>
      <P>The Bill is framed in such a way that these societies are answerable to the Minister and in regard to the high qualities which I should like to believe will exist in the committees of management of these societies, I should like to think that they would all represent the taxpayer as well as the angling members of their societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am even more convinced now about the justification for this amendment.  To have two out of seven is totally out of proportion.  That is an even higher proportion than the Taoiseach's nominees in the Seanad, and we do not know what the quorum for a meeting would be.  One could certainly envisage a situation where the Minister's nominees could constitute a majority of those entitled to vote and make a decision at a meeting.  The Minister has offered no real justification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was curious as to his observation about protecting the taxpayers' interest. It is certainly news to me that the societies would have access to public moneys.  I understand that the purpose of the societies was to raise moneys from their own resources to contribute to the development of fisheries and to make payments to the regional boards.  The Minister is saying that he is putting two people on to the management committees to protect the taxpayers' interests.  Is he saying that the societies will have access to public funds, because that certainly would be a new dimension to this whole discussion? It is certainly news to me and I would like <Col N="322" /> it cleared up.  My amendment is certainly justifiable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Chair's anxiety to proceed with this Bill but I would like to make one comment on that. I am surprised that Deputy Gilmore did not know about this.  He usually reads Bills with care.  Section 13 reads: &ldquo;The Minister may, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, make payments to a society established under this Act for the purposes of the society.&rdquo; I am surprised the Deputy missed that.  I publicly mentioned it on a number of occasions.  I would advise Deputy Gilmore to listen very carefully to what I say in public because it is the distilled wisdom of centuries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hate the Minister to think badly of me, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I understood section 13, dealing with grants to the society, to mean the kind of administrative grant that would be made for the purposes of administering the society.  Perhaps I took the Minister up wrongly but I understood from his reply to the amendment that there would be moneys available to the society out of public funds for fisheries development.  If that is the case, it is an important dimension to this debate because what it does raise is the question of the relationship between these societies and the regional boards.  My understanding is that the regional boards were established, under the 1980 Act, to manage and to administer the public investment in inland fisheries.  If the Minister is saying that these societies will also have that function then he would need to clarify the respective roles of the societies and the regional boards.  Are we to have a two headed monster in each region, on the one hand a society which has public money and is generating its own money and on the other the regional boards which are also responsible for public investment in inland fisheries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> That needs to be cleared up.  My understanding of section 13 is that we were talking about smaller amounts of money being made available, perhaps from the national lottery or from the Minister's Department, for administrative purposes. I certainly did not understand that the societies would be a vehicle for public investment in inland fisheries.  My understanding was that the regional boards were already the vehicle for that.  For some time, there has been doubt over the future of the regional boards.  If the societies are to develop in this way and become a vehicle for the managing of public funds in inland fisheries, what is the future of the regional boards to be? Looking some distance down the river it seems that there is a question mark over the future of the regional boards if an alternative body is to have a role in the disbursement and investment of public funds.</P>

I had to admire his skill.  He homed in on administration which is not mentioned at all here, and may the Lord protect us all from the expenditure of large sums of money on administration.  We do not want that.  We want money for the development of and the protection of our fisheries. I would feel exceptionally guilty if I thought that this House was going to vote moneys which would be swallowed by administration.  The relationship between the regional boards and the co-operative societies is quite clearly defined in this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (6) states that any person shall be entitled to a copy of the rules of a society on payment to the society of such fee as may be specified by the Minister. We are getting down to the very small print here.  The bureaucracy involved in something like this is horrendous.  Will this ever arise in practice?  It is just mind boggling.  Any common sense society would send a copy of the rules to anyone who asked for it.  They might, if they were very parsimonious, ask for the price of a stamp.  However, the Minister is not satisfied with that.  He has to poke into every nook and cranny in the administrative affairs of the society to the extent that the fee which the society may charge has to be specified by the Minister.  That is just a nonsense.  This point can best be dealt with by way of my amendment which provides that the society may charge a fee without any reference to the Minister.  Deputy Gilmore's amendment <Col N="325" /> is almost identical to my amendment and I ask the Minister to accept one or the other of them &mdash; I am indifferent as to which amendment he accepts.

As it is a matter of public interest it is important that a list of the shareholders in a society should be available to the public.

      <P>I support Deputy Garland's amendment.  While the Minister has referred to the normal practice which obtains in co-operatives we are talking about co-operatives which will utilise public moneys in the development of fisheries.  A list of the shareholders of such societies should be available to the public in general on payment of a fee. Deputy Garland has raised a very relevant point.  I am surprised the Minister has not provided for this.  The membership of these societies should be public knowledge.  The Minister has said that anyone will be allowed join the societies and, therefore, any person should be entitled to know who the members of the society are.</P>

      <P>I too support Deputy Garland's amendment.  We need to ensure that societies, committees and clubs are proud of their membership and work and that members of the public have access to such information.  The Minister indicated to Deputy Gilmore that public moneys will be utilised by these societies.  Indeed, he will go so far as to appoint two members to ensure that taxpayers' money will be properly spent and that the societies will be answerable to the taxpayers.  The proposal in Deputy Garland's amendment seems to be a follow-on from the accountability provision. If there is no accountability people will think such societies have restricted membership and will regard them as closed shops.  As a woman I am aware that many organisations have restricted membership, particularly against women.  This can give rise to all kinds of suspicions. The societies should be required to provide a list of shareholders to any person who makes application and pays a fee.  I <Col N="327" /> do not understand why the Minister cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers, I also support this amendment. The principle of access to information is one which has to be enshrined in legislation. I do not think the Minister's reply that the members of the society will have the right to inspect the register of members covers this requirement.  We do not know what the rules of the society will be although the Minister said membership will be open to anyone who is prepared to pay the fee.  I accept that this provision will be included in the rules.</P>
      <P>We had some debate previously about the rights of an individual who wants to fish.  If one of the societies passes by the 60 per cent majority a requirement that anybody who wants to fish on, say, the River Lee will have to hold a share certificate many people may be aggrieved by that decision.  For example, people who have fished that river and other rivers for many years may feel aggrieved at the idea that the members of one of the societies could make a decision requiring them to become a member of the society and have a share certificate before they are allowed to fish.  Those people should have the right to find out who the people who make such decisions are, who are the members of the society.  They should have a right to know who the shareholders are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also, of course, the question of public funds.  If these bodies are going to have some control of public funds we should know who they are.  I can certainly see situations arising where people will want to know who the corporate members of the societies are.  This is critical information.  Deputy Garland's amendment is an excellent one and I support it.  I ask the Minister to look at it again as it would not in any way diminish the principle of the Bill as he sees it and what he is trying to achieve in the Bill.  It would add a very important safeguard for the public which would not in any way detract from the Bill.  It would <Col N="328" /> extend the right to information beyond the members of a society.  These may be people with an interest in fishing beyond the members of the society who would have a right to this information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barnes raised the question of accountability.  As I mentioned, two trustees representing the Department of the Marine will have a role to play in regard to public moneys. Of course they would have a role also with regard to the general funds of the society as would the management committee elected by the members of the co-operative society.  That and the availability of the register to all members is a sufficient transparency.  Membership is open to all, and anybody who is a member can inspect the register.  Part of the role of the trustees will be to look after the taxpayer.  That is a sufficient transparency without the amendment which is before the House.</P>

    <P>I have had a great deal of correspondence about this provision and about vacancies <Col N="329" /> among the elected members.  The thrust of my thinking and of most of the representations I received was that the vacancies should be filled by unsuccessful candidates of the elections to those bodies.  I mentioned already that the rules while still not finalised will incorporate more or less what Deputy Garland suggests in amendment No. 25.  We will incorporate the system already operating in the regional boards.  Where there is only one unsuccessful candidate of the election that person will be co-opted if he agrees and where there are two or more unsuccessful candidates the candidate with the most votes will be co-opted. If none of those conditions obtain, the committee will select somebody from the membership of the board.  Vacancies will be filled from the elected members in accordance with the rules.</P>

It seems to me that there are people outside this House who know more about what the rules of these societies will be than the Members of the House.  Its puts us in a very difficult position in trying to address amendments like this where the Minister says that the vacancies will be filled in accordance with the rules of the society, when we do not know what are the rules of the society.</P>

That is all I am saying.  Given their absence, things will be made very difficult for us and we will have to get up in this House to ask questions about them and object to things which we might not object to if we knew the full story.

      <P>This debate is now degenerating into a farce.  The Minister has the draft rules for these societies and, as Deputy Gilmore said, we are being treated with contempt.  How can we be expected to operate in this environment? Perhaps the best way to expedite the matter and get rid of this difficulty would be to delete that subsection from the Bill because if this matter is to be included in the rules of societies we do not need to have it included in the Bill.  Societies would not be precluded from including it in their rules if it were to be left out of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister has accepted the concept behind my amendment, the purpose of which is to ensure democracy.  It is only fair and reasonable that vacancies should be filled by those who have the support of the shareholders but who did not receive enough support to be elected first time round.  Some maverick or outsider should not be appointed to the management committee.  I do not care which way the Minister goes about it as long as the principle is accepted.  Perhaps the best way to deal with this matter would be to delete the subsection altogether.</P>

      <P>Members on this side of the House were never more aware of the slogan, &ldquo;knowledge is power,&rdquo; in so far as that we are in a limbo or a no man's land.  Indeed, the reason we have taken up so much time debating some sections is that we are of the view that we have to oppose them.  The Minister indicated on an earlier section, when he turned down our amendments, that it would not be appropriate to outline the rules or guidelines in legislation but now and again, like a conjuror, he draws from his sleeve one of the rules.  I would ask him in all sincerity to outline to Members on this side of the House, who have a right to know, what the rules will be for all present and future members of societies.</P>
      <P>We should remember that this legislation is not just being introduced for those groups who are in touch with the Minister but also to ensure the proper administration and development of inland fisheries.  This matter must be considered in that context.  This side of the House should be given some indication of what the rules will be.  I ask the Minister again, now that we have been given another flash of a rule, to give us the benefit of his wisdom with regard to the rules to ensure that we do not continue to shadow box given that we have a responsibility to all anglers and future anglers in this country.</P>

I have also told the House that the rules are in draft and I have my doubts about the relevance of an across the board speech about the rules in general but in this case I have given the specific draft of the rule in order to indicate that the amendment put down by Deputy Garland is substantively the same as my own.  I accept that this amendment makes reference to &ldquo;the next person in line per previous ballot&rdquo; whereas our experience of the regional boards is that we have to go further than the next person to the person after that and then make provision for <Col N="333" /> a situation where neither of those two people is available.

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 42 to 44, and in page 5, lines 1 to 3, to delete subsection (3), and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) In considering whether to grant recognition to an angling club or other body for the purpose of subsection (1) of this section or fixing the amount of a fee to be paid by a corporate member under that subsection particular regard shall be had by the co-operatives to the outlay of the body concerned on work of fishery development and public benefit in the area in which the society operates.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> Section 8 deals with corporate membership of societies.  We are now into a very tricky area because generally speaking the rules of clubs and societies do not allow corporate membership and one person one vote is the order of the day. One would have to have very serious reservations about the whole principle of section 8 and I will oppose it very strongly because it has got all sorts of connotations. There is a big power bloc there which could be used quite unfairly.  I do not think we need much imagination to figure out the various ways in which that could be done.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, in so far as we have to bear with section 8, it can be improved by substituting subsection (3).  The new subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) In considering whether to grant recognition to an angling club or other body for the purpose of subsection (1) of this section or fixing the amount of a fee to be paid by a corporate member under that subsection particular regard shall be had by the co-operatives to the outlay of the body concerned on work of fishery development and public benefit in the area in which the society operates.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In my view it is very definitely superior to the subsection in the Bill and I await the Minister's comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I too will be opposing this section because it incorporates a number of very dangerous precedents. First, we have &ldquo;any angling club or other body&rdquo; that, as we have established, could be anything, a company, a hotel group, anything.  Even a political party may become a corporate member of a society in accordance with the rules of the society.  That is fine as far as it goes, but then we are told that a corporate member can nominate for ordinary membership a number of people, and the number is unspecified.  Perhaps in the Minister's gradual unveiling of the rules of these societies he might like to tell us what the rules of the society will say about the number of ordinary members who will <Col N="336" /> be allowed admission to these societies without fee under this arrangement of corporate membership.</P>
      <P>The third element is that a corporate member might not have to pay a fee at all or may have to pay a fee which is much reduced in relation to the number of members it will be nominating for membership because it will be able to take into account the outlay it has had on fisheries development.  Will a large angling club, or a number of large angling clubs, be able to say, &ldquo;We have done X work already on that river worth £10,000; give us £10,000 worth of share certificates in return for that&ldquo;?  Can they nominate for ordinary membership that number of people?  Will a corporate member be able to nominate for ordinary membership more ordinary members that it has members of its club?  Will an angling club or other body, as it is defined, who by virtue of their outlay are entitled to 150 share certificate and have only 100 members, be entitled to nominate 150 ordinary members to the society?  A very undemocratic principle is being built in here.  This section is a recipe for giving control of these societies to large clubs. All the experience we have in any area where control of a public facility is given to a club has shown that over time the club takes unto themselves more and more control of that facility to a point where very often the general public are excluded.</P>
      <P>In another section of the Bill there is a vehicle whereby that may be done because the public may be expressly excluded from using the rivers and lakes by a 60 per cent vote of these members of the society.  We will see large clubs getting large corporate membership and putting in a large number of ordinary members with voting rights.  In some cases they may not have to pay the equivalent of what those members would normally pay for share certificates because it will be offset by the outlay and, effectively, they will be given control of the rivers and lakes in that area.  That is a very dangerous principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principles of democracy that have applied generally in this State have been <Col N="337" /> based on one person one vote.  We know to our cost what happened when in a neighbouring state that principle was departed from and voting entitlement was based on rate-paying capacity or whatever.  We are building into legislation voting entitlements based on the collective strength of a club.  It is a very dangerous precedent because, as we have learned in the course of the day, we are now dealing with bodies who will not only have the right to decide who may fish, they will have the right to decide who is prosecuted and they will have control over public funds.  We need to reflect very carefully on this section and its implications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I also oppose this section, its lack of democracy and, as Deputy Gilmore said, of the concept of one person one vote.  There could be abuse of membership, particularly corporate membership.  Section 8 (1) provides that any angling club or other body may become a corporate member, but we have not defined what the other body is.  By becoming a corporate body, they presumably could be treated in a different way from the ordinary fee-paying individual member.  For instance, a corporate member shall be entitled to nominate without fee one ordinary member of the society.  I presume that a hard working, industrious member of a club will not have that right.  There is an inbuilt privilege here.  It is within the bounds of possibility that groups with special rights assigned to them could begin to take over a club or a society.</P>
      <P>Section 8 (3) states:</P>
      <P>In considering whether to grant recognition to an angling club or other body for the purpose of subsection (1) of this section or fixing the amount of a fee to be paid by a corporate member under that subsection particular regard shall be had to the outlay of the body concerned on work of public benefit in the area in which the society operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an inbuilt privilege or the possibility of discrimination in so far as another body which is well adjusted for <Col N="338" /> takeover could become a corporate member and could afford outlay on work of public benefit which other bodies could not.  If other clubs or individuals cannot show the same level of outlay on work of public benefit in the area in which the society operates, will they find themselves in a less privileged position?  The wording indicates that they will.</P>
    <P>This section reeks of the opportunity to discriminate by giving special privileges to better off, better organised corporate members who can appoint another member without a fee.  They will gather influence and with their extra clout they will justify extra privileges by their outlay on the development of the society, in contrast to other members and to their detriment.  We are attempting to show that there is huge leeway here for discrimination, privilege and élitism where ordinary angling members could find themselves at a huge disadvantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the whole structure of this section has all the hallmarks of setting up an élitist sinecure controlling position, totally removed from the even handed, democratic administration of the societies that one would expect in a fairly organised distribution of the privileges of the amenities of fisheries in our lakes and rivers.  I am surprised that a section has been tendered in this format.  It is poorly drafted and I do not understand what is in the mind of the Minister and the Government in putting it forward on this basis.  The wording of subsection (3) is rather strange.  It states that a particular regard shall be had to the outlay of the body concerned on work of public benfit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am talking about the Minister's amendment where he proposes to delete the word &ldquo;work&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;fisheries development&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, I am not deleting the word &ldquo;work&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  The Minister is proposing to insert the words &ldquo;fisheries development&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;work&rdquo;. Particular regard shall be had to the outlay on this work.  Does it follow that regard is not to be had to other matters which might be of equal importance?  Perhaps there would be a society of people who might not be able to afford to plough in substantial amounts of money but might have quite a lot to contribute to fisheries in their area which would not involve substantial outlay on fishery development work.  Why this concentration on a heavy financial input? Why should particular regard be paid to this heavy financial expenditure while no other consideration is mentioned?  The whole thing smacks of élitism and is totally unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discretion as to the numbers of ordinary members is left totally in the hands of the society, thereby stitching in on a permanent basis the rights of those they favour.  How are we to know how many members they will fairly accept and that fair and reasonable consideration will be given to applications from clubs, groupings or societies who are not in a position to put up very substantial sums?  Is any appeals procedure provided for?  Is there to be any openness about this procedure? Will reasons have to be given for these important decisions or will this be an operation behind closed doors where <Col N="340" /> nobody will know why one club was accepted and another rejected?  Fisheries rights have become a matter of privilege over the years.</P>
    <P>It is distressing to say the least that in the year 1991 we find that old regimen of privilege being continued, being stitched into the system from now on and into the foreseeable future.  One would have thought that in 1991 the time had come to burst the whole thing wide open to ordinary people, the ordinary citizens, even if they did not have much money to join expensive clubs or to contribute huge sums for fisheries development but who nonetheless have the sport and interest in fishing very much at heart and who put in tremendous effort building it up.  There are other kinds of effort than financial effort which these people put into fisheries.</P>
    <P>In his amendment, the Minister pays no particular regard to their efforts and no provision is made for them.  I would have thought that in setting out the section the Minister would have made provision for them.  I would have a greater degree of sympathy for his position if he had worded his amendment to say something like this: that in considering the application and the number of seats to be allocated to the club or society, regard shall be had to the following matters under paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5).  Indeed, an outlay on fisheries work could well be one of those items but it would be only one of the paragraphs and there should have been quite a list of items and not just that one.  If the Minister had phrased his amendment in that way it would have given a fairer presentation to pretentions of bringing in a democratic regime on the organisations of societies.</P>
    <P>However, the whole thing reeks of élitism and a behind closed doors operation. There is no provision for upfront public explanations or giving reasons for decisions.  It is just preserving and locking in a continuation of the system for the vested interests already there, and which this legislation, introduced in 1991 by this Coalition Government of Fianna Fáil and <Col N="341" /> the Progressive Democrats who represent those interests, will ensure continues henceforth.  No breath of fresh air is being allowed to penetrate the system.</P>

      <P>My colleague has said that we will be opposing this section. Deputy Garland's amendment has a great degree of common sense.  However, in my view the amendment is flawed in that it does not go far enough, but I would not fault it altogether on that because it is a good amendment.</P>
      <P>We should be taking the opportunity, as the Legislature, to address the serious imbalance, the serious apartheid, which takes place within various sporting clubs. I am talking about apartheid of the sexes, clubs where women are excluded.  I would like to see corporate entities being required in their articles of association to have an equality clause that they would not exclude women.  In amendment No. 28, Deputy Garland suggests that public benefit in the area in which the society operates should be a consideration in granting recognition to an angling club.  But it should also be a consideration that members should be free to join any corporate entity or as an individual member, irrespective of sex. It may seem rather strange for me to say but if half of the population were black and the other half white, or if half the population were Muslim and half were Catholic, and if the black or Muslim sections were as unrepresented and treated as women are in places such as golf clubs and presumably in fisheries clubs &mdash; there would be legislation in this House to prevent it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the points I wished to raise have been very adequately dealt with other speakers. However, I would like to put on record again the grave dangers in this section. Who makes the decision to grant recognition to an angling club or other body? Who assesses and makes a ruling on the nature and extent of work of public benefit? These are very important points. We do not know who will make these decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 8 recognition will be granted to a club in accordance with the &ldquo;rules&rdquo;. The rules crop up all the time, but we are trying to legislate in a void because we <Col N="343" /> do not know the impact these rules will have on corporate or other type of membership. I would like to hear the Minister's reply to the points that have been made and particularly to the points raised by Deputy Taylor who not only outlined the dangers in the section but the privilege that could be taken from people who have worked over a long number of years for the development of fisheries.  Some people have worked extremely hard without compensation because they felt it was in their own interest to work for the development of fisheries in our lakes and rivers.  Let me repeat that without seeing the rules we are frustrated in trying to legislate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will have observed that the amendment in my name is more or less <i>en rapport</i> with that in the name of Deputy Garland.  We seem to be approaching each other in that I seem to be growing greener by the moment.  I am sure Deputy Garland will appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite the same thing as public benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The words &ldquo;fishery development&rdquo; are included in Deputy Garland's amendment and in my amendment I am asking that we insert &ldquo;fisheries development&rdquo; before &ldquo;work&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>First, with regard to corporate membership, as indicated earlier in the debate, corporate membership could be of two kinds: that of an angling club and second, that of some other institution that was anxious to make a contribution either to the development of angling in the area, its protection or both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of a power bloc and I have so indicated already in the course of this debate.  During my discussions with anglers' groups &mdash; many of whom had diametrically opposed views with regard to both development and protection &mdash; all, in unison, agreed that there are whole areas of the country, of the <Col N="344" /> business community &mdash; hotels, guesthouses, public houses &mdash; who gain substantially from angling tourism and that they were making no contribution.  They appealed to me to include something in the Bill that would enable such people make a contribution if they were willing to do so.</P>
    <P>I foresaw the dangers mentioned by some Deputies, that people with fat wallets might be able to buy a whole lot of share certificates, turning all the co-operative societies into monopolies for them and I took steps in the Bill to prevent that happening.  If the people who made a big fuss about this read the Bill carefully they would have have seen that no matter how much money that type of corporate member pays, that member will receive just one share certificate.  I would be glad if they gave £1,000 willingly for a purpose they themselves claim is a desirable and honourable one.  There will be one share certificate available to the ordinary citizen for the price of six packets of cigarettes or seven pints of stout; that is all the voting power or privilege they will enjoy.  I am surprised that escaped the notice of many of the people who contributed to this debate.</P>
    <P>The second point that surprised me is this: angling clubs have been lauded by Members of this House, both Members who participated in this debate and those who participated in the Second Stage debate, by the members of the clubs themselves, which is not surprising and by various groups representing anglers. One point consistently made to me was that the work they did hitherto did not receive recognition by the State or by anybody else.  Knowing what many of them did, I accept that the efforts they put into angling development and protection over the years were not fully appreciated.  It was for that reason, at the request of those people right across the board, I inserted the provision in the Bill about angling clubs.  This is an important point in view of what Deputy Gilmore raised: they will get membership only with name and address by paying £12 for a share certificate; no more, that is all they will receive.  There is no question <Col N="345" /> of getting more membership certificates than actual members.  Membership of the co-operative societies is open to all &mdash; I want to insist on that.  There is no élitism, no exclusivity.  Anybody in Ireland &mdash; indeed a partitionist objection was made to the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; which I rejected &mdash; anybody in Ireland is entitled to purchase a share certificate for the price of six packets of cigarettes and become a full member with the same privileges, powers, duties, rights and obligations as somebody from a hotel, company &mdash; and I hope there will be lots of them &mdash; who will contribute say, £1,000, £2,000 or £3,000 to the development and protection of fisheries in their areas.  There is no lack of democracy whatsoever.  I reject the suggestion that there is.  It will be one person, one vote; no discrimination, no special position for anybody.</P>
    <P>I will pardon Deputy Taylor for coming in at the end of the debate and for having such a superficial view of this Bill.  When in doubt blame the draftsman is an old ploy in this House I have witnessed on many occasions.  Deputy Taylor talked about ploughing in money.  I have already indicated to the House that, as far as corporate membership is concerned, in the case of angling clubs, it will be one share certificate for each person nominated from their club provided they purchase a share certificate.  For the other membership they will recieve one membership certificate for whatever amount of money they contribute, no matter how large.  There is no élitism; it is more than democratic.  There are no privileges; there is no regimen of privilege.  Deputy Taylor has some effrontery to come in and accuse me or my party of élitism in this regard.  There is no regimen of privilege here.  There is simply the development of a co-operative society in the various areas to develop a rich, natural resource for our citizens and for tourist anglers who visit the country.</P>
    <P>It is easy and emotive to talk about expensive clubs.  It is not an expensive clubs to have to pay £1 per month for membership of a co-operative society. <Col N="346" /> Deputy Taylor used emotive words like élitism, privilege, reeks of this and reeks of that.  He talked about closed doors; when he had finished speaking it sounded like a cabal.  Every speaker is entitled to his imagination but there was no substance in what Deputy Taylor had to say.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell introduced something which I found very interesting, particularly knowing that the spokesperson for Fine Gael is a doughty warrior in the field into which he entered.  I congratulate him on the principle that fools rush in where angels fear to tread.  There is not even a scintilla of suspicion, or a mimesis of a scintilla of a suspicion, that there would be any discrimination against women in co-operative societies.  There is no apartheid.  The only division is between the angler and his fish and he must lure the fish by bait and so on to him.</P>

I have heard of other clubs who have refused on the basis of sex to admit citizens of this country.  I do not condone it.  I hope the practice will never enter our angling clubs.  I know it will not because, from the time that Our Lord chose fishermen for his most faithful followers to the present time, fishermen have been more than civilised in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We have engaged in quite a lot of general discussion on this <Col N="347" /> section.  It would be well for us to reflect on the question of where this section emanated from.  This section is the core of the deal struck between the Minister and the objectors to the rod licences.  The Minister had an enormous problem. There was a rod licence which was not acceptable, huge public controversy about it and much political pressure to get rid of it.  On the one hand when the Minister sat down to do his deal he wanted somebody to pay money for inland fisheries.  The clubs on the other hand were not willing to pay the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>What we have here is a formula whereby the Minister will be able to get money for inland fisheries and clubs will not have to pay it because it will be offset by the outlay on fisheries development work.  On top of that, clubs have the added attraction of getting control of these societies because they will be able to nominate large numbers of ordinary members as a result of their corporate membership.  Who will end up paying? We will have other types of corporate members such as hotel owners.  The Minister has, perhaps inadvertently, given us a misdirection in relation to whether the other corporate members will hold share certificates or nominate ordinary members as I understand it.  Let us take the case of a hotel.  A hotel could buy any number of share certificates but it will only be entitled to nominate one ordinary member to the society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>They will only get one certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is the catch.  In practice angling clubs around Lough Corrib will not have to pay for membership of this society because they will be able to claim that the outlay incurred in fisheries development is such as to give them the share certificates without paying for them.  This will be decided by the society which, in turn, will be controlled by the clubs who are claiming this <Col N="348" /> arrangement of offsetting the charges for their share certificates.  A German tourist staying in a hotel will not have to pay because the hotel, having purchased the share certificate, will pass it on and allow the tourist staying there for the weekend or whatever to use the hotel's share certificate to fish on Lough Corrib.  Who will have to pay?  The ordinary person who wants to fish on that lake and who is not a member of a club will end up paying for the share certificates and the right to fish because, inevitably, the society will decide by a 60 per cent vote that only those who hold share certificates will be permitted to fish those waters.  We talked earlier about whether those bodies were misnamed as co-operatives: they are not co-operatives, they are cartels.  None of us are in any way diminishing the role of angling clubs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but we have to call this what it is, a very clumsey compromise, if I may say so, worked out between the Minister and the rod licence objectors in order to solve the rod licence problem. The effect of it is free fishing for members of angling clubs and free fishing for tourists staying in hotels who have, in turn, purchased share certificates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but charged fishing for individuals who want to enjoy the pleasures of the lake.  That is what this comes down to.  The individual who goes out ultimately will have no effective say in how these societies are run.  Clubs with corporate membership entitled to nominate 100 ordinary members, or whatever the number might be are, in effect, the people who will control the societies. They are the people who will elect the management committee and who will make the decisions as to how public funds are disbursed and how the society will be run.  This section is a recipe which puts the individual who is not a member of an angling club at a great disadvantage <Col N="349" /> irrespective of whether that individual is a man or woman.</P>

      <P>The Minister who is a fisherman like myself, will be aware that to succeed at fishing one needs the right fly and one has to strike at the right time.  Now we have an opportunity to strike and say that nine years off the 21st century we are putting down a marker.  I accept, as he does, knowing something about fresh water fishing, that it is one of the sports where women get an opportunity to participate but that is not the point.  The point is that I have been asking the Minister to put down a marker, by including in the articles of association a requirement that persons who contribute to the company will not be discriminated against and that there will be no question of a distinction being made on the basis of sex.  The reason I suggested he put that down was that it would be a marker for other sports where women are excluded. We should take an opportunity, when debating matters in this House, to put this on the agenda.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister knows the difference between a sonnagham and a gillaroo, one operates in the deep and one operates in the shallow water.  I am afraid the Minister is operating in the shallow here because he is not prepared to listen to argument to use this Bill to put down a marker in the sporting area generally. I accept what the Minister has said about fisherwomen or whatever the correct title would be.  An opportunity could be taken here, and in other legislation going through the House, to get rid of this attitude in society that somehow women are second class citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister when replying to the debate on the amendment made some adverse comment about my coming into the debate rather late.  I do not know whether I am supposed to apologise for that or whether I am in order as a Member of this House to come in to participate in a debate on a Bill at any stage.  It is not as though we are over-burdened, as I look around the House, by Members of his own party or the Progressive Democrats making any contribution even at this late stage.  I do not think it is appropriate for the Minister to make an implied criticism of me because I chose to come in and make what contribution I can in a measured way to a small aspect of the Bill while paying tribute to the Minister, and my other colleagues of all parties, who have been doing trojan work on it.  We cannot all contribute to every Bill all the time and one does what one can.  I do not think it should be a matter for adverse comment when that is done in the best interests of the Bill and of fishing in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that any citizen of Ireland can pay his £12 and get his certificate but from my reading of the Bill I do not see that that is the case.  I do not see any right given to any and <Col N="351" /> every citizen to pay £12 and become a direct member of the co-operative.  I would like the Minister to direct me to the particular section that gives that right. I see reference to joining a club and thereby being nominated but I do not see in section 7 or any other section &mdash; as I have said I may be missing it &mdash; that any citizen of Ireland or anywhere else can pay £12 and become a direct member of the co-operative society.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated earlier that his intention here is that effort towards fisheries development and so on would be rewarded.  That is a laudable sentiment but it is not what the section says.  The section does not use the word &ldquo;effort&rdquo;; it uses a very different word, the word &ldquo;outlay&rdquo;.  Outlay and effort have two completely different meanings.  The word the Minister used in talking to us is a better word than the one he has put in the section.  Effort could imply that people would do anti-pollution work in the rivers, cleaning them up or all sorts of things that might involve work and effort but not outlay.  Outlay means money, perhaps substantial sums, out of the pocket.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister would be prepared even at this late stage to consider some variation there.  I would ask him to consider substituting for the word &ldquo;outlay&rdquo; the words &ldquo;contribution, financial or otherwise,&rdquo; thereby bringing into play in the section the very thing the Minister spoke of, namely, effort.  It would be encompassed by that wording, rather than by the narrow wording, &ldquo;outlay.&rdquo; I would ask the Minister to consider that wording.  It would certainly be of some help in the section.  I am not saying it would make it right but it would be of major help, and it would be appreciated if the Minister would consider it.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the section troubles me.  The Minister seems to have implied in his earlier address to the House that the qualification of having particular regard to the outlay of the body engaged in fishery development work of public benefit is confined to the corporate members who are not angling clubs.  I do <Col N="352" /> not know whether that is what he is telling the House is the position under the section but it is not my reading of it.  My reading of it is that if an angling club go to the society seeking recognition &mdash;&ldquo;in considering whether to grant recognition to an angling club&rdquo; is the wording used in subsection (3) &mdash; regard will be had to the outlay of the club on fishery development work of public benefit.  I will have something to say about the words &ldquo;public benefit&rdquo; in a minute.</P>
    <P>I agree that there never was any problem about being able to fish and there certainly will not be under this provision, but if a club of more modest circumstances and whose members are of more modest means were to go to the society seeking recognition what would happen?  The society would be obliged &mdash; it is not a question of them being entitled &mdash; under the law to have particular regard to the outlay of that angling club on fishery development of public benefit.  It does not refer to potential outlay or outlay at some future date.  The wording clearly refers to outlay incurred in the past.  That very likely would make matters extremely difficult for a club coming to the society seeking recognition because the society would be obligated to say: &ldquo;This is laid down for us by law and section 8 of the governing Act says that we must pay particular regard to the outlay you have put into fishery development work of public benefit in the area&rdquo;. I would say as an aside that no work in this area would be work for public benefit because the members of the public at large have no rights there at all.  This is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Mitchell and the Minister I am not a fishing person.  I have gone on holidays many times to the west of Ireland for the sake of the scenery, in fishing areas admittedly, although I have never fished there.  I became friendly with and spoke to many local people living in these areas and the views I have on this, as often happens, are formed from some of those conversations.  I distinctly recall being very friendly with a man who lived in a very small and modest cottage over-looking a very attractive fishery which <Col N="353" /> was fished repeatedly by English, French, Germans, Italians and so on. Late one evening when we were talking &mdash; this stuck in my mind although it was many a long year ago &mdash; he commented on the fact that it was strange that all these people were able to fish in the area while he was not and never has been able to afford to fish there.  I am looking at the Bill to see if that position will be radically changed.</P>

I stand by the comments I made regarding the unsatisfactory and elitist nature of what is proposed here.  Would the Minister consider the variation I suggested?  It would be of some benefit although I would still be unhappy about the basic structure of it.  I am unhappy that a club going to the society for the first time seeking recognition would have to run the gauntlet of particular regard having to be paid to those substantial expenditures.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Browne <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i> has been given permission to raise the matter of the medical standard required by the Civil Service Commission particularly in relation to eyesight and if these same standards apply to semi-State companies. Deputy Browne has five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Go raibh míle maith agat a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Tá mé buíoch go bhfuil seans agam an cheist seo a phlé.</P>
      <P>At the outset I want to inform you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that you, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, Deputy Dick Spring and even President Bush need not apply to Iarnród Éireann for the most mundane job because you would not get it since you wear spectacles.  This is the difficulty we have tonight.  I would advise you all to stay with the jobs you have.</P>
      <P>New regulations were implemented on 28 February which mean that anybody doing a medical test will have to read without their glasses, and in this day and age that only happens when one is looking for spectacles.  In my view a plate layer who works on the railway line replacing the track should not be subjected to this rule because if he is wearing glasses he can see perfectly.  It has been long accepted that glasses replace weak eyesight and help to overcome it.  We have had medical tests over the years and they have been useful both to employers and employees.  We have to agree at this stage that spectacles are acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell me exactly what standards are laid down by <Col N="357" /> the Civil Service Appointments Commission because if the requirements of Iarnród Éireann were implemented nationwide, nearly half the workforce would lose their jobs, that is, if I can judge by the treatment meted out to one Carlow applicant who was sent to Dublin for his medical.</P>
    <P>The company's excuse is that this standard is necessary because of mobility of the workforce in Iarnród Éireann.  This excuse rings very hollow in view of the fact that the system in Iarnród Éireann is to release temporary workers a month before they have served their time to become permanent and then re-employ them.  If this is the kind of mobility they are talking about, workers can do without it.  It is difficult to accept that a bespectacled worker on a railway line would not see an object as large as a train.  It is incredible that the board of Iarnród Éireann fail to accept that after the age of 40 most people's eyesight weakens.  It is entirely unacceptable that in this day of scarce employment barriers should be put in the way of workers.</P>
    <P>Let me add that I think it is regrettable that I have to make this statement before the Minister makes his.  I appeal to him to take up the case of Iarnród Eireann because the workers there are getting a very raw deal.  I am amazed that the unions have not taken up this case.  I look forward to the Minister's reply to assure me that this system cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I should first point out that, under the terms of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, recruitment to positions in the Civil Service is a matter for the Civil Service Commissioners who are completely independent in the performance of their functions.  The principle of independent recruitment contained in the Act is an extremely important one, guaranteeing that all candidates for positions in the Civil Service are considered in a fair and impartial manner and that merit is the criterion for selection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> Under section 17 of the 1956 Act, the commissioners are required to satisfy themselves on a number of matters before accepting that a person is qualified for appointment.  These include that the person is in good health and free from any physical defect or disease which would be likely to interfere with the proper discharge of the duties of the post and that the person possesses the physical characteristics, if any, prescribed for the position in the regulations for the competition in question.</P>
    <P>The commissioners are thus required to ensure, among other things, that a candidate's eyesight is of a standard which would enable him or her to perform the duties of the position effectively both at the time of recruitment and in the future.  This applies equally to those recruited from special competitions for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I understand that the standard of eyesight is determined by the Civil Service Commissioners on the advice of the chief medical officer and would vary according to the duties of the position in question. Standards would be more stringent, for example, for posts in certain services such as air traffic control, prisons or customs and excise than for posts of an administrative or clerical nature.  Candidates who are regarded as unsuitable for appointment because of defective vision are notified accordingly.  They may appeal this decision and their case is then referred to an independent specialist.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has outlined a particular kind of case.  Certainly the Minister is prepared to contact the Civil Service Commission and to make them aware of the concerns expressed here tonight.  The Minister has no function in relation to recruitment to State bodies.  I am not in a position to deal with this aspect of the Deputy's question.  However, I am sure the Deputy is aware that it is normal for an employer to make inquiries about the suitability of prospective employees from a health point of view.  Essentially, the Civil Service Commissioners are independent. They are governed by legislation but within that there can, of course, be scope for reconsideration of <Col N="359" /> the application of that legislation.  In view of the points made by the Deputy tonight the Minister will ask the Commissioners to look at this question.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Repossession of Cars.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of bringing to the Minister's attention the serious matter whereby financial institutions order the repossession of motor vehicles.  One of my constituents had his car repossessed and his case is a good example of what happens.</P>
      <P>My constituent purchased a pre-owned motor vehicle via the national papers by private treaty.  He paid cash for the vehicle and received an official receipt. He completed the official motor registration change of ownership form and received the original and official tax book in which he was later registered as the owner.  Like most ordinary innocent individuals my constituent was happy with his purchase.  One can fully appreciate and understand his shock and horror when 11 months after he purchased his car it was taken from outside his home. However, that was only the start of his problems.</P>
      <P>Once he got over the initial shock he went to his local Garda station to report the unauthorised taking of his vehicle. He was advised by the gardaí that his car had been repossessed by one of the leading banking institutions as there was an outstanding debt due on it and was told that he should contact them.  I was astonished when this matter was brought to my attention.  I rang the Garda station and asked them to record the unauthorised taking of the vehicle, which is exactly what happened.  After that I contacted other Departments.  It is not right that a person who purchases a motor vehicle in good faith and goes to the trouble, which many people do not, of completing the official motor registration change of ownership form so that he is registered as the owner, should have his car taken in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might say that there is an <Col N="360" /> institution who can advise people on whether there is an outstanding hire purchase arrangement on a vehicle.  All I can say to that is that my constituent was not aware of this.  I wonder how many people are unaware of the existence of this institution which can give advice on such matters.  One could pose the question: does this relate only to hire purchase arrangements?  With the development of financial services, lease acquisitions and other financial arrangements I wonder if any institution would be able to say the exact arrangements made in regard to any motor vehicle.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote from correspondence I received from Dublin Corporation's motor registration office which states:</P>
    <P>The licensing authority is concerned with the registered ownership of a vehicle and not the legal ownership. A person in whose name a vehicle is registered may or may not be the legal owner of that vehicle.  Ownership is defined in regulations as the person by whom the vehicle is kept.</P>
    <P>I received a letter from the solicitor acting on behalf of the banking institution in which he stated:</P>
    <P>We are instructed to advise our clients are the legal owners of the vehicle and purchased same for the purpose of leasing same to one of its customers.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that innocent individuals who purchase pre-owned vehicles and receive an official registration book registered in the name of the person who is selling the vehicle can have their cars repossessed with the co-operation of the local gardaí.  There are many questions I should like to ask in regard to this matter but I cannot do so in the time available to me.  Legislation should be introduced to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>This issue has been brought to the attention of the general public by way of a popular radio show.  Many people who have found themselves in the same position as my constituent phoned the presenter of this radio show to talk about their experiences.  We should introduce <Col N="361" /> legislation or bring in regulations to prevent such incidents.  I ask that this very simple request be addressed by the Minister. The easiest way to deal with this problem would be to provide that the person who has legal ownership of the vehicle should be the registered owner. In this way one could easily find out if a banking institution has an interest in the vehicle.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the problem raised by Deputy Callely which has received extensive coverage in the media. I share the Deputy's concern for the difficulties and distress caused to persons who find themselves in this type of situation.</P>
      <P>The difficulty arises where a person purpose to sell a car to another person and the purchaser subsequently discovers, much to his cost, that the seller was not the car's legal owner.  Ownership of the vehicles comprehended by some credit transactions is retained by, and still reside with, the provider of the credit.  I should point out that such arrangements are perfectly legitimate.  In some instances, such as hire purchase, the agreement for the giving of credit will provide for the transfer of ownership at the end of the period of the agreement but in certain leasing transactions there is no provision for the ultimate transfer of ownership.</P>
      <P>Such responsibility as I might have in this area derives from a general responsibility in the matter of consumer credit. I regret that there is no action open to me to resolve difficulties of the kind to which the Deputy has drawn attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Prima facie,</i> an action of this kind may entail fraud which should be reported to the gardaí and any question of recovery of moneys paid over is a civil matter to be resolved by the courts.  However, I would remind the House, that the registration documents of a vehicle are often used to establish the credibility of the seller in such cases.  It is important to reiterate that possession of such documents is not a proof of ownership.  Indeed <Col N="362" /> the tax book clearly states that the registered owner for motor tax purposes is not necessarily the legal owner.  Any changes in the form of the tax book would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment who deals with such matters.  I will draw his attention to this problem and he may consider it appropriate to put an even stronger notice in the motor tax book.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, in the matter of the buying and selling of goods there was a philosophy of <i>caveat emptor,</i> let the buyer beware.  While this has changed to a considerable degree because of the introduction in recent years of a considerable body of legislation which affords consumers specific rights and protections, it is an approach which is still obviously worth observing in cases entailing the purchase of used cars.  In the case of car purchases members of the public can best do this by availing of a facility provided by a body called the Hire Purchase Information Ltd., 20 South William Street, Dublin 2, telephone No. 6794522.  This body maintain a register of vehicles which are the subject of hire purchase or leasing agreements and on the payment of a fee of about £4 will provide information to a member of the public with regard to whether such an agreement exists in relation to a particular vehicle.</P>

      <P>Deputy Pat Rabbitte has been given permission to raise the matter of the urgent necessity to extend the community policing experiment and the juvenile liaison officer scheme having regard to the misery being caused to local residents by worsening crime in parts of the Dublin South-West constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise the issue of worsening crime in parts of my constituency and the urgent necessity for the gardaí to be given additional resources &mdash; specifically the extension of both the community policing and the juvenile liaison officer schemes to <Col N="363" /> deal more effectively with the situation. I can tell the Minister for Justice tonight, for example, of the meeting in Killinarden school earlier this week when 500 people attended and expressed the view that vandalism and crime are out of control in the area.  This plea from law abiding citizens can and will, as summer approaches, be repeated at other locations in the constituency.</P>
      <P>At that meeting dozens of speakers voiced what has only been said in private up to now; women returning from late shift working walk in fear for their personal safety; single mother families barricaded in their homes; families under siege because they happen to live closest to the point of congregation for young gangs on the rampage; homes broken into and burgled and schools damaged and teaching aids stolen in broad daylight.</P>
      <P>Above all there are two things that are causing law abiding citizens to despair; first, an environment of fear is being created by a very small number of criminal families who are known to the gardaí but, in the view of the residents, are not being effectively prosecuted by the gardaí; second, Dublin Corporation, as the housing authority in some of these areas, seem either unwilling or unable to deal with troublesome families whose offspring are terrorising the community.  There is virtually no hands-on management by the corporation of what is the largest local authority housing area in Ireland.  There is no accountability to the people since no public representative of any party is elected to Dublin City Council and consequently Dublin Corporation are seen to be neglectful and careless about housing allocation and management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am now satisfied that crime and alienation in parts of my constituency are as bad, if not worse, than the sad circumstances a few years ago that finally secured the community policing pilot scheme for Tallaght.  This scheme has been a very considerable success but sadly is no longer able to cope.  In addition, despite very recent successes in the constituency by the Drug Squad, <Col N="364" /> there is again widespread concern about alleged drug pushing, especially of illegally procured, usually prescribed, drugs.  The latest representations I have had concern the fear that a clinic operated by medical doctors in one part of my constituency may have to be shut because of vandalism and break-ins to the surgery and the doctors' cars.</P>
    <P>In addition, the threat in some cases to the personal safety of busworkers means that the transport service to some areas is at risk at night time.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to say to the Minister for Justice and to the Government that, Dublin south-west urgently needs additional Garda resources and, specifically, the extension of both the juvenile liaison officer scheme which is being starved of resources and, above all, the community policing experiment.  Public sector housing in Tallaght must become the responsibility of Dublin County Council and, ultimately, the new West Dublin Council in the current reform of local government.  Suitable remedial detention centres must be opened for young offenders.  Will the Minister comment on whether he thinks a new offences against the person Bill may be necessary in the context of modern conditions, having regard to the fact that the existing legislation has been on the Statute Book for 130 years?</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister tonight to agree to meet the community leaders in Killinarden who attended this public meeting to which I referred.  It is not the only area, but it is an area of acute problems at the moment.</P>
    <P>I also appeal to the Government and the Minister to take some urgent action to break this cycle.  In some of these areas unemployment is as high as 75 per cent and there is a need for the Government to address some of those black spot employment areas urgently, because of the alienation of young people who are following the lead of a small number of families of hardened criminals and who might be steered away from that path if they had employment opportunities.  The situation is extremely serious.  I would ask the Minister to take my word for <Col N="365" /> that.  The TDs of all parties for the constituency agree with my view.  It is wrong that law abiding citizens feel they cannot go about their everyday duties without living in fear for their personal safety and the safety of their property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Hearing Deputy Rabbitte paint a picture of crime and vandalism in the Dublin South-West constituency, the uninformed listener might be forgiven for mistaking the constituency for an area which has been starved of law enforcement officers and resources.  This is not so.  While the people of Tallaght and Clondalkin which make up the greater part of the constituency have had to bear their share of the crime problem of recent years, the Garda Síochána have been very active in both those areas.  The Tallaght area in particular has seen the development of a number of policing initiatives to enhance the Garda services available to the local community to tackle the problems of petty crime and vandalism.</P>
      <P>The efforts of the Garda Síochána in tackling crime in Clondalkin and Tallaght have not been without success.  The statistics for indictable crime reported that both of these areas last year showed an aggregate reduction of no less than 9 per cent on the figures for the previous year. This is a very significant reduction by any standards and it serves as an indication that the measures being taken by the Garda Síochána are having the desired effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte this evening urged the increased application of the community policing and the juvenile liaison schemes.  I am a committed supporter of these schemes and I assure the Deputy that resources are not being spared in putting these schemes into operation in the communities which need them most. The community policing scheme is already well established in Tallaght and Clondalkin.  There is a total of 23 members of the force engaged in this form of policing.  The aim of the scheme is to build better relations between the Garda and the local community and to have a more visable Garda presence in <Col N="366" /> local neighbourhoods.  The Garda authorities are very pleased with the success of the scheme in Tallaght and Clondalkin and the level of manpower and resources allocated to the scheme, especially in Talllaght, shows the commitment of the Garda authorities to ensuring that an adequate Garda service is available for the protection of property and the peace of local residents.</P>
    <P>The introduction of community policing in Tallaght was accompanied by the allocation of substantial additional manpower resources.  The overall number of gardaí employed in Tallaght and Clondalkin has been increasing in recent years.  Recently, two additional gardaí were assigned to Tallaght and four additional clerical assistants were assigned to Tallaght, which released members of the force to go about their crime prevention and investigation duties.  The manpower needs of Tallaght and Clondalkin are being kept under review.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the juvenile liaison officer scheme.  In Tallaght at present 80 juveniles are being dealt with under the scheme.  The scheme has a crucial role to play in giving young people who fall foul of the law a second chance.  I share the Deputy's concern that it should work effectively and that the services of the juvenile liaison officer scheme should be available to any young offender who might benefit from a second chance option.  With this in mind, I approved a package of measures last December to increase the effectiveness of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Another initiative taken by the Garda authorities in Tallaght is the pilot project scheme set up in January in conjunction with St. Patrick's College in Drumcondra, with the wholehearted co-operation of the teachers of the area.  The intention is to help children develop healtheir attitudes towards the Garda and law enforcement and to inculcate positive attitudes in relation to the prevention of vandalism, litter, care for the environment and local amenities.  This scheme has worked very well in the community in Tallaght.  Much of the work took place in informal contact outside of the classroom as well as inside.  A mini-bus has <Col N="367" /> been provided since May last year and it is available to the local gardaí to take the children on sporting trips, to visit Garda Headquarters and so on.  What we are trying to do is to get local gardaí involved with the community and more and more work is being done in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully to the Deputy's contribution tonight in which he expressed his concern and outlined the situation which prevails as he, the parents and residents view it.  I will have the matter investigated once again in the light of the outcome of the meeting held on Tuesday last, the details of which were passed to me by a number of my colleagues.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank you for allowing me to raise this matter and sincerely thank the Minister for coming in to listen to me.  The reason I raise this matter is that I am concerned about the treatment I have seen meted out to people in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance or assistance when allocated a local authority house and in need of furniture and other basic household <Col N="368" /> effects.  Quite simply, the treatment that they get depends on the health board area in which they live.  Community welfare officers have discretion to help them with furniture and other essentials and most decisions are fair and adequate.  The scheme is a good and necessary one for people who have to start making a home from scratch.  Many of these are separate or deserted mothers but why is the operation of the scheme so secretive, why are there no clear guidelines and why has it got no name?  Some unscrupulous officials are manipulating the scheme to the extent that they are making beggars out of those unfortunates who need help at a very emotional and difficult time.  Let me give as examples two women in my constituency.</P>
      <P>The first of these is a mother who was housed in Shankill.  She went to the community officer in her area who gave her a list of her entitlements and told her that she would have to put £50 towards the cost of a new fridge and cooker.  She was treated with dignity and grace and the transaction was a happy one.  The other person is 21 years old and a single mother with a two years old child.  She was housed in Dundrum but when she went to her community welfare officer she at best got begrudging treatment.  No list was handed to her and instead she was offered bits and pieces and told she would be given £60 to buy a second-hand fridge and cooker.  She was also told that she would have to arrange transport herself. The most unacceptable aspect is that the funds for these goods come from a central budget and not from the local offices.  No official has the right to punish someone in this way.  I even suspect that some of these men are practising misogynists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want all the health boards to come clean on this scheme, to stop playing scrooge, to let us all know what the guidelines are and to apply them in each health board area.  Other public representatives have spoken to me about this matter. They have come across the same problems but they realise that nothing can be done or achieved by approaching these men directly.  Likewise, the applicants in question fear that they will be victimised <Col N="369" /> if they raise the matter.  The Dáil is the place to correct bad practice and ambivalent treatment.  I hope the Minister will take action in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's motion relates to the issue of payments for exceptional needs under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The question of whether and, if so, to what extent an applicant for supplementary welfare allowance should be assisted in the provision of exceptional needs payments is a matter for determination by each health board.  My Department's guidelines on the operation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, issued to the health boards before the commencement of the scheme, point out that claims for help with exceptional needs can arise in a wide variety of situations and that each claim should be considered in the light of individual and local circumstances.</P>
      <P>In considering each application the health boards will take into account the applicant's circumstances, whether essential items are already available to him or her and his or her ability to provide for these from their own resources.  As these payments are discretionary no pre-determined levels of support are available. Each case is different and is decided on its merits having regard to all the relevant facts.  The payments may be made in kind or in cash and may vary considerably from case to case depending on the individual's circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 212 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, a health board may in any case where it considers it reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case so to do, determine the supplementary welfare allowance that shall be paid to a person by way of a single payment to meet an exceptional need.  The health boards may assist people under this provision with the purchase of essential household equipment whether by way of cash allowances or by providing the actual items from their own stores or via local traders.  The guidelines suggest that the following household items can be regarded as essential and <Col N="370" /> may be treated as the normal minimum requirements: table and chairs; curtains and floor coverings; beds and mattresses; sheets, blankets and pillows; household appliances, for example, cookers.</P>
    <P>The health boards follow these guidelines closely and will supply these items to persons once they have established their need for them.  The guidelines on the operation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are kept under continuous review and general directives are issued to the health boards by my Department from time to time to deal with new developments which arise.  The area of exceptional needs payments is being reviewed in the context of a general review of the guidelines for the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is at present taking place within my Department.  The review will seek not only to update the guidelines but to address any inconsistencies which may be present with a view to achieving greater equity and uniformity of treatment.</P>
    <P>It is understood that the Deputy has a particular case in mind &mdash; she referred indirectly to the case.  I have contacted the Eastern Health Board who have informed me that the Deputy's representations in this case have been accepted as an appeal and it will be speedily determined.</P>

      <P>I am calling on the Minister for Justice tonight to take whatever steps are necessary to bring about a stop to the unacceptable practice which exists in the legal profession, termed the solicitor-client aspect arrangement.  This is an agreement whereby solicitors deduct sums of money from damages awarded to their clients over and above the costs the solicitor receives as a result of a court decision.  Abuses are widespread.  I am aware of cases where solicitors have stopped thousands of pounds from clients who have received court awards and have described them as deductions for extra work carried out even though they have been awarded costs by the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The clients of solicitors are intimidated when they object to these deductions. They are told that they are at liberty to <Col N="371" /> go to the taxing master of the High Court to appeal the action of the solicitor. However, they are warned that if they fail in their application to the taxing master to have the deductions waived they will be liable for extra costs.  This, generally speaking, deters the client from taking any further action and the client usually goes along with the solicitor's decision to make the extra deduction.</P>
    <P>While most solicitors are honourable and honest until such time as there is a proper contract between solicitor and client these abuses will occur and the public will be victimised.  I am aware of cases where awards have been made in court and the solicitors have received their costs but these same solicitors have in turn deducted further amounts from the client's awards.  I have been in contact with the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland on this issue.  They, again, have used the Pontius Pilate method and stated that this is a matter for the client and solicitor and that they cannot intervene. I will be meeting the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland tomorrow on this issue and I will be putting my views to them on the abuses which are occurring.  I believe the Minister must in any amendments to the Solicitors Act regularise this area.  There must be written contracts and agreements.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the public must not be left at the mercy of unscrupulous practitioners in the legal profession and the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland must act not only as the guardian of the legal profession but also act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will try to stay within the allotted time.</P>
      <P>First, I should make it clear that there may be circumstances where a solicitor is entitled to charge costs directly to his client, over and above the costs that he is entitled to recover from another party in an action &mdash; the so-called &ldquo;party and party&rdquo; costs.  This aspect is regulated by Order 99 of the Rules of the Superior Courts.  However I have become aware that it is the practice of some solicitors to deduct substantial amounts from damages awarded to their clients, in respect of their costs in addition to what may be recoverable in the form of party and party costs.  As a general practice this is objectionable and I am considering the question of including suitable provisions in the proposed Solicitors Amendment Bill, which is at an advanced stage of drafting, to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>A client who is dissatisfied with the amount of costs sought from him by his solicitor is entitled to require the solicitor to submit the bill of costs for taxation by the Taxing Master in accordance with the Rules of the Superior Courts.</P>
      <P>I should also add that any person who has a complaint about deductions being made from an award of damages by a solicitor may raise the matter with the law society, who are the regulatory body for the profession.  I have asked the law society to consider their existing procedures and guidelines in this area and to ensure that their disciplinary arrangements are adequate for dealing with complaints received about solicitors in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>The report of the Interdepartmental Study Group on Unemployment Statistics, published in April 1979, recommended that persons aged 65 years and over should be excluded from the live register effectively because they are retired.  This recommendation was implemented from January 1980.</P>

    <P>There are two schemes currently in <Col N="127" /> operation &mdash; the pre-retirement allowance scheme and the pre-retirement credits scheme under which persons in receipt of long term unemployment assistance or signing for credits respectively can declare themselves as retired from the labour market.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 46 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>The present famine in Africa in which more than 20 million people may be in danger of starvation is at least as serious as that of 1984-85 when similar numbers of people were affected.  At that time the European Community significantly increased its emergency aid to the affected regions.  This culminated in the Dublin Plan to which Deputy O'Keeffe refers, under which the Community attempted to meet 60 per cent of the food deficit by mobilising 1.2 million tonnes of food for delivery to the peoples of Ethiopia, Sudan and the other countries in need.  While this had the support of all parties in the House I pay tribute to the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret Fitzgerald, as well as to Deputy O'Keeffe who was Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs for their role at the time.</P>
      <P>According to the latest estimates from the Commission, the needs of all the countries affected on this occasion are put at 4.5 million tonnes and at the present time there is a shortfall of 1.5 million tonnes.  The situation is most serious in the Horn of Africa&mdash;Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia &mdash; where about 15 million people are at risk.  Many other countries, in particular Angola, Mozambique and Liberia, are facing a worsening situation.  The most immediate priority is to meet the needs of the next few months when stocks of food aid, especially in Sudan, will become depleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While pledges continue to be announced the delivery of aid supplies up to now has not been adequate.  It must be said that this has been due to a significant extent to factors outside the control of donors.  I would point out that the causes of famine have their roots not just in crop failure due to lack of rains or other <Col N="131" /> natural disasters.  Civil war and in some cases lack of co-operation with the international relief effort on the part of governments or rebel movements have gravely inhibited the effectiveness of aid and the ability of donors to reach the populations in need.  The port of Massawa in Ethiopia, for example, was closed for a long period by rebel action, necessitating complicated and expensive alternative arrangements for the delivery of aid in Ethiopia.  The eventual reopening of this port to emergency relief which was achieved following intense pressure on all sides throughout 1990 has greatly assisted the provision of supplies to the populations affected.  In Sudan much valuable time has been lost by the government's refusal to acknowledge the scale of the problem and to co-operate with the international relief effort.  I would hope that progress can now be accelerated as there have been recent indications that the authorities there are taking some action to facilitate delivery of aid.</P>
    <P>During Ireland's term of office as Presidency of the EC Council of Ministers the Government were active in keeping the question of famine in Africa high on the agenda.  We have worked, and will continue to work, to promote the peaceful resolution of conflicts in these countries through political negotiations such as those which succeeded in securing the reopening of the port of Massawa in Ethiopia and which appears to be yielding some results in Sudan with the reactivation of Operation Lifeline &mdash; the UN international relief effort for Sudan.</P>
    <P>Up to last week, two thirds of the needs in Ehtiopia and 50 per cent of the needs in Sudan were covered by pledges, although some of these remained to be confirmed or delivered.  Taking all the countries affected, the European Community and its member states are supplying over one million tonnes of food &mdash; a very significant proportion of the overall needs, 4.5 million.  This compares with about two million tonnes from all other donors.</P>
    <P>Ireland has contributed over 1.1 million pounds from the disaster relief fund since the beginning of 1990 in <Col N="132" /> response to the emergency.  In addition a further contribution of 250,000 pounds is being provided to the World Food Programme in Sudan.  We also contribute to the efforts of other international relief agencies and we will support further action on the part of the Community and its member states as necessary.</P>
    <P>At the General Affairs Council meeting last Monday the Commission was asked to bring forward proposals for additional aid.  It was intended that this should meet the immediate needs of Sudan and Ethiopia.  I am hopeful that it may also constitute a quarter of the remaining needs of all the countries concerned until the next harvest is due.</P>
    <P>While there is no room for complacency, I am now more optimistic that this latest initiative by the EC may be followed by corresponding action by others.  If the rest of the international community also pledges to meet a significant proportion of the outstanding needs we may yet avert a disaster on the scale that we all fear.  There is no doubt that more needs to be done.</P>

      <P>I have been concerned by the reports of the recent epidemic in Peru and an allocation of £20,000 from the disaster relief fund has been made in response to the appeal by the Peruvian Government for international assistance. This appeal was made through the United Nations Disaster Relief Organisation (UNDRO) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) who are co-ordinating the present cholera relief operation on behalf of the Government of Peru.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 111 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union has been under way for some two months now and a large number of proposals on various issues have been put forward.  These include the Franco-German proposals referred to by the Deputies and a Presidency questionnaire designed to draw together more coherently the various themes which are emerging.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be desirable to go into detail on the many proposals which are still taking shape in what is a continuing negotiation.  I can however give the Deputies an account of our position in more general terms on the major issues which have emerged so far at the conference, which include those referred to in the questions.</P>
      <P>We have already made it clear that we accept the objective of a common foreign and security policy and are prepared to work towards it on the understanding that the institutions of the Community and the Twelve as we now develop them, would be the primary forum for the working out of such a policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Rome European Council of 14-15 December last, we joined with our partners in working out guidelines and general principles which would govern such a policy.  These are still relevant. They envisage that the common foreign and security policy would aim at maintaining peace and international stability, developing friendly relations with all countries, promoting democracy, the <Col N="135" /> rule of law and respect for human rights and encouraging the economic development of all nations, while also bearing in mind the special relations of individual member states.</P>
    <P>As regards common security, the Rome guidelines envisage the gradual extension of the union's role in this area &mdash; in particular and initially with reference to issues debated in international organisations; arms control, disarmament and related issues; CSCE matters; certain questions debated in the United Nations, including peace-keeping operations; economic and technological co-operation in the armaments field; coordination of armaments export policy and non-proliferation.</P>
    <P>It was also agreed at Rome that, with a view to the future, the prospect of a role for the union in defence matters should be considered.  But it was made clear that this would be without prejudice to member states' existing obligations in this area, bearing in mind the importance of maintaining and strengthening the ties with the Atlantic Alliance and without prejudice to the traditional positions of other member states.  We regard this latter provision as important.  It was also agreed that the idea of a commitment by member states to provide mutual assistance as well as proposals put forward by some member states on the future of Western European Union should also be addressed.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Intergovernmental Conference now under way is to see how far the necessary consensus can be reached on provisions for a common foreign and security policy based on these principles which we have already agreed.</P>
    <P>One important issue is whether a common foreign and security policy can be introduced gradually.  We take the view that it can.  Another important issue is whether, when the new policy comes into operation, decisions should be by majority voting or by consensus.  Our view has been that it would be only realistic at this stage where sensitive issues are being brought into the domain <Col N="136" /> of common Twelve policy for the first time, to provide for decision by consensus. We would also see no objection to various proposals for an improved institutional framework to implement the proposed new policy.  This could involve decision-making by a single Council covering the present responsibilities of the Council of Ministers and of European Political Co-operation; a single Secretariat to cover both areas and adequate procedures for consulting the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The joint working paper submitted for discussion at the Conference by France and Germany proposed among other things, a role for the Western European Union (WEU), to which nine member states belong.  The role proposed is that of a channel between the future Political Union and NATO.  In this regard I would only say at this point, that if there is to be a common security policy of the political union towards which we are now working it is our view that it should be formulated together by the Twelve in accordance with principles which they have worked out together as its basis.</P>
    <P>Our approach on these matters was stated by the Taoiseach, in the Dáil on 1 November 1990 when he reiterated a position which reflects also the position of previous Governments.  On that occasion he said that:</P>
    <P>If the Community were at some stage to embark on arrangements for its own security and with its own security concept, then Ireland as a fully committed member state would be willing to consider participation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 75, 101 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>In 1979, when Ireland established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, the Irish Government recognised the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China.  Diplomatic relations are conducted with China on that basis.  At that time, Tibet was recognised internationally as part of the People's Republic.  That situation remains unchanged.  The question therefore of recognising Tibet as an independent and sovereign state does not arise.</P>
      <P>One of the purposes of the United Nations, to which Ireland fully subscribes, is to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples.  Consistent with that principle, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 45/131 on 14 December 1990, entitled, &ldquo;Universal realisation of the right of peoples to self-determination&rdquo;. Ireland joined in the unanimous adoption of the resolution which does not make reference to any particular territories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I continue to be deeply concerned at reports of human rights abuses in Tibet. Our Ambassador in Beijing has continued to monitor closely the situation in Tibet, especially in relation to human rights.  Together with his colleagues from the Twelve, the Ambassador has ensured <Col N="138" /> that the Chinese authorities are kept fully aware of our concerns on human rights in Tibet.</P>
    <P>As recently as 27 February at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, the Presidency on behalf of the Twelve renewed the appeal to the Chinese authorities to guarantee full respect for the human rights of their citizens throughout China, including Tibet.</P>
    <P>Ireland's policy on Tibet has always had as a central concern the need to ensure that the human rights of its people are protected.  That continues to be the case.</P>
    <P>I take it Deputy Barry is referring to the private visit to Ireland of the Dalai Lama.  In contacts with the Chinese authorities on this matter it has been made absolutely clear that in our democratic system foreign visitors are at liberty to visit Ireland at the invitation of private persons and organisations, provided entry formalities are complied with.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The closure of cross-Border roads has been repeatedly raised, both in general terms and in relation to specific crossings, through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast and the British authorities have <Col N="139" /> been kept fully informed of the views of the communities most affected.  It has also been frequently on the agenda of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, being most recently discussed at the last Conference meeting which was held in Belfast on the 9 April.</P>

    <P>A formal request has been received from the UN Secretary General for our participation in a United Nations observer unit to be known as UNIKOM, the UN Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission. Ireland, along with 31 other countries, has been asked to supply military observers.  The request to Ireland is for one officer of lieutenant colonel rank and seven of major or captain rank.  The <Col N="140" /> Government have given their approval and preparations are under way to send these personnel.  Arrangements are in hand for the senior Irish officer to travel to Kuwait City by the end of this week. The other officers are expected to follow as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the UNIKOM operation are laid out in Security Council Resolution 687 of 3 April and in the Secretary-General's report of 5 April 1991 on the implementation of Resolution 687.  The mandate of the mission will be to monitor a demilitarised zone of approximately 200 kilometres in length, extending ten kilometres inside Iraq and five kilometres inside Kuwait from the Iraq-Kuwait boundary, to deter violations of this boundary and to observe any hostile or potentially hostile action mounted from Iraq or Kuwait.  I have placed copies of the complete texts in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <P>The Government are continuing to give a high priority to the problems of Irish emigrants, particularly those who are in an undocumented situation.  In the case of Australia, the embassy at Canberra has been instructed to offer all appropriate assistance and advice to Irish citizens who may have overstayed the validity period of their visa and who may wish to regularise their situation.  The embassy also keeps in contact and works closely with Irish organisations and associations in Austrialia to ensure that the difficulties facing all our emigrants are kept to a minimum.</P>

    <P>In the context of the recent introduction of new Australian regulations, I <Col N="141" /> am aware of reports of some difficulties being experienced by Irish citizens who have remained in Australia beyond the validity period of their visas.  The regulations in question were introduced specifically to address the overstay problem.</P>
    <P>The embassy at Canberra has informed me that the implementation of the new regulations on overstayers has caused some increase in the number of Irish overstayers coming to the notice of the Australian authorities but the increase has not been significant.

      <P>The Deputy, I take it, is referring to the announcement by the Kuwaiti authorities that they will be reducing the number of foreign workers who are employed in their country.  I agree that such a decision will have very serious effects on the workers involved.  Many have came from countries where there was no work for them and their families at home have been dependent on their remittances from Kuwait.  This problem is faced by all immigrant workers and the Government are not aware of any discrimination in this regard against Palestinians. More generally, the number of foreign workers employed in Kuwait is primarily a matter for the Government of Kuwait.  In the difficult circumstances which that Government face it has been decided that there should be fewer foreign workers in the country.  I believe that when circumstances change so too will the perception of the appropriate size of the foreign labour force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has made a positive and constructive contribution to the debate on Political Union right from the earliest discussions exactly a year ago.  During our Presidency we played a central role in the process which led to the decision at the Dublin meeting of the European Council in June to convene an Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union.  We helped to lay down the framework within which the work of the Intergovernmental Conference would be carried out and it was in Dublin that the four general headings under which specific issues would be addressed were adopted.  These are (i) the scope of Political Union, (ii) democratic legitimacy, (iii) efficiency and effectiveness of the Community and its Institutions and, (iv) unity and coherence of the Community's international action.</P>
      <P>Ireland participated fully and actively at official and ministerial level in the preparatory phase of the Intergovernmental Conference during the Italian Presidency in the latter half of last year.  This work culminated in the adoption of a full and detailed report drawn up by Foreign Ministers and adopted at the Rome European Council in December on the basis of which the broad guidelines for the work of the Intergovernmental Conference were laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the preparatory phase in the second half of last year, Ireland emphasised the issues which we believed to be essential for the IGC to consider. We explained to our partners the general principles of our approach.  The Taoiseach set these out in some detail in his contribution to the debate in this House on 1 November.  I was happy to note that these principles were endorsed by the <Col N="145" /> joint committees on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities under the Chairmanship of Deputy Peter Barry in a Special Report prepared for the Conference of European Parliaments in November 1990.</P>
    <P>It was also during the preparatory stage that we highlighted the issues to which we attached paramount importance and indicated that we would be making a written contribution on some of these at the appropriate time &mdash; namely when the negotiations proper had begun following the formal opening of the IGC on 15 December 1991.</P>
    <P>Since then we have tabled specific proposals in respect of economic and social cohesion in both of the intergovernmental conferences.  We also felt it would be important to the work of the Conference on Political Union that we make contributions in the area of new competences.  To this end we lodged texts on education and health.  As Deputies are aware I have arranged for these proposals to be lodged in the Library of the Oireachtas for the information of the House.  Finally, in the case of culture we co-operated with the Commission in the preparation of a text.</P>
    <P>Since we tabled our proposals a number of delegations have made contributions on the same areas and in several cases have drawn ideas and language from us.  In the area of economic and social cohesion, our proposals, coming as they did very shortly after the opening of the IGC served to place the issue firmly on the agenda of the Conference and underlined the importance of cohesion as a central element and objective of Political Union.  Since then Spain, Greece, Portugal and significantly the European Commission have come forward with proposals.  I am confident that as a result of our efforts, there will be a strengthening of the commitment to economic and social cohesion and a firm basis established for the continued improvement and development of existing and future mechanisms for the reduction of regional disparities and the consolidation of economic and social <Col N="146" /> cohesion as one of the mainstays of European integration.</P>
    <P>In the case of education and health, we believe that these are two areas of concern to all the citizens of the Community. It was therefore wholly appropriate that there should be a specific Treaty base for future Community action in these two areas and, again I am happy to report that our proposals have found considerable support from other member states.</P>
    <P>We have now reached a stage in the negotiations where most of the issues which delegations wished to raise have been noted and work will shortly commence on the analysis and elaboration of draft Treaty articles drawn up by the Presidency. Ireland will examine these carefully to ensure that they reflect our concerns and protect our interests.  We have the right to submit draft texts ourselves and, in the case of all the areas I have just mentioned we did in fact do so.  We may do so again in the light of the negotiations and where we see that such a contribution would be helpful and likely to gain general acceptance among our partners.</P>

      <P>One of the most important initiatives designed to give effect to this provision of the Anglo-Irish Agreement was the establishment in 1986 of the International Fund for Ireland.  The remit of the fund covers the social and economic development of all of Northern Ireland and the six Border counties in the South. To date, the fund has committed about <Col N="147" /> £120 million to approximately 1,700 projects in these areas.</P>
      <P>The review of the working of the Anglo-Irish Conference, published in May 1989, places particular emphasis on developing the economic and social aspects of the Agreement.  As provided for in the review, a number of Ministers from both sides, including those responsible for Tourism, Transport, Energy, the Environment and Health, have participated in recent Conference meetings.</P>
      <P>A further initiative specifically targeting the Border areas, and which has been discussed at a number of Conference meetings, is the Interreg programme of the European Communities.  In this regard, the Government and the Northern Ireland authorities have recently presented a joint submission to the European Commission containing a range of measures for implementation over a three year period.</P>

      <P>However, the Government regularly receive inquiries from foreign Governments as to whether any objection would be raised to the award of decorations to individual Irish citizens. These requests are processed through my Department at official level and no objection is raised provided the decoration does not confer a title of nobility or honour which would bring it within the scope of Article 40.2.2 of the Constitution and therefore require prior approval of the Government.  Since 1 January 1980, a total of 175 such requests have been received.  In that period, no objections have been raised in relation to any such requests.</P>

      <P>Ireland is anxious that the issue be settled as soon as possible, and is of the view that the delay in locating the Environment Agency is a setback to Community progress in the Environment area.

      <P>The general principles governing the use of the sea and its resources are part of long-established customary law and numerous international treaties dealing with particular aspects of the law of the sea.</P>
      <P>In the waters beyond the 12 mile territorial sea, high seas freedoms apply. That means that these waters are open to vessels of all states.  Ships in these waters are required to exercise the freedom of the high seas with due regard for the rights of other users of these waters.</P>
      <P>High seas freedoms are subject to certain exceptions within the 200 nautical mile zone.  These exceptions relate in particular to those resources over which the coastal state has exclusive jurisdiction&mdash; these include living resources such as fish and non-living resources such as oil.</P>
      <P>The general rule under international law regarding the maintenance of law and order on the seas is that it is the duty of the flag state, wherever the vessels may be, to exercise its jurisdiction and control at all times over ships flying their flag.</P>
      <P>The duty of the flag state derives from its responsibility for the good order of vessels of its registry.  The duty of the coastal state derives from its right to the resources within the 200 mile zone.</P>
      <P>Unless an activity relates to its resources within 200 nautical miles the coastal state has no greater authority than any other state with regard to foreign vessels and may only intervene if it believes a vessel is engaged in piracy, the slave trade, unauthorised broadcasting or that a vessel is without nationality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for the maintenance of law and order, therefore, falls in the ways I have outlined to both the flag state of the vessel and to the coastal state within <Col N="150" /> whose 200 mile zone the vessel is operating.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputies that Article 50 of the UN Charter is being implemented in respect of requests made by member states of the UN for assistance to mitigate the adverse effect on their economies of the application of the sanctions laid down in Security Council Resolution 661 of 6 August 1990.  The committee established by this same resolution to examine such requests has to date considered applications for assistance from 21 states and made recommendations to the President of the Security Council which have been forwarded to the Secretary-General of the UN for appropriate action.</P>
      <P>The Secretary-General has drawn the attention of member states and the agencies of the UN system to the special need for assistance to these countries and is being informed on a continuing basis of aid measures taken.  To date states requesting special assistance under Article 50 have received aid both on a bilateral basis from member states and from special assistance programmes of UN agencies.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the Sudan is included among the 21 states which have requested assistance under Article 50.</P>

      <Col N="152" /> The Deputies may be interested to know that Ireland's bilateral contribution to assisting states adversely affected by the Gulf Crisis amounts to over £3.8 million and our contribution via multilateral organisations amounts to around £3 million.</P>
    <P>Ireland has specifically earmarked for the Sudan £250,000 of its bilateral aid for countries affected by the Gulf Crisis.  It has also provided £170,000 in emergency relief to the Sudan since the outbreak of the crisis.  In addition, Ireland continues to operate its bilateral development aid programme in the Sudan which is one of the four &ldquo;priority&rdquo; countries in our aid programme.  The allocation for the Sudan under this programme is £600,000 for 1991.</P>

    <P>A weekend closure operates between 6 a.m. on Saturday and 6 a.m. on the following Monday of every week during the fishing season.</P>
    <P>In relation to the extension of the fishing season in this area I will be considering this matter later this year in the light of all relevant information and scientific advice.  I would stress however, that it is not the policy to give such extensions save in exceptional circumstances where it is beyond doubt that the level of stocks and the level of escapement necessary to sustain an adequate level of stock, would not be jeopardised.</P>

      <P>Following the establishment of a new independent Namibian state on 1 April 1990, Namibia extended their territorial waters to 200 miles and excluded all foreign vessels from fishing within that zone.</P>
      <P>A number of member states had conducted fisheries in Namibian waters for some years and consequently were deprived of fishing opportunities following the imposition of this ban.  The discussions currently under way regarding fishing rights around the coast of Namibia are aimed at the conclusion of a fisheries agreement with that country which will allow fishing activities by Community vessels to be resumed.  Negotiations are proving difficult and indications are that any resumed fishing activity by member states' vessels is likely to be quite restricted.</P>

      <P>In view of European Community policy with regard to fleet capacity and the constraints imposed by that policy, licences are only being approved in respect of applications which involve 100 per cent replacement of active tonnage and horsepower. Applicants have to demonstrate that they intend removing active tonnage and horsepower from the current fishing boat register which is at least equal to the tonnage and horsepower of their new boat.  Boats removed from the register in this manner would be required to be deregistered under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, e.g. scrapped or sold outside the State.</P>
      <P>The applicant in question has not indicated that he has any tonnage or horsepower to remove from the register and until such time as he indicates that he is in a position to comply with the current requirements his application for a sea fishing boat licence cannot be approved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome informed debate on key issues, including that of the structure and capability of the economic model.  Such models, however complex in design, are by definition a simplification of the real world; and for that reason must be continuously subject to a process of criticism and development.  In this context, debate among concerned economists is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The criticism referred to in the question arises from a paper presented to the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland in February last, by two economists from the Central Bank expressing their personal views.  In fact, their conclusion was rather more muted than the question implies.  They actually said that &ldquo;some people...might be tempted to suggest that the results presented (in their paper)...cast some doubt on the reliability of the HERMES model for forecasting and policy simulation&rdquo;.  Their arguments, I understand, in the view of most participants in the lively academic debate that evening, do not call into question the merits of the model for policy formulation purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated, no model can be a perfect representation of the real world. But the model in question has met strict refereeing criteria.  Key elements of it have been published in a most reputable <Col N="168" /> economic journal, the <i>European Economic Review.</i> It is part of an EC-wide system of national models and is regarded by the economists of the European Commission as satisfactory for analytical work on the Irish economy.  The EC, indeed, has commissioned its primary authors for related developmental work on the basis of that satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The HERMES model, as it stands, is a useful support to policy formulation. It will continue to be used within my Department in this context, but with due exercise of judgment and caution against mechanical interpretation of its output.  My Department, in conjunction with the ESRI, will also continue to develop and improve the model as economic theory and our understanding of the complex Irish economy evolves.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer applied for income tax exemption on 31 March, 1990.  He did not qualify for exemption but was entitled to marginal relief.  For the current income tax year 1991-92 the taxpayer again qualified for marginal relief and a certificate to this effect issued to him on 4 March 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Marginal relief operates to ensure that the tax payable in respect of the tax-payer's total income is no more than 52 per cent of the excess of his total income over the exemption limit.  In every case in which it applies, it is more favourable to the taxpayer than taxation under the normal system of applying the standard rate to his taxable income, i.e. income less personal allowances and reliefs: this is because, although the rate of tax is <Col N="170" /> higher, the amount of income to which it applies is considerably less.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as the taxpayer was not employed, all tax-free allowances were allocated to his wife. The taxpayer commenced employment in February 1991, but, in spite of requests from the Inspector of Taxes, he has not indicated how he wishes the allowances to be allocated from now on.  Accordingly, a tax-free allowance granting him the PAYE and PRSI allowances issued on 10 April.  If he wishes to have allowances transferred to him from his wife, <Col N="171" /> he should advise the inspector and an amended certificate will issue.  The taxpayer should also furnish his own and his wife's P60 so that their liability for 1990-91 can be reviewed.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer was granted allowances of £1,357 for 1990-91 as compared with £2,376 for 1989-90.</P>
      <P>This difference is accounted for by the following:</P>
      <P>1.  £90 was granted in 1989-90 in respect of expenses of the husband's employment.  According to the information available to the Inspector of Taxes this allowance was not due for 1990-91 as the husband was not in employment for that year.</P>
      <P>2.  The husband's social welfare pension was increased by £129 in 1990-91. The tax on this pension is collected by reducing the tax-free allowances.  An additional reduction of £129 was made in 1990-91 allowance to take account of the increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  The allowances granted to the taxpayer for the tax-year 1990-91 were incorrect as a PAYE allowance of £800 was omitted.  The inspector is prepared to <Col N="173" /> grant this allowance and review the tax-payer's liability on receipt of her P60 form.</P>

      <P>The milk quota appeals tribunal considered applications for additional milk quota from producers who met the following criteria: (i) producers whose milk production in the 1983 milk quota reference year was affected by animal disease problems, brucellosis, leukosis or bovine tuberculosis, in the period 1978 to 1983; (ii) producers who adopted development plans under the farm modernisation scheme in the period 1981 to 1984 and whose permanent quotas were between 12,800 and 20,000 gallons and (iii) other producers whose milk production in 1983 was adversely affected by exceptional circumstances causing severe hardship.</P>
      <P>In assessing the claims of producers who met those criteria, the tribunal gave priority, in general, to small-scale producers and to producers who had not benefited previously from quota allocations from a national reserve.</P>
      <P>Some 5,000 applications were assessed by the tribunal.  The number of applicants who were allocated additional quota is 1,480.  A breakdown of the quota gallonages of the successful applicants as requested by the Deputy is not readily available.  However, all of the successful producers had quotas under 30,000 gallons.</P>

      <P>The full amount of grant aid due to this applicant for work under the western drainage scheme on an area of 2.8 hectares at Gortmore South was paid in October 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second application in August 1982 to <Col N="184" /> drain a further 1.5 hectares at Gortmore South was not approved until August 1986 due to a general suspension of the scheme during that period.  Notification of completion of this work was received in September 1986 and a grant of £810 was paid in December 1986.  Grant aid on part of the work under this second application was disallowed on grounds that it was purely necessary maintenance on the previous grant-aided area.  On appeal by the applicant, it was agreed that some extra work had been involved and an additional £30 which, on aggregate, represented the maximum entitlement for a hectarage of 1.5 was paid in December 1990.</P>

      <P>The disposal of the public stocks currently in intervention storage in Ireland is the responsibility of the European Commission.  When it can appropriately be used it is provided for food aid.  Not all of the stock is suitable to meet immediate aid needs &mdash; much depends on the facilities in the potential recipient countries and refugee centres.  In a Community context, the matter of humanitarian food aid is primarily the responsibility of the General Affairs Council (Foreign Ministers).</P>

    <P>On this basis, the granting of a work permit is not considered unless the employer can show that, despite all reasonable efforts, there are no suitably qualified Irish or EC nationals available for the position in question, or that there are special circumstances; for example (i) that the prospective employee is a key employee and that a substantial amount of high quality employment for Irish/EC nationals will arise as a result of his or her employment; or (ii) that the prospective employee is coming as part of a recognised exchange programme; or (iii) that the prospective employee is married to an Irish/EC national or is a dependent child or child under 21 of an Irish/EC national; or (iv) that the prospective employee is officially recognised by the Minister for Justice as being a refugee.</P>

    <P>I should point out that the issue of a work permit in respect of a named non-EC national does not in itself authorise such a person to enter or reside within the State.  Admission to the State and authorised duration of stay is subject to the control of the immigration authorities. All non-EC nationals must be registered with the aliens registration section of the Department of Justice and must comply with that Department's immigration regulations.</P>

      <P>The contribution conditions for entitlement to social insurance pensions can give rise to situations where persons who entered insurance early in their careers and subsequently had gaps in their insurance records fail to qualify for any pension payment, despite having contributed for significant periods.  I have made major progress in recent years in <Col N="194" /> removing this anomaly.  The most recent change I made in this regard was provided for in the 1991 Social Welfare Act in relation to persons with a mixture of insurance at the full rate and at the modified rate as public servants.  Insured persons in this category will be eligible from next November for pension payments, the amount of which will be in proportion to the periods of insurance completed at the full rate.</P>
      <P>However, situations still remain where the pension entitlements of certain contributors are less than those of other categories who may have contributed overall for shorter periods.  The National Pensions Board is currently examining this issue and is expected to recommend changes aimed at providing a fully equitable basis for entitlement to pensions, as between all the various categories of contributors.  These recommendations will be contained in the final report of the board which will be completed shortly.  I will be giving priority to consideration of the board's recommendations on this matter.</P>

      <P>The total number of persons in receipt of the allowance is 3,161.  This figure includes those who transferred to carer's allowance having previously been in receipt of prescribed relative's allowance and those who retained their previous entitlement.  Of these 1,402 people have been awared a payment at the maximum rate and 1,759 at a reduced rate.</P>

    <P>Current claim trends indicate that almost 30 per cent of applicants who have not been awarded a carer's allowance are in receipt of another social welfare payment at a higher rate.  Under the <Col N="195" /> extension of the scheme coming into effect next July, persons in receipt of DPMA will be eligible for the carer's allowance.</P>

      <P>The person concerned ceased employment in 1983.  Since that date and up to and including 21 June 1990, she was in receipt of a social welfare payment at all times.  The types of payment she received were unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, maternity allowance and disability benefit.  She was disqualified from receipt of disability benefit from 21 June 1991 as she was found capable of work by a medical referee from that date.  She claimed unemployment assistance on 22 June 1990.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the information supplied by her, the local office was not in a position to authorise her claim and referred it to headquarters for determination by a deciding officer as to whether she satisfied the statutory condition of being available for and genuinely seeking work.  The deciding officer disallowed her claim on the basis that she was not genuinely seeking work.  He considered that she had not made reasonable efforts to get work.</P>
      <P>She appealed the disallowance and following an oral hearing of her case on 10 August 1990 an independent appeals officer confirmed the disallowance.  The appeals officer took into account letters she had submitted from employers with whom she had been in contact.  She was notified of the appeals officer's decision on 10 September and ceased signing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She made a further claim for unemployment assistance on 1 November 1990.  There was no evidence that she had made any efforts to obtain work since the appeals officer's decision and a deciding officer again disallowed her claim on the basis that she was not genuinely seeking work.  She appealed this disallowance and was afforded a further oral hearing on 26 February 1991.  The independent appeals <Col N="199" /> officer subsequently expressed the view that her &ldquo;efforts to obtain employment were not satisfactory or sufficient to satisfy the statutory condition&rdquo; and disallowed her appeal on the basis that she was not genuinely seeking work.</P>
    <P>She made her latest claim for unemployment assistance on 23 March 1991. Arising from details supplied by her with her application, inquiries are necessary in relation to her efforts to obtain employment, her availability for work having regard to her proposed child minding arrangements and her part-time employment as a home help with the North-Western Health Board.  When these inquiries have been completed her entitlement to unemployment assistance will be determined.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be glad to know that the Social Welfare Act, 1991, which has just been enacted, provides for the continuation of the full social welfare payment for six weeks after the  of a spouse in respect of all short term payments.  In addition, in all cases the payment of a child dependant allowance will continue for six weeks after the death of a child.</P>
      <P>I made these improvements in recognition of the burden which parents and widowed persons have to endure following the sad loss of a spouse or child. They are intended to ease the adjustment in the early stages of bereavement.</P>

      <P>The manner of claiming a death grant is set out in statutory regulations.  A person claiming the grant is required to complete a claim form and furnish evidence of death of the person in respect of whom the grant is claimed, that is, a death certificate or newspaper cutting with the death announcement or a receipt for funeral expenses.  Claim forms are available from local post offices, local offices of my Department and the Department's headquarters.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for the administration of the death grants scheme have operated satisfactorily since the scheme was first introduced over 20 years ago.

      <P>The national fuel scheme provides assistance to those who are dependent on long term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A weekly payment of £5 is made for a 26 week period from mid-October to mid-April. A smokeless fuel allowance is available under this scheme.  This allowance of an additional £3 per week on top of the weekly payment of £5 has been introduced to help low income households meet the extra costs of using smokeless or low smoke fuel in those areas of Dublin where bituminous coal has been banned.</P>

      <P>On three occasions she had failed to attend examinations by the Department's medical referee which were arranged to establish whether she satisfied the medical conditions for receipt of disability benefit.  When she failed to attend a further medical referee examination on 24 January 1991, payment of disability benefit was suspended from that date.</P>
      <P>A further medical referee examination was arranged for 8 March 1991.  She attended on this occasion and the medical referee who examined her was of the opinion that she was not capable of work. As a result, my Department were satisfied that she was entitled to disability benefit from 24 January 1991.</P>
      <P>All disability benefit due from 24 January 1991, less supplementary welfare allowance paid to her, issued on 9 April 1991.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the recent reduction in Garda strength at Ashbourne on the transfer of a garda on promotion has not seriously affected the level of Garda service being provided in the area.  The Garda authorities say that <Col N="210" /> they are not in a position at present to replace the member promoted, but that, nevertheless, the local members are continuing to provide a day, evening and night patrol service.  While Ashbourne station closes to the public at 6 p.m. there is no question of the Garda service for the area ceasing at that time.  There are two official Garda cars on allocation to Ashbourne station and in the event of neither of them being operational, the Ashbourne area is covered by mobile units based at Balbriggan.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that the policing needs of the Ashbourne area are being adequately met at present and they assure me that the situation there will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this is a subdivision application which was lodged in the Land Registry on 14 March 1990.  Due to the pressure of work in the registry generally there is, at present, a delay in dealing with applications of this nature.</P>
      <P>I am informed, however, that it is the policy of the Land Registry to try, as far as possible, to expedite cases in which it can be established that special circumstances of urgency exist.  I understand that this was done recently in the case in question and that registration was completed on 12 April 1991.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals to establish specialist Garda units of the kind referred to in the question.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that each Garda division already has the services of members of the force who possess the necessary investigative and other skills needed to tackle serious crime and that these members take a co-ordinated approach to crime which traverses Garda administrative boundaries.  The services of centralised specialist units such as the technical bureau are of course also available if and when required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 229 and 238 together.</P>
      <P>In September 1990, I announced that I proposed to make regulations requiring motor cyclists using public roads to use dimmed headlamps during daylight hours.  I understand that similar statutory provisions operate in four EC member states &mdash; Federal Republic of Germany, France, Denmark and the Netherlands &mdash; and in Norway, New Zealand, Sweden and certain states in the USA.</P>
      <P>A number of studies indicate that day time use of dimmed headlamps improves the conspicuousness of motor cycles for other road users and should help to reduce accidents.  Copies of the following relevant studies have been placed in the Oireachtas Library: SAE Technical Paper Series (USA) &mdash;&ldquo;Research into Motorcycle Conspicuity and its Implementation&rdquo; (1990); VTI Report (Sweden) &mdash;&ldquo;Daytime Running Lights A Potent Road Safety Measure?&rdquo; (1988) and TRRL Paper (UK) &mdash;&ldquo;Motor Cycle Conspicuity in Daylight&rdquo; (1985).</P>
      <P>Many Irish motor cyclists already display dimmed headlamps, during daylight, on a voluntary basis.  The motor cyclists themselves seem convinced that this is beneficial, while not, of course, diminishing, in any way, the obligation of other road users to keep a look out for motor-cyclists, as part of their legal duty to drive with due care and attention.</P>
      <P>The proposed regulations must be considered in the context of other measures to improve motor cycle safety which have already been taken or are under consideration, including the amended 1989 regulations on the licensing of motor cyclists; improved standards for compulsory motor cycle helmets and improved training of motorcyclists.</P>
      <P>I have some reservations on making day time use of headlights compulsory for all motor vehicles.  However, I do not propose to make any decision on this issue pending the outcome of relevant discussions planned at EC level.</P>

      <P>Power to apply the fixed payment notices system &mdash; i.e. the on the spot fine system &mdash; in respect of alleged traffic and parking offences is vested in the Garda Síochána under the Road Traffic Acts. A similar power in respect of alleged parking offences is vested in local authorities under the Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act 1975.  I consider that effective application of the system should be possible under these arrangements and I have no proposals to amend the law to involve other agencies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This estate has been designated for funding under the remedial works scheme and a major refurbishment project is under way.  Before designation, the Minister for the Environment met a deputation from the tenants.  As part of the remedial works project, the corporation sought approval last June to have the replacement of windows funded <Col N="220" /> under the scheme at a cost of some £590,000.  The proposal is being considered in the context of the allocation of £5.6 million notified to the corporation last month in respect of expenditure in 1991 on designated estates, including this one, and a decision will be conveyed to them shortly.</P>
    <P>The plan for social housing published in February put renewed emphasis on the need for local authorities to improve their existing management and maintenance procedures and to adopt a more devolved approach to the running of their estates, including increased tenant responsibility and participation.  The development of this approach in relation to Oliver Bond House is the responsibility of the corporation, as the housing authority, in conjunction with the tenants.  The corporation are being encouraged to take whatever steps are necessary to make progress in this matter and I would, therefore, suggest that the tenants discuss the matter with them.</P>

      <P>A total of £3.322 million has been allocated to South Tipperary County Council in 1991 for national (£1,490,000) and non-national (£1,832,000) roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>N74 Cashel/Tipperary Road: Road grant payments for works on this road since 1978 total £801,000 and the 1991 allocation is £60,000.  A further £50,000 has been allocated in respect of national secondary road black spot improvement works and it is a matter for the local authority to decide if part of this allocation will go towards works on the N.74. The council have been asked to prepare <Col N="221" /> and submit to my Department for consideration sight distance improvement schemes for the worst affected sections of this road.  The council's proposals are awaited.</P>
    <P>N24 Clonmel Relief Road: Phase I of this scheme was opened to traffic in 1986. Phase II has been included in the operational programme on peripherality for construction during the period 1992 &mdash; 1994 at an estimated cost of £4.6 million (1989 prices).  Total road grants provided to date amount to £1.491 million including an allocation of £100,000 in 1991 in respect of design work and site investigation on Phase II.</P>
    <P>Clonmel/Fethard Road R687: Responsibility for the planning and development of works on non-national routes such as the Clonmel/Fethard road is a matter for South Tipperary County Council.  The local authority may use the discretionary grants for roads paid annually by my Department to supplement expenditure from their own resources on such works. The discretionary grants to Tipperary (SR) County Council this year amount to £1,927,000.</P>
    <P>In the period 1988-89 my Department, as an exceptional measure, allocated a total of £147,000 in special road grants as a contribution towards costs incurred by the local authority on improvement works at this location.  Proposals for additional works on this road have been received in the Department and the local authority were informed on 12 April 1991 that there are no further funds at my disposal from which a special grant could be made.</P>

It is my intention that those groups and organisations involved with the business of <Col N="225" /> driving instruction will either be invited to meet with officials of my Department and/or make appropriate submissions on the matter before final decisions are made.</P>

      <P>Sewage from Cork City is currently discharged, without treatment, to the River Lee at Penrose Quay and Kennedy Quay.  I asked Cork Corporation in 1990 to develop proposals for sewage treatment facilities for the city.  Consultants are to be appointed to investigate the various options for secondary treatment, to examine the need for tertiary treatment and to determine the best means of treating and disposing of sewage sludge.</P>
      <P>I regard planning and design of the necessary works as a priority under the Environment Action Programme, and I expect that they will be provided well within the timescale allowed under the EC municipal waste water directive.  This new directive will come into force from 30 June 1993 and will require secondary treatment, as a minimum, in Cork city by 31 December 2000.</P>

      <P>Planning permission is required where there is a material change in the use of any land or structure, not constituting exempted development, and there are provisions in the Planning Acts for determining any questions that may arise in the application of this provision to particular cases.  In a limited number of cases, hours of operation are restricted by planning conditions.  I do not consider that it is necessary, for reasons of proper planning and development, to amend the law so that all extensions beyond midnight of shops' opening hours would be subject to planning permission.</P>

The provision of this overbridge was not included in the road scheme submitted by Kilkenny County Council and approved for road grant purposes.  The local authority subsequently submitted proposals for the bridge and in March 1991 the authority was advised of my decision to provide a grant of £100,000. The balance of the cost is to be met from the local authority's own resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of a number of recent research studies, particularly in Britain, on the question of whether a relationship exists between IQ levels and vitamin/mineral intake.  The results of these studies have given rise to considerable controversy and the findings have been inconclusive.</P>
      <P>In the area of nutrition generally, my advice, in line with current expert opinion, is that people, including young people, should eat a healthy variety diet from a wide range of foodstuffs.  This is the best way of ensuring an adequate intake of nutritional requirements including vitamins and minerals.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that we recently established a Nutrition Advisory Committee which will keep nutritional issues such as the relationship between vitamin and mineral supplement intake and IQ levels under constant review in the light of on-going international research.  This committee will also assist in the development of nutritional priorities and provide expert advice to counteract much of the misinformation and misunderstanding in the area of nutrition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> In relation to nutritional standards the Irish national nutrition survey carried out by the Irish Nutrition and Dietetics Institute (INDI) and published in 1990 included a representative sample of school children aged eight to 18 years.  In general the study indicated that this study group were reasonably well nourished and that intakes of most nutrients were in line with the recommended dietary allowances as published by the Food Advisory Committee.</P>
    <P>My Department recognise healthy eating as a key factor in promoting health in the population, including the health of young people.  Specifically, the health promotion unit have developed a nutrition health promotion action plan which sets out a series of measures which will be implemented to improve nutrition generally.</P>
    <P>The implementation strategies to be used as part of this plan will concern the education of the public, particularly disadvantaged groups, and of young people and the elderly.</P>
    <P>I should add that information on a range of nutrition issues is available from the health promotion unit.  Healthy eating guidelines are available to health professionals to assist them in providing information to the public.  In addition more general information leaflets on healthy eating and on losing weight are available, free of charge, to the public and to health professionals from the unit.</P>

      <P>I have personally investigated the circumstances of this case and the position is that the person referred to by the Deputy was last seen as an out-patient at Cappagh Hospital on 28 January 1991 and is scheduled for another appointment next month.</P>
      <P>I do not consider it appropriate for me to comment on the clinical details of an individual patient.  I understand from the hospital that scoliosis operations are undertaken at a time when the patient has the optimum chance of having the curvature of the spine reduced and that the consultant's decision on the timing of the operation has nothing whatsoever to do with a waiting list and a bed will be available at the opportune time.  This decision is a clinical one, taken by the consultant concerned and the Deputy will appreciate that it is not a matter in which I have any involvement.</P>

    <P>I understand that the policy is, in general, to have at least one member of each ambulance crew that is a fully trained ambulance officer or equivalent.

    <P>I understand that in the United Kingdom it is the policy of the ambulance authorities that by the year 2000 at least one member of each ambulance crew will be a trained paramedic.  This policy has been noted by my Department and it will be examined in detail as part of an ongoing review of the national ambulance service which will be undertaken by my Department in consultation with the health agencies concerned.</P>

      <P>Neither the Department of Health nor the Mid-Western Health Board were responsible for the recommendation to send this child abroad for neurosurgical treatment.</P>
      <P>That recommendation was made by the neurosurgeons dealing with the patient at Beaumont Hospital and that decision was unanimously adopted by the surgical division of the hospital.</P>
      <P>Beaumont Hospital is the national centre for neurosurgical treatment in the State.  It is the policy of Beaumont Hospital that, where a consultant neurosurgeon judges that he does not have the expertise to deal with a particular case, he will discuss the matter with his consultant neurosurgical colleagues in order to determine if the required expertise is available within the hospital.  It has always been the policy of the hospital that, if the required expertise is not available, the patients may be referred abroad for treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the circumstances of the child were brought to the attention of my Department by the Mid-Western Health <Col N="246" /> Board in July 1990, Beaumont Hospital was contacted on the matter.</P>
    <P>I was informed by the hospital that the unanimous recommendation of their surgical division, on the advice of the neurosurgeons dealing with the patient was that she should be sent abroad for treatment to one of three nominated centres.</P>
    <P>The child's parents were subsequently advised by my Department of this specialist medical opinion of the consultants in Beaumont Hospital.  The Mid-Western Health Board subsequently wrote to the parents to advise them that funding for the treatment of their daughter would only be provided in accordance with this recommended course of action.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board pointed out to the parents that the choice, to opt for private treatment, was a matter for themselves but that neither the board nor the Department would be in a position to fund the cost of such treatment from public funds should they choose that option.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I recently met the chairman, the deputy chairman, and chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board.  We spent a considerable amount of time discussing the entire range of the board's operations. Under these circumstances I do not see the necessity to receive a further delegation along the lines suggested by the Deputy at this time.</P>

      <P>A total of 647 hospital beds have been closed in the Southern Health Board area since February 1987.  Of these, 306 were in Cork city.  These figures include long term care and psychiatric beds as well as general hospital beds.</P>
      <P>As part of the rationalisation of hospital services in Cork city, services provided at the North Charitable Infirmary transferred to the Mercy Hospital in 1987.  In January 1985, the then Government announced their decision to close the Cork Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital. The two specialist services provided at this hospital, i.e., ENT and ophthalmology, transferred to superior accommodation at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital and Cork Regional Hospital respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards psychiatric beds, I might point out that there has been an overall reduction in the number of patients in psychiatric hospitals in recent years.  This <Col N="248" /> reduction has emerged from the implementation of the policy outlined in the report on the development of the psychiatric services, <i>Planning for the Future,</i> where the psychiatric services are changing from an institutional to a community-based service.</P>
    <P>The Kenny Review Group, which I have established, is at present examining all aspects of acute hospital services in Cork city and county.  I look forward to the group's recommendations on the organisation and distribution of services.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to out-patient appointments for patients wishing to see ear, nose and throat specialists at St. James's Hospital is that all ENT cases which are considered urgent are given priority and are seen by the consultant as soon as possible.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is a matter for the consultant concerned to determine the priority attached to each case, and to arrange treatment accordingly.  Should the patient consider that her condition has deteriorated and that an urgent appointment is warranted, she should contact her general practitioner with a view to expediting an appointment with the consultant.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the policy outlined in the report on the development of psychiatric services, <i>Planning for the Future,</i> the psychiatric services are changing from an institutional to a community-based service. This has resulted in a reduction in the number of patients in psychiatric hospitals in recent years.  I have had inquiries made of the South Eastern Health Board and I understand that arising from a reduction in the average number of patients in wards at St. Senan's Hospital, Enniscorthy, it is the board's intention to close a ward at the hospital which will facilitate the opening of a hostel in Enniscorthy together with a new mental health centre in Wexford later this year.  This is part of the overall policy of making the psychiatric services more accessible to local communities.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to enter into discussions <Col N="251" /> with the Medical Council or representatives of the general practitioners on the matter of entry to the General Medical Services scheme by Army medical personnel.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that I answered a question in some detail in the House on this matter last November &mdash; Official Report 29 November 1990, columns 716 to 718 &mdash; and the position has not altered in any way since.</P>
      <P>In general, the main mode of entry to the General Medical Services scheme is by open competition but doctors who had established themselves in whole time general practice prior to 1 January 1989 are granted right of entry on completion of five years continuous service in a particular centre of practice provided they satisfy certain conditions.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each health board to decide if an individual doctor satisfies the conditions for entry under the five year rule.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any difficulties posed specifically for Army medical personnel seeking entry to the General Medical Services scheme.  Doctors who have served in the Army Medical Corps may apply for vacancies in the GMS as advertised by health boards.</P>
      <P>However, the health boards are satisfied that they are not eligible to apply for direct entry to the GMS under the &ldquo;five year rule&rdquo; method as their Army service does not meet with the required &ldquo;five years continuous service in full-time general practice&rdquo; under the regulations.</P>

      <P>It will be of interest to the Deputy to know that in 1990 I approved an additional £517,000 for the provision of elective orthopaedic services in the South Eastern Health Board area.  A similar amount has been provided in 1991 and this additional funding has enabled the output of hip replacement operations in the region to be greatly increased.  In 1990, there was a 108 per cent increase over 1989.</P>

      <P>The Deputy recently tabled a question to me in the House concerning an increase in the basic pay of social workers consequent on a review of the matter under the conciliation and arbitration scheme. On that occasion I advised the Deputy &mdash; in a written reply on Wednesday, 6 March 1991 &mdash; that sanction to implement the arbitrator's finding in respect of social workers was issued by my Department on 1 March 1991 and that the arrangements for payment were a matter for individual employers.  Accordingly, the arrangements for payment of the increase to social workers in hospitals under the control of the Eastern Health Board are a matter for that board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had inquiries made of the Eastern Health Board and I understand that arrangements to remunerate their social worker staff on the revised scales will be made within the next eight days.  As the revision of salary, in this instance, dates back to 1 July 1989, there is the question <Col N="253" /> of calculating retrospection in each individual case.  It is understood from the board that this work is at present in hand and that it is hoped that arrangements for payment of the element of retrospection involved in the implementation of the arbitrator's award will be completed by the end of May.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 318 and 319 together.</P>
      <P>In a review of the post-primary accommodation needs of Drogheda carried out in my Department it emerged that (a) in the period 1980-89 County Louth recorded a drop of 41 per cent in the number of annual births for the county, down from 2,091 to 1,242.  In the same period, baptisms in Drogheda town and six adjacent parishes declined by 27 per cent; (b) the output from all primary schools in the Drogheda post-primary catchment area shows a clear decline in the numbers coming on steam in the next seven years &mdash; down from 932 in 1991 to 779 in 1997.  In these circumstances, it is considered that the provision of further additional permanent accommodation in Drogheda would not be warranted.</P>

      <P>The range and type of courses as well as the number of centres has also increased &mdash; for example, 1988 &mdash; 331 centres and 1991 &mdash; 450 centres approximately.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will also be aware, I recently announced the establishment of a national certifying body for such courses.  It is intended to establish this body as soon as the necessary consultations with relevant interests have taken place so that it can start examining the content of courses which are due to start in the schools next September.</P>
      <P>For vocational, preparation and training courses £50.6 million will be spent in 1991.</P>

      <Quest>if he will increase the subvention to CIE to ensure that it will be possible for Iarnród Éireann to do all the necessary maintenance track renewal work to continue the existing rail network to at least the present standards and, in particular, to ensure that trains do not have to reduce speed because of track deterioration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Quest>if, in the event of CIE or Iarnród Éireann deciding to close entirely or reduce the services or the train speeds on the Mullingar/Sligo line because of the deterioration of the track, he will provide the necessary money by way of extra subvention to prevent what would be a very serious blow to prospects in the North West for tourism, industry, farming and general facilities, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 336, 337 and 338 together.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to increase the level of Exchequer subvention to CIE, which in 1991 will amount to nearly £110 million. In addition, the public capital programme for 1991 provides for capital expenditure by CIE of £36.2 million, of which I am informed £5.7 million has been allocated for expenditure on railway signalling and track replacement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure on the maintenance of railway lines and the imposition of speed restrictions, where necessary, are matters falling entirely within the day to day administration of Irish Rail.  I should say, however, that no proposals have been <Col N="274" /> made to me by the board of CIE in respect of the closure of the Dublin-Sligo line or any other railway line.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Yates</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>if he will ensure that a proper major investment is made to resolve the difficulties being experienced by port users out of New Ross Port, due to the lack of maintenance on the rail bridge over the River Barrow; if the necessary investment will be made by Iarnród Éireann in this rail bridge to give a permanent solution to the difficulty; if so, when; and the estimated cost of the works in question.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The restrictions which apply at present at the port of New Ross arise directly from damage caused to the bridge over the River Barrow when it was struck by a cargo vessel on the 7 March 1991.  There is no question of these restrictions arising from any lack of maintenance on the part of Irish Rail.</P>
      <P>I understand from the chairman of CIE that repair work on the bridge in question is expected to commence at the end of this month and that this work will be completed by the end of June.  The company have no plans for any further works in connection with the bridge.</P>

      <P>The answer to the question is no.  It remains entirely a matter for any individual to decide what he or she may wish to do <Col N="275" /> with any existing television aerial they may have that may become redundant with the availability of MMDS.</P>
