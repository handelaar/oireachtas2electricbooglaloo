I ask the Minister of State who is answering questions for the Taoiseach <Col N="3" /> whether he knows that in 1988 Carrolls company set up a mailing company in the USA with the benefit of a £1 million IDA grant.  The company produced in America a very classy brochure purporting to market Irish salmon, furniture and Connemara ponies.

      <P>Tá Corr Iasc Teo, fochuideachta faoi lánúinéireacht Údarás na Gaeltachta atá ag gabháil don tionscal oisrí, ag feidhmiú ag dhá ionad ar leith, i.e., i gCuan na Gaillimhe agus i gCuan an Inbhir, na Muingí, Contae Mhaigh Eo.  Bhí fiontar nach beag ag gabháil leis an togra seo ó thús agus tuigim ón Údarás go raibh deacrachtaí nach rabhthas ag súil leo sa ghnó ó bunaíodh é i 1987 &mdash; idir laghdú i bpraghas oisrí agus síol oisrí agus fadhbanna suímh.  Ar ndóigh chuir siad sin isteach go mór ar an gcuideachta. Tá beirt ag obair sa ghnó anois &mdash; duine amháin i gContae Mhaigh Eo.</P>
      <P>Tuigtear ón Údarás gur tugadh cuidiú &mdash; idir scaireanna agus deontais &mdash; de thimpeall £600,000 don chuideachta go dtí seo.  Chomh maith leis sin cuireadh áiseanna ar chostas £282,000 ar léas don chuideachta ag na Muingí.</P>
      <P>Tá an tÚdarás sásta go bhfuil áiseanna luachmhara agus teicneolaíocht fhiúntach ag an gcuideachta agus tá na roghanna maidir le todhchaí an tionscail á scrúdú acu.  San idirlinn táthar ag súil leis an gnó a choimeád ar siúl ar scála laghdaithe.</P>

Beidh mé ag dul i gcomhairle arís leis an Údarás agus coimeádfaidh mé súil ghéar ar an togra seo. Tá fadhbanna ann faoi láthair faoi na margaí agus faoin suíomh.</P>

Ba é an bunsmaoineamh céanna a bhí taobh thiar de thionscal na mbradán, agus d'éirigh go maith leis sin.  Ní dóigh liom go mbeidh suim ag Údarás na Gaeltachta an comhlacht seo a dhíol anois ach ní fhéadfaí geallúint a thabhairt nach ndíolfar é choíche.</P>

      <P>The preliminary results of the 1991 sample labour force survey which was carried out in April-May this year showed that there were 1,331,000 persons in the labour force.  Of these, 898,000 were males and 433,000 were females.  The estimates are based on the respondents' own assessment of their usual situation with regard to employment.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to determine the exact subset of the 1991 labour force now registered as unemployed.  However, expressing the live register for 25 October 1991 as a percentage of the mid-April 1991 labour force yields the following results: males, 19.1 per cent.; females, 19.7 per cent.; total 19.3 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 26 and 38 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of their determination to <Col N="9" /> stimulate economic growth through consensus the Government negotiated the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> with the trade unions, employers and farmers in autumn 1987.</P>
    <P>Since then the number of persons at work increased by over 40,000.  This compares with a decline of 43,000 over the four years between 1983 and 1986.</P>
    <P>In addition to increasing the numbers at work the programme restored Ireland's economic base and competitive position to the point where GNP growth has averaged almost 4 per cent a year since 1987; we have one of the lowest inflation rates in Europe and rates of personal taxation have been reduced.</P>
    <P>From this greatly improved competitive base we are now far better positioned to take advantage of the anticipated upswing in world trade than we were ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The key objective of the current <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is to create 60,000 new jobs in manufacturing and international services and a further 15,000 in tourism over the next three years.</P>
    <P>While the latest &mdash; April 1991 &mdash; labour force survey indicates a decline in total employment, there are a number of positive features.  Employment in the services sector increased by 9,000 while employment in industry held up remarkably well.  The main contributory factor in the overall decrease in employment occurred in the agriculture sector due to increased mechanisation and the adoption of modern husbandry methods.</P>
    <P>Reliable employment statistics only become available in November of each year when the labour force survey results are published.</P>
    <P>I understand that the question of providing more frequent indicators of employment trends is under active consideration by the task force on employment. One possibility is a sub-annual labour force survey.  Other options are also being considered.</P>
    <P>The latest ESRI medium term review &mdash; June 1991 &mdash; based on the continuation of current policies, predicts an annual average growth rate of 3.7 per <Col N="10" /> cent in GNP up to 1996 with employment growing by 75,000 in non-agricultural sectors.</P>
    <P>For this reason, it is important that we do not allow ourselves to be panicked into rash action or short-term palliatives which could jeopardise the growth forecast by the ESRI.  We would do well to remember that much larger and more powerful economies than Ireland, such as France, have attempted to follow this path and have been forced to abandon it.</P>
    <P>The increase in unemployment is not unique to Ireland but is part of a global trend &mdash; other more developed countries, such as Finland and Australia, have experienced similar increases while unemployment in the United Kingdom increased by almost 800,000 between August 1990 and August 1991.</P>
    <P>The small decline in total employment recorded in the 1991 labour force survey is not an indication of failure of Government policy.  Rather it can be attributed to a combination of factors outside the Government's control such as the recessions in the US and UK which were further adversely affected by the Gulf criss.  In addition to the pressure caused by the natural increase in the labour force &mdash; estimated at 25,000 a year &mdash; we have seen a significant increase in the numbers of emigrants returning from abroad.</P>
    <P>The common thread which has been evident in recent independent commentaries dealing with the current economic situation is that, but for the effectiveness of present policies, conditions could have been much worse and, in many respects, are a lot better here than those in many of our larger trading partners.  In their spring commentary the ESRI stated:</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to discover measures which could ameliorate the unemployment problem in the short term without exacerbating it in the longer term... To increase the budget deficit further in an attempt to combat unemployment arising from the international economic trends would be foolhardy and could jeopardise the <Col N="11" /> economic strategy on which sustained employment growth depends. </P>
    <P>There is no quick-fix solution to the unemployment situation and it would be unhelpful to suggest otherwise.  Tackling unemployment remains the main objective of this Government.  The most effective role which the Government can play is the continued creation of the best conditions for attracting and encouraging investment to enable employment to grow.  Self-sustaining, viable jobs is the only real answer to the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>This approach is being supported by the special task force on employment and the industrial policy review group.  Both bodies will bring forward proposals before the end of the year for easing the unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>That is only part of the solution.  We also have to rely on a recovery in world trade since, as a small open economy, we are very exposed to changes of international trade which, in turn, impact on employment.  There are signs that world trade is beginning to improve and this should provide the stimulus needed in our efforts to expand employment.</P>
    <P>As regards my immediate area of responsibility I should mention that on any one day there are about 30,000 people participating in FÁS training and employment schemes and a further 3,000 in hotel and catering courses operated by CERT.  I would expect, in broad terms, to maintain the present level of activity and expenditure in the medium-term.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would refer to the improved industrial relations climate contribution which has a very positive influence on the maintenance and creation of jobs.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister acknowledge that it was projected in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that there would be 228,000 unemployed on average each year? Would he accept that there are now 260,000 unemployed, and if we add the 30,000 to whom he refers in training schemes there are 290,000 unemployed? <Col N="12" /> Would the Minister accept that this is an abject failure of Government policy? Would he accept that there was a net reduction in the numbers in employment last year in the order of 8,000 &mdash; 5,000 referred to in the labour force survey and 3,000 who were temporarily employed at the time of the survey in conducting the census?  Does the Minister expect that the labour force survey for the year ending April 1992 will show a net decrease or increase in employment?</P>

Would the Minister not agree that the so-called primary policy objective of the Government to tackle the problems of unemployment, as stated in the Fianna Fáil-PD document covering the years 1989-93 and as stated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, is an abject failure?  Could he indicate one initiative he proposes to take this month to tackle unemployment?  Would he not agree that the crisis is now so great that the time has come for the Government to accept the Fine Gael proposal, which is widely accepted outside this House, to establish a national forum on jobs so that the best brains in the country can get together to tackle the problem?  Clearly the Government are incapable of tackling it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The items on the agenda for the Social Affairs Council on 14 October and 6 November were the Draft Directives on Temporary and Mobile Work Sites, the Protection of Pregnant Workers and the Organisation of Working Time together with the Final Report of the Second European Poverty Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Draft Directive on Temporary and Mobile Work Sites aims to address the problems of inadequate planning and <Col N="15" /> lack of proper management and co-ordination which are estimated to cause up to two-thirds of accidents on construction works.  Ireland supported this proposal and the Council adopted a common position on the item.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the Council was able to reach a common position on the Draft Directive on the Protection of Pregnant Workers, which was discussed at the Council on both 14 October and 6 November.  The directive provides for periods of leave during pregnancy or breastfeeding where the work environment or organisation of work poses a risk to the worker or where she cannot be transferred to another job.</P>
    <P>The agreement at Council marks a significant breakthrough in protection of pregnancy and maternity throughout the European Community.  It also indicates a further stage in the implementation of the social action programme.  The new measures give Irish women substantially greater statutory protection.  Currently, Irish women must be working a minimum of eight hours per week and be 13 weeks in employment to qualify for leave under the Maternity Protection Act.  The measures agreed at the Council meeting will eliminate all qualification thresholds for pregnant women workers.  The new measures also extend the current protection for pregnant workers under the Unfair Dismissals Act, by prohibiting dismissal for any reason which is related to pregnancy.</P>
    <P>In addition, new legislation will be required to provide for the transfer of a pregnant worker to alternative duties if a medical assessment reveals a risk to health and safety.  If no such transfer is possible, the new measures require paid leave to be provided.  Currently, pregnant Irish women workers attending ante-natal examinations are entitled to time off without pay.  Under the new measures they will be entitled to time off without loss of pay.</P>
    <P>Agreement was reached at the Council meeting that payment during maternity leave must at least match the payment a worker would receive if she were sick. <Col N="16" /> The provisions of the maternity benefit scheme currently operating in Ireland are already well ahead of the minimum laid down in the new rules.  There is no question of a reduction of benefits to the new EC level in countries where national rates are higher.  Under the proposed Directive the 14 week statutory minimum length of maternity leave will remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>I will be undertaking a review of the amendments to the Maternity Protection and Unfair Dismissals Acts which are required to bring our statutes into line with the provisions which are likely to feature in the new Directive.  The common position adopted by the Council now goes on to the European Parliament for an opinion.  It is expected the new provisions will be presented to the Council for its endorsement next year. Member states will then have two years in which to implement the changes required in their national laws.</P>
    <P>The Draft Directive on the Organisation of Working Time and the Final Report on the Second European Poverty Programme were not reached on 14 October or 6 November due to time constraints. They are scheduled for discussion at the next Social Affairs Council on 3 December.</P>

      <P>It is ironic that the Minister in his very lengthy reply ignored the most important factor in the directive. I refer to the provisions on pay entitlements.  Would the Minister not agree that Ireland is responsible for the watering down of proposals regarding full pay entitlements?  The record in my possession clearly shows that.

Can the Minister give an assurance to the House that following Maastricht the Social Charter will be implemented and will have the full support of this country?  To date our record in this area has been deplorable.  It is reckoned that Ireland and Britain have been the greatest violators of the Social Charter to date and that they have done everything possible to reduce its effectiveness.</P>

      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for the introduction of a new standards based apprenticeship system.  FÁS, who have power to regulate apprenticeships under the Industrial Training Act, 1967, are arranging for the introduction of the new system on a pilot basis next year.  In this regard, FÁS have appointed an advisory committee reperesentative of the social partners, FÁS board members, educational and other interests to advise it on the implementation of the new system.  The advisory committee will consider how disadvantaged groups, such as those referred to in Deputy Mac Giolla's question, can be accommodated in the new system.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for the funding of the new system to be discussed by the Government with the social partners in the Central Review Committee of this programme.  These discussions are still in progress.</P>

      <P>The House is dealing with apprenticeships.  Does the Minister agree it is regrettable that women have to be included in this group?  Can he give the House any indication of the participation rate by women in apprenticeships?</P>

      <P>In regard to the Minister's reply to Question No. 19, will he agree that the new apprenticeship scheme which got some publicity recently is simply a scheme someone thought might be a good idea.  Absolutely no details of it have been worked out, the costing of it has not been worked out and the numbers who might take up this scheme have not been worked out.  It is not known whether these people will come from the long term or general unemployed.  It is not known what criteria will be applied and what business firms might involve themselves in the apprenticeship scheme.  Will the Minister clarify for the House whether there is any reality in this scheme being implemented in January 1992 which is some six weeks away?  Will he indicate what funding will be made available for this apprenticeship scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that the representation on the committee dealing with this scheme is very wide-ranging and includes the most expert and qualified people.  For example, it includes people <Col N="23" /> from the apprenticeship area, representatives of the social partners, educational representatives and FÁS staff. The committee, which is chaired by a very prominent member of ICTU, have been looking at all the elements the Deputy touched on, funding and the specific need to broaden the base of apprenticeships from some of the traditional areas.  The committee has also been examining the possibility of expanding the scope of apprenticeships and the qualifications which traditionally have been, as the Deputy will know, based on certain specified times.  The committee is not targeting the time spent on training for qualification but rather the quality and the input into the programmes.  It is a very wide-ranging review.  As I have told the Deputy they are due to meet again tomorrow.  In the circumstances the Deputy will appreciate that while, understandably, one likes to have specific answers at all stages to questions, that cannot be the priority when you are looking at something as important and wide ranging as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that having announced such a scheme the Government have no idea how to implement it?  Will he indicate what resources will be made available for this scheme next year and how many persons it is anticipated will be able to take up apprenticeships next year?  Finally, will the Minister indicate whether it is the Government's intention to impose an additional and new apprenticeship levy on business generally to fund this scheme?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one constant factor in this Government's approach, it is an approach by way of partnership and agreement.  The Deputy can take it that imposition is not the way we do things.  One of the reasons these discussions are taking place is because <Col N="24" /> one is working towards agreement between the employer and the union representatives as to how the scheme will be funded.  Funding of the scheme is a very essential part of the whole planning process. The planning of this scheme may give rise to very significant developments. The Deputy will not get any reply from me other than that at this point because it would anticipate the issues that will be addressed tomorrow and subsequently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to indicate at this stage to the House if the scheme will discriminate in favour of the disadvantaged in the community?  Would he not agree that everybody else is dependent on the number of apprentices the business sector are prepared to take on board and that there appears to be a marked reluctance at present to take on apprentices? What incentives does he intend to give to the business sector to encourage them to employ young people as apprentices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the disadvantaged in every sense, physically, mentally and even those who may have been traditionally discriminated against, if not deliberately, such as women in the workplace, will be a focus of the whole apprenticeship programme, at least in the terms of the review as to how they can be inducted effectively.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the apprenticeship sector has been confined to certain sectors as the Deputy will be aware.  One of the matters that can be reviewed now is whether the range of involvement in apprenticeships can be extended beyond that sector and whether it can be demonstrated to be to the advantage both of the employees and the <Col N="25" /> employers.  There is great scope for review there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he does not agree that one year into the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that guaranteed under paragraph 11 to provide for these groups in apprenticeship &mdash; disabled, disadvantaged mature entrants, women &mdash; that there is not one practical proposal in evidence?  If he is prepared to take my word for it that there is marginally less than 1 per cent female participation in apprenticeship schemes?  Does he agree that is a shockng indictment of our inability to facilitate participation by women in apprenticeship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly not question the bona fides of the Deputy.  If he tells me it is a fact I have to accept it as such, subject to checking.  If that is the case it certainly reflects a conventional, traditional, and perhaps a regrettable, attitude in relation to the nature of work undertaken by women.  In the course of the examination of all these issues under the apprenticeship review committee that matter, as I have indicated already, will also be looked into.</P>
      <P>Regarding the lack of progress I would remind the Deputy that if we are dealing with something as radical as this &mdash; it is radical including some of the issues which he touched on &mdash; and the possibility of a change to a system based on standards achieved rather than time spent, how the proposed arrangements would be financed and how best any Exchequer costs involved might be minimised we want to identify the financial and other implications of proposals in a whole range of areas which would target training effectively in these schemes.  I do not think it is reasonable to say that nothing has been done when we are coming to a crucial point.  I have indicated that a very important meeting is taking place tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would give us some insight into the reply? Would he agree that it costs an average of £10,000 per annum to train someone in a FÁS training centre in, for example, computer technology and that similar training provided within the post-primary education system would work out at about £2,500 per annum per pupil?  Is there any intention to integrate some of the training schemes with the post-primary education system and make use of schoolrooms which are vacant from 4 p.m. to provide more training for more people at a lesser cost than that currently provided by FÁS?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate from the reply I gave to the previous question that obviously the targeting of the recipient, who is the only one to be concerned here, is the main priority.  We want to ensure that the highest level of qualification will be acquired at the lowest cost.  The figure for FÁS sponsored apprenticeship is not quite £10,000, though it is a significant amount &mdash; £8,794 for an average duration of 48 weeks.  Yes, I do think there is something in the Deputy's suggestion but that is a matter that will also come within the remit of the committee to which I have referred.  I am really concerned about getting the best results from apprenticeship programmes.  This committee <Col N="28" /> will look at all aspects of these courses.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that many of those who undertake FÁS courses would have been better served if the type of course they are now undertaking had been available to them within the post-primary school curriculum?  Is the Minister taking any steps, or does he intend to take any steps, in conjunction with the new Minister for Education, to look at the provision of a more integrated education system than we have at present?  Would the Minister agree that the piecemeal approach taken on one side by the Department of Labour and on the other side by the Department of Education results in fewer people getting the type of vocational training they should get at an earlier stage?</P>

      <P>First, I cannot agree with the Deputy's suggestion that the cost element in his scheme are not effective. Second, I want to assure him that there has been, and will be, very close co-ordination between the Department of Education and the Department of Labour and this will certainly be maintained by me and by the new Minister for Education.  There is no evidence that point made by the Deputy that people would have been better engaged in education training than under the FÁS courses is true.

      <P>A proposal for a directive on the implementation of minimum safety and health requirements at temporary or mobile construction sites was considered at the Social Affairs Council of Ministers meeting held on 14 October 1991.  Considerable progress was achieved and a common position was reached on the proposal.  It is anticipated that the Directive will be adopted at the Social Affairs Council meeting in December 1991.  The expected date by which the proposed directive will be required to be implemented into national legislation is 31 December 1993.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that apparent indication of progress from the Minister. Is the Minister aware that the EC has calculated that although the workforce on building sites in Ireland constitutes only 7 per cent of the total, it accounts for 20 per cent of the accidents, and that the accident rate on Irish building sites is the worst in Europe?  We have a very high incidence of serious accidents and the EC has concluded that urgent measures are necessary to improve the extent of contact between multiple onsite smaller contractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that our record is the worst in Europe.  The level of serious accidents on building sites is a matter of concern.  In Ireland last year seven fatalities and 247 accidents on construction sites involving absence from work of more than three days were reported to the health and safety officer in 1990.  That is far too many.  The Deputy will know that the inspectorate enforce the legislation which governs safety and health requirements on construction sites and that they have devoted a considerable level of their inspection activities towards monitoring and enforcing the legislation which applies to the construction sector.  Far from being in any <Col N="30" /> way laggard in meeting the standard being proposed by the European Community, we very much want to see this being introduced.  The Deputy's suggestions that we have the worst record in Europe does not accord with the facts. We have to recognise that building sites by their nature are hazardous places.  We are anxious to ensure that a whole range of practical measures are introduced and the Deputy can rest assured that we will be in the van in relation to the proposed directive.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the member states can apply for a derogation unless the work is deemed to be particularly dangerous and that there are further conditions whereby there will have to be more than 20 workers on the site and the job will have to last 30 days with a minimum of 500 man hours work on the site?  If these proposals are not compulsory, it is possible to create a potentially dangerous situation. The compromise agreement reached on 14 October still exposes the workforce on these sites to quite a lot of danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland supports this proposal enthusiastically.  We have recognised the hazards associated with the construction industry.  We have devoted a considerable amount of attention towards increasing the awareness of the workers as to the hazards and we have devoted many efforts towards reducing the level of accidents in the sector.  I do not say there are not hazards attached to the construction industry &mdash; I know that from my involvement in law &mdash; and if the proposed directive has implications for our construction sector we will make sure they are taken fully into account and we will ensure that they will not in any way act as a barrier against implementation.  The obligations which will arise from this directive will not be dissimilar to those imposed on employers under the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989. The Deputy should not always present Ireland as being forced to comply with <Col N="31" /> EC Directives.  It is not right to give that impression.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Labour</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the average industrial wage for (a) men and (b) women at the latest date for which figures are available; if he has any plans to reduce the differential; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The average weekly industrial wage for men and women in March 1991 the latest date for which statistic are available, indicated that men earned an average weekly industrial wage of £266.79 and women earned £157.85. Female weekly earnings represent 59 per cent of male earnings.  However when the hourly earnings of male and female workers are considered the differential is significantly lower.  Women earn 68 per cent of the male hourly rate in all industries.</P>
      <P>The differences in industrial earnings derive from a wide range of factors: on average, women work five and a half hours per week less than their male counterparts; other factors such as wage rates, overtime payments, shift and unsocial hours premia, payment by results, bonuses and payment for length of service.</P>
      <P>Recognising the persistence of sizeable male-female earnings differentials my Department, in conjunction with the Employment Equality Agency, have commissioned research in an effort to determine the reasons for the differentials. The aim is to identify those factors which account for the wage gap, such as differences in education and experience and to isolate any residual factors which may be attributable to discrimination. I hope this research project which is being undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute will provide valuable indicators and help to guide future policy in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to bring forward proposals to amend the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 and the Employment Equality Act, 1977 in order to increase their effectiveness. However, legislation alone is not enough to redress current imbalances <Col N="35" /> either in wages or in opportunities for career advancement.  The most positive strategy lies in creating more and better opportunities for women and in removing barriers encountered by women in the labour market.  This is why I will be directing attention to the promotion of positive action which I believe is the way forward.  The Employment Equality Agency and state training agencies have a vital role to play in this process especially in providing a lead to employers in both the public and the private sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that people outside this House would be shocked to learn that there is still a gap of almost £109 per week in the average industrial earnings as between men and women?  We are talking about earnings, not wages, because the Minister has referred to the hourly rate as being somewhat better than that.  Does the Minister know, for example, that that ratio is almost identical to what it was ten years ago and that all our efforts in the interim have produced very little? Finally, does the Minister agree that he is wasting his time doing studies on education and skills rates?  I suggest that there is no difference in terms of education and skills, or marginally, maybe to the benefit of women, but that the issue is essentially one of equality and that his promised revision of the anti-discrimination legislation in relation to pay should be a priority if we are to make any impact on why women, ten years later, continue to be on merely 59 per cent of average male earnings.  It is a disgrace and I am sure the Minister would agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly have to express my concern, to say the least my impatience, with the fact that there are such differentials.  I want to assure the Deputy that one of my priorities is to work to reduce that differential, if not to help it to disappear altogether.  It is true that there has not been much progress in this area.  In 1985 women's average <Col N="36" /> earnings represented 58.5 per cent of men's and now represents 60 per cent; that is not major progress.  At the same time it would be wrong to point to discrimination, active or otherwise, as being one of the major factors.  The whole social conditioning, the background, the type of low skilled work that so many young women have been engaged in, and some of them exploited, brings down the average very considerably.  That is something we must address directly.</P>
      <P>The second thing is that the nature of training and expectation is different.  The expectation, traditionally, has been that women would do different types of jobs. I hope this does not sound patronising but it is clear that women are at least as well qualified as men, if not better qualified.  I have no doubt that it is as much a matter of social attitudes as anything else.  I want to assure the Deputy that addressing this problem will be one of my priorities during my period as Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the way to tackle this problem is not in the piecemeal way it has been tackled to date but by introducing a statutory minimum wage which would rid us of the scourge of these differentials and exploitation of women which has prevailed in Irish society down through the years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true in a sense. I mentioned earlier the exploitation of low paid workers in a range of areas, young women particularly.  My Department have been looking at this problem actively.  It is not always possible to find a male comparator in an equal pay claim because up to now some of the work being undertaken by men at certain levels of industrial activity and otherwise is of a different nature, with a higher skill component than that undertaken by women.  If habits and practices up to now show a differential that is unacceptable, let us not run away with the idea that that is a basis of deliberate discrimination.  We have to change the approach to see that women will be employed in a wider range <Col N="37" /> of jobs and in better jobs, including the highest technical and managerial positions which they have demonstrated they are capable of doing.  We have to change the whole focus of expectation and the time is right for that.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is a need for a campaign to move away from sexual stereotyping in particular areas of job opportunities? Would the Minister equally agree that there is a need to encourage a form of positive discrimination in favour of women in the context of promotions, that an example could be set in that regard in the higher echelons of the Civil Service and that such example would encourage the private sector?</P>
      <P>Finally, would the Minister agree that the position of women is equally stereotyped within politics?  There is only one woman within the Government, from the major party, Fianna Fáil, and there is not a single woman on the junior benches, other than from the Progressive Democrats. Neither the Labour Party nor The Workers' Party have a single woman representing a constituency in this House. Would the Minister agree that positive discrimination should be operated in the area of politics as well as in the workplace?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>From the many views I have heard from women in this area I understand that the last thing they want to rely on is what is called the token woman.  That is not the way the women of this nation want to be vindicated.  When I first started to practise at the Bar there were four ladies practising at the Bar; the perception was that women could not succeed as barristers.  It has now emerged that, in less than 30 years, almost 50 per cent of barristers are women.  They include some of the most distinguished practitioners, including, I am glad to say, our distinguished President.  I see no reason the same cannot happen elsewhere.</P>

Specifically, does he agree that the requirement in the existing legislation, that a woman make a comparison with a male comparator, misses the entire point and that while this provision and requirement remains women, predominantly, in low paid employment can expect no help from the legislative infrastructure?</P>

A joint industrial council could make progress in raising the incomes of women to those of men in that industry. While I accept that he is a new man in the Department and that he should be <Col N="39" /> given an opportunity to look at these areas, the joint industrial councils are attempting to achieve equality.

      <P>I propose to take the questions together. At the outset I would wish to place on record again my concern at the disruption of court business which the industrial action by clerical staff in the courts is causing, and I want to reiterate that every effort has been and will continue to be made by officials of my Department to prevent such disruption.  The approach adopted by the management side since negotiations on matters commenced has been <Col N="42" /> conciliatory and flexible and has been designed to negotiate away the differences between the two sides, so as to avoid industrial confrontation.  Despite their best efforts, industrial action has taken place and has resulted in the disruption I have already mentioned, a matter which will, I am sure, be regretted by Members of all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the House that strenuous efforts to resolve the dispute are still under way, even as I speak, and I am not without hope that the dispute will be resolved before much time has elapsed.</P>
      <P>There have been suggestions that I should intervene personally in the dispute. Such suggestions ignore the fact that I am personally involved through briefings of my officials who are engaged in the negotiations.  They report to me on a daily basis and keep me fully informed at all times of the position and of any developments as they arise.</P>
      <P>I am actively involved in seeking ways to resolve this dispute at the earliest possible date so that the functioning of our courts can return to normal.</P>
      <P>A particularly distasteful effect of the industrial action is the disruption in the payments of income from investments to wards of court.  I have instructed officials of my Department to contact the Civil and Public Services Union to see whether they will facilitate the resumption of normal payments to wards of courts as a humanitarian measure.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>In thanking the Minister for his reply I wish to say that I find it quite unsatisfactory.  He has not yet intervened in the dispute and at present the two sides involved have got themselves into a position where it will be quite difficult for either side to move. Since the Minister is unwilling to get involved is he willing to bring in a third party to mediate at this stage with a view to solving the problem as quickly as possible? Further, is he willing to ask the Department of Social Welfare to assist wards of court who are in a difficult position as a result of this dispute?  Will he do so immediately so that they can get <Col N="43" /> their money and continue to live a normal existence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the first part of the Deputy's question, I can assure the Deputy that I am personally actively involved in the efforts to find a solution to this problem.  I suggest to the Deputy and all the other Deputies in the House that the floor of the House is not the best place to discuss industrial disputes and the solutions to them.</P>
      <P>Deputies will understand that I am somewhat constrained in what I can say to the House.  However, I assure the Members that everything that can be done is being done and I trust it will not be necessary to take the measures the Deputy suggested in relation to social welfare.  Assuming we get the goodwill of the union &mdash; and I have no doubt we will &mdash; the situation in relation to wards of court should be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in disagreement with the Minister in relation to where this dispute should be aired.  The Minister must be aware that the court officers have been on strike since 14 October and that from this weekend there will be an escalation of the dispute involving 10,000 members of the Civil and Public Services Union.  I appreciate the Minister stating he is concerned about this dispute but will he outline to the House what steps he intends taking to resolve it?  Why did he or the Minister for Labour not involve the Labour Relations Commission and the machinery of the Department of Labour?  It is over a month since this dispute started, people have been picketing the courts and disrupting litigation and other work in a major way.  Will he now outline to the House exactly what steps are being taken to resolve this dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already said, I do not deny the Deputy his right and duty to raise the matter.  However, the floor of this House is not the best place to discuss publicly the detailed negotiations and solutions to the dispute.  I assure the <Col N="44" /> Deputy that steps are being taken even at this moment in relation to its solution and I am very hopeful and optimistic that we will get a solution.  The officials of my Department are available to meet the unions at all times and I trust &mdash; without going into further details at this stage &mdash; we will see an early solution.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that approximately three weeks ago when I raised this matter on the Adjournment his then Minister of State gave the exact same reply as the Minister did today?  Is he aware that what is in dispute are 17 upgradings at an annual cost of approximately £7,000?  Is he aware that, last Friday in his absence, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism Transport and Communications moved a Supplementary Estimate of £224,000 to pay additional costs to barristers involved in criminal cases on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions?  In view of the fact that we are talking about a small figure of £7,000 as against £224,000 for barristers' fees &mdash; and that these are low paid workers with no knock-on effect in terms of gradings in other areas of the public service &mdash; will the Minister please drag himself from his desk and intervene in this dispute to bring it to a resolution once and for all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that one of the implications of the Courts Act was to raise the jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts, so that the additional quality pre-court processing work is significant?  Can he reconcile with his statement about goodwill the effective locking out of 263 low paid workers in the courts' service at a time, as Deputy Barrett said, when we are putting a Supplementary Estimate through this House for £244,000 for barristers' fees?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to reply to such emotive terms as &ldquo;locking out&rdquo; and so on.  There were negotiations between my own staff and the union involved in the dispute last year; the claim by the union was examined in great detail and 42 positions were offered in relation to the 270 members approximately.  That was increased, through negotiations, to a figure of 62 positions and discussions are taking place.  I do not want to say anything in the House which could exacerbate a difficult situation.</P>

      <P>In the course of his responses the Minister expressed his concern in relation to the dispute which has been running since 14 October and he said that every effort has been made to resolve it.  Will he state exactly and specifically what is being done by him or his officials?  Why has he not involved the Labour Relations Commission, a body charged with trying to sort out disputes like this, in the matter?  Will the <Col N="46" /> Minister outline to the House if he expects this dispute to be resolved within a matter of days and what steps are being taken to do that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incredible that the Minister has not personally intervened in this dispute after three months.  It is about 14 weeks since the dispute began.  I heard the Minister say on a number of occasions today that he has not been personally involved but that he had received memos from Department officials.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. D. Ahern) Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. D. Ahern)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the three questions together.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with these questions, I know that the House will wish to join with me in expressing deepest sympathy to the family and friends of the late Corporal Michael McCarthy on their tragic loss and in acknowledging the supreme sacrifice made by him in the cause of peace in Lebanon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Corporal McCarthy died on 15 November 1991 when a five-man patrol under his command came under fire from members of the De Facto Forces at At Tiri in South Lebanon.  The patrol had <Col N="48" /> been sent out from the UN position at At Tiri to monitor the activities of members of the De Facto Forces who were observed moving westwards along a track north of the village.  As the UN patrol moved west down the main street it came under fire at the western end of the village.  Corporal McCarthy was killed and Private Richard McGrath was injured.  I am happy to report that Private McGrath's condition is satisfactory.  The other three members of the patrol were, thankfully unhurt.  The route taken by the patrol was a normal patrol route.  The De Facto Forces fired without warning in an undisciplined and indiscriminate manner.  No rounds were fired by the Irish patrol.</P>
    <P>A detailed investigation of the incident which resulted in the death of Corporal McCarthy and the wounding of Private McGrath is being conducted by the UNIFIL authorities.  Protests regarding the incident have been made at local and diplomatic level.  I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs met the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland this morning to express the Government's deep sense of shock and anger at the shooting dead of Corporal McCarthy and the wounding of Private McGrath, and that he has issued a statement in the matter.</P>
    <P>The safety of Irish personnel serving with UNIFIL is kept under constant review.  Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping mission and to provide for their protection.  They are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment, and operational procedures are geared to provide maximum safety for our troops consistent with the carrying out of their mission.  In addition, physical security in the form of equipment and engineer works at posts and checkpoints is steadily being improved. Everything possible will continue to be done to enhance the level of protection and safety of our personnel on overseas duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I wish to extend deepest sympathy <Col N="49" /> to the widow and family and indeed colleagues of the late Corporal Michael McCarthy.  The incident is a further indication of the danger that our soldiers face daily on their peacekeeping missions with UNIFIL.  Is the Minister in a position to outline how many firings have been directed at or close to the Irish positions since January last, and can the sources of these be identified?  Given that on 29 August last a strong protest was issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Israeli Ambassador, would the Minister agree that these protests were not strong enough or went unheeded?  In the interests of the Irish soldiers overseas, would the Minister not accept that further action is required by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the figures available as to the number of shootings that have taken place, but there has been an increase in activity in this area in recent times.  In total, 32 personnel serving with UNIFIL have died as a result of activities in Lebanon in the last number of years.  In relation to the query regarding the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that Minister has made the strongest possible protest to the Israeli Ambassador.  It is the Government's position that the UN Security Council resolution must be implemented by Israel to withdraw from Lebanon.  It is also the position of the Government that the Israeli forces are responsible for the activities of the De Facto Forces because of the support they give to those forces, and the protest has been made in the strongest possible terms.  A protest has been made at UN level and also, as I have said, at local and diplomatic level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too join with the Minister of State in expressing the sympathy of my party to the family of Corporal McCarthy and in wishing Private McGrath a speedy recovery.  I commend wholeheartedly, on behalf of everybody, the bravery shown by Private Ryan during the course of this incident.  Would the Minister of State confirm to the House that the so-called De Facto <Col N="50" /> Forces, otherwise known as the South Lebanese Army, are officered, trained, equipped, paid and armed by the Israeli Defence Forces and the Israeli Government? Would he accept that, in view of the figures given in this House on 31 October to Deputy De Rossa, since the beginning of this year there have been 182 firings by these forces on UNIFIL troops, that the expression of regret from the Israeli authorities ring very hollow indeed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has referred to the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs issued today, would he accept that any questions of retribution or justice being sought from the perpetrators must involve serious questions for the Israeli Government and the Israeli Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to acknowledge the bravery of Private Ryan in relation to this incident, as was adverted to by Deputy McCartan.  Again I come back to what I said earlier, which more or less mirrors what the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said in his statement, that as long as the Israeli authorities give logistical and moral support to the De Facto Forces, they are responsible for those forces.  I acknowledge that, in relation to the number of incidents the Deputy mentioned, it would be of that order.  As regards retribution, what we can do is make the strongest possible protest to the Israelis and the UN to bring the perpetrators of this dastardly deed to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that include the Minister for Defence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I express our condolences to Mrs. McCarthy and her children on the death of her husband in the service of the Irish Army and in the cause of world peace.  I also send best wishes for a speedy recovery to the wounded soldier, Private <Col N="51" /> McGrath, and acknowledge the huge contribution made by our soldiers over many years towards peace and stability in Lebanon.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise two issues.  My original question was tabled to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I would ask the Minister of State, if he has not the direct answers, to discuss the matter with the Minister.  My first question arises out of the support given by Israel to the South Lebanese Army who occupy the area north of the Israeli border.  Will every effort be made, if necessary by way of direct contact with the Prime Minister of Israel, to point out our absolute outrage at the activities of the South Lebanese Army and demand that the financing of that army by Israel be stopped, if only because of the death and destruction it has brought to Irish troops?</P>
      <P>The second point I wish to make is that over the last number of months there has been a huge increase in incidents, mainly related to the Middle East conference, and there is a danger that such incidents may continue.  I would like to raise with the Minister the fact that in May 1980 a conference was held of representatives of the 11 Governments who provided troops to UNIFIL in Lebanon, and arising out of that conference a number of diplomatic and political initiatives were taken which helped to calm the then difficult situation in South Lebanon.  I suggest to the Minister of State, that they discuss the matter with his colleagues, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and present to the Government a proposal that at least consideration be given to again holding such a conference so that not only the depth of our concern would be expressed but that we would get a united effort from all the forces contributing in Lebanon, thereby ensuring that our expressions of concern would have a greater impact at international level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's request that we make direct contact with the Israeli President, I think it is sufficient at present that the Minister <Col N="52" /> for Foreign Affairs has called in the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland to make the strongest possible protest.  In relation to the Deputy's suggestion of a proposed conference, I again reiterate what I said earlier, that the strongest possible protest was made both through diplomatic and local channels, and indeed at UN level. That is as much as can be done at this point.</P>

I accept that it may not be possible for the Minister to be present, but as the Minister of State is present, I believe it is important that we should have something more substantial than a statement for the media.  It is extremely important that the House be informed of what transpired at today's meeting.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given to me under Standing Order 20 (3) (a) and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy John Ellis &mdash; The up-to-date position in connection with the defective chimneys in the Cranmore housing estate in Sligo; (2) Deputy Gay Mitchell &mdash; The need for an urgent report on the implications of the labour relations committee ruling on the return of married women to the Civil Service and whether the Minister for Finance will give details of his position in the matter; (3) Deputy Pat Lee &mdash; The current crisis in private nursing home accommodation in Dublin for elderly patients due to inadequate and improper funding by the Minister for Health; (4) Deputy Michael Moynihan &mdash; The position regarding 40 craft workers who have been put on a three day week and the matter of re-employing them through the Employment Board for the Blind; (5) Deputy Seán Ryan &mdash; The proposed sale of lands and closure of the Teagasc Research and Development Centre at Kinsealy, County Dublin, and the implications this would have for both the horticultural industry in North County Dublin and the future employment of the staff of the centre; (6) Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan &mdash; The imminent closure of Rathduff cheese factory in County Cork with the loss of 65 jobs; (7) Deputy Michael Creed &mdash; In view of recent correspondence from the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, mandating An Post and the Communications Workers Union to draw up an alternative viability plan that would not include widespread closure of sub post office, if he will ensure that breaches of the terms of this mandate do not occur; (8) Deputy John V. Farrelly &mdash; The incident which occurred on Mentrim Lake on the 14 November where four German tourists were threatened by local anglers <Col N="153" /> and the steps the Minister for the Marine intends taking to prevent a recurrence of this incident; (9) Deputy Roger Garland &mdash; The failure by the Government to adhere to the time table set by the EC for the Dublin Transportation Study which, unless dealt with within the EC time scale, will result in the loss of EC funds for light rail transit; (10) Deputy Pat McCartan &mdash; The case of a Liberian national in prison custody here since the 25 June, 1991 and the need for the Minister for Justice to release him from detention; (11) Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan &mdash; The closure of the post office at Kilmurray, County Cork.</P>
      <P>I have selected for discussion the matters raised by the following Deputies: (1) Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan; (2) Deputy Pat McCartan; (3) Deputy Michael Creed.</P>

Section 110 of the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983, clearly spells out that the Minister has a function in this area.  Quite frankly the ruling of the Chair is most unfair.</P>

      <P>Agreed.  On the Order of Business proper I should like to ask the Tánaiste when the Government intend presenting the proposals, promised over the weekend, to close the loopholes disclosed in the recent Supreme Court judgment in regard to extradition.  In that regard the Government ought to seek to close those loopholes quickly.  My party are willing to offer the legislation we have drafted and our full co-operation to the Government in closing those loopholes in regard to extradition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case, that it was obvious that such loopholes existed for quite some time and that this has been confirmed by the Supreme Court judgment?  Will the Tánaiste give some indication of the timescale involved?  We do not want this part of Ireland to become a haven in which people can avoid extradition simply by claiming that they possessed semi-automatic weapons rather than actually using them?</P>

Can the Tánaiste say when we may expect this legislation to be introduced in the House?

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my best wishes to the new Minister for the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> I am quite sure that having been a patient man in the Department of Health he will see this role as challenging.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Bill has attracted a great deal of attention around the country and internationally. The problem is that the Government propose putting in place legislation which will take into account the mass of environmental legislation which has grown up in a fragmented fashion over the past number of years.  They also propose providing a framework which will ensure that that legislation is effective in the years ahead.  Given the complexity of the environmental problems now facing us, obviously this is a daunting task which will involve the expenditure of huge amounts of moneys to put in place measures which will keep our environment in pristine condition and restore our environment to what it was heretofore.</P>
    <P>The agenda for the nineties is very different from the agenda for the previous two decades.  Whether people had any great interest in environmental matters heretofore I suppose it is fair to say that the headlines in recent years about the hole in the ozone layer over the Arctic, the mysterious deaths of seals and porpoises, or the extreme weather conditions prevailing in various parts of the globe and their consequences on agriculture and other activities, have brought environmental matters to peoples' attention. It is probably also fair to say that schoolchildren and those involved in education have been aware for some time of the complexities of acid rain, deforestation, global warming and the greenhouse effect.  Countries do not have individual systems &mdash; we share the same air and we suffer the consequences of transboundary pollution.  For this and many other reasons I hope the implementation of this Bill will ensure that effect is given to the legislation in hand in a coherent manner.</P>
    <P>Approximately 55,000 chemical substances are used in the western world, about 98 per cent of these are absolutely harmless.  However, people have a great fear of the unknown and of the <Col N="166" /> consequences arising from the use or misuse of various chemicals, and the deluge of chemical substances on the market can lead to panic.  A balance needs to be struck between the use of chemical substances and modern technology and peoples' legitimate fears. While big businesses are often perceived to be the great polluter in terms of the quick buck, it should be noted that many Governments can cause pollution through inefficiency, bureaucracy and the introduction of a mass of legislation which cannot be implemented.  To date, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Harney, has done a good job in this area.  However, many questions will arise from the implementation of this Bill.  I hope she will deal with these issues in her reply on Second Stage so that Members can deal with them in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I referred to the difference between areas of scientific interest and environmentally sensitive areas.  I questioned the relationship between these areas and the necessity for compensation to be paid to people who cannot dispose of their property for farming, forestry, etc.  As the Minister is probably aware, while the designation of areas of scientific interest without reference to the local authority or personnel on the ground does not have any legal status at present, it is a cause of great concern.  If the Progressive Democrats/Fianna Fáil Programme for Government is to be implemented under the terms of the agreement, something of the order of £400 million will have to be cut from the Estimates.  This calls into question the seriousness of the Government to make funds available to this agency so that they can do their job.</P>
    <P>I also referred to the statement in 1941 by Archbishop Walsh of the Diocese of Tuam that there should never be any reason for able bodied people to have to emigrate in view of the level of mineral wealth under the soil; 50 years later his successor, Archbishop Cassidy, said in relation to the proposed development at Croagh Patrick that the roots of the <Col N="167" /> mountain were deeper than the vein of gold which is supposed to be there.  I also said that at their recent meeting members of Mayo County Council introduced a specific ban on the county development plan under the 1940 Minerals Development Act.</P>
    <P>I questioned the Minister about who would be the dominant Minister in this area.  The Minister for Energy is charged with responsibility for mineral development but if the elected members of a local authority decide after due consideration to ban all mineral development, where will the power lie?  Will it lie with the Minister for Energy whose constitutional responsibility it is, or what legal effect will a county development plan have in such circumstances?  Mining companies which apply to the Minister for Energy for prospecting licences will have to carry out an environmental impact analysis in the local authority area in which they propose to carry out the mining and have to get planning permission from the local authority in respect of the physical development of the site in question.  If the overall decision of the elected members of the local authority in question is to ban all mining, how can such companies proceed in this regard?</P>
    <P>Objections to developments can be taken to the extreme.  Environmentalists and people interested in the environment can, on occasion, take their fears too far.  It has been brought to my attention that the value of gold in the seam which runs from Croagh Patrick to the Delphi-Doo Lough area could be &mdash; I want to stress the words &ldquo;could be&rdquo;&mdash; of the order of £800 million.  Given that new technology may be introduced in the future, the need for a balance to be struck between the creation of jobs in an area devastated by emigration and starved for industry, and the preservation and maintenance of a good and decent environment, what effect will a ban introduced by a local authority have?</P>
    <P>Like many other speakers, I said that even if the Minister of State leaves nothing else behind her in the Custom <Col N="168" /> House, she should leave a legacy which the children of this nation will associate with her &mdash; a genuine attempt to clear up the social scandal of litter.  As I said, television programmes which influence children should occasionally contain educational references to this problem. Young people who can influence their peers should also take an interest in this issue.  If the young generation, particularly those in primary school and those at pre-primary school stage, are not given instructions in this area they will grow up with no sense of civic responsibility.  This must come through an educational process as other countries have learned from bitter experience.  I would urge the Minister of State to promote actively the cleaning up of our country.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister of State to refer to the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency so far as the generation of electricity is concerned.  I note that in the ESB magazine, <i>Connecting with the Future,</i> they state that in their stretegic plan for the nineties protection of the environment is and will be the biggest single influence on the Electricity Supply Board in the years ahead.  The reason they give is that generating electricity without either coal or oil is regarded as being a major cause of many environmental problems, which it obviously is.  Assuming that in future years the ESB have to increase generating capacity what influence will the Environmental Protection Agency have over the ESB given the fact that under the powers available to the ESB at present they can provide and plant pylons practically in any part of the country.  We have seen them up hill and down valley with total disregard in many cases for the environment and the quality of the environment they pass through.  Will the Environmental Protection Agency have an influence either in an advisory or in a directing capacity to the Electricity Supply Board in terms of their future generation of electricity and the physical fittings that go with it?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" /> An important aspect of the Environmental Protection Agency being introduced is the fact that it will have the effect of removing local monitoring and control from local areas.  For instance, the Japanese plant, Asahi, built over 20 years ago outside Killala was a major chemical plant and people will be aware of the major action plan that had to be introduced on several occasions when acrylonitrile was being transported from Dublin to Killala by train.  Mayo County Council have been carrying out monitoring of the bay for the past 20 years to a very intense degree.  On each of the readings, taken several times a month over two decades, everything has been in order.  However, if Asahi were to apply for planning permission today to build that plant, with all the complications arising from EIA surveys &mdash; fear of chemicals and so on &mdash; it is doubtful that planning permission would issue.  When the Environmental Protection Agency are set up the monitoring of an industry, such as the Asahi plant, will be removed from the local area and may well become anonymous.  If there is no alternative to employment in any particular area and if the Environmental Protection Agency decide to take to the limit their authority under the provisions of the Bill they could effectively close down industries that might not be strictly in accordance with the conditions that should apply but which might be capable of being adapted to meet those conditions within a certain time.  In other words, what I am saying is that if the Environmental Protection Agency take their independent powers to the limit, where no alternative industry exists there could be serious consequences for the economy of an area.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to refer to the regional laboratories which were operated by An Foras Forbartha and which will now either be subject to the local authority or to the Environmental Protection Agency.  For instance, the laboratory in the west which caters for Mayo, Galway and Roscommon is contributed to in a ratio of 40, 40, 20 per <Col N="170" /> cent.  The laboratory do magnificent work in monitoring streams, outlets and so on.</P>
    <P>In terms of existing agencies I would like to know what the effect will be once the Bill in introduced.  The linkage between the Environmental Protection Agency and the local authorities will require some further clarification.  If local authority powers are to be reduced under the Environmental Protection Agency Bill will this not cause delays, inefficiency and confusion?  There are some monitoring activities which local authorities carry out at present and if these are to be removed from them and given to the Environmental Protection Agency there will be a loss of revenue to the county councils involved, many of whom are severely pressured for funds at present.</P>
    <P>In regard to the functions of the agency if a county council or a local authority are not in a position to implement a direction given to them by the Environmental Protection Agency, because of lack of funding, how then are the agency to ensure that their direction and advice are implemented?  Does section 60 (3) (b) really mean that the Environmental Protection Agency will have sufficient funds to enable them to implement their own advice and then take the local authority in question to court and recover the funding? There will be a transfer of activities from county councils to the Environmental Protection Agency; these can range up to 1,000 out of the 1,600 or 1,800 which are presently involved with local authorities.</P>
    <P>When an industrialist, an individual or an organisation apply for planning permission at present to a local authority there is a strict time limit on the issuing of that permission.  That period is two months and extensions of time can be requested and are normally granted.  In respect of pollution, water or waste disposal licences there is no time limit involved but when these licences are integrated and given to the Environmental Protection Agency will there be a time limit parallel to the local authorities' time limit for issue of the individual licence?  I ask the question because one could find an organisation or an industry applying <Col N="171" /> for an extension permission, obtaining the planning permission and not having the required licence issued for some time. That area needs to be cleared up.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Water Pollution Act it would appear that section 81 would allow for provision of buildings without planning permission if the Environmental Protection Agency decide that this should be so.  This is a section of the Water Pollution Act which is not normally used to a great extent but in the case of an industry if the advice offered from the Environmental Protection Agency stated that provision of a further building was necessary, such development, without planning permission, could cause difficulties in built up areas.  That aspect of the Bill should be looked at and referred to by the Minister. Section 51 refers to the protection and the quality of our environment.  I assume that means the existing quality of the physical environment as well as other aspects of it.  For example, under the Department of the Marine, the amount of money allocated in 1990 for coastal protection was £1.049 million.  The corresponding amount in 1989 was £90,000 and there was no allocation in this respect in 1988.  Yet in a report furnished to the members of Mayo County Council, a county with a coastline totalling 866 kilometres and with islands which have a combined coastline of 302 kilometres, that is 16.7 per cent of the national total, the cost of repairs to public property arising from the storms of this year, and general erosion, is more than £2.092 million. The cost of repairs to private property is £4.613 million, making a total of £6,706,000 in one county alone, to protect the quality of the environment.  Local authority engineers involved in that survey were competent in determining what needs to be done.  If a function of the Environmental Protection Agency is to give advice in that area, is not that a duplication of effort without any funding to back it up?  There is little point in establishing an agency and allocating £1 million to get it up and running this year if it will not have the resources necessary <Col N="172" /> to implement the powers given to it under this Bill.  I know the agency will be entitled to seek the views of local and regional experts on various matters and will produce reports occasionally, including five yearly reports, on the state of the nation's environmental health.  Obviously, there will be a great deal of overlapping between reports produced by local authorities, other organisations and the Environmental Protection Agency.  I would like to think that, as this is an all-encompassing Bill, the Government are really serious about giving sufficient funding to get on with the work.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently visited Clare Island where after 70 or 80 years a detailed survey is being carried out on flora, fauna, soil, the atmosphere, the quality of water and so on.  It is important to consider what changes have occurred in one of the most westerly islands in Europe, over 70 years, given all the technology that has been developed since the last survey and the consequences of pesticides, chemicals and so on.  Will the Minister in her reply refer to the role of the Environmental Protection Agency in that area?  This survey is being conducted by the Royal Irish Academy and will obviously update information in relation to that island.  If the Environmental Protection Agency are to enhance the quality of our environment or give advice on it, what role will they play in that sort of survey?</P>
    <P>Much has been said about pollution of the Irish Sea.  I note that sufficient sewage is discharged from both sides of the Irish Sea on a yearly basis to cover the Isle of Man to a depth of six feet.  Most speakers referred to the Sellafield reprocessing plant and called for its closure.  I visited Sellafield a number of years ago.  It is obvious that BNFL have no intention of closing it, nor have the British Government when up to 14,000 people are working there.  The British Government's intentions are clear in that regard, despite calls from the European Parliament and from this side of the water.  It is also interesting to note that evidence has been produced that at Seascale down the road <Col N="173" /> from Windscale, the incidence of leukaemia in that area was higher than normal in 1928 which was some 14 years before the atom was split.  Experts can produce this sort of evidence.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were in Opposition on 12 March 1986, Deputy Ray Burke, now Minister for Justice, in support of Deputy Vincent Brady, now Minister for Defence, called for the closure of Sellafield. Fianna Fáil continuously raised the issue and said it was a matter of regret that the Government of the day could not go with Fianna Fáil on the issue of the closure of Sellafield.  Deputy Burke on 12 March 1986 said that the honourable thing for the Irish Government to do was to unite the House on the Fianna Fáil motion and call on the British Government to close Sellafield.  We now have a new Government and a new programme. The programme does not say what action will be taken about this but the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, and her senior Minister should ensure that whatever action can be taken is taken.</P>
    <P>A problem which has been brought to light in the west of Ireland in recent years relates to the level of radon gas there. The Western Health Board carried out surveys on some of the primary schools located in areas where the reference level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre was exceeded.  It is estimated the 180 deaths from cancer directly linked to evidence of radon gas occur every year.  What surveys can the Environmental Protection Agency carry out to assist local authorities and health boards in monitoring this?  As 437 schools were surveyed in counties Galway, Mayo and Clare there should be a longer term survey of the pupils attending those schools.  The Environmental Protection Agency should be in a position to advise local authorities to issue, with all planning permissions, information about the level of radon gas in any area and where the 200 becquerel limit is exceeded, advice should be given to householders as to how to eliminate the problem.  At the moment that is a function for the local <Col N="174" /> authority in conjunction with the Nuclear Energy Board.</P>
    <P>Speakers referred to afforestation and the resultant acidification in areas densely planted with pine trees.  The 35th report of the Salmon Research Institute of Ireland Incorporated for the year ended 31 December 1990 states that in the west the water chemistry data has shown that streams in the upper Burrishoole catchment area are severely affected by acidification.  The centre carried out an intensive count of fish numbers in the area in November/December 1990 and found that the spawning escapement of 151 was the lowest on record, down by 67 per cent on the 1989 figure of 224.  They found that in terms of the downstream movement of fish the total of 2,063 was the lowest smolt run recorded since total accounts commenced in 1970. The main run was during April and May and water levels were consistently low from mid-April to mid-June and water temperatures were high during the same period.  If Connacht is not to turn into a national forest we need clear advice on where we are going.  If Government policy is to double tourist numbers over a set period, this is obviously an element of the economy that must be looked at carefully.</P>
    <P>I note the farming community responded well to the promptings of Government in the last six years in particular, with regard to agricultural pollution and the disposal of effluent.  The Minister of State is aware of the increase in baled silage.  She may not be aware that the ordinary round bale is triple wrapped and that that cover is extensive enough to cover a tennis court.  There could be up to ten million sheets of plastic used in the western counties alone this year because of the advantage of having baled silage in the generally bad weather.  Obviously, there will be a serious problem over the next number of years if the countryside is covered in plastic.</P>
    <P>We should encourage the farming community to do as they have done over the last number of years.  I raised the matter with the Minister for Agriculture and Food recently and suggested that even a <Col N="175" /> small subsidy should be made to those who want to involve themselves in providing baled silage because of its less polluting effect than that of badly sited silage pits that have run offs into streams. If even a small subsidy were made available to groups or co-ops it would be a very beneficial effect indeed.</P>
    <P>The number of fish kills is down as a result of more care being taken by the farming community.  For instance, in the northern region as of 7 October 1991 there were nine fish kills of which five were agricultural, one unknown and three due to eutrophication; in the Shannon region there were 13 fish kills.  Two were chemical and six agricultural; in the north-western region there were no fish kills reported in 1991; in the south-west-ern region there were seven fish kills of which two were domestic, two unknown, one agricultural and two due to eutrophication. Right around the country the total number of kills was 62, of which 24 were agricultural, 11 due to eutrophication, 12 unknown, two domestic, five chemical and eight industrial.  That number is down on the figures for previous years and that trend should be continued. The principle enshrined in the Minister's Environmental Protection Agency Bill that the polluter pays the cost needs to be followed through quite clearly.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this very broad Bill.  I genuinely hope that the Government see to it that it is not merely an exercise in setting up a legislative body to oversee, implement, advise on and monitor the various aspects of the environment. The Government should also see to it that the resources are available to implement the measures in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to commend the Minister on the methods of selection and appointment of personnel to the board.  That appears to be clear and is obviously important in terms of the public perception.  I hope also that up to date and fully relevant information will be available to the public and that matters relevant to our environment will not be hidden from them.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success in <Col N="176" /> having the Bill passed through Committee Stage.  For the good of our country over the next 50 years, I genuinely hope that this will prove to be fundamental legislation.  I hope the agency will be able to cope with the undoubted increasing pressures in terms of the quality of our environment both now and in the times ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the Environmental Protection Agency Bill. Its introduction is timely.  I welcome too the manner of its introduction in the Seanad.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Harney, on her commitment to making some positive progress in this very important area.</P>
      <P>It may well be that the absence of any significant industrial development in Ireland over the past decade is to some extent a blessing in disguise, at least as far as the environment is concerned. There was not the same public awareness of the importance of environmental protection during that period that there is today.  As a result much more damage could have been done.  It will, I hope, be to our long term advantage that the neglect of environmental issues and environmental protection on mainland Europe during this period will now provide us with the opportunity to project our relatively clean and healthy image.  I hope the Bill before the House will assist in consolidating and improving that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our united efforts in this area will not only safeguard the health of our people but the quality of life and the conditions under which we live.  I hope that in tackling these fundamental issues for our own people we will also reap the rewards of increasing the attractiveness of our country for tourism with its associated benefits to our economy.  As a member of the Council of Europe I have had the opportunity to see at first hand the destruction of the environment in countries like Poland and the highly successful policies of environmental protection in countries like Austria.  If we were to look to Europe for examples of success and failure in <Col N="177" /> this vital area of development I would strongly recommend Austria as a good example of what can be achieved through carefully thought out and implemented environmental policy.</P>
    <P>It would be my wish, however, that in time and with the opportunities available to us, our own programme in this area will surpass anything achieved on the European mainland.  In this regard I believe that the local authorities have a vital and paramount role to play in this entire area.  The application of uniform standards as between the various local authorities is fundamental to the success of the scheme.  The Minister has certainly acknowledged that in the various provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We, as a small nation, cannot afford a fragmented approach to environmental protection.  The fact that we have the advantage of being an island nation makes this approach even more important. It also makes our task much easier.</P>
    <P>If we are successful with environmental protection in the individual local authority areas and if there is a co-ordinated approach between the various local authorities then our valuable and extensive coastline will also be protected, although the question of sea pollution from sources outside our control does arise.  We must address this question in a very positive manner.  I have in mind our concern in relation to Sellafield and other possible threats to the environment and to the sea from the dumping of various chemical wastes.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the new agency should be independent of Government and that they should have the necessary resources to do their work. The Minister of State was also correct to conduct a wide range of consultations and discussions with various groupings, including the statutory authorities.  The expected initial net cost &mdash; somewhere in the region of £4 million &mdash; will be more than offset, even in the short term, by the additional revenue likely to be generated from tourism growth and other ancillary developments.</P>
    <P>In supporting the concept of independence for the agency, it is vital that <Col N="178" /> they do not divorce themselves from national policy on industrial and agricultural development.  There is a need to adopt a positive and balanced approach and to ensure that we do not go to ridiculous extremes in our environmental policies to the detriment of ordered development and the need for job creation.  I do not think this is likely to happen under the terms of the Bill, but I would like to put down a marker in this respect.</P>
    <P>Environmental issues tend to attract extremists and the composition of the board and advisory committees should be balanced and representative of both sides in this debate.  If this is done, then the difficulty of extremism on both sides will be eliminated with, I hope, consensus and balance prevailing.  We need to get away from the extremism which has, on occasion, cost our people opportunities for employment and frightened away potential entrepreneurs both within the country and from abroad.</P>
    <P>Waste disposal within local authority areas is a source of growing concern.  This is an area of environmental protection which has not received the attention it deserves, and it must be addressed.  The preservation of the countryside and the quality of life in rural towns and villages is dependent on the success and effectiveness of each local authority in carrying out their plans for waste disposal.  We must provide an effective refuse collection service for all who need it but we must not resolve this wider community problem by transferring it to the doors of others, particularly those residing in the vicinity of centralised landfill sites.  The agency must require local authorities to exercise the highest level of control and management of such sites and sufficient funds must be made available to enable them to do so.</P>
    <P>Laois County Council of which I am a member, recently applied themselves to the task of resolving such a problem and in so doing received considerable help and support from the community residing in the vicinity of our landfill site.  We now have in place an effective monitoring committee representative of council <Col N="179" /> members and the local community.  Perhaps progress has been slow but it has been steady and I hope it will result in Laois County Council being able to develop a waste disposal area to the highest standards, which could be achieved anywhere in the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to all concerned but in particular to the voluntary community representatives.  We do not always utilise and avail of the vast potential for goodwill and progress which lies dormant in many local communities and which could be harnessed, as we have done in County Laois, in the national interest.  Perhaps the Minister of State will take note of our success in this area. She took an interest in our developing problems and met with representatives from the area.  It is important that we establish a climate of co-operation rather than confrontation, which far too often has been the case.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point I would like to make.  I want to pay a special tribute to a group who have made a more significant contribution than any other to environmental protection the various tidy towns committees.  They more than anyone else have transformed the face of rural Ireland.  The extent to which they have improved the quality of life for all our citizens is impossible to quantify but the economic value of their voluntary participation in improving our national image is immense and the return for the small contributions they receive from, for example, national lottery funds &mdash; some of them are not in receipt of any funding &mdash; is substantial.</P>
    <P>This is one of the few countries in Europe which is experiencing such a high level of voluntary community participation. We should appreciate the efforts of these dedicated people and encourage the seed of neighbourliness and community participation which was sown many years ago by a fellow countyman of yours, a Cheann Comhairle, the late Canon John Hayes, the founder of Muintir na Tíre.  I say this at a time when <Col N="180" /> we have such a high level of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. They need leadership and a sense of direction.  Some of the statutory schemes which have been introduced for the purpose of dealing with problems of this nature are very often too bureaucratic and inflexible in their approach.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a passing reference to housing development and its effect on the environment.  The trend at present is that those who can afford to do so are leaving the more densely built up urban areas and moving to more environmentally friendly rural and semirural locations.  In terms of our great national investment in housing, particularly public authority housing, there is an urgent need to review our policies on housing density from the point of view, as I have said, of protecting our investment and the quality of life being planned for the people who will live in these schemes in the future.</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to quote the Austrian experience as an example.  The local authorities in Austria have put considerable thought and planning into achieving a balance between urban and rural development.  We could take a useful leaf out of their book in terms of their approach to housing and the environment.</P>
    <P>Let me make one small point which may sound rather insignificant but it is important, and that is, we must examine the question of providing a small plot of land for those living in local authority houses to enable them, if they want to, to produce fresh vegetables, for example. I say that particularly in the context of the very high level of food imports at present and the opportunity which is there to produce high quality food which also, of course, has some bearing on the debate in terms of the environment.  That project has been very successfully undertaken by people who have dedicated themselves to such planning in countries such as Austria.</P>
    <P>I wish to make passing reference to two areas over which we should have some positive control.  They are slightly irrelevant but I will only take a short time <Col N="181" /> to make the point.  As I said already, the level of food imports is totally unacceptable and we should be able to do something about it.  The other question is our lack of commitment to purchasing Irish produce and goods.  We have direct control over these two matters and if we fail to implement it it is difficult to understand how we can succeed in areas over which we do not have direct control.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to the changing pattern in relation to agricultural production. I believe that farmers, of their nature, are conservationists and certainly have an interest in the environment. They have responded very positively to the Government incentives to deal with environmental problems on their various holdings.  With the declining level of farm incomes it is not possible for all farmers to fully comply with the requirements of their individual local authorities and I urge that, in such cases, there should be a certain degree of flexibility in relation to administering the laws and regulations governing pollution.  If necessary, the smaller farmers and landholders should be given additional financial aid.</P>
    <P>The agricultural industry generally have a very important role to play in terms of the environment and the attractiveness of our country's potential for tourism.  Our farm holdings have an attractive and worthwhile role to play because of the uniqueness of the farming scene and the large number of small family holdings.  From that point of view, I very much welcome the Bill which the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, brought before the House because it will, I hope, enable us &mdash; as a small island nation &mdash; to capitalise on our great potential, attractiveness and opportunities for tourism.  I have no doubt that the Bill will receive the backing, good will and support of the whole community, including the various farming organisations and many other environmental groups who are naturally and correctly concerned about our future.  I compliment the Minister and thank her for her dedication and commitment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister <Col N="182" /> of State on her initiative in introducing the Bill in the Seanad.  As a former Member of that House I know that many legislative matters are scrutinised more carefully in the Seanad and many more Bills should be initiated there because there is often a much more limited debate in this House.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, did not accept a Private Members' Motion on the issue of environmental protection which was introduced in 1989 by Deputy Shatter.  If it had been accepted we could now be discussing the agency's first annual report.  However, we have not matured sufficiently, politically, to accept that another political party can introduce matters of importance to the House.  The growing concern with the environment has placed this issue high on the political agenda in Ireland and the rest of the European Community.</P>
      <P>Over the last couple of years many public representatives have noted the dramatic developments at local and national levels in respect of issues, legislation and regulations dealing with environmental concerns.  The Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1987 and 1990, and the Air Pollution Act, 1987, contain very wide ranging controls for the protection of the environment. They marked the beginning of meaningful modern legislation to protect the environment at local level.  Our 33 major local authorities are charged with the implementation of this legislation and, by and large, they have performed their duties very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have a vested interest in protecting the environment.  How often do we notice the beauty and tranquility of the countryside, the cleanliness of a street in an urban area or generally appreciate a nice landscaped district?  Deputy Hyland referred to the Tidy Towns competition organised by Bord Fáilte which has contributed in a significant way to encouraging small communities, by way of self-help, to appreciate their environment, tourist potential and a pleasant rural village or town.  It is economically beneficial for businesses and residents to carry out <Col N="183" /> amenity work; in short, the environment and its protection are an integral part of the development of our economy.  The same applies to the major investment and development proposals submitted from time to time to the planners.</P>
    <P>My initial thoughts on the promotion of a new agency to protect the environment were mixed because existing agencies are in place in the form of our local authorities if we decided to give them the necessary powers, resources and personnel to implement the various regulations and legislative proposals enacted by the Oireachtas.  Indeed, I am disappointed at the failure of the Government to recognise the important contribution local authorities have made &mdash; and can make &mdash; in implementing the measures in this Bill.  I want to put on record my appreciation of the enormous contribution by local authorities in defending and preserving our environment. In particular, I want to compliment the role of my own local authority, Kilkenny County Council, of which I am a member, in enhancing and enriching the environment in which I live.</P>
    <P>Planning officials and the executive of Kilkenny County Council, led by the county manager, Mr. Donnelly, have been to the forefront in planning and developing the city and county of Kilkenny, making it one of the most pleasant and enhanced tourist locations in the country.  I recall that when Mr. Donnelly became county manager in 1976 he immediately set about drawing up a development plan for the city and county. The issue of infrastructural facilities, such as water and sewerage, were key elements of that plan and were heavily emphasised.  He recognised that the protection of the environment and the development of industry and tourism potential of the area hinged on having water and sewerage installations to the highest possible standards.  Kilkenny County Council spent millions of pounds on new treatment works and on water and sewerage installations, the most modern and efficient in Europe.  This was <Col N="184" /> done by proper planning and development by the county development team in Kilkenny under the supervision and grant aid of the Department of the Environment. It is my belief that this work would be further enhanced if more decision-making responsibilities were given to local authorities, with a co-ordinating unit in the Department of the Environment to supervise local authority work throughout the country, thus eliminating the need for a new agency.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day this is all about money and the provision of the necessary finance to carry out the major infrastructural works essential to protect the environment.  Many local authorities have been found to be in breach of standards relating to protection of the environment because they have failed to get the necessary finance from the Department of the Environment to carry out essential remedial works.  I hope that the new agency, in spite of my initial reservations about them, will ensure that the necessary finance is made available by the Department of the Environment for urgent projects in the interests of environmental protection.</P>
    <P>I understand that the proposed office for the protection and improvement of the environment will be structured similarly to the existing offices for trade and marketing.  The office will be responsible for all pollution legislation, the establishment of a new nationwide inspectorate and the drawing up of environmental programmes on a county basis.  I hope that the officials of local authorities will have a major implementation role in these programmes.</P>
    <P>Great progress has been made by local authorities in the area of pollution control. Surveys have been carried out by local authorities in the area of pollution activity, seeking to monitor particularly farmyard work and the responsibility taken by the agricultural community for protecting species in our rivers and the flora and fauna which are there for the benefit of everybody.  I assure the House that by and large the agricultural community are very responsible in terms of <Col N="185" /> the environment.  They have spent millions of pounds in the last ten years in upgrading their facilities to ensure that the highest standards are attainable. Nobody has a more vested interest than the agricultural community in ensuring that the highest environmental standards apply, as their agricultural produce in the future will depend on a pure, clean and natural-based system of production which will meet the requirements in the market-place of the European Community. In this regard I hope the Minister will shortly establish an eco labelling scheme that will assist the country in promoting environmentally friendly products, particularly those relating to the agricultural industry.  In this way we will signal to the European Community that we have pure, clean pollution-free products that meet the requirements of consumers throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>On occasion, I regret the headbanger approach of sections of the media in identifying an isolated incident and articulating it as a measure of wholesale destruction of the environment or giving the impression that is a widespread occurrence. Various surveys will show and local authorities will prove that this is not the case and that great progress has been made, with the help of grant-aid from the European Community, in upgrading agricultural facilities.  This is a measure of the responsible approach that everybody is prepared to take.  The incentive is there, and if there is co-operation between the local authority and the farmer rapid results will be achieved.  I emphasise that co-operation is the only way in the long run to achieve the desired result.</P>
    <P>I must pay tribute to the work of Teagasc in relation to this development, particularly as they have appointed an environmental officer in each area to advise the agricultural community on measures that can be taken, the grant aid that is available and the urgency of carrying out the work within the financial limits.  The Environmental Protection Agency and the independent environmental monitoring agency will be charged with formulating and <Col N="186" /> implementing environmental policies.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister how these agencies will operate in practice and how their role will impinge on the work being carried out at present by local authorities.  Various speakers have referred to this matter and clarification is required as to the role of both authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the developments in Europe which will guarantee freedom of access to information on the environment.  I hope that the freedom of information Bill which has been promised for so long will soon be introduced by the Government. The existing EC action programmes on the environment recognise the role of public information in the campaign to safeguard the environment.  The Commission published a proposal some time ago which stated: &ldquo;completely free access to information held by the authorities on the environment would make citizens feel more directly responsible for protecting their environment and tighten controls and activities which would cause pollution&rdquo;. This proposal would ensure widespread dissemination of all information held by State bodies, public bodies or State supervised bodies which operate at national, regional or local level.  Many groups and individuals today find themselves alienated, in that they find it difficult to get information.  This does not help when seeking the co-operation of these same groups and individuals in protecting our environment.</P>
    <P>It is expected that information will be freely available on issues such as the existing state of water, air, soil, fauna, flora and natural sites, and that any public or private projects or any activities that are likely to damage the environment or endanger human health, plant or animal life will be available for inspection.  A summary of the significant number of daily activities of local authorities will be subject to scrutiny.  I welcome the fact that all data on matters ranging from planning to public health to environmental matters will be available to those who request it.  It is essential that there be access to public information.  Planning and development is not inhibited by the <Col N="187" /> responsible approach of individuals. However, a particular vested interest of an individual or group should be noted in all planning matters.  I am glad that there will be a restriction on access to information on grounds of national security and industrial or trade secrecy.</P>
    <P>No individual or group should be hypocritical about the Environmental Protection Agency or about protecting our environment.  As Deputy Hyland said, we should guard against extremism or eccentricity in this regard.  People should not be anti-development just for the sake of it.  We must adopt a balanced and orderly approach and be positive in relation to the proposed development and protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Environmental Protection Agency will be obliged to publish a report on the state of the environment every three years, indicating the progress or otherwise in this area.  The relationship between the Environmental Protection Agency and the local authorities remains to be clarified. As local authorities act as the primary monitoring agency in the State some major adjustments will arise, possibly in the next two years.  The entitlement to access to information may create difficulties for some public authorities, particularly given the range of documents that will become available to the public. There is a danger that this will mark a further diminution of local authority representation and powers and that their impact on environmental decision-making at local level will be lessened.  I hope there can be some cohesion whereby the views of local authorities and local representatives can be channelled to the Environmental Protection Agency and that local authorities will not be alienated from the new agency and in terms of formulating policy.  Their involvement would ensure that matters of local interest and local policy are taken into account in framing regulations.</P>
    <P>One of the major developments in Europe in respect of the environment was the introduction of the EC Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment.  I <Col N="188" /> welcome this regulation particularly as it applies to major projects.  The community and public at large are entitled to baseline information on the environment before development takes place.  This will give a clear indication in the future of the impact of any development and the harmful effects, if any, that it will have in due course.</P>
    <P>Expertise is limited in respect of the operation of the environmental impact assessment procedures, particularly as regards the effects on water, air and soil. It is crucial that all information sought on these matters is given by a developer before planning permission is granted. Indeed, I would urge the agency to insist that no local authority will grant permission unless full baseline data is given in respect of any development that is likely to have a major impact on the environment.  I am thinking particularly of activities such as mining, which has a chequered history in this country.  An application in respect of a mining development at Galmoy, County Kilkenny, is at present awaiting decision by Kilkenny County Council.  I assure Members that the level of expertise brought in by the local authority to assist in relation to the planning application is significant.  It is essential that this scrutiny, to the highest possible standard, takes place to ensure that existing environmental conditions prevail particularly in relation to water, air and soil conditions.</P>
    <P>The people of the area are genuinely concerned about these matters and also about the impact transport will have on the local road network in view of the fact that the local authority have not sufficient money to improve the road network to the standard necessary to allow for the number of trucks that will be traversing these routes.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to ask the Minister for the Environment to examine this planning proposal and to take an interest in the development to ensure that there will be the least possible impact on the road network and on the environment generally. Consideration should be given to <Col N="189" /> opening discussions between the companies engaged in mining activities in the Kilkenny-Tipperary border area on developing a single processing mill for the raw material, and to developing links between the two companies, Ivernia and Conroy Petroleum in order to provide a light rail system for the purpose of transporting the raw material rather than using road transport.  This would be positive discrimination in favour of the environment and in the interests of the community in general.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that everybody wishes to see development take place but we must maintain the highest possible environmental standards.  I have no doubt that the mining companies to which I have referred in the Kilkenny-Tipperary area wish to comply with the highest environmental standards and to allay public concern about what will happen once development takes place. This is a perfect example of the need to achieve a balance between proper planning and development, the need to provide employment and an insistence that its impact on the environment is lessened.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Flanagan, brought to my attention the existence of a group in the midlands called the Midland Environmental Action Group, who have drawn up a report on the production of &ldquo;green pork&rdquo;.  I assure Members that there is widespread concern about this development in pig production in many communities.  I am sure that the Minister, Deputy Harney, is well aware of these projects where animals traverse agricultural land in a free range manner in Leinster and are subsequently processed into &ldquo;environmentally friendly pork&rdquo; in Edenderry, County Offaly.  We had the experience in Jenkinstown, County Kilkenny, of people paying dearly for the sites on which they built houses and enjoying a clean water supply, now finding that farm practices in the area impinge on them and could cause substantial difficulties for the community at large.  The impact of this development on the community has to be questioned.  We must ask whether this should be deemed to be agricultural or <Col N="190" /> commercial activity.  I hope the agency will be able to address these matters and advise local authorities on whether they should be subject to a particular planning process to ensure fair play not only for the developer but for the individual and the community.</P>
    <P>In Kilkenny, the Keep Kilkenny Beautiful Committee have provided the model for many other urban areas in establishing public awareness on the need to have a clean urban area and a litter free environment.  In my opinion, there have been major advances in public attitudes to litter and this happened largely through the education system.  We all agree that good habits need to be developed at an early age.  The lack of importance given to Civics in our schools is hampering the protection of the environment. It should be part of our education that we develop proper attitudes to the environment and do so with State support through our education system. Through information and awareness, and a reward for the achievement of local success it is important to make the general public aware of the common objective of having a clean, litter free and waste free environment.</P>
    <P>The location of dumps is a contentious issue for local authorities.  The necessary land space is often very difficult to obtain without considerable community agitation and there have been several examples of this.  Despite assurances that the highest European environmental standards will be observed in providing these facilities, the general public do not believe that the local authorities will abide by those standards.  Some Members referred to waste disposal but I am glad to say that the highest possible European standards are being adhered to in the dumps throughout the country.  It is now realised that local authorities have a problem in disposing of refuse, but it must be disposed of somewhere.  It costs a significant amount of money to dispose of waste and local authorities have to charge for this service.  In fact, in 1992 Kilkenny County Council will spend £753,000 in disposing of refuse and in the operation of dumps, and will receive <Col N="191" /> £100,000 from the service charge for refuse collection.  That is a measure of the local authority's commitment to the environment.</P>
    <P>Smog was considered to be largely an urban issue and confined to the city of Dublin.  However, nothing could be further from the truth.  The Minister for the Environment should ensure that smog levels are monitored in every urban area this winter.  I do not think it is acceptable that people with chest complaints or asthma, and old people do not have the opportunity to insist that the local authority or the Environmental Protection Agency monitor the levels of smog in each housing district of urban areas and that the information is passed on to the community to allay any public fears.  I urge the Minister to take this suggestion on board.</P>
    <P>Ireland should become an international pioneer of protection of the public and the environment from nuclear hazards.  A national radiological protection institute should be established and given a status independent of Government in advising on the health and environmental hazards of radiation and to report to the Minister for the Environment.  It was brought to my attention recently that MMDS masts are a source of great concern to the community. The lack of information on MMDS is causing public disquiet.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to make available any information that she or her colleagues in Government may have on radiation from this source in order to allay public concern.</P>
    <P>As a nation we must face up to our responsibilities in order to pass on to the next generation a landscape and an environment which is fit to live in and which people can enjoy.  I am convinced that many of the measures proposed in Parts III, IV and V of the Bill are part and parcel of existing local government practice and if given the resources local authorities could make an even greater contribution to the protection of our environment.  I trust that the legislation which is &ldquo;green&rdquo; in its content will not <Col N="192" /> find a ministerial &ldquo;yellowness&rdquo; in its implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment on her successful piloting of this Bill through the Seanad.  It represents the most comprehensive legislation on the environment to come before the House for a long time.</P>
      <P>The Bill represents an important milestone in the ongoing debate on the relationship between the environment and economic development.  Despite what other speakers said about the conflict between the role of the local authorities and the new agency, I wish to nail my colours to the mast and to say that for me the need for a national, uniform protection agency was clearly obvious from the debate on industrial development of Cork harbour in the past few years.  That debate had as much to do with a lack of public confidence as with anything else.  At the time, rightly or wrongly, the public in general did not have confidence in the capacity, resources or expertise of the local authority to effectively police the environment, particularly in relation to the major industrial plants and developments. That point came across very strongly.  In the light of the growing environmental debate, the complexity of economic development, particularly in relation to chemical and pharmaceutical plants, the intensification of agriculture, the growth of the electronics industry and so on, it is clear it makes sense to have a national body exclusively responsible for the protection of the environment that has no conflicting interests or other pressures put upon it that would deflect it from protecting the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a fundamental problem in relation to local authorities.  Whereas the environmental departments of many local authorities had been doing their utmost to protect their environment it is clear there was a genuine conflict of interest in relation to the environment <Col N="193" /> between different sections of local authorities. There is no question that compromises were made, that certain lobbies in local authorities were anxious for certain developments to take place and perhaps took shortcuts or overruled the environmental argument in their local authority. That is a fundamental reason for needing a national agency with the exclusive objective of protecting the environment.</P>
    <P>An ongoing debate has concentrated on the relationship between the local authority planning system and the licensing role of the new agency.  That relationship should be allowed to evolve.  The establishment of the agency would, in itself, create its own dynamism.  Over a period of time a relationship would gradually be evolved, and I think it would be a complementary one as opposed to being one of conflict.  We should not be unduly concerned about that issue but should allow such evolution to take its course.</P>
    <P>The Bill is comprehensive.  I am particularly delighted with the promotion and co-ordination of environmental research. What I would say to the Minister and, indeed, to the agency is that it is particularly important that such research is made available to public representatives in general and to members of local authorities and health boards in particular.  It has often struck me that those on the official or management side of local authorities have a distinct advantage over a local authority member in debates concerning environmental issues in so far as a local authority member rarely has access to all of the documentation the officials have or the expertise to take on officialdom in those debates.  It is vitally important that when the agency offers guidelines or advice to local authorities they take care to distinguish between members and officials, and ensure the research is made available to members of a local authority rather than just the officials, who might provide it in the form of reports to local authority members.  In other words, if the agency have strong advice on a development in a local authority area or on the way in which a local <Col N="194" /> authority is performing they should communicate that directly to the elected members of the authority as well as to the officials.</P>
    <P>In the research on environmental matters it is also important to utilise the existing and growing infrastructure in the third level sector.  There is little point in setting up new environmental research units when many third level institutions already have considerable research facilities in the form of laboratories, environmental research expertise and so on.  One of the great failings of our educational system is that we have not applied the expertise and resources in it to the wider community and society in general.  This Bill offers an opportunity to do that.  We have all witnessed in recent years the growth of environmental research programmes both at adult education level and at third level in universities and Regional Technical Colleges.  The operation of the agency in the area of research should dovetail with third level institutions and there should be constructive interaction and utilisation of existing resources rather than duplication of resources.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely imperative to have full public disclosure on environmental issues.  One of the great reasons for a breakdown of public confidence in local authorities and in the State's capacity to monitor the environment is a lack of public disclosure.  I am a relatively new member of a local authority and the Dáil and it seems to me that breakdown stems from a traditional view of letting the public know just what they need to know and holding on to more sensitive material.  In an issue of major environmental concern involving the operation of the sanitary landfill site in Cork the reluctance of Cork Corporation to publish consultants reports on that operation created tremendous public unease and exacerbated the situation.  That issue illustrated the need for full public disclosure and the right of people to have access.  When people are given access to information they become more responsive but when they are deprived of information they suspect there is much more <Col N="195" /> to an issue than there probably is and they become suspicious and more conspiratorial in their attitude to their local authority.</P>
    <P>That issue also illustrated to me the fact that the local authority of which I was a member did not have the in-house expertise to deal with that issue.  The issue had grown beyond the expertise of the local authority and the authority had to hire consultants from abroad, which was a very wise decision.  On study of the landfill site, the consultants discovered enormous environmental hazards and problems, the chief of which was the presence of methane gas, which was explosive, in the landfill site.  The consultants recommended the installation of a ventilation system to vent out the methane gas to prevent explosions.  They also discovered very serious contamination of ground water and surface water as a result of leached pollution.  It was thought the possibly unacceptably high concentration of metals resulting from leached pollution could have a detrimental impact on the Douglas estuary. There was also considerable peat movement of bogs.</P>
    <P>That was a major environmental issue in Cork and I use it to illustrate the general point that the local authority itself did not have the necessary expertise and that it was only by calling in outside expertise that it suddenly began to realise the gravity and the scale of the problem with which it was confronted.  A national Environmental Protection Agency would have to be particularly strong in its role of overseeing local authorities.  The agency have to be seen by the public not so much to take on the local authority but to offer strong advice and guidance, to actually meet officials and members of that local authority and to tell them that they should go about their operation in a particular way.  At the moment most local authorities are going through their estimates and considering the demands on their expenditure.  Unless strong pressure is put on local authorities to spend on the environment then they will not do so; they will spend in other areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> One welcome section of the Bill enables the Minister to make regulations to deal with the prevention and control of noise.  Noise pollution is a matter of growing concern in residential areas throughout the country.  Probably that is the weakest area in our existing planning laws.  I have become annoyed and frustrated at the advice I have received from planning officials that there is no point in pursuing this problem of noise pollution through the planning laws; that one would be better to take a civil case against the polluter.  That is not good enough in that it is unnecessarily inhibiting and costly for the person concerned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures to be included to counteract noise pollution which will also be welcomed by the general public. I am thinking particularly of the provision of a District Courts complaints procedure in respect of neighbourhood noise.  There appears to be a number of concerns nationwide exempted from the provisions of the planning laws because they had been in existence prior to 1963 while, in the interim, major urban residential developments have grown up around them, its attendant noise pollution being an unacceptable intrusion in the residential amenities of the area.  The planning authorities appear to have very little power to deal with that problem.  It is vital that the proposed agency grapple with that problem.</P>
    <P>The central concept of this Bill, the introduction of an integrated licensing system, is particularly welcome and should eliminate much duplication from the system thereby aiding applicants for licences and so on.  On the financial implications of the Bill, it is envisaged that revenue will be generated through licence fees and charges for services. Although we are operating within restricted budgetary considerations, I would urge the Government to fund this agency generously, giving them a good start.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of location of the agency I support the pleas of many of my colleagues from Cork who have argued cogently and logically for its location in Cork, not merely for the economic benefits it would bestow to the city <Col N="197" /> but because much of the debate which led to the emergence of the concept of an agency arose from many disputes in Cork in relation to industrial development, the protection of the environment and so on.  We have a large pharmaceutical and electronics base in Cork, with a rich agricultural hinterland in addition to the city having all the requisite services and so on, rendering it a most desirable location for the proposed agency.</P>
    <P>To revert to the public disclosure and publication of regular reports on the state of our environment, it is important that that would not be merely a nominal role of the agency but rather that they would pursue this matter vigorously through our education system, at primary and second levels, through community groups, public representatives and others. Indeed, that might well be described as one of their more important roles.</P>
    <P>We have made considerable advances in environmental protection since 1987. With the enactment of the Water Pollution Act, 1990, and the Air Pollution Act, 1987, local authorities' controlling powers and enforcement regulations in relation to the environment have been greatly enhanced.  The independence of the proposed agency has been guaranteed also under the provisions of this Bill. I welcome the provision rendering it an offence for anybody to endeavour to improperly influence the agency in relation to any issue or development.  On the other hand, it should be legitimate for any public representative or member of the public to make a representation based on the merits or demerits of any particular development to the agency.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State proved very flexible in the Seanad with regard to amendments tabled by many Members there.  I have no doubt but that the same will apply in this House.  In her introductory remarks she welcomed amendments being tabled on Committee Stage, particularly in regard to the role of the agency <i>vis-á-vis</i> their planning and monitoring powers.</P>
    <P>We should not be afraid of the provisions of this Bill, as some local authority <Col N="198" /> officials appear to be.  Whenever there is change or development proposed people who had control in certain areas up to now, always will be somewhat reluctant to let go of that control or allow somebody else take on additional roles.  I contend that this agency will assist, augment and strengthen the role of local authorities in the overall areas of environmental protection.  Within that context I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to make a few comments on this Bill.  First, I regret to say that one of our finest State assets to tourism was destroyed by fire.  I refer to Slane Castle. It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the important role its owner played in allowing the general public view that building over the past ten years, in that it comprised an important part of the development of tourism in our county accommodating many more visitors.  In the interests of the nation it would be my hope that some aid would be available from some source within the State to help refurbish that building.</P>
      <P>It has been my experience as a member of a local authority for the past 17 years that an enormous amount of work has been undertaken recently with regard to protection of our environment.  Local authorities have become increasingly conscious of the seriousness of the environmental problems they encounter and have been forthright in confronting them.  I know many local authorities nationwide have submitted many requests to the Department for funds to tackle the problems they have encountered in the environment, for the provision of more updated, pollution-free facilities for sewerage systems and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The population in County Meath has exploded &mdash; for example, within the short period I have been a member of our local authority, the population has risen from approximately 70,000 to 105,000 &mdash; as has been the case in Kildare and Wick-low. We are in dire need of extra funds from the Department to help us meet the ever increasing demands on our existing services.  In 1975, Meath County Council <Col N="199" /> spent approximately £1,000 annually on environmental protection whereas today we need in the region of £300,000 to £350,000 which must be provided out of our limited allocation.</P>
    <P>In replying to a question I tabled today the Minister said that that extra money is provided by way of grant, whereas that grant has been continuously reduced.</P>
    <P>The new proposal will certainly fall flat if sufficient funds are not made available to the agency and to the local authorities who will be required to carry out certain works.  Tourism is fast becoming our single biggest industry and it is vital that we protect our environment.  The Minister should discuss at Government level the provision of the necessary funds to enable the effective implementation of this legislation.  New regulations which have come into effect in the last few years have become a burden on local authorities due to the difficulty in raising the necessary funds.  There has been a population explosion in the counties around this city.  We have to raise charges, while one third of the population do not.  That is causing serious problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been by any standard an extraordinary debate because of the quality of the contributions. The fact that 47 Deputies contributed confirms that concern for the environment is a top priority for all Deputies and all parties.  I am pleased that the Bill has been broadly welcomed by all sides of the House and will not be opposed on Second Stage.  That is not to say that Deputies did not have many suggestions to make to refine the Bill but this would be more appropriate to Committee Stage.  A number of clarifications were sought which I can deal with now in order to avoid repeating part of this debate on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable number of Deputies referred to problems related to waste, including in particular toxic and dangerous waste.  This matter is currently being examined in my Department and I intend <Col N="200" /> to have a new waste Bill brought forward as soon as possible so that all the issues can be fully debated in this House.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the resources which will be available to the agency to carry out their functions.  I can assure the House that the Government are committed to ensuring that adequate resources will be made available.  I am also conscious of the fact that there will be many practical and logistical difficulties in bringing the agency fully into operation.  To enable the agency to concentrate initially on the priority issues, including the integrated licensing system, there will be a need for the phasing in of functions over a two to three year period.</P>
    <P>There is adequate provision for staffing of the agency, which will comprise staff transferred from other bodies whose functions are being taken over by the agency.  Staff can be seconded to the agency, for example, for a period or to perform a specific task; the agency can employ consultants or have tasks carried out by other bodies on an agency basis. Of course, the agency will also be recruiting staff, especially where particular expertise is required for the performance of their functions.  In addition, as an interim measure, the Minister is empowered under section 43 to supply services, including staff, to the agency so that they can operate successfully once established. It is envisaged that the agency will have a staff in the region of 150 to 200 when they are fully operational.</P>
    <P>The agency will also be given the necessary funding and it is envisaged that the eventual cost will be about £8 million per annum.  About half of this amount will come from transfers of funds in conjunction with the assignment to the agency of staff for whom budgetary provisions already exist, with the balance coming from the collection of licence fees and charges for services provided by the agency.  It will, of course, be necessary to provide additional resources from the Exchequer and these will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell sought the inclusion in the Bill of a statutory role for the President in relation to the agency.  The <Col N="201" /> President's role is derived primarily from the Constitution.  With some exceptions, the powers and functions of the President are exercisable only on the advice of the Government and there is no provision for a role in the formulation and execution of policy.  Deputy Mitchell's proposal would involve the President in matters which are the preserve of Government.  The Constitution never envisaged such a development.</P>
    <P>The President can and does play an important role in giving recognition and encouragement to the valuable work of many environmentally aware individuals and groups by her attendance at meetings, ceremonies and local and national community initiatives.  Such recognition can only enhance and increase public involvement in environmental matters.  I pay tribute to President Robinson for the vigorous way she has become involved in environmental causes.  However, no legislation is required to enable the President to continue her involvement in this area, which is both desirable and encouraging.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the absence of a proper precautionary approach in the Bill and in particular to an inadequate emphasis on prevention other than end of pipe solutions.  This is far from the case.  This Bill is the first Irish legislation, and perhaps the first international legislation, that specifically embodies the precautionary principle.  Section 52 (2) (c) of the Bill specifies that the agency when performing their functions must have regard to the need for precaution in relation to the potentially harmful effect of emissions, where there are reasonable grounds for believing such emissions would cause significant environmental pollution.  This is one of a number of general principles set out in section 52 under which the agency will carry out their functions.</P>
    <P>In addition there are specific requirements in other sections of the Bill. Section 81 prohibits the agency from granting a licence unless they are satisfied that any emissions from the activity will comply with or not contravene environmental standards and specifically that <Col N="202" /> they will not cause significant environmental pollution.  The agency are also required to ensure that the best available technology not entailing excessive costs will be used to prevent, limit, eliminate, abate or reduce an emission from an activity.  These provisions place a strong emphasis on the preventative approach.</P>
    <P>The general emphasis of Part III of the Bill, which relates to the agency's functions, is on prevention with, for example, provisions relating to an eco labelling scheme for products and services, environmental audits, setting environmental quality objectives, issuing codes of practice and so on.  No country can afford to ignore end of pipe solutions as part of its environmental strategy until clean technology options are much further developed.  Ireland as an importer of technology is largely, but not wholly, dependent on development in other countries.  Nevertheless I believe the principles behind this Bill are going a long way in recognising the importance of prevention of emissions and new waste legislation which is being developed in my Department at present will further reinforce this principle.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed by Deputies Mitchell, Howlin, Allen and others about the range of functions to be assigned to the agency and that the built environment has been excluded from the Bill.  I was somewhat surprised at this issue being raised, given the very wide range of functions proposed for the agency under Part III in addition to their licensing and enforcement role.  The latter functions take account of the need for institutional reform in the area of environmental controls, particularly of large scale developments which pose a high risk of pollution. It is not intended that the agency should act as a land use or planning authority although there will clearly be interaction between the planning system and the proposed licensing system operated by the agency.</P>
    <P>It was never the intention that the agency would be accorded a planning role.  The planning code has been painstakingly and carefully built up over the last three decades and the institutional <Col N="203" /> arrangements which have been put in place to implement it will not be tampered with lightly.  However, as I mentioned in my speech the minimisation of conflict between the planning and licensing system is the subject of an ongoing review within my Department and certain amendments will be tabled in this regard on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The general range of functions to be assigned to the agency have been carefully chosen having regard to the need to concentrate on our most serious environmental problems.  The extension of those functions to some of the areas which have been suggested would divert the agency's resources from their core tasks and would quickly lead to a loss of the agency's control and credibility.</P>
    <P>There are adequate powers under sections 53 and 54 of the Bill for giving additional functions to the agency at any time should the circumstances warrant. We will be in a better position to judge the feasibility of extending the range of functions once the agency have been in operation for an appropriate period.</P>
    <P>I want to refer specifically to a point made by Deputy Cotter.  He questioned the comments I made in the Seanad in relation to the impartiality of local authorities. He said that I seemed to think certain functions were being given to the agency because local authorities were not impartial in the way they carried out their activities.  I said nothing of the sort.  I said, and I quote: &ldquo;This Bill is being formulated in an atmosphere of public disquiet about the impartiality of public authorities in their decision-making on often controversial development&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Whether or not one agrees with it, I think we will all be aware of the considerable public disquiet and reaction by a minority against certain types of development.  This public disquiet is fuelled by the dual functions of local authorities who have a developmental role as well as a regulatory one.  The establishment of the agency will make it transparent that the regulation of those developments with potential for serious <Col N="204" /> pollution will be the responsibility of a separate, independent and expert body.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputies Howlin, Gilmore, Garland and Carey, expressed concern about the degree of public access to information on the environment and the means for such access.  Deputy Gilmore went further to suggest that the freedom of access provisions were a mere gesture and somehow would be compromised by the provisions of section 39.</P>
    <P>Section 108 on &ldquo;Access to Information on the Environment&rdquo; is an enabling section and provides a framework for implementing the European Community Directive on this matter.  Much of the Bill is drafted on a framework basis with provisions for the detailed procedures and other matters to be set out in regulations. This is done for practical reasons. If all the details were included in the Prinicipal Bill, it would render consideration of the Bill impractical because of its size and complexity.  The singling out of a particular issue, such as the freedom of information provisions, for detailed treatment in the Bill could not be justified, particularly as there is a requirement to give effect to the European Community Directive by 31 December 1992.</P>
    <P>The European Community Directive recognises that there are situations which require that information should be exempted from the right of general access.  Some Deputies expressed concern about the agency's power under section 39 to restrict the disclosure of confidential information.  I do not see this as a problem.  In recognition of the fact that certain information must be treated as confidential &mdash; and as I have said this is recognised in the European Community Directive &mdash; the agency must be given the power provided for in section 39. However, the use of this power is always subject to the overriding provisions of the European Community Directive and I already introduced an amendment, which was passed in the Seanad, to make it clear that the requirements of section <Col N="205" /> 108 would not and could not be compromised in any way by the provisions of section 39.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies will be aware of my commitment to greater freedom of information and I am satisfied that the provisions in the Bill will provide for a wide level of public access to environmental information in future.  The duty on the agency to make information available to the public is clear and extensive.  There are at least 18 sections in the Bill &mdash; other than section 108 &mdash; where there is specific provision for publication of information, and indeed the duty in many cases is mandatory on the agency.  The greater availability of such information will inform public debate in the future and ensure that facts rather than fancy are the basis for public discussion of particular developments.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputies Ellis, Gilmore, Deenihan and Carey, sought clarification on the regional environmental units to be established by the agency.  The agency are obliged by section 43 of the Bill to arrange, as far as is practicable, for the performance of their functions through regional environment units.  This obligation is placed on the agency so as to ensure that they do not become an over-centralised body.  The activities which will be licensed by the agency are located throughout the country so it is essential that the agency be in a position to operate effectively in all regions.</P>
    <P>The exact number of units and the areas of the various regions will be a matter in the first instance for the agency, subject of course to resource constraints. However, it would be expected that the agency would have regard to the areas and structure of the regional authorities under the new local government reform proposals.</P>
    <P>Great care will be taken however, to avoid wasteful duplication of resources and it is anticipated that the regional units will be based initially on existing facilities such as the three local authority regional laboratories in Kilkenny, Castlebar and Monaghan.  In addition, further regional units will make use, in so far as it is <Col N="206" /> practicable, of existing facilities such as, for example, laboratories in third level institutions and other State bodies.</P>
    <P>Deputies Dukes and Garland asked the question: who will define what is the best available technology not entailing excessive costs?  The responsibility for determining a BATNEEC is given to the agency under the provisions of section 5. It is expected that the agency will discharge the responsibility by specifying emission limit values achieveable through BATNEEC either generally for the class of activity or specifically for a particular activity in the conditions attached to a licence.  The purpose of establishing BATNEEC is to serve as a reference as to what is possible to achieve in relation to minimising the impact of an activity on the environment.  It does not imply that there is only one set of technologies which will meet the requirements. An operator may use whatever technology and other measures he considers most appropriate provided he satisfies the criteria specified by the agency.</P>
    <P>Best available technology does not of itself require that the very latest tested technical concepts must be employed. Availability and whether the technology has been &ldquo;proven in the field&rdquo; are important criteria.  The &ldquo;not entailing excessive costs&rdquo; part of the term refers to the economic viability of the technology or techniques in the context of the sector as a whole for which the BATNEEC is being applied.  It is important to point out that in addition to BATNEEC considerations, all activities, both new and established, will be obliged to comply with relevant statutory requirements regardless of the costs involved.  Under section 81 BATNEEC is only one of six sets of conditions about which the agency must be satisfied before they grant a licence.</P>
    <P>Deputies Ellis and Cullimore referred to the importance of the farming community to protecting the environment.  It is not envisaged that the agency would have a licensing role in relation to pollution incidents from small farms but <Col N="207" /> intensive pig and poultry rearing installations will be licensable by the agency. As regards pollution from ordinary farms, it is worth noting that the reduction in fish kills caused by agricultural sources since 1987 has been maintained.  This is due in no small part to the programme of measures to prevent water pollution which has been implemented by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for the Control of Farmyard Pollution (1989-1993) was approved by the European Commission in August 1990.  Substantial grant assistance is being made available to farmers for the provision of slurry and silage effluent storage tanks, animal housing and fodder storage under the Operational Programme and the Farm Improvement Programme which are administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  By end 1990 over 18,000 grant applications had been approved under the Control of Farmyard Pollution Programme.  A total investment of some £190 million is envisaged under the programme.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have pointed out that the Bill does not specifically provide for the control of private landfill sites by the agency.  Under the 1979 Waste Regulations private landfill sites must obtain a permit from the relevant local authority and the permit can contain conditions as to the operation of the site.  It is envisaged that the local authority will apply the same criteria and procedures to the operation of private landfill sites as the agency specify for local authority sites.  The agency will have powers under section 61 to ensure that local authorities are adequately supervising the operation of the private landfill sites.   Therefore, there is no necessity for the inclusion of private sites under section 60 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Deputies from the Kildare constituency made a number of comments in relation to a letter I was supposed to have issued about proposals to upgrade the Kilcullen sewage treatment facility.  I want to refer in particular to the comments made by Deputy Stagg in his speech on 24 October last.  He said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> The Minister of State knows Kilcullen particularly well... She issued a letter to her party colleague in that town stating that a sewage treatment works would be put in place forthwith. That letter was issued to every house in the town.  The senior Minister knew nothing about it.</P>
    <P>Miss Harney: It is not true.</P>
    <P>Mr. Stagg: The letter was issued in the Minister's name with a covering letter from her colleague.  The effect of that deceiving of the people of Kilcullen resulted in a decent Fianna Fáil councillor...losing his seat...</P>
    <P>Miss Harney: Show me the letter.</P>
    <P>Mr. Stagg: Every house in Kilcullen has the letter.  I have it in my house but it is not with me. </P>
    <P>Subsequent to that debate I approached Deputy Stagg for a copy of the letter but I still have not received it.  The reason I have not received it is that no such letter exists.  Because of the widespread publicity given to Deputy Stagg's remarks I want to put on the record of this House, for the purpose of correcting the record, my involvement as far as the Kilcullen sewage treatment works were concerned.</P>
    <P>On 6 April 1990 I wrote to Senator John Dardis as follows:</P>
    <P>I refer to your recent letter about Kilcullen Sewage Works.</P>
    <P>The position is that my Department has requested Kildare County Council to submit a revised Preliminary Report for the Kilcullen Sewage Treatment Scheme and which forms part of the Upper Liffey Valley Scheme. </P>
    <P>On 24 July I wrote again saying that the preliminary report had not been received.  On 13 May 1991, which was before the local elections, I again wrote to Senator Dardis saying:</P>
    <P>I refer to your letter of 10th inst. about the above matter.</P>
    <P>The position is that the submission of a preliminary report by Kildare County <Col N="209" /> Council is still awaited by my Department. The scheme cannot be progressed until this report is received. </P>
    <P>That report was received on 28 May.  My most recent letter was on 8 November 1991 indicating that the report was received.</P>
    <P>I take a very dim view of Deputy Stagg seeking to mislead this House in order to score cheap political points.  It is a fact that I have met with a community development association in Kilcullen but at no stage did I indicate to them &mdash; and they will confirm as they have only recently written to me about this matter again &mdash; or to anybody else in that area that approval was imminent for the upgrading of the Kilcullen sewage treatment works.  I share the concern of the local Deputies about this matter as I do about other treatment works which are inadequate around the country.  The Government have said on many occasions that we are committed to upgrading sewage treatment facilities in this country as a matter of priority.  A sum of £1 billion for that purpose and the upgrading of water treatment facilities for this decade was planned to be spent on these facilities.  I hope those funds will be provided.  Given that we have a difficult budgetary situation that may not always be possible, but I hope they will be forthcoming so that our water resources will not be contaminated or polluted due to the lack of appropriate sewage treatment facilities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stagg also asked about my involvement in what he called Athgarvan dump and he said again I could not do anything about it.  I am sorry to tell Deputy Stagg I cannot overrule the courts.  The illegal dump at Hillsborough, Athgarvan, County Kildare, was the matter of a High Court action brought by Kildare County Council.  They sought to enforce the closure of this dump.  They were unsuccessful on the basis that it had existed as a tip site prior to the enactment of the Planning Acts of 1963.  The site operator, however, is required to obtain a permit from Kildare County Council, <Col N="210" /> under the terms of the European Communities Waste Regulations, 1979, in respect of its waste disposal activities. This will allow the council to impose conditions and duties on the permit holder to ensure the satisfactory operation of the facility.  The permit application is at present, I understand, being processed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry of the Fine Gael Party gave me and Deputy Taylor great credit for &mdash; as he said &mdash; ensuring that the national waste incinerator was not located at Baldonnel.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of &ldquo;not in my back yard&rdquo;.  Wherever this facility is to be located, surely within a mile and a half of a hospital like Peamount and beside Baldonnel aerodrome &mdash; where one cannot even get permission to build a house for a local resident &mdash; was not an appropriate location.  I make no apology for opposing that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank all Deputies for their contributions. It was a very comprehensive debate and, as I said earlier, it indicates that protection of the environment is a concern for Deputies and for all parties in this House.  Many Deputies laid great emphasis on the fact that we need to place a greater emphasis on educating people in relation to their environmental responsibilities.  I share that concern about the need to educate the public in this regard.  The ENFO office attached to my Department which was opened in September 1990 is providing invaluable information to members of the public, to schoolchildren and to many interested persons in relation to environmental issues.  The interest shown in the activities of that office makes it clear to me that there are many people of all age groups who are now deeply concerned about our environment and who want to ensure that everything is done to protect and enhance it.  The Environmental Protection Agency will play their part in that process. It will not be a panacea for all our environmental problems.  One of the worries I have is that perhaps too much <Col N="212" /> is expected of this agency.  When it is in place, I believe the agency will be independent and will be perceived as such.  The agency will be fully resourced and will act as a public watchdog to ensure that the highest possible environmental standards are maintained.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; and I think Deputy Gilmore &mdash; referred to the smog problem in Dublin.  Although they paid tribute to the fact that there has been a huge improvement in air quality they were concerned about the implications on low income families.  I share that concern. Unfortunately, it is not always easy or possible to do the right thing and to ensure that it does not impinge in some way on some sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the householders of Dublin for the manner in which they have worked with the Government to ensure that that ban on the sale and marketing of bituminous coal is a success.  We still have a long way to go; the problem is by no means over.  Any coal burning in the city contributes to increasing smog levels and to disimproving air quality.  I think the decision taken by the Government was the right one in the circumstances and one which has brought great benefit not just to the wealthy of this city and county but to all groups and particularly to those suffering from respiratory and chest related problems.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the speedy passage of this Bill.  Second Stage was longer than one anticipated.  It was a good debate; it was comprehensive and 47 contributions indicate the kind of interest there is in the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency.  I hope we will be able to have Committee and Report Stages through this House as quickly as possible so that this agency can be established as soon as possible and can perform the very important functions, particularly in the priority areas for the agency, towards the middle of next year.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, alarmed at the projected increase of unemployment to over 300,000 in 1992; conscious of the deteriorating economic situation within Ireland; concerned about the changes which will affect agricultural output as a result of the GATT talks and the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy; determined to act decisively to deal with the wide range of problems in the delivery and extent of our social services, in particular health, housing and education; resolves to establish on a statutory basis an Oireachtas Social and Economic Committee with not less than 18 members drawn from both Houses:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to speak for approximately 20 minutes.  This motion calls for the establishment of a social and economic committee.  No one doubts that the country is facing economic and social problems on an enormous scale.  As recently as last weekend two publications coming from diverse quarters served to underline our serious economic and social problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Sunday Business Post,</i> the voice of commerce and the business establishment here, talked about a state of emergency and in an unprecedented full page editorial they outlined the major problems facing the country and called for a <Col N="215" /> philosophy which will act as a binding agent and hold society together in the coming decade.  It was the most dramatic editorial they have ever produced.</P>
    <P>In a separate document published over the same weekend by the Catholic Justice Commission and the Conference of Major Religious Superiors on aspects of the 1992 budget, the authors called for a massive transformation in the way our budget is formulated and in how the economic policy which it underpins is implemented.</P>
    <P>Both publications underline the extent of the crisis facing society but they are only two of numerous publications which over the last year and a half have documented the extent of the failure of our economy to create the level of employment required to sustain at a reasonable standard the lifestyle of all our people.</P>
    <P>There have been changes in the economy over the last three years or so in terms of public spending and in the wider economy.  There have been various efficiencies, prunings, rationalisations and an outside commentator looking at Ireland would readily recognise the considerable shake-up that has taken place and might even describe the economy as being leaner than it was.  But, would they come to the conclusion that our economy is more competitive as a result?  I doubt it.  All the signs are that the economy is less well able to withstand any economic shock than it was.  By the same token it must be doubted that our economy is well equipped to benefit from any significant international recovery.  Above all, there is no sign that we will be better able to translate economic growth into the jobs than we were.</P>
    <P>What a price has been paid in the polarisation of society, in the breakdown of communities, in the suffering of young and old alike if they need a service from the State?</P>
    <P>Two points must be made right at the start of this debate.  First, the breakdowns that we have witnessed have not happened by accident &mdash; they have all come about as a matter of choice and are all directly related to the priorities of <Col N="216" /> Government in the last four years. Second, all these things &mdash; hardship, unemployment, and the economic failure of society &mdash; are related.  The climate which has allowed and encouraged emigration on a historic scale, the collapse of parts of our health service, and the gradual dismantling of high standard free education, is the same climate, regrettably, that has permitted the emergence of a new sort of scandal in Ireland &mdash; the scandal of greed and petty corruption that has characterised the last few, sad, sordid months.</P>
    <P>It is not our purpose to use this motion or debate to recriminate.  There has been enough of that.  There must now be a constructive and positive political response to this problem that reaches beyond the narrow historical and bitter boundaries of party division and Civil War animosities that flared into life last Wednesday night in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance on his new appointment on my own behalf and on behalf of my party.  The public are crying out for a constructive, comprehensive response from all elected politicians.  If we fail to respond in a generous and creative manner, we run the risk of not only forfeiting their support but of undermining the foundations of democracy.  When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo;, I refer to everybody in the Chamber.  For how long can we sustain, in stable form, a society which by any reckoning &mdash; and the CMRS report is the one to which I most recently referred &mdash; has one third of its population below the poverty line and 20 per cent of its workforce condemned to virtual indefinite idleness?  It cannot go on forever.  We must do something about it.</P>
    <P>The role of Government is to provide leadership and direction.  It has never been an easy task.  Our problems have been compounded in recent years as the difficulties facing individual Ministers and parties in Government have increased.  Faced on the one hand with the demands of participation in the meetings of the Council of Ministers in the European Community while at the same time managing complex Departments at <Col N="217" /> home, Irish Ministers are becoming increasingly remote and isolated from Irish society due to the demanding pressures on their time.  I have not even added the demands with regard to constituency representation or party affairs.  The role and workload of a Minister today is infinitely more demanding than it was five or ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The traditional culture of Cabinet Government has depended on a near exclusive relationship between the Ministers of the day and the permanent civil servants.  Problems are analysed in private, policy options are debated in secret and solutions, if any, emerge from behind the wall of Cabinet collective responsibility, to be presented to the Oireachtas in the form of legislation which will require the rubber stamp of approval from Government supporters. We have all experienced that either as Government supporters or Ministers.  It is a very old system which has been in operation since 1922, but it has not served the nation well.  It has been comprehensively reviewed and seriously damned by Professor Joseph Lee in his award winning work on modern Irish history. Despite our proclamations of independence, we inherited a Westminster model of parliament in 1922 and we have not seen fit to reform it, nothwithstanding the fact that that Mother of Parliament model has itself significantly transformed the way in which it does its business.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Chair in his capacity as Speaker of the House who is familiar with the workings of many parliaments, that most people in this House recognise that virtually every European Parliament has a committee structure that involves the members of the parliament, irrespective of their party allegiance.  The European Parliament and the Congress of the United States have committee structures, although they do not have Cabinet Government in the form we know and recognise.  The committee system is an integral part of the work of every modern parliament.</P>
    <P>Where are we with regard to the attitude and intentions of the present Government in respect of the utilisation <Col N="218" /> of the resources of Parliament in a constructive committee structure?  The recently agreed Programme for Government between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats contained the following:</P>
    <P>In future, suitable Bills will be dealt with on Committee Stage by a Select Committee and debates in the Dáil on these Bills will be confined to Second Stage and Report Stage.  Streamlined voting procedures in committee will be introduced, so that there is a minimum interruption in the flow of business.</P>
    <P>A calendar will be set out in advance for the meetings of the Oireachtas Committee.</P>
    <P>The Government will propose the establishment of a European Affairs Committee along the lines proposed in Report No. 7 of the 6th Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  MEPs will in future have a right of audience at meetings of this Committee.</P>
    <P>The Government will examine the feasibility of giving a special allowance to the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committees in recognition of their additional responsibilities and workload. </P>
    <P>While I welcome that modest step forward and the commitment that underlies it, it simply does not go far enough.  It will not deal with specific requirements which the public now want from the Oireachtas.  We cannot do the business we have been elected to do with the system which we now have.  All the talk about changing the voting system is irrelevant if we do not change the way we do business inside this House.</P>
    <P>It is the considered view of the Labour Party, which I believe is shared by most Members of this House and certainly by all Opposition Parties, that we need to harness the energies of all the Members of the Oireachtas and to open the doors of Departments of Government to the social partners and other interested and concerned groups in our society who <Col N="219" /> want to see our problems confronted and who have solutions to offer.</P>
    <P>This motion proposes to establish on a statutory basis an Oireachtas social and economic affairs committee.  It would draw its membership from both Houses of the Oireachtas and would have its own independent staff with adequate resources to enable it to carry out its work.  In this context, since both the Minister and one of his more senior advisers are here, let me make a plea for a separate estimate and separate budgetary control for the Houses of the Oireachtas to be incorporated into a method of financing this democracy similar to that in other parliaments in Europe.  Otherwise the plea for resources will fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>The committee would become the eyes and ears of the Oireachtas in responding to the economic and social problems which confront our people.  The committee would review and analyse reports which are being prepared and published by a wide range of exports and commentators and make recommendations based on those reports to the relevant Departments of Government.</P>
    <P>The committee would do something that is never done in this House.  It would listen to the views of civil servants who are charged with the responsibility of implementing policy and hear their comments and observations as to the practicality of some proposals and the difficulties relating to the administration of existing policies.  This is a practice with which every member of a local authority in this House is familiar; yet it does not exist in this House.  Something that has no prospect of practical implementation can be proposed.  There may be very good reason why it cannot be implemented, but these are never articulated because the people charged with administering the proposal do not have the opportunity to talk in a non-adversarial manner to the Members of this Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The committee would provide, on a regular and open basis, a forum for dialogue and discussion between representatives of the social partners, who <Col N="220" /> have now been virtually institutionalised, so as to enable us to understand the problems of different sectors of society.  We would talk to each other rather than at each other and we would talk within the confines of this building and not over the air waves through RTE.  The committee would enable people to say in public what they are saying in private and convey their views directly to Members of the Oireachtas who would ultimately carry the responsibility of changing policies and implementing decisions.  The committee could, if directed by the Oireachtas, deal with specific legislation on Committee Stage from time to time in a comprehensive and professional manner.  The committee would provide the basis for a democratically elected forum which would be open to the views and representations of citizens throughout this State in a manner that currently does not happen.</P>
    <P>This new approach would speed up the process of law making in our society and bring to bear upon its formulation a wide range of expertise within the Oireachtas and outside it which is presently excluded.  It would also free up time within the Houses of the Oireachtas to enable other debates to take place, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the operation of our national assembly.</P>
    <P>If anything has been conveyed to me over the last number of weeks it is that the public are crying out for a constructive and positive response from politicians of all parties in an attempt to solve the many social and economic problems which currently afflict this land.  The animosities of the last weeks, the bitterness of the last few days have damaged relations within this House and even undermined support for democracy outside it.  The results of a survey, albeit taken last March, seem to give some credibility to that assertion.  If we are listening, and the Labour Party most certainly are, we must respond positively and I believe the Minister will so do.</P>
    <P>The Government have tabled an amendment and I want to devote the last three minutes of my time to analysing <Col N="221" /> that amendment.  First, I recognise the attempt by the Government to respond positively to the spirit of our proposal.  I have to say in all honesty, however, that it simply does not go far enough.  I have already read into the record of the House our proposals for Oireachtas reform and they are quite minimal.  There is no firm commitment and no explicit reference to the kind of committee I am seeking. Second, with the absence of resources &mdash; and Members of this House will be familiar with this problem in the context of the Committee on State-sponsored Bodies and the Oireachtas Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities &mdash; the committee simply cannot do the work that they have been charged to do by this House in the broader sense.  Ministers for Finance have never had an easy task and the present Minister, coming into today's budgetary climate which has been compounded by mismanagement over the last year, is facing a very difficult task indeed. I put it to him that a properly constructed economic and social affairs committee would provide an additional forum, an additional democratic place under this roof that would enable options to be explored, solutions to be teased out and possibilities examined in a manner that would bring us, maybe not immediately but inevitably, towards solutions that would work and would, because of the way we participated, have the support of the public at large.</P>
    <P>Every other democratic assembly on this continent works this way.  The United States Congress harnesses the expertise of every one of its members.  What is so special about the 15 members of this Cabinet &mdash; and they are certainly not permanent members, as we have seen in recent days &mdash; that they are uniquely endowed with the skills to come forward with solutions to problems that have baffled many other people while all the back benchers on the Government side, all the expertise on the Opposition side, are simply ignored.  One could count on the fingers of one hand the number of constructive amendments that have been accepted by Ministers on that side of the <Col N="222" /> House, because it has not been part of the culture of Cabinet Government to open up to that kind of thinking.  I can make that criticism because I have been a part of that culture.  I have on occasions accepted amendments against the advice of the culture and on other occasions I have refused to accept amendments on the advice of the culture because it is a closed culture born in the suspicions of 1920 to 1922.  However, the world has moved on a long time since then.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by making an appeal to the Minister for Finance.  We have offered this debate in a constructive manner.  We believe the problems now facing us are on a scale never previously encountered by a democratic administration on this island.  Nobody believes the Minister can produce solutions on his own.  We on this side of the House do not have all the solutions either.  We have to pool our expertise in areas where consensus exists and where it is only a matter of exploring the precise practicalities of implementation.  If we do not do that we run the risk to having in another 20 or 30 years a compendium volume published by a successor to Professor Joseph Lee which will damn us for our failure to manage the State but it will be compounded by the fact that after 70 years of independence we failed to learn the lesson of not fully involving the expertise and commitment of the Oireachtas.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government parties, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, to reconsider the amendment in the name of the Minister for Finance because it does not go far enough.  They can do much better than that.  Without prejudice to whatever solutions may emerge from such a committee, their establishment is an absolute priority.  I strongly recommend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to join my colleague, Deputy Quinn, in urging the Minister to agree to establish this economic and social committee. In doing so I wish to point out that there is among the public a great concern that there is a kind of fatalism here.  There is <Col N="223" /> the growing idea in many circles that there is almost nothing that anybody can do about the rising level of unemployment, emigration and low income levels.</P>
      <P>When I first entered politics in about 1969 the unemployment figure stood at 65,000.  I remember discussing this issue with Dr. Noel Browne at a time when people used to say, as the figure headed over 70,000, &ldquo;what if it reaches 100,000?&rdquo; As we wait for the unemployment figure to rise above 300,000 we are speaking about little less than a national catastrophe in social terms.  Of that 300,000, 160,000 are at present long term unemployed.</P>
      <P>Ministerial speeches give a very flimsy analysis of unemployment.  I should like to make one last appeal for a dropping of one convenient excuse about unemployment which I have listened to so often in this House in recent years: I challenge the new Minister, whom I wish every success in his new ministry, to drop this nonsense that if we create a climate in the economy we will automatically produce jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take it very simply as an elementary economics student would take it.  We have had superficial economic growth but with that growth we have had neither investment levels nor job creation.  Ministers speak of an economy that they measure and test by low inflation rates, favourable interest rates and, sometimes, growth rates although this has abated in recent times as growth has slipped away. Even in times of favourable growth, of 5 per cent and up to 7 per cent, there has been no impact on unemployment.  The notion of creating a climate and relying on these superfical indicators is, as I described it for years, an image of a depeopled economy, it is the fundamental fallacy as some of us were taught when we studied economics so many decades ago.  It goes back to Adam Smith who rejected the notion that one could have an economy which did well but a people who did badly.  Any serious politician has to make the fundamental test of an economic strategy: what is its outturn <Col N="224" /> in terms of investment levels and job creation?  This has not happened in recent times.</P>
    <P>Let me point out how this fallacy arose. I watched what I call the econometric fallacy flourish in the Department of Finance: the idea that the engine could be ticking away even if one did not ask what it was moving and the idea that the indicators could be right and the people could be suffering.  I watched this thinking shade into the Economic and Social Research Institute.  I pay tribute to that institute and to the NESC because both bodies saw that, ultimately, the economy was an instrument for social benefit and that one had to consider unemployment, emigration, social policy and the amount of money available for health and so on. Uniquely, all the staff of the Economic and Social Research Institute combined, under the director and others, to produce a volume on unemployment.  They took on the national problem of unemployment. All this motion asks is that intellectually, socially responsible, important work finds its place in the political process.</P>
    <P>What is standing in its way &mdash; I was often accused of this &mdash; is the kind of ideological block which exists in the thinking in the Department of Finance &mdash; I am being very careful about this &mdash; the idea that it is soft to consider the social outturn of economic strategy and that real economics deal just with the indicators, the depeopled economy.  Thus we have had little less than rubbish prepared for Ministers in recent years, which had a mantra like quality, which stated: &ldquo;In these difficult times when at last the national finances are restored and brought to order&rdquo; and so on.  One speech after the other contained that little rhyme at the beginning.</P>
    <P>The second fallacy I urge the new Minister to take on is the notion &mdash; it was created again in a hostile environment to the unemployed &mdash; that the causes of unemployment are located among the unemployed.  One has two options, and it was always so when economists and <Col N="225" /> social economists looked at unemployment. One saw high levels of unemployment as a feature of the economy or one saw and explained it in terms of the characteristics of the persons unemployed. Old poor law always justified it as the characteristics of the unemployed. There was the notion that they had to be conscripted to work at a time when job opportunities were drying up in the economy.</P>
    <P>The third fallacy I have heard, disgracefully, repeated in the House time and again is that the slowing up of emigration is responsible for the high unemployment rate.  When the figures are adjusted we will see that our high unemployment rate is due to a net loss of jobs in manufacturing, the increase in the numbers coming into the labour force and migration from agriculture.  If we took all the emigration figures out of the increase in unemployment one would not explain the rise in unemployment.  It is dishonest and untrue to say that the fact that people are not leaving is responsible for the high unemployment rate.</P>
    <P>I might say about those who are being forced to emigrate &mdash; this is what gives urgency to what Deputy Quinn and others have said &mdash; that we should be very clear that they are emigrating into a hostile environment for migrants everywhere. The next ten to 20 years will see the attitude towards migrants all over Europe as perhaps one of the most significant social problems in the European Community.  Already workers who are non-nationals are in difficulty in practically every country in the Community. Migrants, and those who talk to emigrants in London, speak about the difference in attitude now as against other years.  We have a responsibility to our emigrants and to the unemployed.  We are asking in this motion that academic work of the highest quality that is engaged in the issues of social policy, unemployment and job creation and critiques of our industrial policy be fed into our thinking in a non-con-frontational way in this Chamber and in the other House.  I cannot for the life of me understand why a Government would <Col N="226" /> resist this.  Perhaps they will come back and say that that is the function of the Department of Finance but I would then have to ask where is there in print an analysis, for example, from the Department of Finance with their new resources?  Our national debt, which we hear is a great burden, had some unique features, not least the fact that maybe over 65 per cent is owed to Irish institutions. Have the Government transmitted to such institutions that they have any responsibility for investment in the Irish economy and for job creation? Where is there any serious thinking like this?</P>
    <P>It is indeed, as Deputy Quinn said, a certain 19th century feature that Finance operate in isolation from social policy.  I would go further and say that if we had such a committee we could have discussed Telesis and the disastrous industrial policy of high front-loaded grants which were justified.  I am in favour of forms of industrialisation; I remember the argument, the idea was to capture them and, through their linkages, they would transfer technology and, through their purchases, transmit benefits by a multiplier through the domestic economy.</P>
    <P>There were studies &mdash; again by people outside the formal decision making system &mdash; which showed that the linkages were not taking place.  There were studies piled upon each other relating to the informal economy, the amount of profit escaping from the country; they showed that maybe between one-eighth and one-tenth of gross domestic product was escaping from the country without any benefit, investment outcome or jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a choice of continuing to preside over a deadly fatalism of a very sinister kind which argues that we must let the blood keep flowing, that there is nothing you can do about unemployment until the economic climate gets better. Occasionally in the speech of a Minister for Finance there are a few paragraphs about world conditions &mdash; it is hailstoning in the world &mdash; therefore, we cnanot expect to do better; if the British economy picks up so might we.  There is an <Col N="227" /> argument about the degree of connection between the British and Irish labour markets and how one responds to the other. It is said that if there was growth in Britain there would probably be more emigration from this country and less unemployment.  That is elementary.  All this motion is asking for is the creation of a forum to which we will bring the best of thinking to analysing the nature of our unemployment problem through the parliamentary process.</P>
    <P>Every month, for the last 14 months, unemployment has risen.  What are the Cabinet supposed to do about it?  Certainly it would be an extraordinary act of ostrich-like quality to bury your head in the sand and say that you must not have a forum because we have the Department of Finance; you must not read the NESC reports or critiques of industrial policy; you must not read those valuable reports about value added in agriculture; and you must not read reports about, for example, changed definitions of services, etc.  Every agency in the country are asking us to have a more informed debate about unemployment and investment.</P>
    <P>If the motion is rejected we are in danger of not heeding any of the reports. I have noticed this attitude.  I am 50 years old and I have attended many seminars; I have seen the so-called economists.  I detest people who condemn economics as a science but there are people who practise a form of economics which do not have anything to do with the people economy.  I have heard them talking about those who are concerned about poverty, the unemployed, social welfare, old people who can only have one cataract removed at a time and replacement hips.  They regard them as a soft group of people and not real to decision makers &mdash; good, real, non-elected decision makers, good, real, non-elected, ignorant decision makers, good, real, non-elected, ignorant anti-intellectual decision formers who want to exclude from this House the work of a whole lifetime on peopled economics.  They are people who have spent their life doing research and comparative studies on <Col N="228" /> economies in the labour market in Europe and outside it.</P>
    <P>We do not have such a committee at present and we are driven daft by being told that the Taoiseach is consulting different people in Europe.  He reminds me of the poor old tenants going up to the big house saying: &ldquo;would your honour be moved to give us a better price for the potatoes?&rdquo; That is our preparation for Maastricht.  In every parliament in Europe there are draft versions of treaties and discussion papers which have been debated by elected members.  The Minister will be presiding over these decisions.  Is it on that the Irish people will be asked to accept a common currency, a central bank in Europe, for example, when all the evidence since the Single European Act is that their peripherality and the disadvantages that flow with it have increased?  Where, in this business of getting more money and so forth, is there any semblance of constructing a set of policies and strategies that would convey that to the areas of high emigration and high unemployment?</P>
    <P>Recently at a meeting in Europe I could sense that we were the laughing stock by not having adequate regional structures.  In every country which speaks or writes about regional policy, going back to the sixties &mdash; and I speak as a founding member of the Regional Studies Association in Ireland &mdash; it is accepted, if you are to have a regional authority, you must give it the power to analyse a problem, prepare a programme, establish a budget, discuss priorities within the budget and have some kind of accountable elected body to administer and monitor its policy.  That does not exist because the people in the regions cannot be trusted and, after all, you have this kind of subtle control through the existing county system, not necessarily to elected county councils but through bodies like county managers' associations.</P>
    <P>There is so much that could be done. Parliament is becoming, as it is in many countries in Europe, less and less accountable.  This committee is an <Col N="229" /> attempt to erode a driving conviction at the moment that Parliament has nothing to say about unemployment, emigration, poverty and low income levels.  It is an attempt to create a forum in which we might discuss alternatives.  Deputy Quinn said that we can be generous in that regard, we just want an opportunity to present ideas.  My own time in politics began in 1969 when unemployment was around 60,000.  It is now heading for 300,000.</P>
    <P>What kind of discussion do we have in this House on economics?  What will the Minister do about it if he blocks a committee like this?  It is very important to bear in mind &mdash; this is the good old Department of Finance thinking again &mdash; that the problem will disappear eventually but the census figures do not bear this out.  For example, in 1988, there were 70,000 four year olds in the country.  It will be well into the next century &mdash; perhaps in its second decade &mdash; when the natural increase will affect those available for work.  The problem is not going away.  At the same time there has been a decimation of job opportunities in agriculture. There is also a structural problem in the British economy which is allowing it to return to growth but which is not creating jobs.</P>
    <P>This committee could take as a hypothesis &mdash; I am willing to be judged by the evidence offered for or against it &mdash; that while there has been neglect of unemployment, emigration and poverty among those on low income, at the same time there has been the sustenance of a culture of speculation that has judged wealth creation on its own terms, that the spending of wealth was important. However, that culture of speculation has been involved in job destruction.  The people who have received the greatest accolades for creating wealth, which they spent ostentatiously, were people who destroyed jobs rather than created them. I hope that the proposed committee will shift the thinking on the ground to a culture of production in which all our ideas will be geared towards the creation of jobs and discussions on economic and social aspects of the economy.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after Dáil Éireann and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;supports the proposals for Oireachtas reform set out in the recently published Programme for Government and in particular</P>
      <P>&mdash;the proposal to enable suitable Bills to be dealt with at Committee Stage by a Select Committee;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the proposal to review after the Christmas recess the possible arrangements whereby short debates on topical matters take place each day;</P>
      <P>notes that these proposals will give ample scope for detailed discussions on Committee Stage of Bills and for frequent debates on economic and social policies including examining in detail reports from various bodies such as the NESC and the ESRI and providing Deputies generally with the possibility of voicing their opinions on economic and social policies including the creation of employment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputies Quinn, Higgins and Noonan for wishing me well in my term in the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the contribution of Deputy Quinn in moving the motion.  I accept he has done so in a constructive way and that he is taking a positive attitude to what can be done in this regard. I have been involved for many years in Dáil reform.  When Deputy Bruton was Leader of the House during the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition and I was Whip for Fianna Fáil we worked for 18 months, in 1983-84, to see what committees could be set up and how the workings of the House could be improved.  Eight years later we look back and realise that some of those committees were a success but many of them did not live up to the expectations or the aspirations we outlined at the time.  Certainly the work programmes that were laid out were not completed and, for that reason, I am <Col N="231" /> concerned as to the value of such committees. However, I do not rule them out.</P>
    <P>In the Programme for Government I considered ways in which we could reform the workings of this House.  I accept that such reform is necessary. Deputy Quinn read into the record many of the aspects of that programme.  Some points in it were referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, of which I was honoured to be a member for many years, and these issues will be teased out in that committee.  I argued eight years ago when I was Government Whip and a member of that committee, as did Deputy Quinn when he was Whip of his party and later when he was Minister, and also Deputy Seán Barrett, that it was best to deal with this matter not at committee level but in the House.  It was suggested that committees be set up to deal with Committee Stage of Bills, and, again, that point is reflected in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>Another point raised is that we should be entitled to freer, short term debates in the House on major issues that affect us.  The proposals in the Programme for Government will allow the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to decide on how best that can be done and whether we can make progress in this regard.  If useful committees are to be set up we should consider the points in the Programme for Government and take them up in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  In that way these issues can be dealt with and progress can be made.</P>
    <P>The motion put before me yesterday evening for examination and response and put before the House by the Deputies opposite has underlying it a basic contention with which I do not disagree, that is the idea that valuable contributions to the formulation of public policy in vital areas of national life can and must be made by Members of the Oireachtas.  I feel strongly, as I think do all my colleagues in Government, that elected representatives in their daily work can tap a wider range of experience and opinion than any other group in the State and <Col N="232" /> that evaluating, distilling and articulating that volume of opinion must have a recognised place in our political and parliamentary system.  Deputy Quinn made that point although he feels that Government Ministers, because of their heavy workload &mdash; which is the case regardless of who is in power &mdash; are remote from the decisions of ordinary people, but I do not accept that.</P>
    <P>Despite my feelings on this point, I disagree with the motion because the form in which it is put forward underrates the value and effectiveness of the contribution which is made, and continues to be made, on the floor of this House by Deputies of all parties and the degree to which those contributions influence the operation of Government in all areas of public policy and administration. The motion proposes the creation of an Oireachtas committee with a remit so widely defined as to ensure that no area of national life falls outside its purview.  What it seeks to do is set up a body which would oversee not the work of a single Minister or a single coherent area of Government but of our entire political system.  We already have such a body, called Dáil Éireann, which carries out that work.  What the Labour Party seek to do is to assign to a small body of no fewer than 18 Deputies and Senators a substantial part of the functions which belong to all Members of this House. This is not a measure to enhance the powers of the House, as some speakers pretend; it is a proposal that the House hand over a most fundamental part of its functions to a committee.</P>
    <P>Even if this House were predisposed to abdicate its responsibilities in the manner proposed by the motion and agree to the creation of the committee, we are faced with the question of how workable the new machinery could be.  How would it mesh with the operation of other committees of this House?  It would impinge on many of the committees whose establishment I was involved in some time ago. How would it impinge on the operation of the Government to which this House has entrusted the affairs of the country?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> My contention is that the terms of reference of the committee have been so widely drafted that if established on the basis proposed it would regard itself as entitled to trespass on the remit of all the other committees established to look at specific and identified problem areas of public administration.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that such a committee would be unwieldy and unworkable, that we on this side of the House feel constrained to oppose an amendment to this motion.  Our amendment takes account of the desire to increase the involvement of Members of the House in the detailed shaping of legislation, as referred to by Deputy Quinn, and in teasing out in the fullest way possible the implications for the community of the specific details of proposed laws.  It also makes provision for the revision of arrangements introduced by this Government to ensure that the views of Deputies on matters of topical concern can be placed on the record promptly.  I acknowledge what Deputy Quinn has said, that the proposal goes a considerable way towards solving the problem but does not go all the way.</P>
    <P>This Government have shown their commitment to the enhancement of the role of the Oireachtas in the field of legislation and examination of governmental activities in a practical way &mdash; the number of topics which can be discussed in the House as a result of the alteration in the Adjournment debate arrangements has been increased and allows Members to deal promptly with matters of topical concern while the institution of broadcasting from the Houses of the Oireachtas has enabled the concern of legislators with the issues of the day to be literally brought home to the constituents. We have also established a new committee to assist Members to reflect public concern with crime and other matters under discussions.  Under our new Programme for Government, we have committed ourselves to enhancing the role of the Dáil through a series of specific measures.  We have in particular indicated our support for a procedure which will allow suitable Bills to be dealt with <Col N="234" /> on Committee Stage by a selection committee.</P>
    <P>While I was in opposition I raised this issue, and I know Members of the Opposition have been calling for it for some time.  We are making arrangements to allow urgent topical matters to be deal with.  I know Deputy Seán Barrett has raised this issue in the House for many years whenever Dáil reform was discussed.</P>
    <P>The first of these arrangements will allow a greater and perhaps more productive involvement by Members of this House in what may seem to be the minutiae of legislation; but, as most of us have cause to realise, the small details of legislation, the manner in which a statutory phrase is deployed, can have significent impact on the lives and activities of those we represent.  The sceptics may argue that legislation and concern with economic and social affairs are different elements of the parliamentarians task, but a look at the thrust of legislation which has come before this House in recent years highlights the difficulty of drawing a meaningful distinction between legislation which has a social economic effect or dimension and that which has not.  Our concerns as legislators are primarily with domestic policy and with those aspects of European affairs which bear on our industry, agriculture or social affairs.  The difficulty of drawing such a distinction is underlined in what I may describe as the preamble to the proposals put before us which refer to these areas &mdash; unemployment, housing, health and education.  Give a committee this wide ranging remit and what business is there left for the rest of the House.</P>
    <P>The second of these proposals is designed to improve existing mechanisms available to this House to discuss matters of topical concern.  In making those improvements a consultative process will be involved to which the Members, through their Whips, will be able to contribute and their exprience of the working of the present arrangements for short debates drawn on to devise improvements for the year ahead.  I think we are all aware that the existing arrangements <Col N="235" /> were not intended exclusively to enable Members to mount fire brigade exercises on matters affecting their constituencies but to allow topics of wider concern in areas of evolving policy to be discussed.</P>
    <P>The range of topics indicated in tonight's motion suggests that the coming review might profitably focus on how best these arrangements should be modified to ensure frequent debates on economic and social policies, including detailed examination of reports from various bodies, such as the NESC and the ESRI, and to provide members of the House with enhanced possibilities for voicing their views on economic and social policies including the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>My own belief is that any perceived restriction on a Deputy's scope to contribute to the public discussion of these topics can be more readily and properly removed by the mechanisms I have outlined to enhance his or her scope to make points on the floor of the House or participating in the detailed scrutiny of legislative proposals than by establishing the &ldquo;catch all&rdquo; forum with limited membership envisaged in the motion.  This is the positive case for the amendment we are proposing to the motion.</P>
    <P>No doubt the proponents of this motion will represent their initiative as indicating their concern for a wide range of socio-economic issues as Deputy Higgins has outlined.  I find it hard to credit that the Deputies proposing this motion really believe the committee which they propose could possibly promote advancement in any of the many areas they would encompass.  There will be a cross-over into the work of the existing committee, on which Members worked hard and diligently. The committee envisaged lacks any coherence or clarity of purpose.  In attempting to consider and make recommendations on the entire spectrum of economic affairs, it will inevitably collapse under the sheer weight of the task. If we are honest we all know about the difficulties in the management of committees.</P>
    <P>I negotiated with Deputy Bruton in <Col N="236" /> 1983 and it was agreed that the work of the committees would be reviewed on an ongoing basis but, frankly, that has not been done.  We tended to build on the existing committees.  However in the Programme for Government we allow for an examination of the committees to see what committees should be retained.  In the indepth discussions on 1992 I do not rule out that amendments would be taken but we should not add to the committee list until that review is undertaken.  The committee proposed in tonight's motion fails palpably to fulfil these requirements. Instead it is an appalling mish-mash of organisational theory which would not achieve any worthwhile purpose.  Certainly the proposed committee would do scant justice to the wide range of weighty matters which it is suggested it should consider.</P>
    <P>I would have the gravest doubts about the merits of establishing this or indeed any committee on a statutory basis.  This would mark a decisive change from long established practice.  As things stand, no Oireachtas committee is so established. Even the long standing Committee on Public Accounts is not statutorily based but is established under Dáil Standing Orders.  I do not believe in unnecessary legislation.  Oireachtas Joint Committees should be established &mdash; and indeed abolished &mdash; on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in response to the evolving perceptions of the Oireachtas on the issues which are currently appropriate for consideration at such a forum.  I can see no justification for the creation of unnecessary rigidities by the establishment of any committees on a statutory basis; in any area such as this flexibility is an important requirement.</P>
    <P>The functions envisaged for the proposed committee leave me with a decided sense of unease for a whole range of reasons.  Let us examine them one by one.  The first function is to review economic and social policy from time to time. I cannot see any Oireachtas committee operating satisfactorily with such a wide remit.  At any given time there would be such a range of topical current issues which would fall into these categories <Col N="237" /> that the committee would inevitably spread their resources far too thinly to allow for any meaningful review to be undertaken.  In my view, Oireachtas committees are most needed to look into areas which the Oireachtas, because of pressure of other work, is precluded from considering in sufficient detail.</P>
    <P>I think that most Members of this House would agree that as things stand, the Oireachtas spends a very considerable amount of its time debating matters of economic and social concern. There are regular formal opportunities for such discussion provided by the lengthy debates on the Estimates, the budget, the Finance Bill, the Appropriation Bill, Question Time and Private Members' Business.</P>
    <P>Most of the time of this House is spent on issues raised in this motion.  We have the opportunity to raise issues of agriculture, housing, health, education and economic and social matters during the debate on Bills, at Question Time, Private Notice Questions and on Adjournment debates.  We have indicated in the Programme for Government that we are prepared to consider the reorganisation of the working of this House. Deputy Quinn acknowledges this point.</P>
    <P>The second function envisaged for the committee is to examine in detail the reports from various bodies such as the NESC and the ESRI.  Anyone who has ever read a report from either the NESC or the ESRI will readily acknowledge that they are consistently well presented and always incorporate, where appropriate, clearly enunciated proposals and recommendations.  They do not in my view lend themselves to the type of minute scrutiny by a committee of selected parliamentarians which is envisaged in the motion.  These reports frequently deal with a single topic &mdash; often one with relevance to the area of responsibility of a single Minister.</P>
    <P>Some such reports attract a deal of media attention which often includes elaboration and criticism of their conclusions by experts and commentators in the field concerned.  Deputies, and I have <Col N="238" /> some experience of this, may express their views on such reports in several ways: they may pose questions to Ministers on their reaction to such reports at Question Time or in the annual discussions on a departmental Estimate; they may pursue contentious elements, where relevant, through the evidence taking mechanisms of existing committees &mdash; be it the Committee on State-sponsored Bodies, the PAC, the Committee on Women's Affairs, the Select Committee on Crime and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges; or if they regard the span of public attention on the topics concerned as limited, they can ventilate their views in the form of motions during Private Members' Time or during the Adjournment debates. Given the range of commenting options open to Deputies, it is doubtful whether any contribution can be made by another committee in this area.</P>
    <P>The next proposed function is to deal with legislation on Committee Stage as the Dáil may from time to time decide. What is envisaged here is definitely worth considering, but I am not entirely certain what is intended.  Is it envisaged that Committee Stage of all legislation which touches on the entire range of social and economic affairs should be so considered? The Government are sympathetic to the motion that appropriate legislation be referred to a select committee, and I think that I have outlined that.  The House may, indeed, as the motion implies, be less inclined to utilise the mechanisms available to it to have specific legislation considered by committees rather than the whole House.  I think that all of us will admit that Members are perfectly happy to make worthwhile contributions on the scope and thrust of certain legislation generally but find that they have less enthusiasm for teasing out the possibilities inherent in the phrases in a section or subsection whereby the draftsman gives expression to the intentions of the particular Minister. The use of special committees on legislation has the advantage of removing discussion on those items from the limited time available for discussion on the <Col N="239" /> floor of the House, thus allowing a fuller and more technical discussion on them. It also has the advantage of allowing that particular task to be assigned to Members selected because of their known interest or experience of the problems reflected in the Bill.  I think we have done that to great effect with at least two or three Bills in the life of the current Dáil.  To my Labour Party colleagues I say that I agree with that proposal wholeheartedly.  It is in the Programme for Government and there is no difficulty with it.</P>
    <P>What is proposed in paragraph 6 of the motion would, I grant, remove discussion on Committee Stage or in special committees and assign it to a fixed team of members rather than a hand-picked group.  We have seen the advantage of a hand-picked group over a fixed committee with two of Deputy Shatter's Bills where that worked very successfully.  I put that forward as a system which has worked well and which could perhaps be extended.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposals, as I have stated, as set out in the new Programme for Government satisfy any requirement to preserve the time of the House as a whole at least as effectively as the proposals outlined.  It is a clear improvement on them in terms of ensuring that the Members dealing with Committee Stage of a particular Bill have a proven interest in it.  More important, the Government's proposals ensure that the diverse talents of all Members of the House, whether they be front benchers or backbenchers, are more likely to be drawn on in the course of a session than are the proposals put forward in the unamended motion.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the particular advantage offered by the Government's proposal, the Labour Party's motion contained a procedural change which cannot be made.  I just ask the Labour Party to consider it.  I presume that it is just a drafting error that has been made, so I shall not argue it out.</P>
    <P>The fourth proposed function is to receive submissions from the social partners and other interested groups on matters concerning the creation of <Col N="240" /> employment and wealth and on the rights of workers and unemployed persons. There can be no objection to interest groups seeking to communicate their views to Members of the Oireachtas. Indeed, many such groups already systematically canvass Deputies on topics of interest to them and bring their views to attention through submissions, lobbying and presentations.  That is something that happens every day, whether one is in Government or in Opposition.  I am doubtful that even advertisements soliciting views on economic and social issues generally would bring to light anything likely to add to the sum of parliamentary knowledge.  If we went along with this proposal, what would be the result in terms of the action needed to improve employment or wealth creation? The Oireachtas is the Legislature; the Government, not the Dáil, is charged with carrying legislation and public policy into effect.  That is a point we have to remember.  To have a practical impact, the committee would have to convey the views they received to the Government.</P>
    <P>My time in Government has taught me some realities: first, no group with an idea it wants translated into governmental action misses a chance to communicate it to Ministers or the Government; and, second, no Deputy convinced by a constituent, a group &mdash; whether they be a lobby group or an interest group of any kind &mdash; or a contact, that he has a solution to some national or local problem fails to find a means of bringing it promptly to ministerial attention either on the floor of the House or through representations, delegations or deputations.  As things stand, numerous groups make submissions &mdash; both written and oral &mdash; to the Government.  Every year Government Ministers meet with and consider proposals from a wide range of interest groups.  The Government consider that this process represents an important contribution towards the formulation of economic and social policy.</P>
    <P>What worthwhile role could an Oireachtas committee play in that matter?  Clearly, all that the proposed <Col N="241" /> committee could do would be to bring the matters raised to the attention of the Government, as groups and individual Deputies already do.  In essence, what would be involved would be the creation of a new, needless layer of mediation that would serve only to create an artificial barrier between the Government and various interest groups.  Deputy Quinn made many good points, but I think that he argues against himself because &mdash; as Deputy Noonan would certainly know from his capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce through the years &mdash; a number of bodies come to the Government and if a Minister is too busy in other affairs and cannot keep in touch, he or she is at least kept informed by the lobby groups, who have a right to bring their requirements and their arguments before a Government Minister.  To leave all of that to a committee would certainly create the barrier about which I think Deputy Quinn has an argument.  I know, as every Minister for Finance knows, what is required between now and budget day in early January and of the number of bodies and groups to meet both officials and Government members.  That position applies not to one Department but to most Departments of Government.</P>
    <P>The fifth proposed function is that the committee would make detailed recommendations from time to time to the Government and the Oireachtas on the creation of employment and wealth and all related matters.  The issues of employment creation and the generation of wealth are undeniably of paramount importance and urgency in the context of the country's economic development.  I do not deny that many Members of the Oireachtas have valuable contributions to make in that regard.  The essence of a successful committee is that the Members, while allowing for personal opinions, should be able to work together to achieve a consensus on the matter under consideration.  Issues of employment and wealth creation are at the heart of the ideological divide in this country, as elsewhere.  I promise Deputy Higgins to try to deal with some of the issues that <Col N="242" /> he raised.  I accept that perhaps he has some arguments on the matter; we have had this argument across the House before on the rising tide and other issues and perhaps some of his arguments over the years have proved to hold some weight.  In a different job from my job in the Labour portfolio, in which I did hear some of those arguments, perhaps I should now try to look at those arguments from another point of view.  The Deputy has been consistent on what he has said from 1987, so I shall certainly listen to the points that he has made strongly and consistently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That last function &mdash; because time is moving on &mdash; ascribed to the proposed committee is that it would commission reports and employ consultants as required.  I accept that any Oireachtas committee is conscious of its need to have impartial advice on tap so that it can heighten the degree of expertise it brings to bear on the examination of the public service or public policy.  I sometimes worry that Deputies once they get on a committee are not inclined to underestimate their own ability to probe deeply into complex problems and are perhaps over-impressed by the possible contributions that some outside bodies can make.  The ERSI and the NESC, as things stand, are entitled to engage the services of consultants, and they do.  As these organisations have been established to examine issues of social and economic importance, the engagement of further consultants involves a duplication of their efforts.  Many other Government agencies and bodies do bring in consultants and, I think, are encouraged by Governments to do so when the need arises, therefore I am not too sure that we need to start overdoing it in committee, although this very day I have been dealing with a committee of the House which requires the services of consultants on a particular aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, a general point about the proposed committee that must <Col N="243" /> not be lost sight of.  Experience throughout Europe has been that committees work most effectively when their work is targeted towards a recognised and clearly defined area of activity.  We have in general avoided the establishment of committees which simply mirrored the activities of a single Department.  Indeed, the arguments against such a close alignment between committee and ministerial portfolio are clear.  We have achieved the focus which other countries obtain by having such an alignment by ensuring that the responsibilities of our committees are clearly defined on the basis of their subject matter.  Our committees have, within those parameters, operated with considerable and growing effectiveness and each has developed modes of operation which the Members believe most suitable to their particular task.  In general the nature of the tasks entrusted to those committees has allowed Members, irrespective of their party allegiance, to reach consensus on the subjects of their study and to work together with a common purpose.  This characteristic and the practical benefits which flow from it is one which we would all wish to maintain in any extension or development of the committee system.</P>
    <P>Apart from its wideness, the remit envisaged in the Labour Party's motion for this new committee seems to us on this side of the House to run counter to this trend.  Divergent views on the manner in which the economy should develop or on the wisdom of specific initiatives in the social areas exist in this House: they are strongly held and do not lend themselves to easy synthesis or consensus.  I see no grounds for thinking that a committee of 18 or fewer parliamentarians licensed exclusively to examine the difficulties we have encountered will sort out those difficulties and fundamental differences.  My fear is that, by turning an area of proven and accepted contentiousness over to a committee, by asking them to undertake what cannot realistically be done, we would be building in to our committee system serious contention, possibly altering the <Col N="244" /> consensual culture of our existing committees who have served us so well and in whom I perceive much value.  So far I have taken this motion at face value and rather than create another Oireachtas Committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While in no way wishing to diminish the significance of, or Government commitment to, improving the social and economic problems we are experiencing, I must repudiate the implication in the motion that the Government are not grappling with these problems in a vigorous, effective manner.</P>
      <P>Total employment this year to date has been higher than even the high level achieved in 1990, as demonstrated by the strong increase in employment-related revenues.  For example, receipts from PAYE to the end of September, and from the training and employment level up to mid-October, were up by 8.2 per cent and 6.7 per cent respectively over the corresponding period last year.  The increase in unemployment has not been the result of a reduction in employment levels.  Rather it is related largely to the cessation or reversal of emigration. While that does not account for all of the problem it does to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are committed to achieving further significant improvements in the employment area.  Deputy M. Higgins raised the question of a task force on employment with me in a debate in this House about a year ago.  We must bring together the various sectors of industry in an endeavour to formulate proposals which if not successful at least constitute a desirable attempt.  That point was taken in the course of the discussions on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> I think it was Deputy M. Higgins who was the first to raise that matter in the House.  It is my hope that <Col N="245" /> such efforts will be successful.  However, because of the growth in the labour force the unemployment picture will remain difficult for some time to come.  For that reason the Government are determined to continue the approach which has already begun to yield fruit, and that approach is underpinned by the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The Government believe it is only through co-operation with the social partners, with the support of this House, that economic progress and employment creation can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the contention that unemployment will reach a figure of 300,000 next year.  That is a very pessimistic estimate, a figure that assumes a large fall in employment which is not realistic on the basis of the most up-to-date data.  Whatever problems the Government have had &mdash; or the even greater ones attributed to them by hostile commentators &mdash; we have never relaxed our efforts to deal with them.  We will continue to do so and will not be distracted from that task by suggestions of simple solutions such as those embodied in the motion before the House.  A number of segments of this motion form part of the Programme for Government. The others can be discussed in the light of changes in the committee structure suggested in the Programme for Government at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have already taken the opportunity to congratulate the Minister in the House.  I should like to congratulate the Minister of State present and wish him well in his capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Finance.  I know him fairly well.  He has been a hard-working, dedicated backbencher for a long time. He comes from a very good political tradition in south Kerry where his mother was a very popular woman.  Indeed, many women play a part in his political life. For example, his wife can make a great input from another very strong political tradition in the Labour Party in west Cork.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First, the Fine Gael Party will support the motion of the Labour Party unamended.  Our opening position is that we consider it does not go far enough in terms of our having a useful committee.  However, we will not quibble about its detail and will be voting for it tomorrow evening.</P>
      <P>There is now a need for a very strong political structure in this House.  Sometimes people draw comparisons with what is happening right across Europe, which is relevant also.  It seems to me that, in Parliaments around the world, there is a conflict between the Executive &mdash; the Cabinet &mdash; and the Parliament. The opening position from the point of view of the Executive is that they want to take all decisions and treat the Parliament as a rubber stamp.  The opening position from the point of view of the Parliament is that they want to scrutinise and have power over the Executive, allowing the Executive to act only under their authorisation.  They are the two opening poles of the conflict between power-sharing between parliaments and executives.  Of course one always must be a balance to the other.  Clearly parliaments serve the function of balancing the power of government.  Various countries have found the balancing point somewhere along that line or spectrum, but we are too far at one end of the scale; in our scale the Parliament is more or less a rubber stamp.  Our Cabinet has operated for a long time as the only decision-making body, the only executive authority.  Quite frequently, our Parliament has been reduced not only under the Constitution and the law but also under the procedures of this House to simply having a function of stamping the decisions of the Executive, sometimes even doing that without scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That arises from the 1937 Constitution in that its main instigator, the late President de Valera, envisaged a Constitution for majority governments.  In cases of clear-cut majority governments, <Col N="247" /> especially looking back into his political past &mdash; in which there were Cumann na nGaedheal Governments in the twenties and Fianna Fáil Governments thereafter &mdash; he foresaw circumstances in which one majority Government would replace another majority Government, Fine Gael and Labour on the one hand and Fianna Fáil on the other.  The rules and arrangements are laid down for majority Governments.  Over the past 23 years we had a majority Government here from 1977 to 1981 only.  Looking at it historically &mdash; if I may be permitted a political barb &mdash; probably it was the worst Government we had, with a huge majority, that of former Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch.</P>
    <P>I do not think our arrangements necessarily are the best for coalition or minority Governments.  Yet over the past 23 years to a very large extent that is what we have had.  Many of the crises which arise here &mdash; we have seen them over the past couple of months and we saw them when we were in power &mdash; arise from the fact that coalition or minority Governments, in their perception, have total power and only need the Parliament to stamp their actions.  Then, on a given night, the Parliament rebels and there is no time for an accommodation to be made with the Parliament.  Therefore, we saw on budget night in 1981 two Deputies hesitate in the lobbies and, because they wavered, and went one way rather than the other, the Government fell.  We witnessed this time and again, where the Parliament did not have time to consider the action it was taking over a period and certainly did not have time to negotiate its way out of the trouble.  I have seen it on a number of occasions, again going through the lobbies, when Deputies said; &ldquo;we are going to cause an election but we have no alternative.&rdquo;  It happened even on nights when they did not cause elections.</P>
    <P>If we want to rule our country as modern European countries are ruled, it seems that coalition or minority Governments will be more the norm than one party majority Governments.  It follows <Col N="248" /> that we should make arrangements in Parliament to allow them to work.  That is the strongest argument for an effective committee system.  It is only through such a system that the fundamental differences between the parties, even within one Government, and between parties on all sides of the House can be resolved in the spirit of compromise so that an unimportant detail of policy does not plunge the country into the chaos of an election when nobody wants one.</P>
    <P>Such an arrangement would have to go further than this motion proposes.  The traffic envisaged in the motion is one way. A committee of this House consisting of 18 Members would examine all sorts of things and receive submissions and then advise the Government on the basis of the advice they had taken or the reports they had gone into in detail.  There should be traffic in the other direction as well. There has to be a procedure where the Government would lay the general principles of their decision before a committee so that the committee would have a say before the final decisions were taken.</P>
    <P>I have in mind the Estimates, which will probably be published before the Christmas recess.  They will probably be debated by way of a &ldquo;take note&rdquo; motion on which statements will be made and there may or may not be a vote at the end. Members will be voting on the totality of the Estimate.  I do not believe there is a single Deputy who is totally opposed to the total Estimate, nor do I believe there is a Deputy on the Government side who is totally committed to the whole Estimate yet half will vote against the whole Estimate and the other half will vote for it.</P>
    <P>While the powers of the Minister for Finance derive from the Constitution and consequently cannot be interfered with in this House, an intermediate arrangement could be made.  The Minister could decide the overall figures, the current budget deficit, the EBR and the whole package in terms of gross and net figures, but the House would have the authority to vary it.  I cannot see anything wrong with a committee of this House or the <Col N="249" /> whole House in Committee deciding, for example, that they wanted to spend more money on primary education rather than some other aspect of education or that money in the Health budget should be moved to community care in order to keep people out of institutions.  I do not see that the Government would be embarrassed, lose face or be in any way less effective if all Deputies were involved in the detailed perusal of the Estimates, while agreeing that in the final analysis macro-policy must be in the hands of the Minister and must be the responsibility of Government.  The detail of policy could be worked out and improved by a mechanism which would allow a contribution from all sides.</P>
    <P>We had a minority Fine Gael Government in 1981 and a minority Fianna Fáil Government in 1982.  Under minority or Coalition Governments many of the crises which result from the big bang theory of Government, where Deputies must march through the lobby when they hear the bell, would be ruled out if we had a proper committee system.  That is the strongest argument for it.  It involves a shift of power from the Executive to Parliament, not necessarily concerning matters of principle but of detail. Parliamentarians are the best authority on detail.  This is where the influence of the constituent comes in.  In my clinics I do not get advice on the grand principles of running the economy, but I hear about the small problems which illustrate the flaws in the system.  There should be an opportunity for Deputies to influence decision making in that manner.</P>
    <P>Political parties are far more complex now than they were in 1937 when Mr. de Valera drew up the Constitution.  In 1937 there was still a small and undivided Labour Party, although it divided very early in the war.  The two big blocs were Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, whose identity largely came from the national movement and the split in 1922.  There was a coherence of attitude within the big parties which made it possible for their leaders in a Cabinet to represent their views fully.  Parties now are structured in a complex fashion, having within them many <Col N="250" /> individual views, sometimes moving in the same direction but sometimes in conflict. There must be an outlet for the complexity of views within political parties. Effective committee systems would be important in resolving such problems.</P>
    <P>We have heard time and again that the House is not relevant to the needs of the people, that people lack confidence in the Government and in politicians.  The institutions within which we work are not responsive to our own needs or to the needs of the people we represent.  A movement towards a committee system is the best way of resolving the problem.</P>
    <P>I suggest this very short and rather minor analysis as an illustration of why many of the European countries are ruled very effectively by coalitions.  They have a system of parliamentary committees which lends itself to that form of Government. For many years we have been swimming against the wind and the tide. Institutions which were geared under the Constitution for somebody who had single party majority Government in mind are being forced to accommodate a different reality in the eighties and nineties. We should move to accommodate the new reality and find a new point on the scale between the powers of the Executive and the powers of Parliament. We are fairly familiar with the strong committee system in the United States. A President has to negotiate a budget through the Congress, in circumstances where he represents the Republican Party, normally a minority party in the Congress.</P>
    <P>I cannot see anything wrong with a budget promulgated here in the first week of January which would not have to pass through the House until the last week of that month.  The Minister for Finance could read out the budget, which would become the property of the House in Committee or of a committee of the House, with the power to recommend variations to the Minister.  There would have to be some arrangements about bonded warehouses and so on in respect of excise orders.  Apart from that, there is not a fundamental problem in moving towards a real committee system to <Col N="251" /> accommodate the needs of the community through the complex representation in Parliament, while at the same time giving an outlet for the talent in the various political parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to close the Rathduff cheese making factory on 20 December next with the loss of almost 70 jobs.  This cheese making plant which has been in operation for almost 30 years has produced a first-class commodity which has won awards for quality and perfection of product.  The success of this plant has been due in no small way to the workforce who have given sterling service to the company for over a generation. Many full-time and temporary workers used their skill and expertise in the manufacture of a product which has won acclaim throughout the world.  The decision to close such a plant with the loss of almost 70 jobs and invaluable expertise on the basis of rationalisation is surely shortsighted, particularly in the present climate where the manufacture of food products is probably one of the most important areas for growth and job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closure of this invaluable plant will have a devastating effect not just on the workers and their families but on the entire area.  Areas such as Whitechurch, Grenagh, Breen, Donaughamore, Carrignavar, Blarney and Mourneabbey will all suffer in the process.  The communities which have been built up in the area over the past 30 years will be seriously affected.  Young people and school leavers will be denied an opportunity of work and will be forced to emigrate.  The knock-on effect of such a closure will be detrimental to various businesses such as local pubs and small shops that are dependent on the plant for survival. Indeed, the effects of the closure will <Col N="252" /> be felt far and wide and Rathduff will become a ghost village.</P>
    <P>Last June 170 jobs were lost in Western Digital in the Dublin Hill area of Cork which is a stone's throw from Rathduff. An additional 240 jobs have been lost in this plant as of this evening.  There is the prospect of another 60 job losses a few miles down the road before Christmas. The constituency of Cork North Central has been devastated by unemployment with unemployment levels of 75 per cent and 80 per cent in some areas.</P>
    <P>Last year the workers at this plant were informed that an alternative industry would be bought in an attempt to save the jobs at Rathduff.  I believe there has been no news yet about an alternative industry despite the fact that an American firm recently showed interest in the plant.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to appeal to the Minister, taking into consideration the grave implications the closure of this plant will have on the community, to examine the situation in conjunction with the IDA and any other relevant bodies with a view to keeping the plant open until such time as an alternative industry is found so that an area already crippled by unemployment and emigration can be given some hope for the future.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank my colleague, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, for raising this matter.  I endorse what he has said about the workforce in the Rathduff cheese factory. Over the years these superb workers built up a fine name for themselves and the product they produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood that Dairygold has decided to discontinue the manufacture of cheddar at its Rathduff factory. Approximately 65 people will be affected, about half of whom were seasonally employed.  Unions representing the employees were informed of this decision on 15 November.  Regrettably no alternative enterprise could be found for the plant.  However, Dairygold has indicated to the trade unions its flexibility and willingness to find alternative <Col N="253" /> employment within the society for the workers from Rathduff.  A successful redundancy package already agreed with the trade unions in the context of amalgamation will be available to those who do not wish to avail of offers of alternative employment from the society.</P>
    <P>At present the Irish dairy sector includes almost 40 plants which are licensed to process milk.  Since accession to the European Community the industry has developed into a modern, high-technology industry.  Our success can be gauged, in particular, by the record export levels achieved by the industry which reached a peak of almost £1.483 billion in 1989.  However, prior to the recent developments in the sector, the processing structure of the industry had remained virtually unchanged for many years.</P>
    <P>The position of the Rathduff cheese factory within the context of the amalgamation of Ballyclough and Mitchelstown Co-ops must be viewed as part of the rationalisation process which the Irish dairy sector is currently experiencing.</P>
    <P>Until recently emphasis in the industry had been on investment in plant and equipment in order to process continually increasing milk supplies.  However, the introduction of the Community's quota system in 1984 required a fundamental change in approach by the industry.  The key aims of the industry must now include the rationalisation of their processing facilities and the development of both their product range and market outlets.</P>
    <P>The ICOS in their 1987 document <i>A Strategy for the Irish Dairy Industry</i> recommended the establishment of three milk processing units.  Similarly, the IDA and the Department of Agriculture and Food in their paper <i>A Future in Food,</i> also published in 1987, stressed that the future prosperity of the industry lies in rationalisation.</P>
    <P>The Irish dairy industry has to achieve the economies of scale necessary to compete in the post-1992 market.  The heavy reliance on the intervention outlet for both butter and skim milk powder underlines the vulnerability of our industry and <Col N="254" /> emphasises yet again the need for change and expansion of our product portfolio. Such expansion can only be achieved in the context of a rationalised and efficient industry with the scale to achieve results in the main consumer markets for dairy products.  The general record of the Irish dairy industry to date, with a few notable exceptions, indicates how difficult a task this can be.</P>
    <P>The closure of the Rathduff factory has to be judged in this context.  The reorganisation of the industry now taking place should, in the medium-term, maximise employment opportunities in a more competitive processing structure within the industry.  In view of current pressures on the entire industry, it has to be accepted that existing structures need to be flexible and dynamic to take account of the ever more competitive climate worldwide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this case on behalf of a hapless Liberian national who has been in custody in our prisons since 25 June last, having committed no crime other than to seek hospitality and asylum in this State. I should also like to thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Flood, for being present to reply to the debate.  I hope he will carry my earnest plea for the release of this man at the earliest possible opportunity back to the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The case of Mr. Ben Marti Doe is yet another sad indictment of the way the Department of Justice treat aliens.  Mr. Ben Marti Doe arrived at Shannon Airport on 25 June of this year on a flight from Jamaica.  He sought to claim asylum in this country at Shannon Airport but instead was put in prison.  There is still no clear indication of when his case will finally be determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Ben Marti Doe who is a Liberian citizen fled from the Ivory Coast during a most vicious civil war in that country. He states that his wife, two children and <Col N="255" /> mother were killed when their house was bombed.  He further states that his father was killed earlier by Government gunmen in the course of the internecine struggle which occurred in his home country of Liberia.</P>
    <P>In seeking asylum in Ireland, what crime has Ben Marti Doe committed? Why must he remain in prison?  The treatment Mr. Doe received from the Department of Justice has been truly appalling and, in many ways inhuman.  Mr Doe was taken from Shannon Airport and placed in Limerick prison after a brief interview with a detective sergeant pending an investigation of his case.  The Department of Justice informed him that he was to be deported a week later but this failed because of the refusal of an airline pilot to take him on board a flight back to Jamaica.  He was again placed in detention.</P>
    <P>The point has to be made here that Mr. Doe did not gain temporary admission into the country and then refuse to leave, or go into hiding, or do what many other foreigners and aliens do.  He arrived on a plane from Jamaica and immediately made himself known to the authorities in Shannon and made his case clear &mdash; he was seeking asylum.  It is regrettable that the Department of Justice do not seem to have in place standard procedures to deal with people like him.</P>
    <P>Up to the point when he was put back in detention after an attempt was made to deport him, Mr. Doe had not been informed that he could seek legal advice or support or that he could contact the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.  An attempt was made to deport a man from this country without following the basic procedures laid down by the UNHCR and his Irish legal representatives have argued in court that the Department of Justice were in breach of their own agreed procedures in this area made in 1985.  He has secured a review by the Minister for Justice of his original expulsion order after two applications to the High Court seeking protection for his basic rights were made on his behalf by solicitors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> The case again highlights the appalling manner in which Ireland treats aliens. There have been many cases of concern at the methods of operation of the aliens section of the Department of Justice acting in a high handed way to people from Third World countries.  It would be difficult to imagine a citizen of the United States of America or of Australia being treated like Mr. Doe.  Our Government like to boast to the world about our fine democratic system, but clearly these are not intended to apply to aliens who find their way here.  Surely we should apply to aliens what we seek for our own citizens forced to live as aliens in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>The main points I wish to raise are the need for the Department of Justice to put in place a procedure that is based on the principles laid down by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the Council of Europe, a system that would ensure that all applying for refugee status would be informed that they can have legal advice and support and that they can contact the Office of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in London.</P>
    <P>In the case of Mr. Ben Marti Doe I appeal to the Department of Justice to release him from prison as soon as possible, perhaps, on some form of bail, he can regularly report to a Garda station until the Minister has enough evidence to make a final judgment on his case or the situation in Liberia settles down. Here I echo what the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in London said in regard to the position of Mr. Doe in a letter received by the Minister in October 1991.  Having said that they cannot obtain enough evidence to finally determine the case one way or the other, they said:</P>
    <P>I wish to reiterate that in UNHCR's view it would not be appropriate to return now Mr. Doe to Liberia against his will, considering the situation prevailing in the country at the moment. Accordingly, UNHCR would appreciate if Mr. Doe were allowed to remain <Col N="257" /> in Ireland until the situation in Liberia has sufficiently improved. </P>
    <P>I cannot put the matter any clearer than that.  I join with the UNHCR and ask the Department to treat this individual with humanity, to release him from prison and allow him to remain in this country, at least until matters resolve themselves in Liberia.</P>

      <P>The person mentioned arrived at Shannon on 25 June 1991.  Both he and a travelling companion had no identity documents and both applied for recognition as political refugees. The applications were considered and the Department of Justice consulted with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Both applications were refused.</P>
      <P>When the two persons were being placed on board an aircraft to leave the country, this person initially refused to travel, due to a dispute about seating arrangements.  When he agreed to travel the airline staff refused to take him as they considered that his behaviour could interfere with other passengers and possibly endanger the aircraft.  He then began High Court judicial review proceedings. These were settled on the basis that the case would be further considered.  The Department of Justice again consulted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and after considering their views, Mr. Doe was notified by letter, dated 30 August 1991, that his application was again refused. His legal representative once more obtained an injunction preventing his removal from the State.  This further action was settled on the basis that his application would again be considered and in the meantime he agreed to remain in custody.  Once more the Department of Justice consulted with the United Nations High Commissionor for Refugees and once more his application was refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that this application has been considered on three separate occasions by the Department of Justice, <Col N="258" /> each time in consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and on each occasion neither the Department nor the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees consider that he has advanced reasons which would entitle him to be granted refugee status under the Geneva Convention.  I might mention that he has given a number of mutual exclusive accounts of how he came to Ireland and that when any independent verificable statement was made in the accounts it proved to be a falsehood.</P>
    <P>Turning to his continued detention it is a fact that had he accepted the earlier negative findings in his case he would by now have been removed from the State. As I said earlier, part of the agreed settlement of the most recent High Court proceedings was that he agreed to remain in custody pending the outcome of the further review provided for in that settlement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise this particularly important matter.  Originally I was disappointed that the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications could not attend but in light of the facts I will present I am glad I have a Cork Minister to listen to them who will hopefully lend a sympathetic ear to the case I am about to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a letter dated 16 September <Col N="259" /> from the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Brennan, which was sent to the Communications Workers' Union and the chairman of An Post.  The contents of this letter were to form the basis for negotiations between the two sides in their efforts to put together an alternative viability plan for An Post.  The evidence I am about to present to the Minister will highlight clearly that An Post are in breach of the contents of this letter.</P>
    <P>The letter mandates both sides to enter into negotiations without &ldquo;significant reductions in the number of sub-post offices&rdquo;.  The reality is that since the date of issue of that letter, An Post have closed every sub-post office where the contract holder has died or voluntarily withdrawn. This is, in effect, implementation of the original viability plan which was rejected by the Minister, the Government and politicians on all sides of this House.  It is interesting to note that since 1984 An Post have closed a total of 120 sub-post offices in this manner.</P>
    <P>I understand that the report the Minister commissioned into the social consequences of widespread closure of sub-post offices has been completed and presented to him.  Is it the Minister's intention to publish this report?  In the interim, would he mandate An Post not to proceed with the closure of any sub-post office until time has been given to consider the contents of this report?</P>
    <P>In particular, may I bring to the Minister's attention the evidence of which I spoke earlier which proves An Post's disregard for the Minister's directive?  In the past months An Post have closed two sub-post offices with which I am familiar: one at Dominic Street, Galway, which had 420 weekly pension transactions and 220 child benefit transactions monthly &mdash; clearly a viable economic sub-post office; the second, with which I am more familiar, is the Kilmurry sub-post office in my own constituency.  This post office was run for many years by the recently deceased Mrs. Murphy who gave an excellent service to the surrounding community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> Kilmurry has a population of 500, and a seven-teacher national school with 220 pupils.  It is an attractive village with two shops, three pubs, two churches and even a museum.  Prior to the death of the postmistress she was told by management from An Post that her post office was economically viable and would survive a rationalisation plan by An Post.  Yet, within hours of her death, presumably procedures were put in place which effectively closed the door on Kilmurry sub-post office.  Whether or not this closure is forever rests with the Minister.  If the Minister's directive and his signature on this letter has any validity, the Minister must instruct An Post to reopen Kilmurry sub-post office.  The social argument for opening it is obvious &mdash; the convenience to old aged pensioners.  However, it is because this sub-post office is viable economically that its closure cannot be allowed.</P>
    <P>The original viability plan referred to the 600 least busy post offices serving an average of fewer than 50 customers each week and the viability plan proposed to close 550 sub post offices.  By the yardstick being used in the viability plan Kilmurry post office is clearly economically viable.  The original plan argued that a minimum of 50 transactions per week was necessary for economic viability.  Kilmurry post office had 50 old age pensioners cashing their weekly cheques, along with 14 other weekly social welfare payments and 60 monthly child benefit payments.  It was clearly an economically viable unit.  The future of this sub post office is in the hands of the Minister.  The Minister, as a Cork Minister, I am sure will give sympathetic consideration to the case I have presented.  I hope An Post will be mandated to reopen Kilmurry post office forthwith.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the Deputy's suggestion that An Post will not comply with the request in relation to the measures to be taken to restore the company to financial health. The company are fully aware of our views <Col N="261" /> in relation to the resolution of their financial difficulties.  In the course of a reply on the Adjournment Debate of 17 October 1991 in relation to an industrial dispute in An Post, the main initiatives which had been taken by the Minister regarding An Post recovery proposals were outlined.  One of these initiatives was a request to An Post to withdraw this viability plan which they produced, and replace it with a set of proposals designed to achieve a break-even by 1992.  The Minister, Deputy Brennan, insisted at that time that these proposals should exclude the question of the closure of some 500 sub post offices and the provision of roadside letter boxes.  Both management and unions are, at the Minister's request, participating in talks under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and consultants appointed by the Minister, Deputy Brennan are studying the socio-economic implications for rural communities of the closure of sub post offices and the provision of roadside letter boxes.  The consultants' report will be finalised shortly and their recommendations will be considered.</P>
      <P>In accordance with established procedures which pre-date the formation of An Post, the company continue to review the need for the continued operation of sub post offices when the postmaster or postmistress retires, resigns or dies.  To date this year, An Post has closed 17 sub post offices in accordance with that review procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise the issue of the regulation of investment advisers. The recent collapse of a number of investment firms, subsequent court cases and the subsequent major financial loss to clients highlights a substantial gap in the regulation of the investment services sector.  Any investment intermediary selling non-insurance products, such as unit trusts, is not obliged to satisfy any requirements in respect of the handling of client funds, the provision of bonds or the issue of appropriate documentation to clients.  It is not acceptable that individuals should be exposed in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consumers investing in life assurance products through insurance intermediaries have a reasonable level of protection following the enactment of the Insurance Act, 1989.  It is vital that equivalent protection is given to consumers investing through investment advisers in non-insurance investment products.  All investment intermediaries should be licensed through the Department of Finance or the Central Bank.  Powers should be available to prevent an investment company from trading if malpractice is discovered, and a compensation fund should be established through the licensing system to give some or all of the investors' finance a certain level of protection. Under present investment criteria there is every incentive for an Irish investor to invest in the UK or in some other European country where consumer protection exists.  This is an ironic situation, whereby the Government's failure to introduce regulations to protect investors implies that it is much more <Col N="263" /> important that they invest abroad rather than at home.  This is scandalous.  We badly need change.  I am calling on the Minister for Finance to introduce regulations immediately to protect the consumer in the financial services area and not allow this appalling cop-out in relation to clients' finances to be allowed to continue.</P>

      <P>When the Deputy raised this matter on 31 October, the Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, on behalf of the then Minister for Finance, confirmed that we do not yet have adequate controls in respect of certain investment activities, and she stressed the need to close the gaps in our present regulatory system so as to avoid the problems associated with the failure of investment intermediaries. Further regulation in this area will be required under the terms of the draft European Community Investment Services Directive which will set out the parameters for national legislation to follow. However, adoption of the Directive has been delayed by the complexity of the issues involved and the question of introducing supervisory arrangements here in advance of the adoption of the Directive is being considered as a matter of urgency.  There has already been consultation with the relevant industry interests to see what improvements are possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Insurance Act, 1989, regulates the activities of insurance brokers when dealing in insurance products and provides protection for consumers in relation to insurance products.  This legislation is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The non-insurance elements <Col N="264" /> of the activities of investment intermediaries &mdash; mainly the marketing of UCITs and unit trusts &mdash; are not, however, currently subject to regulation by any agency, no Minister has any regulatory responsibility and there is no required provision for investor compensation. It is far from satisfactory that the general public should be so at risk and I consider it appropriate that persons and firms providing an investmentn service to the public should be authorised and should have to satisfy supervisory requirements in respect of all their investment activities, not just in relation to insurance products.</P>
    <P>Discussions have been taking place with the various interests involved in this sector to reach agreement on an appropriate system of regulation.  Following on these helpful discussions, proposals are being formulated with the aim of achieving an effective and efficient regulatory system which will adequately safeguard consumer interests.</P>
    <P>It has already been announced that legislation is being prepared to change and update the regulation and supervision of the Irish Stock Exchange where investor compensation arrangements already exist.  The intention is that the Stock Exchange will be subject to the Central Bank as regulatory authority.</P>
    <P>No regulatory system, however efficient, will eliminate risk to the investor. I would like to urge people to think carefully before they entrust part of their life savings to investment operations which hold out the prospect of spectacular returns.  Investors should be careful to check out the status and credentials of any investment firm whose services they wish to avail of.</P>

      <Quest>if any study has been carried out to establish the reasons for the very substantial rise in unemployment among women as indicated by the live register figures; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that between January 1987 and July 1991 unemployment among women increased by 26 per cent while unemployment among men went down by 6 per cent; if the Government are planning any new initiatives to deal specifically with the level of unemployment among women; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Between January 1987 and July 1991 the female proportion of unemployment as measured by the live register rose from almost 28 per cent to 34 per cent.  There are a number of factors which have contributed to this increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, which provided for changes in the social <Col N="54" /> welfare code so as to ensure equality of treatment as between men and women came into operation between May and November 1986.  In effect, the Act enabled married women to qualify for certain entitlements, including unemployment assistance, in their own right instead of being treated as dependants of their husbands in which case they were not included in the live register.  It also extended their entitlement period for unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>The effect of these administrative changes was immediate and cumulative; between November 1986 and July 1987 the female share of unemployment rose from 27.5 per cent to almost 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>A further administrative factor which has altered the proportion of female unemployment has been the introduction of the PRETA and PRECS early-retirement schemes.  As most of the beneficiaries of these schemes are men it has reduced the male component of the live register.</P>
    <P>In addition to these administrative changes, women now must be registered as unemployed to qualify for FÁS courses. When viewed in the light of the increasing numbers of older women entering the labour force, it is reasonable to expect that more and more will sign on to improve their skills competency on these courses.</P>
    <P>Apart from these administrative changes, the participation rate of women in the labour force has been increasing in recent years.  This is borne out by the 1989 labour force survey which shows that the number of women in the labour force increased between 1986 and 1989 compared with a decrease among men. It is reasonable to assume that this change in participation levels would also manifest itself in the live register.</P>
    <P>In relation to increasing employment, the Government are pursuing a policy aimed at strengthening the economy.  In addition, a number of specific initiatives have been started, including the Task Force on Employment and the Review Group on Industrial Policy.  Women will benefit from their activities.</P>
    <P>With regard to Government policy in <Col N="55" /> relation to equality and equal opportunity, this was set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and given further expression in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to the attainment of a society based on principles of equality and equal opportunity. To that end, a second Commission on the Status of Women has been established to bring forward a set of recommendations to the Government on how women can be empowered so that they are able to participate on equal terms and conditions with men in economic, social, political and cultural life. </P>
    <P>In order to achieve this aim, the Government recognise that progress on employment equality is dependent on legislation, complemented by positive action programmes at the level of the individual organisation and at the national level.</P>
    <P>As part of its general response, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> contains commitments to increasing female participation in nontraditional areas, relaxing live register requirements further to facilitate women who wish to return to the workforce, and providing créche facilities at training centres and for workers in the public service.</P>
    <P>Within my own area of responsibility, the 1986 White Paper on Manpower Policy stated that Manpower programmes must promote equality of treatment in the labour market for women, who are still faced with a relatively narrow range of employment opportunities on entering or re-entering the labour market.</P>
    <P>This policy is being facilitated through the provision of extra places for women on FÁS skills based programmes and through the development, where necessary, of specified training and employment programmes.</P>
    <P>In addition, FÁS have launched a special positive action programme for <Col N="56" /> women aimed at increasing and broadening the range of opportunities available to women in the labour market.  The programme is designed to translate the Government's commitment to equal opportunity into a range of practical actions.</P>
    <P>I am currently considering the introduction of a Bill to amend the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>A registered employment agreement &mdash; REA &mdash; for the security industry has been in existence since 1984.  This agreement, which is registered with the Labour Court, lays down legally enforceable minimum pay and certain conditions of employment for persons employed in the security industry to provide a security guarding service &mdash; static guards.  This agreement has the same effect as a joint labour committee.  It is open to the employer and trade union bodies who are parties to the agreement to amend it to cover other employers in the security industry or, alternatively, to consider having a joint labour committee established for the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to holidays the security industry REA lays down a minimum entitlement of 19 days leave per annum for employers who are covered by the agreement.  The agreement also provides <Col N="57" /> for minimum entitlements in respect of pay and time off for the eight public holidays.  Employees in the industry, who are not covered by the REA, would generally be covered by the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, which provides for a minimum legally enforceable entitlement of three weeks holidays and eight public holidays per year.  This entitlement applies to most employees, including those in the security industry, who work at least 18 hours per week.</P>
    <P>The Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991, extends entitlement, on a modified basis, to employees who have been in the continuous employment of the same employer for not less than 13 weeks, who are normally expected to work at least eight hours per week and who, but for the Act of 1991, would not be entitled to the provisions of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.  All complaints in relation to breaches of the Holidays Act are fully investigated by my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department receive complaints from time to time in relation to breaches of the security industry registered employment agreement.  During 1990, 57 inspections of security firms covered by the REA were carried out by the labour inspectorate of the Department either on foot of such complaints or on a routine basis and six cases were referred to my legal advisers for the institution of legal proceedings.  I would like to assure the Deputy that all complaints referred to my Department are fully investigated and where necessary appropriate legal action is taken.</P>

      <P>Companies, or area based partnerships, <Col N="58" /> representative of local community interests, public agencies and the social partners have been set up to co-ordinate the response in 11 of the 12 pilot areas. In the case of Limerick city, it has been agreed that the existing EC Poverty 3 Organisation, Paul, be expanded to include social partners on its board and that it re-prioritise its work to take cognisance of <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>The national co-ordinating team, acting on behalf of the Central Review Committee in relation to the establishment of the area based partnerships, submitted a report in the context of the bilateral discussions taking place with the social partners on the review of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The report contained guidelines for partnerships.  Copies of these guidelines were issued to partnerships and supplied to the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 5 of section VII of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> stated that the pilot projects will be reviewed before end 1991.  The Central Review Committee have assigned responsibility for the implementation of the review and evaluation of the area based partnerships in 1991 to the Combat Poverty Agency.  This review and evaluation process involves three key tasks: preparation of partnerships' reports on activities in 1991; review of the processes involved in setting up the partnerships in 1991; and design of a model for assessing the impact and effectiveness of the partnerships in 1991.</P>
      <P>The agency, which is working with the partnerships on the review, is expected to submit a report to the Central Review Committee early in January 1992.  It is proposed that, on the basis of that review, satisfactory models of partnerships will be progressively extended nationwide by 1994, as resources become available from a growing economy.</P>

Following a review of the scheme by the ESRI it was decided to focus it on the long term unemployed, early school leavers and other categories, such as disabled people and travellers.

      <P>The Government have consistently sought to counter negative perceptions among employers about the capabilities and motivation of the long term unemployed which may have adverse effects on the opportunities available to older workers.  They have sought to change attitudes and advance positive measures, primarily through the partnership approach that has worked successfully through the implementation of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and its successor the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>The Government undertook in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to pursue a policy of substantially raising recruitment age limits throughout the public service.  The Deputy will be pleased to learn that upper age limits for recently advertised open competitions for posts in the Civil Service have reflected the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The Minister for Health and the Minister for the Environment have both provided for an upper age limit of 50 for all offices in relation to which they are the appropriate Ministers.</P>

      <P>I propose to provide for the information requested by the Deputy in the tabular statement below, which will be made available to Deputies.  The tabular statement also shows the position in relation to seconded staff in An Foras Áiseanna Saothair FÁS and the Health and Safety Authority &mdash; HSA &mdash; which are bodies under the aegis of my Department.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last part of this question, I should point out that the job-sharing scheme, as it operates in my Department, is not as restrictive as is implied in the question.  Staff on job-sharing have the choice of a wide variety of working arrangements to suit their particular needs.  In addition, most staff on job-sharing also enjoy the benefits of a system of flexible working hours which affords considerable latitude in the organisation of their hours of attendance.  The job-sharing scheme was agreed centrally between the Civil Service unions and the Department of Finance and any amendments to the scheme would be for negotiation between those parties.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the total number and identity of State or semi-State bodies currently under the aegis of his Department and in receipt of an annual State subvention either directly from the Exchequer or from the EC Structural Funds; if he will further outline (1) the number and value of schemes entered into on foot of such funding and (2) the number of permanent positions created arising from such funding in each of the past four years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are five state sponsored bodies under the aegis of my Department as follows: Foras Áiseanna Saothair (FÁS); CERT; National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health; Labour Relations Commission; Employment Equality Agency.</P>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy's question regarding schemes refers to schemes operated by FÁS.  There are four such schemes operated by FAS, namely the social employment scheme, the employment incentive scheme, Teamwork and the enterprise scheme.  Total expenditure by FÁS on these schemes amounted to £62.677 million in 1988, £56.543 million in 1989, £77.041 million in 1990 and the projected expenditure for 1991 is £83.7 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> The social employment scheme and Teamwork are work schemes designed to give unemployed persons opportunities for work on a temporary basis.  No permanent posts arise from these schemes.</P>
    <P>In the case of the employment incentive scheme, employers recruit unemployed persons and are paid employment subsidies at the end of a 39 week employment period in respect of such employment. FÁS have no statistical information available on the number of permanent positions created as a result of participation in this scheme.  However, the number of persons recruited under the scheme for the four years is 3,269 in 1988, 3,461 in 1989, 2,440 in 1990 and the projected recruitment level in 1991 is 2,000.</P>
    <P>The enterprise scheme provides unemployed people with the opportunity to set up their own enterprises.  The number of persons so assisted during the period in question is 2,467 in 1988; 2,523 in 1989; 2,534 in 1990 and the projected number for 1991 is 2,500.  A report on the scheme published by the ESRI in 1988 showed that 60 per cent of businesses set up under the scheme were still in operation 24 months after the end of participation in the scheme.</P>

      <P>NOW is a European Community initiative which aims to promote equal opportunities for women in the field of employment and vocational training. Over 100 proposals were submitted to the Department of Labour, as the designated National Authority in Ireland for all matters relating to the ESF, for consideration under NOW.</P>
      <P>In general, individual applications are not submitted to the EC Commission. The EC Commission require an operational programme to be drawn up outlining the objectives and priorities of the Irish authorities in relation to the given programme.  An operational programme for the NOW initiative was submitted to the EC Commission on 19 July and negotiations between my Department and the EC Commission have been taking place since that date, following the normal pattern for such negotiations.  A Commission decision is now expected within the next month.</P>

      <P>Following the meeting which I <Col N="82" /> had with Deputy Mary Coughlan and a deputation from the Pettigo area of County Donegal last May, the full details of the situation at Tullyvogey, Letter Bridge and the Pettigo-Lettercran road were conveyed to the British authorities, together with proposals for measures such as footbridges which might help to alleviate the problem.  I have urged that these proposals be given the most sympathetic consideration so as to minimise the inconvenience which closed roads are causing to the local community.</P>
      <P>The British authorities have indicated that a considerable amount of preliminary work on the footbridge proposals has been carried out, but that there are major problems involving land acquisition, rights-of-way and other legal issues.  I am pressing the British authorities to give these matters their most urgent attention with a view to action being taken on the proposals at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general issue of reopening closed roads, I am assured that the British authorities are keeping the situation under constant review but that progress in this regard has been inhibited by security considerations.  I will continue to argue, as I have done in the past, that road closures should only be maintained where the security requirements clearly outweigh the inconvenience to the local community.</P>

      <P>I condemn unreservedly the continuing attacks by the Yugoslav National Army, as well as by Serbian irregular forces, on the people and city of Dubrovnik.  These constitute totally unjustified aggression against the Croatian civilian population of Dubrovnik and the surrounding area, and have caused them immense suffering.  They are also <Col N="83" /> causing serious damage to the ancient city, which forms part of Europe's cultural heritage.</P>
      <P>These attacks are in violation of the cease-fire agreements which have been agreed through the mediation of Lord Carrington.  they have necessitated the withdrawal of EC monitors from the city, and the evacuation of the most vulnerable of the population.  The situation in Dubrovnik was a major factor taken into consideration by Foreign Ministers of the Twelve when, earlier this month, they decided to take restrictive measures against Yugoslavia.</P>

      <P>The Governments of the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Vietnam reached an agreement on 29 October on the return to Vietnam of Vietnamese currently in Hong Kong, under procedures agreed with the United Nations High Commissioner For Refugees.</P>

    <P>The agreement is viewed as a major step in the full implementation of the Comprehensive Plan for Action (CPA) for Indochinese Refugees.  Of particular importance is the confirmation by the Vietnamese Government that no illegal immigrant who returns to Vietnam will <Col N="84" /> face persecution and that the Government will continue to facilitate the monitoring of those who return by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and others, to ensure that these guarantees are fully respected.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 to 58, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's general position on economic and monetary union is well known.  We support the adoption of a single currency and monetary policy throughout the Community and we are aware that this <Col N="86" /> will entail the establishment of an independent central monetary institution committed to price stability, the co-ordination by the member states of their economic policies, the avoidance of excessive deficits and the adoption of procedures to ensure the rules governing economic and monetary union are complied with.</P>
    <P>The detailed provisions are currently being discussed in the Inter-Governmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union and the recent Dutch draft Treaty was prepared to assist that conference in the final stage of negotiations before the Maastricht European Council.  The Dutch draft Treaty, which should be viewed only as a working document, is currently being considered line by line and all member states, including Ireland, are making an active contribution to those deliberations.  In view of the fact that the negotiations are now at a very sensitive stage, it would not be appropriate for the Government to disclose their detailed views on specific aspects of its Dutch draft Treaty at this stage.</P>
    <P>The general principles outlined above, including that of attempting to ensure equitable treatment <i>vis-à-vis</i> all member states has governed, and will continue to govern, our specific negotiating strategy.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Commissioner of Valuation is statutorily independent and it is not open to the Minister to influence his decisions in any way. Under the system of quarterly revision of valuations introduced by the Valuation Act, 1988 the owner or occupier of a property, the rating authority or an officer of the Commissioner of Valuation may apply at any time to have the valuation of a property revised.  Applications are sent through the rating authority on a monthly basis to the Commissioner who issues particulars of the revised valuation to local authorities at quarterly intervals.  As requests for revisions are issued only on a quarterly basis, it is inevitable that there will always be a certain number of applications on hands in the Valuation Office awaiting issue to rating authorities.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that there is a necessary connection between the level of the dependent relative tax allowance and eligibility for the carer's allowance from the Department of Social Welfare.  In any event, I would point out that taxpayers entitled to the dependent relative allowance are also subject to the usual conditions, entitled to claim medical insurance relief and medical expenses relief in respect of the dependent relative, and to claim mortgage interest relief on a loan obtained for the purchase or <Col N="90" /> improvement of a dwelling for use rentfree by such relative.  In addition, the focus of tax policy is to conserve and widen the tax base and reduce tax rates: on foot of this, in recent years the top and standard tax rates have been reduced by 6 per cent in each case, the standard band has been extended by over 40 per cent, the personal and PAYE allowances have been increased, and special provision has been made for the low-paid via the exemption limits and the child addition to them.  These improvements have been of benefit to taxpayers generally, including those claiming the dependent relative allowance.</P>

    <P>There is not much scope for designating further areas of the country as national parks.  The Office of Public Works as the State agency with responsibility for the protection of our natural <Col N="92" /> heritage does, however, review potential areas for future parks.</P>
    <P>North west Mayo has been examined in this context but having regard to current priorities and resources there is not at present a specific proposal to establish a national park there.  It is therefore premature to consider transferring native deer to the Nephin Beg range in Mayo.</P>

    <P>In February last my predecessor as Minister for Agriculture and Food announced that, following a report by an Inter-Departmental committee set up in <Col N="93" /> February 1990, two areas had been selected for launching the initiative on a pilot basis, viz part of the Slieve Blooms in County Laois and Offaly and Slyne Head, County Galway.  The necessary scheme has been drawn up and is now in the final stages of negotiation with the EC Commission.  There has been no expenditure to date, since there can be no question of implementation in advance of Commission approval.</P>

      <P>Safeguards against conflict of interest in respect of members and employees of FÁS are contained in the regulation of the procedures and business of FÁS and in their purchasing procedures formally adopted by the board and their standard contract of employment.</P>
      <P>ILTS are a subsidiary of FÁS provided for in section 4 (6) (b) of the Labour Services Act, 1987.

      <P>The legislation relating to conditions of employment administered by my Department, with the exception of the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1977, applies to workers regardless of their age. The purpose of Protection of Young Persons Act, 1977 is to extend the scope of legislative protection given to young persons under the age of 18 and, therefore, could not be described as discriminatory.</P>
      <P>The Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1991 apply to employees between the ages of 16 and 66.  The Acts require that an employer who dismisses an employee by reason of redundancy, supplies the employee with a redundancy certificate stating the reasons for the redundancy. If the reason given relates solely to the employee's age, this is not a valid reason for redundancy as defined under the redundancy payments acts.  In such a situation, or in any situation where an employee feels that he or she has been unfairly selected for redundancy on the grounds of age, the employee is entitled to bring a claim seeking redress under the unfair dismissals act to the employment appeals tribunal which will determine the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> The commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to increase upper age limits for recruitment to the public service is being implemented.  This should provide a stimulus to both the wider public and private sectors.  The upper age limit for recruitment to most posts have been increased to 50 years for the Civil Service, health boards and local authorities.</P>
    <P>With regard to promotion, this is a matter for individual employers, provided they comply with the requirements of the employment equality legislation.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to introduce further regulations to provide for the prohibition of age limits in all the circumstances covered by the Deputy's question.  I am not convinced that legislation is a necessary or even an appropriate means of promoting better access for older persons to the available opportunities on the labour market.  In the present economic environment further regulation of the labour market in this area could be damaging to job creation and impose added costs on employers.</P>
    <P>Where a legislative approach has been adopted, as in the USA, it stemmed from demographic concerns and fears about the practice of prematurely terminating the employment of older people.  No similar circumstances apply in Ireland, where the demographic structure is markedly different to that in the USA in the late 1960s.</P>

This assessment allows entitlement of old age non-contributory pension to continue at the minimum rate of £3 per week.  This minimum rate is increased by the living alone allowance of £4.30 per week and during the winter months by the basic fuel allowance of £5 per week and smokeless fuel supplement of £3 per week which gives a current entitlement of £15.30 per week.

As a result, her pension has been reduced to £65 per week with effect from 8 November 1991. If the person wishes to appeal against this assessment, it is open to her to do so.</P>

      <P>The person in question was paid disability benefit from 21 March 1989 to 10 July 1990, when he was examined by a medical referee, who found him capable of work. His claim was disallowed by a deciding officer with effect from 11 July 1990.  He was also paid pay-related benefit which ceased on 21 June 1990, when he had exhausted his entitlement.  He appealed against the decision disallowing him payment of disability benefit.  On 8 May 1991 an appeals officer found in his favour and reversed the decision of the deciding officer.</P>
      <P>During the period of his disallowance, from 12 July 1990 to 7 May 1991, he applied for and was paid unemployment benefit plus pay-related benefit.  The pay-related benefit amounted to £658.00.</P>
      <P>However, as a result of the appeals officer's decision he was entitled to disability benefit from 12 July 1990.  Pay-related benefit was not payable with this disability benefit as he had exhausted his entitlement to pay-related benefit with disability benefit on 21 June 1990.  As a result he received £658.00 that he would not have received had he remained on disability benefit after 12 July 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is accepted that the amount in question was properly paid on his unemployment benefit claim and the question of recovery does not arise.  However due to an oversight at the local office the <Col N="111" /> person concerned was inadvertently asked to pay the money.</P>
    <P>My officials are required to identify themselves clearly in all correspondence with the public and I will examine the Deputy's complaint in this case.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from 18 October 1990. In the course of routine inquiries by inspectors from my Department on 15 October 1991 he verbally admitted to working with his son in a silage contracting business in June 1991.  He also signed a statement detailing the exact nature of his work, viz. driving farm machinery.</P>
      <P>This work is in contravention of the rules of behaviour governing receipt of disability.  The relevant rule states:&mdash;&ldquo;A person shall do no work unless it be light work for which no remuneration is, or would ordinarily be, payble&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The penalty for a breach of these rules provides for a disqualification for receipt of disability benefit for a period of up to nine weeks.  Accordingly, this client was disqualified by a deciding officer for the period from 18 November 1991 to 18 January 1992.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's representations are being accepted as an appeal against this decision and the case will be referred to the social welfare appeals office for determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further aspects of this person's entitlements are still under review.  When he submitted his claim in October 1990, he stated that his wife was not self-employed. It has since been established that she owns a farm and a business. Her income from these sources is being investigated.  When these investigations <Col N="112" /> are complete, the question of entitlements to increases for dependants will be reviewed.</P>

    <P>In the current year, the cost of providing the tow away service up to 30 September 1991, is estimated at £189,000.  Additionally, a two-car tow truck was acquired in February 1991, at a cost of £46,000.  Also, a new car pound (capacity 300+ cars) was taken over and fitted out at the junction of Infirmary Road and Parkgate Street.

      <P>I have received representations from time to time regarding the abolition of ground rents.</P>
      <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978, prevents the creation of new ground rents on dwellinghouses and the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, provides, as regards existing ground rents on dwellinghouses, a low cost purchase scheme by virtue of which any person can terminate the ground rent on his dwellinghouse. The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Act, 1987, extended indefinitely the operation of that scheme.</P>
      <P>The recently published Programme for Government states:</P>
      <P>The Government are committed to introducing legislation which will abolish all remaining domestic Ground Rents as and from January 1 1997. Under these proposals, all remaining such rents will be deemed no longer to exist, and the fee simple of the property will become the exclusive ownership of the householder.</P>
      <P>The legislation will shift the onus of completing the purchase of outstanding ground rents from the householder to the ground rent landlord.</P>

      <P>The scheme under which a local authority may carry out improvements to a private house in lieu of providing a local authority house is aimed specifically at houses owned and occupied by persons qualified for local authority housing.  The scheme may also cater for a case where a person qualified for local authority housing, can be suitably accommodated in a house owned by a member of that person's family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for the individual housing authorities to implement the scheme having regard to their assessment of its <Col N="119" /> potential to meet housing needs in their area and the capital allocation made to them for the scheme this year.  In deciding the priority to be accorded to individual cases, for which the scheme is considered appropriate, housing authorities should, of course, have regard to the relative acuteness of the housing needs of the households involved.</P>

      <P>An application for funding under the remedial works scheme has been received and is being examined; a decision on the eligibility under the scheme of the works proposed will be made as soon as possible.  However, the priority rating accorded to this estate by the corporation <i>vis-à-vis</i> other estates, the financial commitments on the corporation's eight approved projects and the overall high demand by local authorities for funding under the scheme would not allow the designation of Swansnest Court at this stage, even if the works proposed are deemed eligible under the scheme.  The management, maintenance and improvement of their housing estates and the fixing of priorities between different estates are matters for the corporation.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are responsible for the management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwellings, including the provision of bathrooms. The £2 million bathroom sub-programme introduced this year is intended to supplement the expenditure of authorities from their own resources to assist them to eliminate this deficiency in their housing stock.  The limited funds available under the sub-programme were allocated to authorities which had a comparatively high number of dwellings without bathroom facilities.  Allocations under the sub-programme were made to 21 authorities including Wexford Corporation, Enniscorthy UDC and two county councils.</P>
      <P>Capital allocations this year under the remedial works scheme were made to 41 housing authorities including Wexford Corporation, Enniscorthy UDC, New Ross UDC and 12 county councils.  No proposal under the remedial works scheme has been received from Wexford County Council.</P>

      <P>When Beaumont Hospital was being opened in 1987 some unused space in the paediatric unit was allocated to consultants for use as a private clinic.  This was a temporary arrangement, pending the construction of a separate facility. The space currently occupied by the private clinic is capable of accommodating 25 paediatric beds.

      <P>The question of establishing language disorder units in the Mid-Western Health Board area is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education, to decide upon.  I understand that his Department are currently investigating the need for the units in conjunction with the Mid-Western Branch of the Language Disorder Support Group.  In that regard the support group has been asked to supply psychological and psycholinguistic reports in respect of those children for <Col N="132" /> whom the facilities are being sought and I am informed that further consideration of the issue is dependent on receipt of this essential documentation.</P>
      <P>In view of the foregoing the Deputy will appreciate that consideration by my Department of the sanctioning of speech therapists posts at this stage is premature.</P>

      <P>While the percentage of the adult population which smokes has decreased from 43 per cent in the early seventies to 28 per cent in 1990-91 the number of young people taking up the smoking habit is a cause for concern.</P>
      <P>The most recent sudy of smoking among young people in EC countries, (Eurobarometer Survey Oct. 1990) shows that 4 per cent of 11-15 year olds in Ireland were regular smokers (i.e. smoked at least once a week).  In this study Ireland was among the four countries with the lowest percentage of young people smoking.</P>
      <P>A more detailed study of Dublin schoolgirls published in 1990 shows that 2.5 per cent of girls in the senior classes in primary schools were regular smokers while 13 per cent of those in the junior classes in post-primary schools were regular smokers.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about these figures relating to the numbers of young people smoking and my Department are involved in a number of initiatives to combat this worrying trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health promotion unit of my Department, the psychological service of the Department of Education and the <Col N="138" /> Irish Cancer Society have come together to form a working party to develop a peer-led smoking cessation and reduction action programme for young people.  The primary aim of this programme is to reduce the level of smoking among young Irish schoolchildren.</P>
    <P>To begin this programme, suitable leaders from within the school-setting will be identified and trained in areas such as information dissemination, communication skills and leadership.  As a result of his training, it is anticipated that the students will return to the school setting with the skills necessary to instruct their colleagues with regard to various aspects of their health related behaviour, most notably their smoking habits.  It is also anticipated that those attending the training seminar will have acquired the ability to initiate projects on this subject on their return to school.  On-going support is to be provided to participants when the programme is in place in the school setting.</P>
    <P>To date, the working party have been working closely with a number of students as to how best this initiative should proceed.  The first training seminar is to take place in the first term of the 1992 school year.</P>
    <P>As part of the European Commission's Europe against cancer programme the health promotion unit of my Department and the psychological service of the Department of Education are hosting a national conference on health education and cancer prevention for three days at the end of this month.  This conference will bring together individuals from the health and education fields in order to tackle the problems, at school level and of lifestyle related illnesses.  Smoking features prominently in that regard.</P>
    <P>For the past two years the health promotion unit have organised a nationwide school poster competition entitled, &ldquo;Health is looking Good&rdquo;.  School children were asked to create a poster on one of various health topics including smoking.  This competition was highly succesful as it succeeded in the heightening of children's awareness of the <Col N="139" /> main health themes, particularly smoking.</P>
    <P>An information pack on various health issues was distributed to every school in the country for use by teachers.  The winning entries &mdash; four of which were directly related to smoking &mdash; were reproduced and have been disseminated to schools throughout the country.  The unit will continue this initiative in 1992.</P>
    <P>A substance abuse prevention programme has been initiated in selected schools on a pilot basis by the health promotion unit and the psychological service of the Department of Education. The programme will run during the 1991-92 academic year.</P>
    <P>It involves whole school staffs becoming more aware of ways in which they can help young people respond to threats to their health.  This programme deals with ways that relate to a young person's ability to resist the offer of substances.  Tobacco is one of the substances that is specifically dealt with.</P>
    <P>During 1990 and 1991 the health promotion unit in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society and the Department of Education held a number of highly successful teacher in-service training seminars on the subject of cancer education. These seminars focused specifically on smoking.</P>
    <P>A range of school materials have been developed as a resource for these teachers.  The HPU have been involved in the compilation of these materials &mdash; one for primary schools, one for junior second-level students and a third for senior second-level students.  Video material is currently being prepared by the unit and the Irish Cancer Society for use on television specifically aimed at young people and smoking.</P>
    <P>Some of the initiatives I have referred to above are taking place in the Dublin area, though not exclusively so.  The unit is currently developing the 1992 national anti tobacco campaign.  I propose that this will have a particular focus on the problem of young people smoking.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme it is open to a committee to carry out an annual review of the income of the scholarship applicants parents and to adjust the category of scholarship payable in the event of an increase or decrease in means.</P>
      <P>It is understood that it is in this context that the County Kildare Vocational Education Committee carry out an annual review of income in each individual case. I am satisfied that this practice does not discriminate against students whose parents are unemployed.</P>
