      <P>I move the following amendment: for &ldquo;29 January&rdquo; 1992 to substitute &ldquo;15 January&rdquo; 1992.  We need to come back earlier because the Dáil has not been reformed and, therefore, there are no other means, apart from plenary meetings of this House, for processing legislation or dealing with financial business. This session will conclude without processing the following Bills: Environmental Protection Agency Bill, the Roads Bill, the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, the important criminal law evidence Bill, the criminal proceeds Bill, the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages [Regulation] Bill and a housing Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being as economical as possible in what I say.  A large number of other Bills, to which I could refer, have not been processed.  We should come back earlier and the only circumstances in which I would agree to coming back later would be if the Government indicated that they intended to find other means, through committees of this House, which they have not done hitherto, to deal with the legislative and financial backlog of 1991.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposal to bring the Dáil back on 15 January.  The Government should acknowledge their <Col N="2419" /> failure in regard to their legislative programme for this year by agreeing to that. The Dáil should resume at an earlier date and take a serious approach to legislation. Unfortunately, the Government have failed miserably with the legislative programme in this session and we could correct that by coming back on 15 January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party also support the proposal that we come back sooner than the date mooted, 29 January, in the Government proposal.  I support the suggestion of 15 January for the reasons outlined.  There are many important and urgent Bills which should be addressed by this House, sooner rather than later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The annual Appropriation Bill gives statutory effect to the departmental Estimates for the supply services, both non-capital and capital, including all Supplementary Estimates that were voted and approved by the Dáil since the enactment of the previous Appropriation Act.</P>
      <P>This year's Bill appropriates to the various services set out in the Schedule, the sum of £7,199,991,000 comprising the estimates totalling £6,991,629,000 as set out in this year's revised post-budget Book of Estimates and Supplementary Estimates totalling £208,362,000.  As usual the Bill also authorises the use of certain departmental receipts amounting to £917,581,000 as Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out that although Supplementary Estimates of over £208 million have been passed by the House this year, this does not mean that Exchequer spending is overrunning by that amount.  As Deputies will no doubt have noticed, the 1992 Abridged Estimates Volume which I published last Tuesday shows the provisional outturn for total voted services at £7,143 million, <Col N="2429" /> some £57 million lower than the total amount appropriated in this year's Bill. This reflects of course the fact that savings in certain spending areas will help defray the extra resources required on those Votes for which Supplementary Estimates were needed.  I will return to the emerging budgetary position for 1991 later.</P>
    <P>Apart from giving statutory effect to the Estimates, the Appropriation Bill has another vitally important function.  That is, it provides a statutory basis for calculation of the &ldquo;four-fifths&rdquo; issues which the Minister for Finance is authorised, under the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965, to make from the Exchequer towards meeting the cost of the following year's services during the period before the Dáil has an opportunity to consider and pass the various individual Estimates.</P>
    <P>This allows for the smooth continuation of services from one year to the next.  If the Appropriation Bill is not passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before Christmas, the provisions of the 1965 Act could not apply and there would then be no statutory authority to spend voted moneys in 1992, at least until the Dáil resumes.</P>
    <P>This year the Appropriation Bill is also being used to make a technical amendment to the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927.  The amendment is set out in section 2.  The necessity for this section arises out of the proposal, contained in the review of the Programme for Government, that the Dáil sits on Fridays.  As Members are aware, under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927, the Dáil can impose taxes by Financial Resolution, but taxes imposed in this manner will lapse unless they are ratified by being incorporated in the subsequent Finance Act.</P>
    <P>So as to ensure that this House is afforded the right, within a reasonable time, to debate and examine in detail taxes imposed by Financial Resolution, the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act imposes strict deadlines on the passing of the subsequent Finance Act.  If these deadlines are not met, taxes imposed by <Col N="2430" /> Resolution on the preceding budget day will lapse.  These deadlines are: (i) The Dáil must complete the Second Stage of the Finance Bill within 30 sitting days after budget day and (ii) the Bill must be signed by the President within four calendar months of budget day.</P>
    <P>As I said, the necessity for the legislation contained in section 2 arises from the proposal that the Dáil should meet on Fridays.  Up to the present, the practice has been for the Dáil to sit on three days each week.  If the Dáil is now to sit on Fridays, there will be four sitting days per week and the 30 sitting day rule would leave insufficient time to prepare the Finance Bill for presentation to the House.</P>
    <P>Up to the present, with three day sittings per week, the &ldquo;30 sitting day&rdquo; rule allowed a Minister for Finance about 12 weeks to prepare the Finance Bill.  The budget is normally on the last Wednesday of January and 30 sitting days after this day amounted to ten weeks of Dáil business. Taking account of a break for St. Patrick's Day, ten weeks after the last Wednesday in January invariably overlapped with the Easter recess.  So depending on the length of that recess, the Minister for Finance normally had 12 or 13 weeks to present the Bill to the House. If the House is now to meet on four days per week, the 30 day rule would allow no more than seven to eight weeks to prepare the Bill.  The legislation could not be prepared within this timescale.</P>
    <P>No doubt Members will wonder why the Bill could not be ready in eight weeks. The process of preparing the Finance Bill is as follows.  Every proposal for inclusion in the legislation has to be examined in the greatest detail by my officials.  All foreseeable problems, whether problems of principle or of administrative feasibility, must be solved satisfactorily.  This process involves close co-operation with the officials of the Revenue Commissioners and in certain cases, with officials of other Departments.  Each proposal is then submitted to me for approval.  When I have considered, and amended or approved, a proposal, officials of the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="2431" /> prepare a preliminary draft of the proposed section.  This is sent to the parliamentary draftsman and a text for each section of the Bill is prepared.  When this process has been gone through for the 100 or more sections that normally comprise the Bill, the draft legislation is assembled and submitted to Government for consideration and approval.</P>
    <P>The Bill must then be printed and checked.  It has to be published in time to allow all Members of this House time to examine it before the Second Stage is taken.  It would be my firm wish to have the Bill ready for this House as quickly as possible after budget day, but it would be unrealistic to undertake that it could be got ready in less than 12 weeks or so than it normally takes.</P>
    <P>The intention of section 2 which we are now considering is to accommodate a move to Friday sitting while continuing to afford the Government 12 weeks to prepare the legislation and to have the Second Stage taken.</P>
    <P>However, a rigid 84 day rule would not be practicable.  Because of the variability of Easter, there would be years when an 84 day rule would allow only nine or ten weeks for the preparation of the Bill, as the House would be in recess when the 84th day elapsed.  Because of this, the legislation before the House provides that if the House is in recess on the 82nd, 83rd or 84th day following the budget, the Second Stage must be passed within five sitting days of the resumption.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of changing the &ldquo;30 day rule&rdquo; to an &ldquo;84 day rule&rdquo;, it is necessary to provide for a situation where the House is dissolved between budget day and the passing of the Second Stage. Under the &ldquo;30 sitting day rule&rdquo;, were the House to be dissolved, a problem does not arise.  By definition the House is not sitting and so for the purposes of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, no sitting days elapse.  Under the proposed &ldquo;84 day rule&rdquo;, however, a dissolution of the House would eat into the 84 days and it could happen that Financial Resolutions would lapse as a consequence. Therefore, section 2 (b) provides that <Col N="2432" /> should the House be dissolved, the period of the dissolution will be added to the time limits, that is, the &ldquo;84 day rule&rdquo; and the four month rule will also be extended by the length of the dissolution.</P>
    <P>I now want to return briefly to the main purpose of the Bill &mdash; the appropriation of moneys to the various services provided in the Estimates, and to put the 1991 expenditure figure I mentioned earlier in the wider budgetary context.  In speaking to this House last night on the Take Note motion on the 1992 Estimates, I referred to the international uncertainty against which the 1991 budget was set.</P>
    <P>My predecessor, Deputy Albert Reynolds, made it very plain at budget time this year that the budget was based on certain critical assumptions &mdash; it was assumed, for example, that the international slowdown would restrict our growth rate to no more than 2.25 per cent &mdash; a dramatic reduction on the growth achieved over 1989 and 1990, which had averaged over 6 per cent per annum.  No-one tried to disguise the risk that the international downturn could be worse than had been allowed for, and that this would adversely affect us.  Attention was drawn to the manner in which such a slowdown could have repercussions for unemployment and therefore public expenditure.  We now know of course that the recession in the UK and the US has been much deeper than anybody had anticipated.</P>
    <P>When the end-June Exchequer returns were published it was abundantly clear that problems were emerging on the budget both as to expenditure overruns and revenue shortfalls.  On the receipts side, significant shortfalls were evident in tax revenues.  While on the expenditure side, the economic slowdown was increasing unemployment costs due mainly to the virtual cessation of emigration. These factors, together with some slippage emerging on other fronts, especially health, left the Government facing an overrun of at least £200 million at that time.</P>
    <P>While some of these factors were outside our control and had to be provided for, the Government were firmly of the <Col N="2433" /> view that the threatened level of overrun had to be addressed in a decisive way so as to reduce the impact in 1991 and to mitigate the adverse knock-on effects for the 1992 opening budgetary position.  The Government, therefore, set in train a wide-ranging and detailed line-by-line examination of 1991 expenditure allocations, and other non-tax areas to see where savings could be made to help alleviate the overrun then emerging.  The result of this examination was a package of adjustment measures of over £100 million. This resolute action by the Government has helped contain the budgetary drift this year to a level well below the threatened overrun of £200 million emerging at mid-year.  I am confident that the outturn on the EBR can be held to about 2.5 per cent of GNP as compared with the initial budget target of 1.9 per cent.  In reality, of course, the proceeds from the Irish Life flotation will bring the actual EBR well below the budget target of 1.9 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Firm control of the public finances remains a Government priority.  We have again demonstrated our resolve in this regard with the publication of the 1992 spending Estimates earlier this week which show continuing restraint on spending.  Continued firm control of spending is an essential precondition for achieving the Government's medium term target and it is my firm intention to ensure that these targets are attained for the benefit of all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Minister for giving us the opportunity of saying a few words on the Appropriation Bill and the amendment that is being introduced to facilitate the officials of the Department of Finance in the preparation of the Finance Bill.  I do not intend to talk about the Estimates for 1991 in general terms.  The debate on the 1992 Estimates began last night and I have said what I had to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is a reasonable proposal by the Minister and his officials.  It seems that when time is being allocated for preparation of the legislation it is false to base the time period on sitting days <Col N="2434" /> rather than on actual days because it is not the Members of this House who are preparing the Finance Bill.  While there is a relationship between sitting days and the processing of legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas there is no relationship between the work the civil servants in the Department of Finance put into a Finance Bill and the number of sitting days.  Obviously to base the time on calendar days is appropriate in circumstances in which the Dáil will be sitting, generally speaking, on Fridays. By confining the time to 30 sitting days, considering that the Dáil will be sitting four days each week rather than three days, it would cut into the time available to the officials of the Department of Finance to prepare the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his officials have traditionally facilitated the professional groups and interest groups who wish to make submissions between the time of the budgetary announcements and publication of the Finance Bill, and that is appropriate.  Different countries have different ways of doing things.  In the United Kingdom, for example, the Finance Bill is published on the day after the budget speech and it is immediately available to MPs.  That is one way of doing business, but it means that the decisions which are incorporated in the budget and the Finance Bill have to be made well in advance of the budget.  In the UK, matters such as the normal indexation of social welfare and the indexation of income tax bands and allowances which are matters of statute, are included in the Estimates which are published before November.  Only the immediate changes are made on budget day and they are drafted in the Finance Bill at the same time as the budgetary speech is adopted.  That has some merit in that the decisions of the Chancellor of the Exchequer are full and final and there is no scope for lobbying by vested interests to change these decisions subsequently.</P>
    <P>The system here is a more open one and I am not proposing that it should be changed.  It is a good idea that the professional groups and interests affected <Col N="2435" /> have a say in the ultimate shape of the Finance Bill even though concessions of principle are not generally agreed in discussions between the interest groups and the Minister and his officials.  I have no objection to the technical amendment proposed by the Minister.  Adequate time must be given to the officials in the Department of Finance and a change to a four-day sitting week would certainly shorten the time available to them.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give a commitment that there be adequate time on Committee Stage to debate the Finance Bill.  It is unacceptable that a Finance Bill which can quite frequently run to 70 to 80 pages of detailed technical tax law is often limited to time.  On occasions, ten, 12 or 15 sections are decided by one question at various times in the course of the debate, and effectively they are not debated at all.  This House, as a legislative body, has a particular function to oversee financial matters.  It is not good practice &mdash; I doubt if it is in line with the Constitution &mdash; to pass large complex sections of a Finance Bill without any debate whatsoever.  I would like the Minister for Finance to reflect on this matter.</P>
    <P>It would be more appropriate to deal with the Finance Bill in a committee of the House rather than take Committee Stage in the House.  I can understand the time constraints involved.  If three days are devoted to a Finance Bill in one week and two days the following week it is a lot of debating time but considering the complexity of the matter it is not a lot of time.  We should consider removing the Bill from the floor of the House and dealing with it in a specialist committee for nine or ten days during which time the party spokespersons on Finance and the people in this House who have a specific expertise on financial matters could go through it line by line.  If the Bill was dealt with in that way a lot of the political posturing and political rhetoric would be eliminated and a real debate would take place on the text of the legislation and its impact on tax law.  If that cannot be done I would ask the Minister to ensure that we have a more extensive <Col N="2436" /> Committee Stage debate on the Finance Bill in 1992 and in future years.  I accept the Appropriation Bill, as amended, and I thank the Minister for the opportunity of speaking on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not take up the time of the House unnecessarily on this matter.  There is a certain irony in the fact that the present Minister for Finance is the person who led the charge in negotiating the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> last year in which an unrealistically optimistic view was taken of revenue for 1992.  In starting his career as Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern should take a levelheaded approach to dealing with matters that need to be adopted by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is simply crazy that we are expected to accept that when the international climate turns sour, the Government are powerless but when the international climate becomes exceedingly good, the Government are uniquely triumphant in their singular ability to turn around the economy of this country.  To a certain extent the completion in a formal sense of these Estimates and the Appropriation Bill for 1991, including the correction made back in June, is a vindication of the Opposition and a reflection on the political leadership on the Government side.  The Minister indicated in his speech that it had become apparent by June that things were not going so well.  Should he care to &mdash; but I am sure he does not have the time &mdash; read the contributions made by myself and other Deputies, including Deputy Noonan, on the budget and on the Finance Bill, he would see that the early warnings were given at the start of 1991 to the effect that the revenue expectations based on the growth and unemployment assumptions of last year were hopelessly optimistic and would not be met.  It was not until the House went into recess in July that the Minister for Finance of the day finally admitted in public what his officials had been saying for the previous six months.  Having said that, it is appropriate that we go through <Col N="2437" /> the formality of giving legal authorisation by way of debate to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I concur with what has been said already on this amendment.  The extra time is necessary, and the period of ten to 12 weeks is an appropriate time in which to draft the technical legislation to give effect to the budget.  There are both good and bad aspects to having a time separation between the announcement of the budget and the formulation of the Finance Bill.  In a negative sense it allows people to mount charges and lobby against certain changes.  The most effective lobby I encountered in recent times was the CII lobby against the removal of section 84 provisions and they were successful on a number of occasions. Because of the scale and size of our administration and the lack of infallibility in Government Departments, no matter how well intentioned or committed they are the time scale allows people to analyse the budget and look at the implications of the Bill to give it effect.  On balance, I would prefer to maintain the system we have rather than the alternative suggested by Deputy Noonan, where the Finance Bill would be published the day after the budget.  That conveys a certain kind of rigidity which I do not think is suitable for us at this point in time.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the drafting of the Finance Bill is a complex, technical task and for that reason I strongly support the proposal that the Committee Stage be referred to a special committee of the House and that we would give ourselves a reasonable period, perhaps three weeks, to tease out the amendments in a non-adversarial manner.  None of us would profess to have a monopoly of wisdom on the drafting of technical resolutions but all have access to professional back-up services in both the private and professional sectors.  Indeed, we would have access to people who are from time to time formally engaged by the Government.  There have been occasions where the Minister of the day was unable to respond to the technical demands of an amendment because of the scarcity of time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2438" /> I can refer to an example last year where the Minister responded to a proposal from the Fine Gael benches the previous year on the capital taxation of land transfers on the double.  They made the case that when the son who inherited land died, the land reverted to the parents, thus attaching taxation on each transaction.  The hardship cases were identified and recitified.  Last year I highlighted a similar anomally to respect of the complications that arise when a second marriage is not properly recognised and the Minister gave an undertaking to accept the validity of the proposition being put forward but appealed for indulgence because of insufficient time to draft a properly worded amendment that could be tested legally, and an amendment could not be produced in time.  They are just two examples but numerous examples could be cited.  If the Committee Stage could be debated in special committee, we would get a better Finance Bill and the loopholes that inevitably from part of any Finance Act could be identified and the changes could be fine-tuned.  Because we cannot increase the expenditure provisions in the Finance Bill, all we can do is make it a better Finance Bill, and this could be achieved on Committee Stage. For that reason I accept the amendment. It is not unreasonable but I believe that we will have to deal with Committee Stage differently, not just in respect of the Finance Bill but in respect of other legislation.  We could make a start with the Finance Bill.  If the Minister for Finance was willing to give the lead on this matter it would send a signal to the other Ministers' line departments to follow suit.  It would also avoid the kind of argument that is part and parcel of the end of term critique of performance.  Our legislative performance was pretty miserable this year.  Who accepts responsibility for that remains to be seen.  We are not responding to the legislative needs of a modern society with our 19th century system of law making.  This should be taken on board.  The Labour Party will support this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Finance and the Government Whip for providing the time to put on record our observations on the proposals before the House.  I also take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to what is an unenviable task.</P>
      <P>This is a unique occasion because this is the first time ever we have addressed the Appropriation Bill, having a copy of the Bill before us.  The practice heretofore was that all Stages of the Bill were taken without debate and as a result the Appropriation Act was circulated subsequently. The Workers' Party took every opportunity in the past to protest about this and we would have continued this protest because it was not a good legislative practice.  Leaving aside the question of not having Second, Committee, Report and Final Stage debates we were being asked to agree to something in good faith without ever seeing it and I believe that is not desirable.  We have a copy of the Bill before us today because the Minister has advanced an amendment to the Collection of Taxes Act, 1927, and I wish to comment on that.  First, let me say that the reason the amendment was tabled is because of a commitment in the joint Programme for Government that the House would sit on a greater number of days in the new session.  I welcome that.  Indeed, we pushed for this for some considerable time so that we would work a reasonable working week and so that we would not have to endure the business being crammed into long sitting hours, as we have seen last week and this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of Government was published on 18 October last so the Minister and his officials were aware of this difficulty over the past ten weeks.  May I ask why it was left until the second last day of term that the Whips were alerted to the problem and now on this last day of the session we are being asked to deal with it in this way?  Is there a logistical problem in the Department of Finance of getting the legislative proposals on to the table early?  This brings me on to the <Col N="2440" /> wider question that is involved in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can reply at the end of the debate but may I take the opportunity to answer it now?  Other options were looked at, but when I examined them last weekend I saw that the other options might get us over the difficulty this year but would lead to difficulties in the future.  Rather than having a messy solution, I decided it was better to do it this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is making my point in some ways, when he says he realised last weekend that there were options.  The timing of this amendment leads me on to the larger issue, that is the capacity of the Department of Finance to produce the Finance Bill within a reasonable period.  From the point of view of The Workers' Party the concern is that by amending the time dicate in one aspect of the Finance Bill and leaving in place the four month rule this morning we are effectively shortening by about two weeks the time that will be available to the House to debate the Finance Bill on Second and subsequent Stages.  The Workers' Party would be more happy to have the Minister stand by the proposal he is advocating today if there was a proposal to lengthen proportionately the four month rule.  I do not know whether or not that proposal was considered.  My concern is that every time the House comes to Committee Stage of the Finance Bill there is always a guillotine in operation, on the basis that there is a deadline to meet, and Members do not get adequate time for debate.  Frankly, there is a suspicion in our minds that as a good parliamentary device the Minister holds back the Finance Bill until the eleventh hour, when it is circulated, brought to the Whips' meeting and the House then begins the Second Stage debate within a matter of days of its publication.  Committee Stage is taken almost as quickly, with guillotines being in place all along the way.  The suspicion that as a good parliamentary tactic the Finance Bill is <Col N="2441" /> not released until the eleventh hour is the reason that I laboured on the point about this morning's amendment coming in so late.</P>
      <P>Some of the more controversial aspects of the budget and the Finance Bill tend to appear later in the drafting and in the structure of the Bill and, invariably, they are never reached or debated on Committee Stage.  Deputies do not have the chance to examine them in detail because of the use of the guillotine.  Therefore, what is being proposed will exacerbate the position because, in effect, there will be two weeks' less time available, more guillotines will be introduced and demanded and there will be fewer opportunities for debate.</P>
      <P>I was advised in a briefing note and explanation made available to the Whips that one of the contributing factors to the lapse of time from budget day to the publication of the Bill is the practice of allowing outside interests to lobby and the Department and the Minister taking the time to consider those viewpoints and decide whether to take them on board.  Is that a good practice?  I am not necessarily advocating that Ireland should follow the procedure of Britain where the Finance Bill is published virtually contemperaneously with the budget. However, it seems that in a country in which successive Governments have had great difficulty withstanding the pressure from lobby groups and vested interests groups a short period of time might be better for the ultimate product to come from the Finance Bill.  I am considering the business expansion scheme proposals contained in last year's budget and the very substantial retreat represented in the Finance Bill from that position.  There is no doubt that the period of time available then was used very effectively by vested interest groups to put pressure on the Minister to have the proposal changed, as it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the reasons given, the Workers' Party are unhappy with the amendment proposed to the 1927 Act.  We would have been happier had the second deadline been amended so that adequate time <Col N="2442" /> would at least be available, even if not used.</P>
    <P>In summary, I ask the Minister, like Deputy Noonan, to promise he will consider the issue of the earliest possible date for the publication of the Finance Bill &mdash; in short, perhaps the time available for people to make their representations and have them considered could be curtailed a little &mdash; so that the Bill comes to the House early enough to allow a fair amount of time for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The idea of using a special committee is also contained in the Joint Programme for Government and such a committee could be very usefully employed in a Bill of the complexity and scale of the Bill under debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not need that amount of time.  I appreciate the concession. I thank the Opposition spokesmen and the Whip of The Workers' Party for their co-operation in this matter.  I particularly thank Deputy Michael Noonan for the constructive points he made.  I consider them to be helpful and I assure him I shall take them on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my first ten years in the House I was involved in Finance Bill debates, both in my early years as a Government backbencher and as an Opposition backbencher. I concur with the remarks made by Deputies.  When we were involved in discussions on the Programme for Government we considered the issue of special committees and the way Bills should be taken.  I asked that the issue be at least examined.  It was not the first time I did so.  I co-operated with the Leader of the Fine Gael Party extensively in 1983, when he put forward good proposals.  I was party Whip and Shadow Leader of <Col N="2443" /> the House at the time.  Although we did not get our own way, we set up the Committee of Expenditure and introduced new regulations for the Committee of Public Accounts.  They proved successful.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects I should like to address.  I have been asked about dates. The Department will not be using any devices.  Deputy Noonan was gracious enough to acknowledge that the people involved in the budget section of the Department will not have too much spare time between now and the effective conclusion of the Finance Bill because they are involved in a huge process.  The procedure followed does serve democracy well and gives outside people a major say in the the legislation.  I was present years ago on a day when the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain introduced a Finance Bill and it was hard to imagine how one could issue a Finance Bill without taking into account the views of various interest groups.  Obviously, it works in some form under the United Kingdom system but I do not believe it would work here.</P>
    <P>The second issue, and probably more important, concerns a committee system. I shall give serious consideration to the way in which a committee system would work.  I do not know about the days, but it has always been my view that with the amount of attention paid to each section and each provision in the Finance Bill, the amount of party posturing &mdash; to use the expression Deputy Noonan used this morning &mdash; a committee process with experts from the Department of Finance the Revenue Commissioners and other appropriate advisers, would be much more meaningful.  This morning Deputy Noonan asked me to examine a committee process, and I shall certainly do that.  The second request was that if that was not feasible there should be some way of extending the number of days available.  The first proposal is attractive to me because it is a sensible suggestion but I am only expressing a personal <Col N="2444" /> opinion and shall have to take the matter up with the Government in due course.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Estimates for the Public Services (Abridged Version) 1992 and Summary Public Capital Programme: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Minister for Finance on 18 December 1991:</P>
    <P>That Dáil éireann takes note of the 1992 Estimates for the Public Services (Abridged Version) and of the 1992 Summary Public Capital Programme.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>noting that the 1992 Estimates for the Public Service and the 1991 Summary Public Capital Programme</P>
    <P>(a)  fail to provide for a number of commitments freely entered into by the Government including those on public service pay, the reduction of the pupil/teacher ratio at primary level, and an increase in Overseas Development Aid;</P>
    <P>(b)  provide for an increase in the <Col N="2445" /> daily charges for hospital patients of 25 per cent, representing a total increase of 50 per cent in 12 months, but do not include any specific commitments to assist the plight of the mentally handicapped and their families, despite the clearly established need in this area;</P>
    <P>(c)  will result in further reduction in capital expenditure on areas like public housing and the construction and equipping of primary schools;</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy De Rossa.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to note that, in the 1992 Estimate there is no provision at this stage for any increases in the rates of payment that might be granted in the forthcoming budget.  Neither is there provision made in the Estimates for a 1992 Christmas bonus.  In accordance with normal practice that will be decided later in the year.  In order to understand how the net figures has been arrived at one should consider how the social welfare services are funded.  The total social welfare expenditure is comprised of insurance-based payments, funded from the Social Insurance Fund, and assistance payments which are totally Exchequer-funded.</P>
      <P>The Social Insurance Fund is financed mainly by PRSI contributions from employers, employees and the self-employed. The Exchequer makes up the balance to meet expenditure for the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gross expenditure for 1992 is projected at £3,270 million compared with a <Col N="2446" /> projected outturn of £3,100 million in 1991.  This is the amount required to finance and preserve all existing schemes and services, a huge amount of money by any standards.  Each day of the year we spend nearly £2.6 million on the elderly, the same amount on the unemployed, around £2.3 million on family support, and over £1 million on the sick.  The 1992 Estimates show the Exchequer contribution to the Social Insurance Fund at £101 million which, though 33 per cent lower than the provisional outturn for 1991, is strictly not comparable with that figure for the reason I gave earlier.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer makes up the shortfall between the income of the Social Insurance Fund &mdash; mainly PRSI contributions &mdash; and the expenditure on benefits. This is done through Subhead C of the Estimate.  Included in the 1992 Estimates is increased PRSI income arising mainly from higher earnings next year and from indexation of the earnings ceiling.</P>
    <P>Therefore the Estimates are not strictly comparable because the 1992 Estimates at this stage do not include provision for whatever budget increases may be granted next year or for a Christmas bonus.  These will significantly change the position so far as the Exchequer contribution to the Social Insurance Fund is concerned.</P>
    <P>The 1992 Estimate for unemployment assistance shows an increase on the 1991 provisional outturn of 13 per cent.  This is due mainly to three factors:&mdash; a higher projected level of recipients; the additional cost in 1992 of the 1991 budget increases, and an extra pay day in 1992.</P>
    <P>The live register underlying the 1992 Estimate is 275,000.</P>
    <P>Payment for more than 12,000 small holders is included in this allocation which is necessary to supplement the income of small farmers and their relatives.</P>
    <P>The lone parent's allowance brings together means-tested schemes for persons bringing up children on their own. The categories covered by the scheme <Col N="2447" /> are: unmarried persons; separated persons; widowed persons and prisoners' spouses.</P>
    <P>The 1992 Estimate for lone parent's allowance is up 14 per cent.  This is due mainly to a projected increase in the number of recipients, particularly unmarried mothers, which, on present trends, are expected to increase from an average of approximately 20,200 this year to 22,650 in 1992.  There is also an extra pay day for these recipients next year and, of course, the 1991 budget improvements will cost more because they will be in force for the full year in 1992.</P>
    <P>The cost of the pre-retirement allowance is expected to increase very significantly in 1992 because of increased numbers.  The scheme was introduced in March 1990 to provide more flexible signing arrangements for older unemployed persons.  Initially, it was made available to persons aged 60 years or over.  In April this year, the qualifying age was reduced to 58.  Over 2,000 persons have availed of the extension.  The total number in receipt of pre-retirement allowance is currently 8,300.</P>
    <P>As well as increased numbers, other cost factors in 1992 include the carry-over of the 1991 budget improvements and an extra pay day.</P>
    <P>The increase of 13 per cent on family income supplement is due mainly to the additional cost in 1992 of the improvements introduced in the 1991 budget. These included the abolition of maximum rates and increases in income limits.</P>
    <P>The cost of the carer's allowance is expected to increase in 1992 by a very sizeable 68 per cent.  This is due mainly to the extension of the scheme to persons caring for recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance with effect from the end of July this year.  The additional recipients will be in receipt of carer's allowance throughout the whole of 1992 and this will add significantly to the cost of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the health boards and caters for persons in need who do not qualify under any of the other <Col N="2448" /> social welfare scheme or who may be in receipt of an interim payment until their claims are processed.  The cost of the scheme is financed by my Department by way of advances to the health boards. There has been a big increase in expenditure on this scheme in 1991 and the reasons for this are being examined.  They mainly stem from the fact that unanticipated demands for rent and mortgage interest supplements, as well as interim payment claims, have greatly increased costs.  The decrease of 4 per cent in the amount required in 1992 is due mainly to certain once-off arrears payments to health boards in 1991.</P>
    <P>As in other areas of Government expenditure, it has been necessary to make certain adjustments in social welfare expenditure in 1992 in the light of the severe financial constraints facing the Government.  The main thrust of these adjustments is to use social welfare resources more effectively and more efficiently.</P>
    <P>The measures include the re-routing of short term sickness payments through the employer, thus facilitating the integration of short term sickness payments with the taxation system; better control of social welfare expenditure and a number of adjustments in schemes designed to achieve better targeting of resources at those most in need.</P>
    <P>There are specific measures on which decisions have been taken by the Government and which will be given effect in legislation early in 1992.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that with effect from next April all weekly disability benefit and occupational injuries benefit payments will be treated as income for tax purposes.  The mechanisms for implementing these arrangements are currently under urgent examination in my Department.  It is envisaged that they will include a combination of a statutory sick pay scheme under which for an intial period &mdash; say four weeks &mdash; responsibility for sickness payments will be transferred to employers with an appropriate compensatory arrangement and, for claims in excess of four weeks duration, other <Col N="2449" /> arrangements will be made to integrate disability benefit with employers' payroll systems and with the taxation system generally.  Some payments under the occupational injuries benefit scheme will also be rationalised.</P>
    <P>Relevant aspects of the proposals will be presented to the central review committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> for discussion with the employer organisations.  The necessary legal provisions will be included in next year's Social Welfare and Finance Bills.</P>
    <P>Contribution conditions for receipt of social welfare benefits require claimants to have, in the first instance, a certain minimum number of paid contributions and, thereafter, a minimum number of paid or credited contributions in a recent contribution year.</P>
    <P>At present people can be entitled to short term social welfare payments mainly on the basis of credited contributions and without any recent record or paid contributions.  The Government have decided that, in the interests of better targeting of benefits, entitlement to disability and treatment benefits will be subject to a minimum number of paid contributions in the previous year.  These arrangements will apply to new claimants only.  Existing recipients will not be affected.</P>
    <P>In line with the approach that schemes should be better targeted, the Government have decided that from April next persons earning in excess of £25,000 a year will not be entitled to treatment &mdash; dental and optical &mdash; benefit.</P>
    <P>Legislation was introduced earlier this year in the Social Welfare Act, 1991, for the discontinuance of the `old' maternity scheme.  The scheme has been largely superseded by the maternity scheme for women in employment which was recently extended to cover part-time working women.  Arrangements are now being made to amend the scheme for women in employment in order to cater for a certain small number of working women who would otherwise not be covered by that scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government are concerned with recent trends in relation to the claiming <Col N="2450" /> of unemployment benefit which is being used to top up voluntary severance payments and early retirement packages. Measures to control this development are currently being worked out.  Details will be announced in next year's Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>As a further measure to target payments to those most in need, entitlement to deserted wife's benefit will be restricted where recipients have substantial earnings from employment in addition to their benefit.  It is intended that the restriction would apply above the level of average earnings, that is around £12,000 a year.  The details will be provided for in next year's Social Welfare Bill.  This restriction will apply to new claimants only.  Existing recipients will not be affected.</P>
    <P>A series of control measures will be implemented during 1992 aimed at improved PRSI collection and the elimination of fraud and abuse of social welfare schemes.  Considerable progress has been achieved this year, particularly in reducing PRSI-related fraud, and that progress will be continued into next year. The PRSI system is central to our policy of providing an adequate social welfare system and no abuse of any kind will be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Nineteen ninety-one has been a further year of improvement in our social welfare services which demonstrates once again the Government's commitment to maintaining the value of social welfare payments. In the past 12 months, we have implemented the increases in weekly social welfare payments announced in the budget.  They were: a general increase of 4 per cent; special increases of 11 per cent in short term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance; a special increase of 6 per cent in long term unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>We have introduced improved payments for children through higher rate of child benefit for the 4th child onwards; minimum payment of £12 for each child dependant; child dependant allowances to continue up to age 21 for children in full-time education whose parents are on long term payments; made further <Col N="2451" /> improvements to the family income supplement which will be developed further as a central support mechanism for working families on low incomes; introduced <i>pro-rata</i> pensions for people who have a mixture of full-rate and modified rate contributions.  I signed regulations to that effect recently.</P>
    <P>We have also allowed recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance to retain their entitlement to free travel when they enter residential care.  By virtue of having their free travel pass, they will also be able to avail of the &ldquo;companion&rdquo; pass introduced in 1990. We have reduced the age limit from 60 to 58 years for qualification for the pre-retirement allowance.  Under the scheme, the long term unemployed aged 58 or over have the option of transferring to a pension book system which they can cash at their local post office.  That avoids weekly attendance at their local employment exchange.</P>
    <P>Another area of significant achievement in 1991 was in developing links with the voluntary social services sector.  This support will be continued next year despite current financial restrictions.</P>
    <P>A number of schemes are involved in this area.  In 1991, £500,000 was made available to provide support and assistance to over 350 locally based women's groups.  This scheme will be continued in 1992.  In 1991, £750,000 was spent on community development programmes including six new projects in north Dublin, north Wicklow, Waterford, west Cork, north Mayo-west Sligo and Kilkenny.  The programme will also be continued in 1992.  In 1991, £750,000 was made available for this scheme of grants for once-off projects in the voluntary social services area.  This year, 161 organisations were funded under the scheme.</P>
    <P>All of the necessary preliminary work associated with the preparation of the charter for voluntary social services has now been completed.  Proposals for consideration by the Government on a White Paper are currently being finalised.</P>
    <P>The most significant and far-reaching <Col N="2452" /> development during the year was the launching of a regional management structure for my Department.  This development represents a very important change in the way my Department delivers their services.</P>
    <P>The new approach to delivery of services is being achieved through: developing the one-stop-shop concept which will provide a broad range of services at a local level; improving and modernising buildings and offices around the country; giving greater autonomy to regional and local managements; improving liaison with FáS to ensure the best possible mix of training and employment opportunities for the long term unemployed, and improving local information services.</P>
    <P>Under the new regional management structure, the country has been divided into eight regions with a regional manager, supported by a small management team, in charge of each region.  The regional management centres have been established in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Dundalk, Sligo and Longford.  Regional managers will be responsible for the delivery of social welfare services in their regions.  My Department's offices in those areas will be converted into one-stop-shops for all social welfare services.</P>
    <P>A new social welfare services office was opened in Ennis in September 1991 which, as well as catering for unemployed people, also provides a range of services to pensioners, lone parents and other social welfare claimants.  This brings to 11 the number of new offices opened since 1987.  Work on a new office at Finglas, Dublin, has commenced and is due for completion in July-August next year. I am glad to report to the House that planning is proceeding for offices at Navan Road and Tallaght with a view to construction starting in October-November 1992.</P>
    <P>As part of the decentralisation projects planned for my Department, new offices will also be provided in Longford, Kilkenny, Wexford and Dundalk.</P>
    <P>A programme of improvements is also underway in our existing offices around the country.  These include: a new fresh <Col N="2453" /> claims area which was completed in Waterford; a major refit of the Cavan office which is nearing completion and a new base for social welfare officers in Galway which is also nearing completion. In addition, a contract for an extension and refit of the Mullingar office has just been placed and work is expected to start in the New Year.  Plans for major work at Carlow and Athlone are well advanced and work should start next year.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the continuing need to control expenditure in the social welfare area.  Despite that constraint, we are committed to maintaining and improving our social welfare system and to making sure that special consideration is given to the most vulnerable sections of our society.  Much has been achieved in recent years but there is much still to be done.</P>
    <P>During my term in office, I intend to make a meaningful contribution to the development, consolidation and delivery of our services, particularly to those most in need.  I want to ensure that our schemes and services are fair to our social welfare customers and at the same time that the taxpayer who pays dearly for these services gets value for money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly pleased that I am speaking in this debate after the Minister for Social Welfare because much of what I want to say relates to expenditure on social welfare and, in particular, to three aspects of it. The first is the almost complete lack of targeting.  We do very little to zone in on those who are less well off so as to give them more assistance.  Yet we give hundreds of millions of pounds to people who do not need it.  Children's allowances are a case in point.  For example, some very wealthy people get free telephone rental, free travel and free electricity allowances while many of those who are living in poverty do not get these allowances. That is one area I want to address at some length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second area relates to the creation of abuse and anti-social problems by our social welfare policy.  I have in mind, in <Col N="2454" /> particular, the unmarried mothers' allowance. Far be it from me to attack the concept of the unmarried mothers allowance but the reality is that tens of thousands of young girls have been caught in this trap because if they get married they will lose this allowance.  The Minister gave the alarming figure of a 14 per cent projected increase in the lone parents allowance next year.  This is only one aspect of the problems created by our social welfare policy.</P>
    <P>We also create problems by refusing to grant unemployment assistance to young unemployed persons who are living at home.  These young people who are forced to leave home not only qualify for unemployment assistance but for a medical card and a rent subsidy.  This costs the State a great deal more money as well as having the effect of breaking up families and creating problems in the rented housing sector by increasing demand and pushing up rents which, in turn, adds to the Exchequer cost as the rent subsidy has to be increased.  This is just a flavour of what I want to say about expenditure on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The third area relates to poverty traps. The Minister did not refer to this in his speech.  The Government spend hundreds of millions of pounds causing poverty, trapping people in poverty and causing unemployment.  Over the past four years I have written articles before the budget to show what the Government are doing.  The table I produced last year shows that a married couple on unemployment assistance with four children already poorly off will be worse off if they take up a job on the average industrial wage.  After the 1991 budget they would have been £23.08 worse off.  That poverty trap has got wider over the past four years.  I want to emphasise that people who are living on unemployment payments are living in poverty and are not getting too much.  Yet if they take up a job on the average industrial wage &mdash; most people on social welfare will take up jobs on less than the average industrial wage &mdash; they will be a great deal worse off.  How can we expect people who are <Col N="2455" /> already living in poverty to make their situation worse.  This is a real problem.</P>
    <P>It seems that Governments have difficulty in co-ordinating their policies. There is no Minister for employment.  I plead with the Government to set up a Department for employment which would look at all aspects of Government policy and how they affect the workplace. The Minister for Social Welfare is doing one thing and the Minister for the Environment is doing another in terms of differential rents which affect the value of social welfare.  The Minister for Health deals with medical cards while the Minister for Justice deals with the issue of civil and criminal legal aid.</P>
    <P>People who are working have such deductions from their basic pay as PAYE, PRSI and occupational pension contributions.  They also have to pay their transport costs to work plus an additional differential rent if they live in a corporation house, or a mortgage repayment if they live in a private house.  They also have to pay their trade union contributions and minimum VHI cover. They do not get a Christmas bonus, a medical card, a family income supplement or a free fuel allowance.  After all those adjustments, a couple with four children on the average industrial wage will have a disposable income of £118.75 this year whereas a couple with four children on unemployment assistance will have £141.83.  These people are not well off.  Not alone do the unemployed have to deal with the humiliation and depression of not working but they are trapped in this position because of the Government's failure to face up to a number of problems.  As I said, hundreds of millions of pounds are being spent in causing unemployment and poverty.</P>
    <P>Over the past four years I have pleaded in this House &mdash; when I was in Government I wrote a memorandum to the then Minister for Social Welfare on this issue &mdash; for the introduction of a single means test.  At present there are something like 17 means tests.  As I have said before, the Minister for Health heard me talking <Col N="2456" /> about this only last week, we degrade those who lose their jobs and are on social welfare by putting them through the hoop 17 times for their entitlements.  Most of the means tests involved different criteria and all a great deal of official time.</P>
    <P>Three or four years ago, when Mr. MacSharry was Minister for Finance the Government set up an interdepartmental committee to look at the idea of having one national eligibility test.  I urge again that this be brought about so that people will not have to go to 17 different offices, sometimes 17 expensive bus journeys away, but will be able to go to the local health centre to be assessed for means.  I would urge also that any certificate granted be valid for the next year even if there is an improvement in means in the intervening period because that is one of the factors that comes into play when a person is offered a job.  He has to ask himself if he will be better or worse off, if he will lose his medical card, if he will lose his rent subsidy, if he will lose help with his ESB bill.  I urge those two points for the reason I have given and because officials based locally would have local knowledge and this would minimise abuse of the system.  If people did not have to give up these benefits as soon as they got a job they would not be discouraged from improving their lot.</P>
    <P>Another thing I would urge is that the means test be based on net pay rather than gross pay.  It is absurd that somebody who is working should be ineligible for benefits on the basis that their gross pay is over the guideline when their take home pay is under the guideline.  This is one of the greatest anomalies.  It is one of the things that is causing unemployment and encouraging the black economy. People are forced to abuse the system. They are forced into poverty or to staying in poverty.  It is the Irish equivalent of the Indian caste system.  India is a poor country.  I was there and I was appalled by the poverty.  I do not see Indian poverty ever being relieved because no matter how good they are they cannot rise above their caste.  Our social welfare system is just like that.  If people try to improve their lot legally, they will be <Col N="2457" /> worse off.  So they are trapped in poverty and we are spending hundreds of millions of pounds on that system.  I therefore urge the idea of one means test a year, done locally and based on net pay.  If a person's situation allows any improvement during the year in question, that should not be taken into account.  A person should not lose his medical card or other benefits during that full year.</P>
    <P>Another thing I would urge is that young people who are unemployed and living at home should get their unemployment assistance or at least a large proportion of it and should not be disqualified because of the means of their father or mother or other family members.  This would be cheaper for the State because it would not force people out into private flats where they then qualify for rent subsidy, for medical cards and other benefits thus costing the State a fortune and breaking up families.  Here are two areas where the State can remove anomalies, cut down on abuse and save hundreds of millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>The third area of social welfare spending is the very delicate and very tricky question of unmarried mothers' allowances. The appalling revelation in the Minister's speech that we are budgeting for a 14 per cent increase in unmarried mothers' allowances in 1992 will shock the entire country.  It would be wrong to make changes in unmarried mothers' allowances which did not provide for the girl who finds herself pregnant and in distress.  However, it is equally wrong that we should continue a regime which traps young women and young men in an unmarried state when they want to get married, because if they marry they lose out.  As this is a matter that needs to be handled very sensitively I suggest the setting up of an inter departmental task force to report within a short number of months to look at the social problems that the present regime is creating and avoid adversely affecting those who really need and deserve the assistance of the State at a time of crisis in their life without creating all the anomalies that are so evident.  As public representatives <Col N="2458" /> we know there are thousands of unmarried couples living together while the woman is in receipt of unmarried mothers' allowance.  I know that theoretically cohabitation is a disqualifying factor but the present regime leads to that abuse.  It leads to other social problems. Therefore, I am asking the Minister to consider setting up an interdepartmental task force which would consult with the Council for the Status of Women and other interest groups on how to address this problem.</P>
    <P>When I went to study the social welfare system in Great Britain about two years ago I was very surprised to discover that they do not have an unmarried mothers' allowance.  Nor is there one in Northern Ireland.  I am sure the country will be shocked to hear that.  In Great Britain a single parent is considered on means just like other unemployed applicants.</P>
    <P>The one thing single parents here must not do is to take up a job because they would lose the single parent allowance. That is another poverty trap, another anti-marriage trap.  We are now providing something close to £130 million under this heading alone for next year at a time of crisis, at a time of poverty.  The present unmarried mother's allowance is not means tested.  It is an endless commitment, not confined to one, two or three years.  This does not make sense.  It means that if a girl gets to the stage where she wants to marry she loses that and is worse off, and she probably loses her medical card and lots of other things as well.  It is a trap.  I am not asking that the payment itself or the gentle, caring consideration of single mothers be abandoned. That would be absolutely wrong and very much against all I believe in. However we should not be stupid.  We should not force young women or young couples into poverty traps or into anti-marriage traps.  At the same time, by bringing about the improvements I suggest we could save the Exchequer a lot of money.</P>
    <P>The main point I want to talk about is the appalling unemployment figures and the irrelevance of this House in regard to them.  At the moment our unemployment <Col N="2459" /> figure is 264,800.  Add to that 11,229 on pre-retirement allowance and credits who used to be on the register and the figure goes up to 276,000.  If we add those who are on social employment schemes and on FáS training courses it goes up to 300,000.  In the last seven years 188,000 people net have emigrated from the country.  I checked these figures this morning with the Central Statistics Office.  Leaving aside social employment schemes and FAS and adding the 188,000 people who left the country to the 276,000 who are now registered as unemployed we have an appalling figure of 450,000 unemployed.  That is close to 39 per cent of our workforce.</P>
    <P>This is not a failure of the Government but of society.  To extrapolate the problem ahead, our workforce is increasing at a rate of 30,000 per year.  In nine years time, at the end of this century that is 270,000 people.  This doubles the present register of unemployed without taking emigration into account at all.  We clearly cannot sustain this.  It is an emergency. Words like &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; and &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; are used far too often in discussions in this House.</P>
    <P>There is a national emergency in relation to unemployment and emigration and that is why I called for a Department of Employment and a Minister. It is often asked what difference that would make; in Britain when they created a Department of Employment, in the following five years unemployment fell by 44 per cent.  It was not just because a Department of Employment had been created, economic growth obviously helped, but also that the Department of Employment looked at employment and the workplace and implemented policy changes.  For instance, they decided that means testing for State benefits would be levied on net pay, not take-home pay. They also started the process of reducing income tax so that the value of gross pay was higher.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to accept the offer of this side of the House to set up an employment forum, similar to the New Ireland Forum on Northern Ireland. <Col N="2460" /> We need such a forum because some of the measures which will have to be taken will be politically difficult for any one party.  Measures will only be put in place if we all agree the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>In a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> Deputy Garret FitzGerald highlighted the fact that economic growth in Spain and Portugal, although less than in this country over the past ten years, created more jobs than had been created here. He called for a study into the reasons for economic growth not creating jobs.  It is central to the problem facing the country to create a Department of Employment and to accept Fine Gael's proposal for an all-party forum on unemployment as the Estimates are being increased by the ever-growing unemployment figures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Health (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Jim Mitchell's contribution.  I am pleased to be able to speak in this debate on the Department of Health where, despite a particularly difficult financial climate, the Government have been careful to ensure that there will be sufficient resources for an efficient, responsive health service in 1992.  To this end we have allocated a gross total of £1,748.003 million to the health services next year, representing an increase of £95.8 million, or 5.8 per cent over the health expenditure outturn for 1991.  When account is taken of Appropriations-in-Aid, the net vote for the health services in 1992 will be £1,529.003 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By far the most significant element of health spending is the non-capital element.  The Government non-capital provision for the health services has increased by a total of £86.709 million, which is 5.4 per cent higher than the non-capital outturn figure for the year just ending.  This underlines our commitment to protecting and, where possible, carefully developing, our health services in a time of severe financial constraints.  A smaller but very important component of health expenditure is the amount allocated each year for capital purposes.  I am pleased to remind the House that the total capital provision for health services <Col N="2461" /> in 1992 will be £43 million, which is slightly higher than last year's figure.  This will enable us to meet our priority commitments and proceed with the planned development of selected community-based and hospital services.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Tallaght Hospital, I want to put on record the Government's commitment to the provision of a hospital to cater for the people of that area.  Tallaght and its hinterland have a population of about a quarter of a million people.  In the context of the restructured health services in the Dublin area it is essential that Tallaght, as one of the five new areas, should have adequate hospital facilities.  To this end, I am taking two initiatives: The recommendations made by the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, chaired by Professor David Kennedy, played a key part in the Government's consideration of the new structures to be put in place in the Dublin area.  I, therefore, as the first of these initiatives, met Professor Kennedy and his group yesterday and I formally requested them to consider the most appropriate way of providing hospital services for this area including possible funding mechanisms, and to report to me within six months; the second initiative I intend to take is to meet immediately after Christmas with the Tallaght Hospital Board and with all the many groups in that area who have a keen interest in the early provision of hospital services.</P>
    <P>The Estimate will make it possible to: maintain acute hospital services at approved 1991 levels, with a continuing availability of 12,000 beds; fund a number of hospital developments commissioned in 1991, notably those at St. James's Ardkeen, Wexford, Sligo, and the acute psychiatric unit at Naas; and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;undertake a number of very important improvements in services, in both hospitals and the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2462" /> While this is, of course, a very satisfactory prospect, and one which I am glad to report, I must emphasise that it will continue to be necessary for all agencies to manage their affairs very tightly, so that the agreed objective are achieved without incurring any excess expenditure. I must also, of course, acknowledge that despite the significant increase in resources they will not be sufficient to meet all the needs which agencies have brought to the attention of my Department.</P>
    <P>I have made provision in these Estimates for the further development of services for persons suffering from AIDS or from the HIV virus and I intend to give particular priority to this during the coming year.  The new National AIDS Strategy Committee (which I announced recently at the conference in St. Brendan's Hospital to mark World AIDS Day) and which I myself will chair, will have its first meeting tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The Estimates have made provision for the following measures in particular: the appointment of a second consultant in this specialty on the north side of Dublin, to complement the services already provided in St. James's Hospital.  This new post will be filled early in 1992; additional hospital beds will be provided, as needs arise, to care for acute phases of the condition; funding will be provided for health education programmes in the media, in schools and at community level; there will be additional funding for community-based services including services provided by the voluntary agencies; and there will be additional funding for services aimed at drug misusers.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned at the waiting lists for services in the mental handicap area, and in my statement in the Dáil on 11 December I make it clear that I intended to make the development of mental handicap services one of my main priorities.  The Estimates for 1992 will enable me to provide: more residential and day places to meet the needs of urgent cases on the waiting-lists; additional respite facilities to assist family carers; and emergency residential services for circumstances in which family <Col N="2463" /> caring arrangements break down suddenly.</P>
    <P>The Estimate provides for a wide range of urgently needed service developments in a number of acute hospitals throughout the country.  In the Eastern Health Board area, funds are being provided to enable a new phase of St. James's Hospital to be brought into service immediately.  This major new 279 bed facility, involving a capital investment of approximately £70 million will replace sub-standard accommodation on the St. James's site.  It will also provide a new suite of 11 operating theatres, a new burns unit and a coronary care and intensive care unit.  Funds will also be allocated to develop the national neurosurgical unit in Beaumont Hospital.  This will involve the appointment of two new neurosurgeons, who will be taking up duty in early 1992.</P>
    <P>A new special unit for oncology patients has recently been built at Crumlin Children's Hospital.  Special funding will be allocated to enable the unit to be brought into full service during 1992. Funds are also being provided to enable cardiology services at Crumlin Hospital to be expanded by the appointment of a second paediatric cardiologist.  The metabolic unit at Temple Street Hospital provides the national screening service for the detection of PKU and other metabolic disorders in newborn infants. Because of the increasing demands on the service, additional funds are being allocated to allow for expansion.</P>
    <P>Funds are also being allocated to expand orthopaedic services at Cappagh Hospital and to improve oncology and anaesthetic services at St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park.  The Government will also allocate funds to facilitate a gradual increase in cardiac surgery activity in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In the South Eastern Health Board area funds are being allocated to enable further phases of the major new 470 bed Ardkeen Regional Hospital in Waterford to be brought into service during 1992. This major new facility costing some £60.5 million involves the transformation <Col N="2464" /> of an old dispersed sanatorium building into a 21st century hospital.</P>
    <P>Apart from enhancing those services these excellent new facilities incorporate a wide range of additional services including a new geriatric assessment unit, a new coronary care unit, and new departments of dietetics, speech therapy and occupational therapy.  There will also be a major expansion in operating theatre facilities and in the radiology department.</P>
    <P>Funds are being allocated to enable a range of facilities at the new Wexford General Hospital which cost some £13 million to build to be brought into service immediately.  The additional services include a new surgical department.  The new hospital also includes new operating theatres and recovery area, together with new radiology, out-patients and casualty departments and the provision of a specialist paediatric service for the Wexford area.</P>
    <P>In the North-Western Health Board area, funds are being allocated to enable the new Sligo General Hospital, which cost £30.5 million to build, to be brought fully into service during 1992.  Additional funds are being provided to facilitate the commencement of an in-patient orthopaedic service at Letterkenny General Hospital.  In the Midland Health Board area, funds are being allocated to expand specialist services at Tullamore, General Hospital.</P>
    <P>In the Mid-Western Health Board area, funds are being allocated to implement service improvements at the Limerick Regional Hospital and at Croom Orthopaedic Hospital.  These are further examples of the Government's approach to a planned and careful response to emerging health needs throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In the Southern Health Board the Government are allocating funds to expand specialist services at the Cork Regional Hospital and also at Tralee General and the South Infirmary/ Victoria Hospitals.  An additional cardiac surgeon post is being approved at the Cork Regional Hospital to reduce the present waiting list for heart <Col N="2465" /> surgery.  Improvements will also be implemented in the board's orthopaedic services.</P>
    <P>In the Western Health Board area, the Government are allocating funds to improve ENT services at University College Hospital, Galway and in the NorthEastern Health Board area, we are making funds available to develop ENT services for the region.</P>
    <P>Shortly after taking up office I met the chairperson and director of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  I confirmed to them the availability of the £100,000 previously committed by my predecessor and we discussed the centre's development needs in 1992.  I am now glad to be able to confirm an additional £52,000 for the centre in 1992, on top of the £100,000 already agreed.  Of the additional £52,000, £25,000 is by way of further funding from my Department and the balance consists of services to the value of £27,000 which will be provided by the Eastern Health Board.  In addition, the Government are providing further funding to the rape crises centre in Clonmel, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterfod to bring their funding per centre up to £25,000.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record that I am very pleased that we have been enabled to take a very careful look at the fine work which is being done in the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and, indeed, in the other rape crisis centres throughout the country.  Following the anouncement which I have made here today, I intend to visit the various centres and to talk to the many fine people there, both professional and voluntary workers to work out with them a planned programme for their necessary work and for the support and succour they give to so many women throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in the Estimates for the payment of £6 million to haemophiliacs, in accordance with the agreement which was reached earlier this year with their representatives and recently approved by the High Court. This brings to £8 million the total amount which has been made available to help this group.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2466" /> In regard to the liver transplant programme, my Department entered into a formal agreement earlier this year under which public patients from this country have surgery at the King's College Hospital in London.  Under the agreement, Irish medical and nursing staff are being assigned to King's College Hospital to receive training and experience so that a liver transplant programme can be re-established in Ireland as soon as possible. The Government are providing funds to St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, and Crumlin Children's Hospital to facilitate the eventual resumption of the programme in this country.</P>
    <P>On the capital side, Deputies will be aware that, as I noted earlier, my Department's allocation for 1992 is £43 million. This level of allocation gives some scope for starting new building projects such as the continuation of development projects at Ardkeen Hospital, Waterford, Sligo General Hospital, the Rotunda Hospital and for the commencement of construction of an important extension to St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny.  This much needed extension has been sought for a long time.  I pay tribute to the excellent staff who work in St. Luke's Hospital and who have for so long worked in unsatisfactory conditions.  The Government are particularly pleased that the commitment which was given last year is to be implemented and that the formal award of the contract will be announced in the first few days of January.  After that has been done, I hope to visit the hospital and to meet with all the people who work here and with the patients also.</P>
    <P>We have also been able to provide for the development of the laboratory and psychiatric unit at the Mater Hospital, and the bone marrow unit at St. James's Hospital.  There will also be a number of minor hospital improvements at different locations around the country.  Provisions will be made for final account payments for a number of ongoing projects, the purchase of urgent replacement equipment and a number of urgently required fire precaution and asset renewal schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2467" /> In line with the recommendations contained in the report on the development of our psychiatric services &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;, the policy of diverting capital resources towards the psychiatric services will be continued in 1992 as resources permit.  Hostels, day hospitals, day care facilities and other community facilities are envisaged.  I am pleased to tell the House also, that a new mental health centre will be built at Longford in 1992 and construction work will also commence on a new centre for autistic persons at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview.</P>
    <P>In the case of services for people with physical and mental handicap, the Government will ensure that the available capital funds will be concentrated on the provision of the community services necessary.  For example, a capital contribution will be made towards the cost of providing new Cheshire Homes at Monkstown and Sligo and capital funding will also be provided for a new acute unit and residential accommodation for mentally handicapped persons at St. Vincent's, Navan Road.</P>
    <P>On the community health side, the building work on the major new health centre at Shannon will be continued and investment will be made in a number of other areas, including the fluoridation of water supplies around the country.  The Government have also decided to make funding available for various community welfare projects such as the provision of an AIDS centre in Dublin and for projects in the child care area, including one in Cork.</P>
    <P>We have been able to make a start in the task of creating a viable infrastructure for community-based service for the elderly and we will press ahead with our plans.  I believe that within the general budgetary constraints faced by the country as a whole, these are very significant and worth-while developments.</P>
    <P>The public hospital in-patient charge applicable to non-medical card holders, currently £12.50 per day, will be increased to £15 per day.  I am making the announcement in the House so that <Col N="2468" /> there will not be cries afterwards that I sought to evade the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a small but essential increase in the contribution. The overall health budget is remarkable in the circumstances.  Deputy Ferris and everyone in the House knows that despite the very difficult circumstances appertaining at present, the Government have very clearly nailed their colours to the mast with regard to health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This group are paying twice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a small but essential increase in the contributions made by patients in public hospitals, and medical card holders will continue to be exempt.  Other exemptions include women receiving services in respect of motherhood, children up to six weeks of age, children receiving treatment for certain long term conditions, children referred from child health examinations and persons suffering from infectious diseases. It is important to note &mdash; and I have insisted &mdash; that charges will not be levied in any other cases where the hospital is satisfied that hardship would result; patients who would otherwise be liable for the charge may be granted a waiver.  Deputies will also be aware that it is possible to insure against the charges under a low-cost VHI plan.</P>
      <P>In the time available today, Deputies will appreciate that it has only been possible to give a general overview of how my Department's 1992 Estimate has been framed in the context of the broad Estimates position.  However, I look forward to dealing with issues relevant to the Health Vote in much greater detail when my Department's 1992 Estimate is taken by the Dáil in the next session and, indeed, in many other debates which will take place in Private Members' time, Dáil Questions and various other arenas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to conclude by saying that despite the overall budgetary situation the Government have clearly recognised the need to make significant additional <Col N="2469" /> funding in real terms available to the health services for the development of key areas.  While the demands on resources are considerable, the Government's response must be seen as a major commitment to the steady improvement of our health services.</P>
    <P>I must make clear, however, that the benefits which this increased spending will yield must be maximised.  Initiatives at present under way in improved efficiency, in the development and application of value for money techniques and in management strategies must continue so that our health services can give the best service possible to the patient &mdash; which is the ultimate test of any health service.</P>
    <P>I commend the Estimates to the House and thank the Chair and the House for the opportunity to speak on them.  I look forward to this job and, despite some testy debates, I look forward to a strong thread of co-operation and continuity in the way we deal with health matters in the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will get the degree of constructive co-operation necessary from all sides of the House in dealing with health.  That co-operation is forthcoming with regard to all Government Departments.  It is our responsibility to co-operate, particularly at a time of economic crisis.</P>
      <P>I was glad to note the Minister's commitment to Nass Hospital, as it is in my constituency.  I ask the Minister to have regard to the second and third phases of development of that hospital which are tied to the Tallaght hospital development programme.  These phases are essential in providing an integrated health service in County Kildare and the back-up or &ldquo;in tandem&rdquo; facilities with the Tallaght hospital.  I say that in the knowledge the the Minister is fully aware of the situation and will be keeping a watchful friendly eye on proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health services generally have always been dominated by experts.  In the past it has been difficult to make changes in those services.  It would not be any <Col N="2470" /> harm to make a thorough review of thinking in the health services.  I draw the Minister's attention to the orthodontic services in the Eastern Health Board region.  There is a nationwide problem in regard to orthodontics and it is getting worse.  It is appalling that people who qualify for the service, who have medical cards, find that their children cannot gain access to what is a highly specialised and important service.  In the Eastern Health Board the consultant orthodontist may resign.  Since I became a member of that board ten or 12 years ago there has been a crisis in relation to orthodontics.  I hope the new Minister will deal with the problem so that we will not have to continuously appoint new specialists to fill the vacancy which recurs every year or so.  There cannot be a proper follow-up in a service of that nature, it becomes disjointed.</P>
    <P>In my brief comments on the issues facing the country I will keep in mind the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Health, whose brief I could only refer to briefly, and the Minister for Social Welfare who has spoken and with whose contribution my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, dealt at length.  Our huge unemployment problem is getting worse.  We are only dealing with the symptoms of the problem and not the source.  We need to reappraise what has gone on over the past few years to see where we have gone wrong, how and why.  Then we should tackle the problem at source rather than trying to deal with the end product, the vast number of people who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>The economic Departments such as Agriculture and Food and Industry and Commerce, will have to accept responsibility for providing job opportunities. The problem is much more serious than people realise.  There is nothing I or anybody can see on the horizon which is likely to solve the problem or attempt to do so at source.  As I said in a debate two weeks ago, we have the highest rate of unemployment in the Community, yet we do not seem to be able to capitalise on the benefits or perks available to us as members of the club.  It is not good <Col N="2471" /> enough to say over and again that Ministers and deputations have gone back and forth to Brussels to listen to the finer points of Eurospeak in which they tell us in a variety of ways that we have a nationwide problem or a European problem. There are ways of resolving the problems.</P>
    <P>We are not getting our fair share of the investment available in Europe for one reason or another.  We are part of Europe.  If an investor from Japan, Korea or the US considers investing in Europe, first he looks at the market and the workforce. We have the workforce.  We are in Europe, admittedly on the western fringe, but that does not preclude us from gaining access to markets on the Continent. Japan is an island and they do not seem to have any problems.  I tabled a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce asking for an indication of the proportion of new industrial investment this country achieved in comparison to that achieved by our European partners. The information was not available because the Minister did not have responsibility.  That vital information should be examined if we are to improve our position.  If we do not do that shortly, unfortunately, the young generation who form a large proportion of our population will become more and more sceptical.</P>
    <P>There are indications that young people are taking little interest in politics because the political system does not seem to be able to tackle the problems that directly affect them.  I can understand why they feel annoyed, frustrated and upset.  It behaves us to attempt to address the problem, and not wait until we are facing a crisis.  We need to change our tactics and tackle the problem.  In regard to agriculture, for example, we have what is known as the review of the Common Agricultural Policy taking place.</P>
    <P>I should say initially that everyone worldwide recognises that the Common Agricultural Policy pursued by the European Community had to be changed because it was unworkable.  It costs millions and billions of pounds and ECUs <Col N="2472" /> to store food in intervention.  Indeed, it would cost less to give it away than store it over a period of time.  It should also be remembered that at this moment there are people strarving all over the world. In Europe but outside the Community there are serious food shortages.  It takes so much time and energy to unravel this bureaucracy that it is almost inaccessible. That is a sad reflection on the European system and on our ability to deal with crises of that nature.  After all, we can fight wars and deliver bombs and armaments all over the world very quickly in an emergency but it seems we cannot unlock the stores to deliver food quickly to those who badly need it.  This matter should be addressed by our negotiators at European level during the next 12 months.  I have no doubt that they have taken this matter up in the past and will continue to do so in future but the problem is getting more serious.</P>
    <P>At the outset I referred to the attitude of young people towards public life and politics and their expectations in regard to what we can do for them.  I know they should expect us to do things for them but there is an obligation on us to chart a course and lay down the foundation stone on which they can build and achieve their objectives to some extent and provide for themselves as opposed to the nation providing for them by way of unemployment payments.  Our young generation, who are highly qualified and capable, are more than anxious to avail of any opportunities we create for them. If we cannot create them however there is no sense in us complaining and carping about the high cost of unemployment payments and so on.</P>
    <P>I have said in the House before, and I make no apology for repeating it now, that, in relation to job creation, agriculture has vast potential and it is amazing we have no worthwhile national plan. There is a European plan, the purpose of which is to limit production, and a GATT plan which will not help farmers one iota but no national plan which lays out clearly defined objectives to enable us respond to the demands of consumers and identify those areas where jobs can <Col N="2473" /> be created.  Such a plan does not exist and the Government will have to accept responsibility for this because the scene is changing.  For that reason we need to address the problem quickly and effectively. We should use our imagination and flair and get away from the idea of bureaucrats telling us that we cannot do certain things because if we do we will impinge on someone's rights.  We should attempt to resolve the problem and then talk about what will happen afterwards.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in industry we are in a straightjacket in the sense that this is an island nation and we do not have ready access to the main markets in Europe unlike some of our partners on the European mainland, but that is no excuse and it does not stand up.  It is now possible to travel long distances over a very short time using for example large ferries for which funds are available from the European Community.  We should utilise the funds available for infrastructural development to create a worthwhile industrial base.</P>
    <P>I am all for protecting the environment. This country could have a clean environment, be a lovely place to live or to visit on holidays but unless we provide jobs as a matter of extreme urgency there will be discontent, which is something an economy or a country cannot live with for too long.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago we dealt at length with the subject of the environment but at that time there were a number of matters which I did not have the time to address in regard to local authority funding.  Let us be honest and admit that the system has long since broken down.  It is not as if the legislation which was put in place years ago did not stand the test of time; it did but for a variety of reasons changes and modifications were made which has resulted in the system creaking and being almost unworkable in some instances.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House particularly to the condition of our roads and the question of housing, two major problems in both town and country at present.  One of the problems which comes up again and again in our clinics <Col N="2474" /> is housing.  However we are not in a position to help because we cannot provide local authority houses as they were provided in the past.  Again, the Government must accept responsibility for this.  I am not making a political point but the fact is that more and more people now wonder where they are going to be housed with the result more and more people are being ushered into private rented accommodation. If they are unemployed they can seek assistance from the health boards, and while they will not be able to live in luxury they will at least have a roof over their heads.  However, their difficulty is how to get out of this trap, the type of poverty trap which Deputy Mitchell referred to.  If a husband and wife with two or three children living in rented accommodation are in receipt of assistance from a health board to help them pay their rent and so on they will just about survive for a period of time. However if either the husband or wife obtains a job, then straight away most, if not all, the subvention is withdrawn with the result that they find themselves in rough seas once again.  They then have to provide for themselves and their family and think about where they are going to be housed because the landlord may well decide to sell the house or flat, when they will find themselves out on the road.</P>
    <P>The social housing programme announced by the Minister a year ago has been an abysmal disaster.  No imagination has been shown, and there are many things that should have been done since then.  For instance, legislation should have been passed long ago.  I accept that interim measures have been taken but, unfortunately, many people who had hoped to be in a position to provide themselves with their own houses have been disappointed.  It was announced at the beginning of the year that 1,000 houses would be provided under this plan but they have yet to materialise.  The Minister for the Environment must accept responsibility for the failure because it is up to him to bring forward the legislation.  Equally, many people who have been seeking local authority housing have been disappointed. <Col N="2475" /> In each local authority area there are between 600 and 700 families seeking to be rehoused but it is unlikely that they will be accommodated because no houses are being built to meet that problem.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I assure the Minister sitting opposite me that he will receive our full support if he introduces any programme to tackle crime.  The problem is becoming more serious as time goes on and it is not going to go away.  One of the main reasons for the upsurge in crime &mdash; the Minister may not agree there is an upsurge &mdash; is that there are too many people who think there is a good chance that they will get away with it.  Perhaps the system and our courts are cluttered up, our prisons are full and parents are not accepting responsibility but no excuse can be made for the hooliganism, albeit in isolated cases, which we have heard and read about in recent times when firemen and ambulance men were abused and stoned.  That simply is not acceptable. Until such time as the perpetrators of such violent acts, including car thieves, recognise that as soon as they pursue such a course there is a very good chance they will be caught and will pay the price for it we will not solve this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Increased provision is being made in respect of each Vote within the Justice group for 1992.  This is an indication of the Government's concern to ensure the protection of our citizens from wrong doers.  Even at a time of economic difficulty we cannot afford to cut back on law enforcement.  The primary duty of a Government is to ensure that people can live in peace and harmony, free from the fear of criminal attack on their persons or property.  This is a duty that this Government takes very seriously indeed. I intend in 1992 to continue to pursue the aims which I set myself when I was appointed Minister for Justice in July 1989, that is to reform and up-date the criminal law; to support and strengthen the Garda Síochána and to enhance and improve the effectiveness of the penal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2476" /> As the House will be aware, I have announced that a sum of £341 million is being provided in the Garda Vote in 1992 which represents an increase of 4 per cent on the provisional outturn for 1991.</P>
    <P>There will be an increased emphasis by all the agencies under my aegis, especially by the Garda on practical measures to deal with crime problems being experienced in certain urban areas. The paramount right of law abiding citizens to go about their daily lives in safety and confidence will be safeguarded and underwritten in every possible way.  A multi-disciplinary approach will be taken to the underlying problems of certain urban areas under particular pressure. This approach will be based, in part, on the advice of the recently established interdepartmental group of senior officials and gardaí which have already commenced their examination of the issues involved.  Side by side with this examination, the Garda assessment of policing requirements in areas of greatest difficulty, will be updated on a continuing basis so that effective response can be provided as and when required.</P>
    <P>The policy of increasing the number of civilians in Garda stations so as to release gardaí for outdoor duties, the work for which they were actually recruited and trained, will be pressed ahead and provision has been made for the recruitment of an additional 120 civilians of whom 70 will be clerical staff and 50 traffic wardens.</P>
    <P>The neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes will be expanded in 1992 and a new business watch scheme will be introduced reflecting recognition of the fact that business premises of all kinds continue to be seen as a major and lucrative target by criminal elements. Arrangements will be made for regular contact between the business community and senior gardaí at local and national level; 1992 will see the release of a special Garda video for schools.  The Garda schools programme already in place in Dublin and Limerick will be extended to Cork and Waterford and the special programmes for teenagers at risk will be <Col N="2477" /> continued in Southill in Limerick and in Coolock, Ronanstown and Killinarden in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Some teething problems which have been experienced with the use of the computerised command and control system in Dublin will be dealt with and the matter, which involves certain industrial relations issues, will be examined as a matter of urgency by the Irish Productivity Centre.  Arrangements to recruit a further 1,000 gardaí will proceed. Over 8,580 applicants sat the written test in September last and interviews of successful candidates from the test commenced earlier this month.  The management of the force will be strengthened by the promotion of 214 members at various levels to vacancies arising during 1992.</P>
    <P>The extremely successful community policing initiative approved by me last summer and put in place at 100 rural stations on 23 September is being fully reviewed at present.  The scheme has involved a drastic reduction in the time spent by rural gardaí on routine administrative and form-filling tasks.  The members of the force involved have been re-deploying on patrol duties, visits to the elderly, to schools and to community groups.  The scheme has been very warmly received in the areas which benefit from it.  One of the specific issues which will be examined following the review to which I have referred, in the matter of when the scheme will be extended to other areas.</P>
    <P>Fifty extra gardaí were specially assigned to traffic duties in 1991, bringing the total specially assigned to 340.  Seventeen clerical assistants were also assigned to release gardaí for traffic duties and ten more clerical assistants will be assigned to the Traffic Corps in 1992.  Six additional in-car traffic camera units will be installed in 1992, bringing the total to nine and 30 new speed guns will be supplied to the force, bringing the total of these to almost 300.  Extensive use of road checkpoints, of which there were over 10,000 per month over the past year, will continue in 1992.  The number of road deaths up to end September 1991 <Col N="2478" /> compared with the same period in 1990 showed a drop of 13 per cent with the number injured down by eight per cent. However, the sad fact that over 300 people lost their lives on the roads up to the end of September 1991 shows that there are no grounds for complacency.</P>
    <P>Violence against women will be the subject of specific attention by the law enforcement authorities in 1992.  I will host a national conference on the subject in Dublin Castle next October which will be addressed by leading experts from the professions, women's groups and voluntary agencies.  Senior Garda representatives, including the Garda Commissioner and senior management from relevant Government Departments as well as members of the Judiciary will attend.</P>
    <P>There will be a complete review of Garda procedures for dealing with cases involving violence, including domestic violence against women and an examination also of investigation procedures. A review of Garda training on this subject, which has been ongoing for the past six months, will be finalised.  Further important law reform measures will also be introduced following enactment last year of the rape Act.  Violence against women is a criminal offence and once reported it must be investigated on the basis of the seriousness of the offence committed and the public interest.  The desire not to exacerbate a difficult family situation will not deter the bringing of a prosecution where a violent crime has been perpetrated against a women.</P>
    <P>A total of £88.1 million is being provided in the Prisons Vote compared with the provisional outturn in 1991 of £84.8 million.  The provision being made for pay and overtime is £58.1 million compared with a likely outturn in 1991 of £57.827 million.  The increase reflects the full year cost of 196 additional staff which were provided for in the 1991 Estimates and which have been recruited on a phased basis this year.  It also reflects the provision which has been made for the bringing into operation in the autumn of the new health care unit at present being constructed within the grounds of <Col N="2479" /> Mountjoy Prison.  This unit will have accommodation for 57 prisoners and will provide enhanced basic health care, short or full hospital treatment, for those who require it.  Included in the provision is an allocation of £10.3 million for overtime. This reflects my objective of restricting overtime expenditure at about 18 per cent of the pay bill.</P>
    <P>The events of the past few months have demonstrated a need to make special arrangements for prisoners intent on provoking unrest in the system.  The majority of prisoners are satisfied to serve out their sentences in peace and to avail of a range of services in the system to help them cope with their sentences and to prepare for their return to the community.  They can be frustrated in this by a small number of troublemakers whose only concern seems to be to create as much unrest as possible and to challenge the insititutions of the State.  It is essential to identify these troublemakers and to separate them from the main body of prisoners if the prison system is to remain stable.  For that reason, I have obtained Government approval to take over the military detention barracks at the Curragh for this group of prisoners.  It has accommodation for 47 and will be operated exclusively by prison service staff without any input from the Army.  A total of £1.5 million is being provided next year to cover necessary adaptation works and staffing costs.  I expect the new prison to be operational by about the middle of the year and I am confident that it will make a major contribution to the stability of the prison system.</P>
    <P>The total provision for the Probation and Welfare Service, including the community service orders scheme, is £8.6 million, compared with just over £7.5 million in 1991.  This additional provision will ensure that the development of alternatives to custody for those whom the courts decide do not require prison custody will continue.  Alternatives at present include fines and compensation orders, deferred and suspended sentences, and community service orders.  At present, there are about 3,200 offenders <Col N="2480" /> under supervision in the community as an alternative to custody, of whom 750 are on community service orders.</P>
    <P>Last year, I announced a new scheme for intensive supervision in the community of some 200 offenders at any one time who would otherwise merit a prison sentence.  The idea was to recruit a total of 31 additional probation and welfare officers to operate the scheme and to provide a number of resource centres, principally in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, to service the scheme.  By the end of this year 18 of the 31 officers will have been recruited and considerable progress will have been made with the provision of the resource centres.  I am providing sufficient moneys next year to enable these arrangements to be completed as soon as possible so that the scheme can come into full operation before the end of the year.  The process of up-grading and consolidating the prison building stock will also continue.</P>
    <P>Work will start early next year on the renovation of the women's prison in Mountjoy which, when completed next year, will have the same level of facilities and services, including in-cell sanitation, as was provided this year in the D Wing of St. Patrick's Institution.  In the meantime women prisoners are being accommodated in the D wing and, therefore, already have the benefit of much better physical conditions.</P>
    <P>The adequacy of services provided in the prisons is kept under constant review and improvements made as necessary. On the recommendation of the Director of Prison Medical Services, I am providing additional moneys next year to improve the standard of medical care. The additional provision will enable general medical and psychiatric care facilities, including clinical arrangements, to be improved.  I am also increasing the number of psychologists for the prisons from four to eight.</P>
    <P>There is an overall increase in the provision on the Courts Vote of about 12 per cent compared with the provisional outturn for 1991.  The principal areas that account for the increase are post and telecommunications services and office <Col N="2481" /> expenses.  The general efficiency and operation of the courts is, of course, a matter of great importance and the Courts Vote provides the funding necessary to equip the courts to function as effectively as possible.  Computerisation of manual operations is helping to improve the efficiency of the court service and I am glad to say that provision under the heading of office machinery is being increased in 1992.  As well as enabling the existing systems to be supported the increase will provide for some development in new areas.</P>
    <P>The increase in the provision will enable the service by recorded post of District Court summonses in cases of summary jurisdiction.  This will be introduced on a pilot basis in the Dublin metropolitan area in 1992 and will relieve a number of gardaí of summons server duties and make them available for normal duty.  The increased provision for office machinery will allow for the purchase of sorting equipment which will be required for the service of summonses by post.</P>
    <P>The recent introduction on a pilot basis of the small claims procedure within the District Court structure provides for a quick and inexpensive forum for resolving disputes in certain circumstances where the claim does not exceed in value the sum of £500.  Expenses such as those relating to publicity material in connection with the scheme will be met from the 1992 Courts Vote.  I am pleased to be able to announce that the grant-in-aid to the Legal Aid Board for the purpose of administering the scheme of civil legal aid and advice is being increased again in 1992.  Two new law centres have been opened by the board this month, one in Dundalk and one in Letterkenny and I am advised by the board that the new centre at Castlebar will open later this week.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, Deputies will be well aware that improving the quality of the service provided by those offices has been a priority for me since my appointment as Minister for Justice.  The basic problem with the registries in recent years has <Col N="2482" /> been their incapacity to cope fully with the growing volume of business being addressed to them.  This has resulted in lengthening delays in dealing with cases and the accumulation of arrears.  The main factors contributing to this development have been inadequate levels of staffing and inadequate investment in new technology.  These factors have arisen because, as part of the public service, the registries have been subject to the various embargoes on staffing and cutbacks in public expenditure which have operated since the early eighties.  At the same time as the staffing levels were being severely reduced in the registries, the volume of business being addressed to them was increasing significantly.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment I have taken a number of significant steps to deal with these problems and to improve the services of the registries.  I will mention these briefly.</P>
    <P>I had the post of registrar and a number of other senior posts, which had been vacant for some time, filled in 1990.  The total combined staffing at two registries has been increased from 473 at the end of 1989 to 519 at present.  A firm of management consultants was commissioned last year to produce a stategic plan to link the organisation structure and technology infrastructure to the business goals and objectives of the registries.  I have since approved for implementation, the five year information systems plan recommended by them and elements of the plan are already being implemented by the registries.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of last year, I launched a programme for computerising abstracts of memorials in the Registry of Deeds.  Studies of the workings of the registry had shown that computerisation of abstract records was essential if a quick and effective service was to be provided to the conveyancing market.</P>
    <P>Work is underway at present on the preparation of a data model of the two registries, as a prelude to further computer systems development.</P>
    <P>Finally, arising from my overall review of the workings of the registries, I sought and received Government agreement in <Col N="2483" /> principle to the reconstitution of the registries as a semi-State body.  I consider that in order to provide the public with the standard of service to which they are entitled and for which they are willing to pay, it is necessary to free the registries from the constraints in the areas of staffing and funding that apply within conventional Civil Service structures.</P>
    <P>Following this decision by Government, I set up a small working group who reported to me earlier this year on the problems of the registries and advised me on appropriate solutions to these problems in the context of their re-constitution as a semi-State body as well as on the legislative and other preparatory work of an organisational nature which needs to be undertaken before the registries can be converted to a semi-State body.  I intend to proceed as quickly as possible with the conversion of the registries.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report to this House that the steps taken to improve the services of the registries are now beginning to bear fruit.  The growth of arrears and delays at the registries, and particularly the Land Registry, have been arrested and in fact a small but significant reduction in arrears has been achieved over the last two years.  This is the first reduction in arrears in a long time and it was achieved on foot, not only of the increased staff numbers, but also through improved management.  Also, it reflects the excellent commitment of the registrar and her staff who are, it must be acknowledged, working under difficult circumstances. I would like to take this opportunity to compliment them on their efforts.  I look forward to a continuation of this good work in the year ahead. Further reduction of arrears and improvement of the services provided would be a most appropriate way to mark the centenary of the Land Registry, which was established in 1892.</P>
    <P>Over the 100 years of its existence the registry has provided a very valuable service to property owners in providing them with a secure and relatively simple means of registering their titles.  There is <Col N="2484" /> yet some distance to go before all property in the country is brought within the registration of titles system but efficient use of the new technology, hardly dreamt of in 1892, will greatly assist us in travelling the rest of the journey.</P>
    <P>In the 1992 Estimates £11.4 million, an increase of 20 per cent over the 1991 provisional outturn, is provided for the operation of the registries.  This provides for the additional staff and computer equipment required to implement the consultants information technology plan and to prepare the registries for conversion to semi-State status.</P>
    <P>I am proud of the progress which has been made in the areas under my remit. I am confident that the programme for 1992 which I have outlined in the limited time available to me today will further improve law enforcement and enhance the administration of justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended in this speech to refer to the forgotten Ireland &mdash; the Ireland of poverty and isolation that has been forgotten by this Government. Instead, I have discovered in this debate that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have not forgotten poverty &mdash; instead, they have set out, quite deliberately, to make it worse.  The range of social welfare cuts announced this morning, in the face of a million poor, is totally and absolutely scandalous. I am reasonably sure that when these details are spelled out, the public outrage that will result will bring this Government down.</P>
      <P>The social welfare cuts must bring the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to an end.  If the trade unions stand by and allow benefits for which people pay, week after week, to be taxed in the interests of short term expediency, it will be seen as a totally cynical approach, and a demonstration that social partnership means nothing except pay negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole package of measures announced this morning &mdash; which we warned was likely to happen in our response to the Estimates &mdash; are aimed at ensuring that increasingly fewer people <Col N="2485" /> will be entitled to decreasing levels of benefits in the future.  We intend to have the legality of these proposals examined in detail, as we do not believe that such arbitrary cuts in entitlement can possibly lead to equality of treatment.</P>
    <P>But above all, we intend to do everything in our power to ensure that everyone is aware that this is only the thin edge of the wedge.  If they get away with this, it is only a matter of time before every element of support &mdash; unemployment benefit, child benefit, and so on &mdash; will be taxed.</P>
    <P>I hope that the outrage which is inevitable will mean that these Estimates come to represent a suitable epitaph for this Government who are rapidly running out of steam.  They lack vision; they lack hope; they fail even to paper over the cracks in the social fabric of our country. To that extent, they are a suitable symbol of the decay and lack of basic compassion that permeates the Government.</P>
    <P>This debate, the last debate we will have in 1991, is a suitable one to look back over the past year and to attempt to look to the future.  The past year will be remembered as the year when honest and decent businessmen were shocked at the degree of venality that was revealed in some quarters of the business sector. It will be remembered as the year when politics was debased and diminished by the revelations of a golden circle of people enabled to enrich themselves as a direct consequence &mdash; to put it at its mildest &mdash; of complacent and lax regulation.</P>
    <P>Why have people lost faith in this country? Why is there now so little respect for politicians and politics?  Why, in the end, will these Estimates have so little impact on the way in which people live their lives?</P>
    <P>The year just ending has marked a considerable turning point in the history of our country, but it will take some time for that turning point to be fully recognised for what it is.  In the past year more progress has been made towards the selling out of the interests of the Irish people, in mysterious and sometimes sinister ways, than at any previous time in <Col N="2486" /> our history.  In the last 12 months, democracy has taken second place to the interests of wealth and power in our society.</P>
    <P>At any time in the life of a small open economy such as ours there is going to be a tension between the interests of the wealthy, and often faceless, minority, and the interests of the people as a whole. At any time it is possible to find industrialists, entrepreneurs and people of privilege seeking to manipulate the system in which they operate to their own advantage &mdash; and in a small economy, that can be easier to do.</P>
    <P>But when struggles of that sort are going on the people have to be able to rely on one thing &mdash; they have to be able to rely on the fact that they have democratically elected a Government and have charged that Government with the responsibility of ensuring that the interests of the people are served first and that the people are protected in any conflict.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the first duty of any Government is the defence of the Nation &mdash; I have said before, and I shall repeat it here, that the first duty of Government is the defence of the people and of the democratic imperative.</P>
    <P>If a Government are to succeed in that task they must be capable of resisting the efforts of those who try to pull strings and of those who seek to build platforms for their own interests only.  Democratically elected governments must see it as their responsibility to resist any and all interests that are purely sectional and to ensure that the consequences of all decisions must be reflected in the common good and not in the interests of one group only.</P>
    <P>It will frequently happen, particularly in a time of scarce resources, that a Government who are motivated only by the highest democratic instincts will have to make choices that are both unpalatable and difficult.  Such a Government will often find themselves the focus of deep unpopularity and will be accused of being out of touch with the will of the people. But it is only when a Government allow sectional interests to pull the strings &mdash;<Col N="2487" /> when a Government in effect become a puppet for more powerful interests &mdash; that they lose touch with democracy.  And a Government who lose touch with democracy have lost the right to govern.</P>
    <P>I believe that the first task of Opposition in a democracy is to ensure that the elected Government of the day maintain a deep and abiding commitment to democratic principles.  As the leader of an Opposition party, I have tried to fulfil that mandate since the day this Government were formed.  I believe that the time has come when this Government must be accused of having abandoned the democratic principles from which they derive their power and influence.</P>
    <P>I cannot stand in front of this House and say that I can prove that members of this Government have subverted the democratic interests of the people they are supposed to represent.  But I believe that the questions that are mounting up every day about the commitment of this Government to democratic values demand answers, and no attempt is being made by anyone on the Government side to answer them.</P>
    <P>The public contempt shown for anyone who tries to ask legitimate questions in the House is paralleled by the arrogance which has become a feature of the style of this Government.</P>
    <P>In short, 1991 will best be remembered as a year that should be forgotten.</P>
    <P>But, of course, 1991 will not and should not be forgotten.  The scandals we know about must be used to ensure that whatever is rotten in our political and business systems is eradicated.  If we can learn no other lesson from the year, let us at least learn the lesson that transparency, honesty and openness are essential ingredients for both politics and business. Let us resolve that we will not accept what might be called the Haughey legacy &mdash; the legacy of strockes, winks and nods, and under the counter deals involving non-existent friends.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that 1991 was also the year of hidden scandals &mdash; in some ways more deep-rooted than the ones with which we are all familiar.  For the <Col N="2488" /> first time this year, we saw visible evidence on the streets of some neglected Dublin suburbs of the beginnings of the breakdown of society.  The sight of children burning cars and stoning gardaí and firemen ought to be one of the symbols that is most deeply engraved on the memory of 1991.</P>
    <P>Because let us make no mistake about it, all these events are connected.  The poverty, alienation and isolation that are all too prevalent in our cities and towns go hand in hand with the ostentatious displays of wealth and exaggerated lifestyles that are so popular with some of our leading gossip columinists.  That contrast will become all the greater if the Government are allowed to get away with the vicious cutbacks in social welfare announced this morning by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest any simplistic connections, neither do I want to deny the role that can and must be played by responsible parents even in the face of grinding poverty and hopelessness.  But Ireland used to be a place of community, a country famous for its ability to look after its own, a country where people would rally around anyone in need.  That Ireland is in serious trouble and the reason it is in serious trouble is because of the atmosphere of &ldquo;me first&rdquo; that has begun to pervade our politics.  That atmosphere has been one of the most poisonous things that has happened in many years in Ireland.  It has left us with a forgotten Ireland of social welfare dependency, poverty, unemployment and crime which realises this Government have no intention of representing them, never mind assisting them through a co-ordinated job-creation policy.  At least Margaret Thatcher had the good grace to admit that she could continue to politically survive by ignoring the three million unemployed people in the United Kingdom.  Our Government attempt to pay nothing more than lip service to the forgotten Ireland &mdash; and now even that lip service is to be abandoned.</P>
    <P>What is happening in our suburbs is a destruction of core values in a community that has been neglected for a long time. <Col N="2489" /> These communities were created in the late seventies and early eighties when inner city communities were literally dropped onto green field situations with solely four walls and no facilities whatsoever and told to live and survive there. Some ten to 15 years later some of the same people are still awaiting basic facilities such as shops, public transport and schools.  In addition, in many of these estates up to 80 per cent of the population is unemployed.  It is no wonder we have the problems we have experienced in the past months.</P>
    <P>The Government started the year by boasting of the great economic miracle that Ireland was undergoing.  Unfortunately, most people never experience that miracle and unemployment and poverty continue to rise to staggering proportions.</P>
    <P>The Government persistently refused to accept a realistic forecast of the prospects for the Irish economy for 1992 from the Labour Party and other independent economic commentators.  The irresponsible action of the Government in the negotiations of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> created false expectations among the social partners and has led to a climate of economic instability with which the new Minister for Finance must deal.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> which has not survived even one year, was negotiated primarily by the Taoiseach, who was prepared to issue a post-dated cheque to the unions in return for political survival.  It is now evident that the Government's cheque is about to bounce and the real victims will be the ordinary people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>How is it that when the Government make a major <i>faux-pas</i> in relation to the economy and in entering into an agreement like the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> so haphazardly they automatically turn to the PAYE sector and the unemployed to pay the piper without the ability to call the tune?  Why is it that the Government perceive the PAYE sector and low-paid public servants as the only feasible option to rectify <Col N="2490" /> their wanton mismanagement of the economy?</P>
    <P>In recent times the annual report of the Revenue Commissioners and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General made it quite clear that very substantial sums in outstanding taxes could be returned to the Exchequer with an improvement in auditing and collection procedures.  Irrespective of the current financial difficulties faced by the Government their priority must be to rectify the position obtaining in the public finances by effective measures to get moneys owed paid on time.  If the Minister for Finance would give the requisite level of staffing to the Revenue Commissioners, particularly in relation to the auditing of the self-assessment sector, those taxes could be brought in on time.</P>
    <P>The recent revelation that fewer than one in 25 self-employed taxpayers, including married couples, are willing to declare incomes of more than £25,000 per annum is indeed an astonishing figure. Above all else what it reveals is a lack of political will to provide the resources necessary to enable the Revenue Commissioners carry out the kind of checking and auditing required to secure fair adherence to the tax laws.</P>
    <P>We know already from old Central Bank studies that the value of the black economy here could be as high as £2 billion.  The under-reporting of income in the way revealed constitutes a grey economy of huge proportions.  Failure to initiate an all-out attack on both the black and grey economies inevitably narrows the options in terms of tackling unemployment, poverty and tax reform.  Good tax administration is symptomatic of good government.  As the Government refuse to pursue this very reasonable option they have pushed themselves into a corner, seeing no other possibility but to take the easy option and demand that the public finance the Government shortfall.</P>
    <P>That is why the Estimates with which we are dealing with lead to greater hardship across the entire community next year.  That is why the housing crisis is not and will not be addressed.  That is why the <Col N="2491" /> health services will continue to stumble from crisis to crisis.  That is also why local services will continue to be decimated and indeed fewer and fewer people will be entitled to ever smaller levels of social welfare support.</P>
    <P>In relation to the contribution of the new Minister for Health this morning, I have to say that she would want to decide very quickly to which side of the House she belongs.  For example, there is no provision in the Estimates for the commencement of the hospital in Tallaght. Yet she says that all the research shows that it is vital to complement the development of the Tallaght area and that there will be more reports.  Why does she not have the integrity to come out and say that all the reports have been prepared and produced, that Tallaght needs a new hospital, the city of Dublin needs a new hospital in Tallaght, yet money is not being provided for it?  Why have not the Government included that in their priorities? The truth is that this Government have passed the point where they care any longer.  It is not merely a matter of day to day survival for members of this Government.  At least half of them spend most of their time, publicly and privately, admitting to wondering how they can change the leadership of Fianna Fáil, paying no attention whatever to the ever-crumbling framework surrounding them. Unfortunately, the remainder in Government are concerned only with their short term future.</P>
    <P>A particular aspect of the Estimates which has gone relatively unnoticed is the provision in relation to an anticipated 22,000 extra people on the live register next year.  It is quite extraordinary that this House is not in extraordinary session to debate the unfortunate concept, with unbelieveable consequences, for 22,000 people in 1992.  The Taoiseach does not bat an eyelid.  We will have unemployment at such a high level that surely people must begin to question the effectiveness of the political system, the response of the political system, indeed, of the political parties themselves.  This House had better make up its mind that <Col N="2492" /> it will address the question of unemployment before it becomes so over-bearing on this economy there will not be a democratic response.  As a political system, we must begin addressing it in a realistic manner.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I sought information from the Taoiseach in this House in relation to the task force on employment announced many months ago.  That task force must have gone into hiding.  Certainly I have not seen or heard of their report.  Perhaps the Minister for Agriculture and Food who is present might enlighten the House whether that task force is still in existence, whether they are due to report, or whether the Government will come before the House in January with any hope for those people now facing the prospect of joining the already 260,000 people, approximately, drawing unemployment assistance and other benefits, pushing that number up in the region of 285,000.  It is a daunting prospect for this State.  I am afraid I do not have confidence in the Government of having the resources, willingness or determination to get on with the job of sorting out that problem.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government, in facing up to 1992 and the challenges and tasks of that year &mdash; despite the claims of having an economic miracle here, we had some component parts of economic recovery such as low inflation and low interest rates &mdash; I can say of 99 per cent of my constituents, or indeed those of most Members of this House, that whereas they are aware of the so-called misery index being reduced, they are becoming so over-burdened by unemployment, through lack of hope and opportunity, that as a matter of urgency, the Government would need to get their act together.  They will have more than a month within which they will not be subjected to the pressures of this House in which to do so.</P>
    <P>If they are unable to do the job they should accept that.  If, because of the internal problems within the Fianna Fáil Party, if because of the difficulties of the purer than pure, whiter than white, <Col N="2493" /> Progressive Democrats, who do not want to take responsibility for any decisions &mdash; obviously there are tought decisions to be taken by Government &mdash; who appear in their public statements to feel that all the problems with Government and the low ratings of Government and Government personalities can be attributed to Fianna Fáil only, I say to them they too have a responsibility and would want to make up their minds whether they are actually participating in Government or want the luxury of hanging on the fringes. Mind you, the amount of time one can hang on to the wreckage itself is quite limited.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food is faced with enormous difficulties in the complex area of agriculture.  The first disappointment was announced in the course of this week that the headage payments expected, in respect of which promises had been given to the effect that they would be paid before Christmas, will not now be paid to many hard-pressed small farmers in our society.</P>

This Government had better make up their minds that they will become the forgotten Government if they do not settle down to the task they were elected to undertake.  They must make some effort to solve these problems. All of the problems may not have solutions; they may be unable to solve all of them.  But in 1992 let us have an aspiration and hope that a better job can be done for our people.</P>

      <P>I would like to wish Deputy Spring a happy Christmas.  I will wait with bated breath for Deputy Spring to wish me a happy Christmas.  There is no doubt but that this has been a very difficult year with difficult tasks faced in the course of the year.  Deputy Spring inquired about the task force on employment and what they were doing.  Of course, one thing that task force have done is come up with 25,000 job placements for the coming year and provided the funding for those placements, offering considerable opportunity to many people with whom I deal as a constituency representative, as would Deputy Spring in his constituency.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with my own Estimate I would like to refer to some issues of major concern to the future of our agriculture industry.</P>
      <P>CAP reform and GATT discussions are the principal focus of attention at Community level.  Ministers in recent Council meetings have devoted much time to considering both matters.  No one can deny that Ireland has benefited greatly from our membership of the EC &mdash; support through the Common Agricultural Policy has helped our agriculture to develop.  Family farms &mdash; the mainstay of Irish agriculture &mdash; have retained their viability and have provided a good standard of living for thousands of families. At the outset I would like to reassure Deputies of the Government's commitment to seeking the continuation of this development.  Any change in the present arrangements will not be acceptable to me unless the specific needs of countries such as Ireland with our very heavy dependence on agriculture are met and the future viability of farming in this country is secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy no longer meets its original objectives and reform is inevitable.  This is not disputed by anyone who knows agriculture.  It has been clear for a considerable time that the build-up of surpluses in several products and the very substantial increase in the cost of the Common Agricultural Policy cannot continue.  Expenditure in the EC on agricultural support increased <Col N="2495" /> by one third last year and £1.4 billion was received by Ireland from the Community to support market prices and structural development in 1991.  Despite this expenditure farm incomes throughout the EC continued to decline.  The situation here has reflected the trend in the Community, even though in 1991 we had record purchases of beef into intervention in Ireland and there has been a 50 per cent increase in receipts under Common Agricultural Policy since 1989.  I am happy to say that intervention beef levels are coming down.  Piecemeal reform without compensation, as has been happening, has eroded the benefits which we had from the Common Agricultural Policy.  What is needed is a proper planned reform of the way the EC supports agriculture so that we can have a permanent stable, properly financed structure for the future.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not alone in questioning the Commission's proposals.  Several member states have difficulty in almost all areas of the proposed reforms.  It is clear that difficult negotiations lie ahead. From our point of view the Commission's approach represents too great and too fast a switch from market price supports to direct payments.  They go too far, too fast.  They are too restrictive in relation to our production of beef, milk, our potential to seek out additional export markets, and the future development of farming in Ireland.  I am demanding a more gradual and moderate change while at the same time insisting that market price support continues to be principal source of farm incomes in the years ahead.  Reform of any kind must be secured by adequate and durable EC financing.</P>
    <P>The proposed milk quota cuts, the price reductions for milk, beef and cereals, the eligibility criteria for livestock premia and set-aside aids and the quota and flock ceiling proposed for sheepmeat are not acceptable as they stand.  There will have to be substantial changes to all of these proposals before I could consider accepting them.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the GATT negotiations are <Col N="2496" /> continuing in Geneva and elsewhere.  Mr. Dunkel, the GATT Director General, proposes to present draft framework agreements in all the negotiating sectors in Geneva tomorrow, 20 December.  At this stage it would appear that several important issues for Ireland and for the Community will not be adequately covered in Mr. Dunkel's texts.  Member states will have an opportunity at a Council of Trade Ministers meeting in Brussels on 23 December to give their initial judgments on Mr. Dunkel's efforts.  For Ireland's part, we will be insisting that any GATT agreement on agriculture takes full account of the principles set out in the negotiating mandate laid down by Agriculture Ministers in November 1990. We will also be insisting on &ldquo;green box&rdquo; coverage for the various compensatory aids envisaged under Common Agricultural Policy reform and that headage payments will not be subjected to reduction commitments.</P>
    <P>While many Agriculture Ministers &mdash; including myself &mdash; will be attending next Monday's meeting we will be insisting that Agriculture Ministers are formally consulted before any conclusions can be arrived at in relation to agriculture.  The Community and Ireland are faced with difficult times on both the Common Agricultural Policy reform and GATT fronts but I am confident that the agreements which ultimately emerge from these negotiations will be satisfactory from an Irish viewpoint.  Farmers and all associated with the agriculture industry can be assured that no stone will be left unturned to ensure such an outcome.</P>
    <P>Gross expenditure on Agriculture and Food increased from £452.3 million to £472.8 million, an increase of 5 per cent on 1991.  The next Exchequer cost provided for in this estimate at £185.3 million represents an increase of 3 per cent on 1991.  In so far as the specific subheads of the Estimates of my Department are concerned I would like to comment on three subheads in particular, subheads B4 and 5 relating to Teagasc and M3&mdash;Aids to Farmers in Certain Less Favoured Areas.  These are the livestock headage schemes.  Detailed discussions <Col N="2497" /> on the Estimates will take place in the New Year but I would like to clarify the position for all interested parties involved.</P>
    <P>The provisional outturn for Teagasc for 1991 is £33.025 million.  This amount includes £600,000 which is the first instalment of an equal pay settlement.  A similar amount will be provided for in 1992. This year for the first time the grant-in-aid towards the organisation's pensions costs is shown separately providing greater transparency in regard to the Exchequer financing for Teagasc.  The actual reduction therefore for 1992 is £0.525 million or 1.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Teagasc, in their corporate plan, have a priority objective to become less dependent on Exchequer funding and to achieve a 50 per cent self-financing position by 1993.  Some progress has already been made in this respect.  This trend has been helped by the European Social Fund moneys in recent years.  I am pressing for further increases for the educational programme up to the limit of this eligibility for European Social Fund co-funding.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that Teagasc deliver their services in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.  In a national organisation with resources decentralised throughout the State, this of necessity requires a reorganisation and consolidation of their assets and resources as required.  Such a review is currently under way and is, in the first instance, a matter for the management and board of Teagasc itself.  I have not recieved any proposals on the reorganisation from the board as yet.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is great concern around the country arising from speculation about possible closures of research stations and training facilities.  I want to assure the House of my commitment to research, education and the advisory services. As far as I am concerned, they are an integral part of any market-based development plan for the future of agriculture, horticulture and rural development. I am personally committed to the development of these facilities and services within the regions so that they can be more responsive to local needs.  I see <Col N="2498" /> the west of Ireland, and disadvantaged areas generally, as a priority in my plans.</P>
    <P>A sum of £95 million is being provided for headage payments in the disadvantaged areas next year.  This means that the increased rates of payment envisaged in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will apply to the 1992 schemes in all the disadvantaged areas, including the recently extended areas and those which were re-classified.</P>
    <P>The new maximum payments will be £3,360 instead of £2,012 and £2,250 instead of £1,880 in the case of cattle in the more and in the less severely handicapped areas respectively and £2,000, instead of £1,750, in the case of sheep in both areas.  The higher rates will cost £12.5 million for a full year.  The increased rates in 1992 will apply to all 134,000 farmers in the scheme.  In 1991, 29,000 farmers will benefit from extension and reclassification.  For the first time, 13,000 benefit from the extension of the less favoured areas and a further 16,000 farmers benefit from the reclassification of their areas.  The increases are worth some £12 million to beneficiaries in a full year and the annual benefit of the scheme to the farmers will increase to £100 million.</P>
    <P>The extremely difficult budgetary situation did not permit the bringing forward of the increases into 1991.  I am prepared to enter into negotiations with the farming organisations within the framework of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> with a view to clarifying what scope there is for meeting the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in as short a time frame as possible.  Deputies will, of course, appreciate that not all payments due in respect of a particular year can actually be made within that year.  Inevitably some have to be carried over to early in the succeeding year.  This year we will pay around £82 million in headage payments, a total which exceeds the level of payments under those schemes in any previous year.</P>
    <P>I know of the importance of headage payments to farm families in the disadvantaged areas.  From my contacts with <Col N="2499" /> the farming organisations and from the many representations I have received from Deputies and other public representations, I know that there is dissatisfaction at what is perceived to be a cumbersome system and an unreasonable delay in making some payments, with the result that the bulk of the payments are not made until the concluding weeks of the year.  I am undertaking an examination of the existing procedures governing applications, inspections and processing of claims as a matter of urgency.  My aim is to ensure that the farmer receives his or her grants as early in the year as practicable.</P>
    <P>The headage payments &mdash; which apply only in the less favoured areas &mdash; are, of course, only part of the total payments to livestock farmers.  We have, in addition, the suckler cow, special beef and ewe premium schemes, which are fully funded by the EC and apply throughout the entire country, including the disadvantaged areas.  Under all of these schemes a total of around £270 million is being paid to Irish farmers in the current year.</P>
    <P>The premium schemes are 100 per cent funded by the EC who lay down the rules and insist that they are strictly applied. The rules caused difficulty for quite a number of farmers last year and many more were threatened with exclusion from the scheme.  However, the EC Commission adopted a sympathetic attitude at our request and this let in a sizeable number of farmers who would otherwise have been deemed ineligible, but the Commission insited that the conditions of the scheme must be fully complied with from 1991 onwards.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it seems that a certain number of applicants continue to have problems with the regulations.  It is still too soon to say how large a problem it is this year but as soon as the present push to have payments made has ended the cases whose difficulties have been encountered will be carefully examined. I can assure Deputies that the approach to be adopted in individual cases will be as sympathetic and as favourable as <Col N="2500" /> possible but the House will appreciate that given the nature of these EC schemes our room for movement is limited.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, clear at this stage that some of the penalties built into these premium schemes are too severe.  I have taken up the matter with the EC Commission with a view to arriving at a less severe and more realistic approach for future years.  The basic principle in so far as EC fully funded expenditure is concerned is that the EC Commission will only recoup member states in respect of expenditure which is &ldquo;in accordance with the Community rules&rdquo;.  This expenditure is subject to audit by a number of bodies including the EC Commission itself.  To the extent that the Commission considers that particular expenditure by my Department on its behalf has not been in accordance with those rules, disallowances are proposed which in turn become a charge to the Vote of my Department.</P>
    <P>The EC-backed Operational Programme for Rural Development, launched earlier this year, involves investment of over £100 million in the period to the end of 1993.  The programme contains a wide variety of measures in support of the rural economy ranging from farm diversification to small and community enterprise, rural infrastructure, research and development and marketing in the food industry and training in agriculture, forestry and fisheries. The response to this programme has been very encouraging with the funds for some of the schemes already fully committed. The 1992 provision at £11,781,000 represents the likely commitments under the measures in particular those relating to farm diversification and small and community enterprise.  It represents an increase of over £9 million on the likely 1991 outturn.</P>
    <P>A further sum of £970,000 has also been provided in Administration, subhead A. 13, for the administrative costs of the new national programme for rural development.  This demonstrates in a practical way the Government's commitment to rural development.  The necessary administrative arrangements <Col N="2501" /> are now being made to establish the new structure.</P>
    <P>As I have already announced, 17 of the 34 applicant groups have been selected for funding under the Leader programme. This will involve total investment of some £70 million over the period to the end of 1993: £35 million will come from public funds &mdash; £21 million EC and £14 million national.  I have provided £11.5 million for Leader commitments likely to arise in 1992.  I will be launching the Leader projects early in the New Year.</P>
    <P>The balance of £667,000 in this subhead is in respect of INTERREG.  The INTERREG programme is a Community initiative designed to assist local populations of internal border areas to overcome the disadvantages at their relative isolation within national economies and within the EC as a whole.  It aims to stimulate local economic activity by providing financial assistance through various sub-programmes covering tourism, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, environmental protection as well as regional and human resource development. The INTERREG programme was proposed jointly by the authorities in Dublin and Northern Ireland.  It will run to the end of 1993 providing total EC assistance in the region of £58 million in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The range of measures eligible for assistance under the agriculture sub-programme covers animal, avian and plant health matters, horticulture, anti-pollution measures and community development. Aspects of the other sub-programmes, tourism, environmental protection and regional development, will also be of direct benefit to the rural communities in the Border counties.  A sum of £667,000 is provided to cover my Department's estimated obligations to INTERREG in 1992.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in the Estimates for my Department for this year provides a secure basis from which we can develop. The year ahead will be of critical importance for everyone involved in agriculture and for the economy as a whole.  There are encouraging signs and we have a lot <Col N="2502" /> of support and understanding among our partners in Europe.  I am optimistic for the future.  We are well placed to meet the challenges which lie ahead.  It is a time for confidence in ourselves, our industry and our ability to progress in the emerging Europe.</P>
    <P>I commend the Estimates to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish first to extend greetings for a very happy Christmas and prosperous New Year to all Members of the House and the very loyal staff.  I am sure we will all enjoy the break.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed at the format of this debate.  I am not cribbing about the debate but in order to get some value from it, it would be better if instead of speeches there was across-the-floor questioning and responsibility put on Opposition Deputies to outline the areas in which better services should be provided while at the same time accepting that only so much money can be spent.  I would prefer if we were given the opportunity to identify areas where services could be reduced if we want to improve services in other areas.  Unfortunately, we do not get the opportunity to do this.  It is time we questioned the manner in which we do our business in this House.  It is a great shame that we are not given the opportunity during this debate to put forward positive proposals and suggestions and to act responsibly by telling people where we would get the money for such proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is merely a means of giving Minister the opportunity to outline in advance of the budget what their Departments intend doing next year.  This is unfortunate.  This House should be given the opportunity in advance of the budget of deciding the amount of money which should be spent on services.  It must be made quite clear that if we are to provide services there is a responsibility to find the money for them.  The State will be paying £6.651 billion for non-capital services. Is the taxpayer getting real value for money for that?  A 1 per cent saving on VAT would produce £66 million.  We are asking public servants to forego this <Col N="2503" /> year increases which were worked out between the social partners yet in this House we are not considering that a 1 per cent saving across the board would provide the money to honour that agreement and prevent what I anticipate will be wide-ranging disruption involving a great deal of frustration to those who are trying to keep people in jobs, to keep businesses ticking over, who are trying to make a profit.  The loss to the Exchequer as a result of this disruption will far exceed the amount of money due to the public servants under the agreement reached a short time ago.  Neither does it do anything for democracy that a Government can sit down, work out an agreement, share responsibility and then walk away and break that agreement without any proper discussions.  That is to be regretted.</P>
    <P>The money could be found by greater efficiency.  How many times does one walk around and see public offices with lights on.  In most offices the heating is on.  Look at the waste of money we see around us.  There are lorry loads of paper around this House, lights are left on in offices and heating is left on.  That can be multiplied all over the public service.  In other businesses people search for savings and are very careful where the money is being spent.  Even in one's own home one would be careful.  However, this does not seem to apply in the management of the public service.  Yet we are asking people to forego their increases when such waste continues.  I do not accept that as a way of doing business. Nor do I accept that the manner in which we are being asked to look at these Estimates is the right way for this House to do business.</P>
    <P>I would like the Government to make proposals which are properly costed and be under an obligation to show where the money could be saved in order to have an improved service.  Under the Justice Estimate, for the Garda, prisons and courts alone we are spending £446 million this year.  If one wants to see bad management, if one wants to see chaos, one should visit our courts any day of the week.  Gardaí waste a great deal of <Col N="2504" /> time in courts, hanging around.  There is no proper system in the courts whereby people would have their case heard at, an appointed time and leave.  Everybody is crammed into the courts in the early hours of the morning and left hanging around all day.  This is costing us £16,750.</P>
    <P>On our prisons we are spending £88 million in relation to 2,200 prison places. In my constituency I spoke to a man recently who had just come out of Mountjoy Prison, having served three days for non-payment of a television licence.  This man had five children and was on unemployment assistance.  He accepted his punishment because he had no choice, he did not have the money to pay the fine that was imposed.  His real problem was that he had just got a notice from An Post telling him that they were about to take legal proceedings against him because he had not paid this year's licence.  He told me the only thing he could do was take his punishment again and head back to prison.  Did any Member ever hear such nonsense as making a man spend three days in prison for non-payment of a television licence? It is costing about £31,000 per annum to keep each prisoner in our prisons and we are putting somebody into prison for three days, costing the taxpayer about £2,000, and we do not even get the fine.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that those who do not pay their television licence should not be punished.  I recognise that we must have order and that those who do pay their licence expect those who do not to be punished in some way; but surely we should have a system where by people could at least pay their fines by instalment if they happen to be unemployed or in receipt of unemployment assistance. Surely a more moderate and modern way of punishing a person in such a position would be to ask them to do some community service work by which they would be contributing to the community.  The last thing we should be doing is putting a person like that into prison.</P>
    <P>Let me compare that to another case involving the Department of Social Welfare that I am dealing with at present. <Col N="2505" /> The person, using his redundancy money from his previous employment plus a £3,000 loan from a bank, purchased 10 per cent of the company his employer owned because it was doing quite well, as he thought.  He was paying back this loan of £3,000 by monthly instalments. When he returned from holidays he found the locks on the doors had been changed and the shop had been closed up.  Then he discovered that this gangster had two companies, one a stock company and the other the company that owned the licence and the lease on the premises and that what he had been sold was 10 per cent in the stock company which was worth nothing.  The other individual has walked away with £65,000, having sold the other company, the licence and the lease.  My unfortunate constituent is without his £5,000.  Neither is he getting unemployment benefit because, he discovered, his employer never paid in his PRSI or his PAYE.</P>
    <P>Later he discovered that the same gentleman had forged his signature on a form which was lodged in the Companies Office whereby he was consenting to become a director of the stock company. This employer is none other than a bank manager operating in this city at present. I have been chasing the Department of Social Welfare to take action against this person for the last four or five weeks, I have had statements supplied and I have produced evidence.  I obtained a copy of the records from the Companies Office and confirmation that the signature on the form is not this man's signature. When a person with five children and on unemployment assistance is sent to prison for three days for non-payment of a television licence while this gangsterism continues, is it any wonder that in a recent survey only 8 per cent of the public said they had absolute confidence in our courts?  Yet we are being told in the Book of Estimates that we intend spending taxpayers' money to the tune of £88 million on a prison system, which is achieving nothing.  I am not saying that people who commit serious crime should not be in prison, they should serve their sentence and I sincerely hope that when they come <Col N="2506" /> out they will not want to go back in again. From the sum of £88 million, £325,000 is earmarked for educational services.  We have things backwards; taxpayers consider that offenders should serve their sentence and that, while they are in prison, they will acquire skills which will enable them to find employment or at least to change their ways.  I also note that a sum of £545,000 has been allocated to enforce community service orders.  We seem to believe in locking everybody up but, while offenders are there, they should at least acquire skills to help them cope with life afterwards.</P>
    <P>Crime is now big business and is paying.  I note from the report of the Garda Commissioner that goods to the value of £36 million were stolen in 1990 and goods to the value of £3 million were recovered.  Somebody is operating a big business in relation to the rest of the goods valued at £33 million.  Putting people into prison and letting them out after a short period because of lack of places will not discourage those who steal goods to the value of £36 million.  They know that if they get a two year sentence the chances are that they will be released after eight or ten months and they have a nice nest egg to look forward to.  This is certainly not solving the problem and the courts should be given immediate powers to confiscate assets clearly derived from crime.  It would not cost the taxpayers anything.  We did this in relation to the Criminal Damage Bill and when it is enacted compensation orders can be made by the courts in respect of malicious damage, which I fully support. If somebody steals my car, takes it for a joyride and rams it against the wall, I am deprived of a car plus the doubtful privilege of repaying the bank the loan I secured to buy the car.  These young thugs are just laughing at us.  However, if they had to pay compensation to the person injured it might take the smile off their faces because that is real punishment.  It would stop the vandalism and malicious damage occurring in this city on a daily basis.  People might then think twice about going into a local authority or middle class housing estate and setting <Col N="2507" /> fire to six or eight cars parked in driveways. If, when they threw stones at Garda cars or fire brigades they had to pay the cost of having the vehicles repaired they might think twice about their actions.</P>
    <P>We have not had a proper opportunity to debate (a) the overall sum and (b) how that sum will be spent; we do not get the opportunity of putting forward positive proposals which will mean that the taxpayer will not have to increase the contribution towards the cost of runing the Garda Síochána, the prisons and the courts.  There have not been changes in outdated systems and practices which are costing money instead of saving it.  That is why frustration is building up in the public and why they are angry.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that people have any difficulty in paying for educational services or for proper health care for those who cannot afford it.  However, they object to there money being squandered, good money being thrown after bad, no changes, outdated laws, no system in this Chamber to change the way we do business or to pass laws more quickly to deal with the problems I have outlined.  If we changed our laws to give the courts new powers, changed the way we punish people, used the money available to keep certain people in prison and tried to give them the skills which would prevent them repeating their crimes when they came out, we might get better value for money.</P>
    <P>I know that more money cannot be spent in one area without savings being affected in another area.  Like many Deputies, I have been notified by the free legal advice centres that they will have to close their operations in the new year because of lack of funding.  They have already let two of their four staff go.  The free legal aid advice centres provide a very worthwhile service at no cost to the Exchequer.  In the area of the Department of Justice alone, FLAC provide legal advice to 8,000 people per year which takes pressure off the Government funded Legal Aid Board.  If we allow FLAC to fold the taxpayers will have to pick up the tab.  For small sums of money <Col N="2508" /> we can get excellent value.  I sincerely hope that the Government will listen to the plea from FLAC and provide assistance. The Minister for Labour, who is present, is aware that FLAC do excellent work on behalf of individuals.  I hope the Minister will consider the special plea I am making on behalf of that organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot emphasise too strongly this Government's commitment to the success of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and to the spirit of partnership between Government, employees and unions which is fundamental to the programme.  I am convinced that future observers will see the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and its predecessor, the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> as agreements of historical significance in the context of relations between the various social partners in this country and as milestones in achieving greater economic and social development.  Prior to the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> in 1987, no previous Government were able to achieve such an agreement.  As in any true partnership no one party to the agreement can claim all of the credit for its success.  Both the employer's representatives and the unions were aware that they were taking a calculated risk in coming to an agreement, particularly in the context of the precarious economic situation which obtained at the time of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>I would like to pay a particular tribute to the trade unions in this regard.  I am fully aware that they had a difficult deal to sell to their members in 1987. However, the trade unions put the long term interests of the country, the economy and ultimately of their members ahead of short term gains.  Without that positive contribution from the unions, we would not have made the recovery we did during the three year period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the current programme is concerned, I fully recognise that in the present climate it is not easy for the trade <Col N="2509" /> unions to accept the Government's proposals on public sector pay.  I should emphasise, that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was conditional on maintaining firm control of the public finances.  A fact that seems to be lost sight of by many commentators is that the Government are fully cognisant of the unions' difficulties in this matter. This action by the Government results from a particularly difficult budgetary position in respect of 1992 and 1993.  We have had lower tax revenue because of a drop in consumer expenditure on the one hand, and on the other hand we have higher expenditure on social welfare as a result of the fall in growth rates.</P>
    <P>In making our proposals, the Government were very well aware of the difficulties they pose for our trade union partners and did not take the actions lightly.  The Government were also aware of the great contribution which the consensus approach has made to economic and social development in this country since 1987.  That process has brought us from a position of near bankruptcy to a position today where our economy is basically sound except for the over-riding issue of high unemployment.  High unemployment is the big problem but let us be clear whether as employers, trade unions and Government that there is only one solution to high unemployment and that is the creation of sound sustainable employment.  Such employment can only be created if we have a sound economy and to have a sound economy the over-riding principle of maintaining a firm control on our public finances must be adhered to.  This is asserted very bluntly in the first paragraph on the economy in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  It is worth pointing out that the principles set out in that paragraph are the guiding principles for the whole programme. Those principles when the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> came into effect were accepted by Government, employers, trade unions and farmers alike.  That assertion is an over-riding principle of the programme which cannot be infringed.</P>
    <P>The Government accept that the action <Col N="2510" /> we have taken has fundamental ramifications for the process of consensus in which we have been engaged since 1987. The Government, however, had no other road that it could take and while the outcome of our approach remains to be seen, we must all ensure that the process of consensus and consultation continues for the ten year period which was envisaged in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  Let there be no doubt about it.  This is a major test for the process in which we are engaged.</P>
    <P>But let it also be clear that if the process cannot overcome the problems which have arisen because of an economic downturn, domestically and internationally then that process in itself will not have proved to be as valuable as anticipated.  I do however believe that there is enough good sense around to enable us to continue with the ten-year approach set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>We have made every effort to take into account the feelings of the large groups who are due special increases and who have been denied those increases for a long period of time.  As far as they are concerned, the special increases will be paid retrospectively on 1 January 1993. Effectively, from their point of view the money will be in the bank.  They are not being deprived of their special increases. It will be paid in full retrospectively.  The other over-riding consideration which had to be taken into account by the Government, in the difficult budget situation in which we find ourselves, was the lower paid and this has been done in the proposals which have been put forward by Government.</P>
    <P>In the course of our recent discussions union leaders have raised the issue of tax evasion.  I want to assure this House that this is an area to which the Government are absolutely determined to devote considerable attention and resources in the future.  It is clear from past experience that there remain a large number of persons whose tax remittance bears no relationship whatever to their incomes. Such a situation is nothing short of a national scandal.  The issue of tax evasion <Col N="2511" /> and tax avoidance will be addressed and attacked in the most vigorous manner possible and notably by the Minister for Finance in the budget.</P>
    <P>We must examine existing reliefs, allowances, tax shelters and concessionary tax rates and take the necessary action to ensure that every citizen in this State makes a tax contribution which bears a real relationship with actual income.  We need a concentrated attack on abuses in the business sector, the professional sector and the self-employed sector.  The Government are determined that the PAYE sector will be satisfied that an even and equitable tax take is being enforced at all levels of our society and we will spare no efforts to bring this about.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the consensus approach which has been the mainstay of this Government's economic policy over the last number of years.  The spirit of trust and partnership which has been so painstakingly built up has taken a severe denting in recent months, largely because of the reprehensible behaviour of a small and, in my view, wholly unrepresentative number of business people.  Individuals who seek to amass substantial personal wealth through irregularity, tax evasion and fraudulent practices deserve nothing but our unqualified condemnation and the rigorous enforcement of the statutory provisions against such actions.</P>
    <P>Apart from the illegality for such practices, what concerns the Government is that the entire business and enterprise community is in danger of being tarred with the same brush.  This would be most unjust and unfair to those thousands of business men and women throughout this country who work so hard within the law, often in difficult trading circumstances, to build up businesses to create employment or simply to make a living without resorting to the despicable practices of a small section of the business community.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure our trade union partners that this Government are not interested in confrontation.  The only group we wish to confront are the tax evaders and those who can well afford to <Col N="2512" /> pay their share to the community but fail to do so.  Trust, confidence and mutual respect is an essential feature of the partnership which is basic to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The actions by an unrepresentative and selfish minority must not be allowed to poison the atmosphere in which employers, employees, farmers and Government must co-operate in common cause.  I want to acknowledge that there is justifiable anger among trade unions and their members at the gross injustice of wealth unlawfully accumulated and evasion of lawfully payable taxes.  This makes the task of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> partners all the more difficult but it also makes Government determined to pursue every avenue to restore the programme to its full vigour.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the unfair and generalised condemnation of those engaged in business enterprises of all kinds, there has been an attempt to extend the same type of condemnation to those of us with political responsibility.  This is a blatant attempt to undermine confidence in the Government even where there is no basis for any charge of improper or irregular behaviour on the part of Government.</P>

      <Quest>if the outcome of the Maastricht European Council provides a sound legal and policy base upon which the social dimension of European Union can become a reality in Ireland; if the Government remains committed to the rights set out in the Social Charter and to their full implementation in legislation; and if he will give a commitment that the Government will implement national legislation, where necessary, to give effect to the provision of the Social Charter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too early to say what exactly the legal and policy implications will be as a result of the agreement reached at the Maastricht European Council on Political and Economic and Monetary Union.  This will depend to a very large extent on the legislation which the Commission will present in respect of the new or expanded areas of competence contained in the new union treaty, in particular the agreement on social policy entered upon by all member states except the UK.  The existing Treaty of Rome text on social policy, beyond which the UK was not willing to proceed, remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Ireland remains fully committed to the Community Social Charter of fundamental social rights which is being implemented through a Commission action programme.  The range of measures contained in the social action programme has been proposed by the Commission in the context of the existing Treaty.  All of those measures which have been discussed so far at the Council of Social Affairs Ministers would require, if approved, implementation by all twelve member states.  We are co-operating constructively in the examination of each proposal submitted to the Council under the action programme and where necessary, the required legislation will be introduced to implement the instruments adopted.</P>
      <P>It had been hoped that consideration of all the proposals under the Commission's action programme would be completed by the end of 1992, however, it is doubtful that this deadline will be met.</P>

      <P>I take it from the Minister's response that he has no plans to introduce legislation in keeping with the Social Charter.  Will the Minister not agree that by virtue of our association with Britain, it is seen that we were <Col N="2514" /> instrumental in watering down the provisions of the charter?  Eventually Britain opted out and we remained within the charter during the Maastricht conference. Would the Minister indicate when he is likely to implement some of the sections of the charter that are approprivate to this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would reassure the Deputy that it is the Government's intention to implement the programme in the Social Charter.  We have already implemented a whole range of the actions in the Social Charter and that process will continue.  I can let the Deputy have the exhaustive list of what we have done, if he wishes.  I do not want our position to be confused by any suggestion of association with the British position.  From the beginning we have vigorously supported the purpose, spirit and implementation of the Social Charter.  The British, for their reasons, gave a different view.  Any reservations we have expressed at the Council do not relate to the principle but rather to the conditions for implementation. The House, the trade unions and employers would agree that it is very important to see the conditions that are being proposed as a consequence of the directives under the Social Charter.  We want to see those being implemented.  To adopt directives at Council level is only one small part of the proposal.  To ensure that they are implemented evenly by all member states is another matter.  That is what we are anxious to achieve.</P>

      <P>A wide range of measures is already in place both in the public and private sector, to encourage employee participation.</P>
      <P>In the public sector the Worker Participation (State Enterprise) Acts provide for the election of worker directors to the boards of 11 State companies and the introduction of participative arrangements at sub-board level in 35 State companies.</P>
      <P>In the private sector a joint FIE/ICTU declaration on employee involvement worked out under the aegis of the Employer Labour Conference was published in June.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2516" /> The Department of Labour have published &ldquo;Guidelines for Employee Participation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Case Studies in Employee in Participation&rdquo; which are designed to encourage more companies to introduce employee involvement arrangements and to assist in identifying and developing suitable arrangements.</P>
    <P>Under the Finance Acts a number of schemes have been introduced to encourage and promote financial participation. The take-up on the schemes is very encouraging and to date over 300 schemes have been approved by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>There have also been a number of developments at European Community level.  Measures brought forward under the Commission action programme to implement the EC Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers include a draft directive on information and consultation for workers in transnational companies and a draft Council recommendation on the financial participation.</P>

      <Col N="2518" /> A person with an adult dependant and three children would, therefore, have £139.50 per week on the social employment scheme as against £124 per week on unemployment assistance.  While persons on unemployment assistance may have additional benefits such as fuel allowance, butter vouchers etc., the extra payment on the basic social employment scheme allowance more than compensates for the loss of these extra benefits.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that there is no compulsion on unemployed persons to participate in the scheme.  However, if a person refuses an opportunity to participate in the scheme the reason for so doing may be investigated by the Department of Social Welfare in the context of that person's continued entitlement to unemployment compensation.</P>
    <P>The submission recently made by the Scheme Workers Alliance sought improvements in the level of payments made under the scheme as if it were a full-time employment scheme.  The social employment scheme offers part-time opportunities to the long term unemployed and the available resources are used to provide opportunities for as many long term unemployed people as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the long term unemployed should be encouraged to participate in the social employment scheme and, if so, would he not agree that there is a specific discouragement to participate which is evident from the figures given by him? Would the Minister confirm that he is aware that in the case of two persons each with an adult dependant and three children, to which the Minister referred, one in receipt of unemployment assistance and the other on the social employment scheme, the differentiation between the two sums of money available collapses because the person on unemployment assistance also gets a fuel allowance, rent allowance, clothing and other allowances while the medical card is available to both?  Would the Minister not accept, according to the submission made by the Scheme Workers Alliance, <Col N="2519" /> that there is an express disincentive to participate in the scheme and because many people suffer a net reduction in the moneys available to their family that this needs to be corrected?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is a disincentive to participate in the scheme which needs to be looked at.  I should tell the Deputy that the reason I picked that illustration is that I thought it was the one which best supported the case I know that he and the alliance would make.  The figures demonstrate that the amounts payable on the social employment scheme are higher than the amounts payable on unemployment assistance. Having said that, I will keep the matter under review to make sure that if people are encouraged to participate in the social employment scheme there will be no obvious or visible disadvantages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that it is entirely inadequate to give the rates of unemployment assistance and compare them with the rates payable on the social employment scheme without giving the value of each of the additional allowances and benefits which accrue to families in receipt of unemployment assistance?  Is the Minister aware that the free fuel voucher would bring the payment received on unemployment assistance up to parity with the payment on the social employment scheme?  Would he agree that this is wrong and that if one is on a social employment scheme the incentive should be that the benefits that one would otherwise receive on unemployment assistaance would be retained and that the additional payment should recompense them for work done?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case. The figures I have given to the Deputy show that there is a differential of £17 per week on the basic rate between the <Col N="2520" /> amounts payable on the social employment scheme and on unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the family with three children?  The difference is £11 even before one talks about the rent allowance and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures demonstrate that even in that case there is a differential of £15.

I have indicated to him that I will review the matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 14 and 23 together.  A discussion document reviewing the options for change in relation to the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 was published by my predecessor.  A Bill to amend the Act is being drafted and will be brought before the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  I expect that this will be early in the next session.</P>
      <P>In response to the aspect raised by Deputy Mac Giolla, while I am not in a position at this stage to give details of proposed amendments to the 1977 Act, I can indicate that the Bill is likely to include certain proposals for changes in the procedures of the Employment Appeals Tribunal affecting unfair dismissal appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the specific issue raised by Deputy Shatter, I am aware that the tribunal, in the course of a determination made on 2 August 1990 suggested an amendment to the Act on the lines indicated by the Deputy.

Equally, would the Minister not agree that those who are taken on in employment should be protected where they suspect that moneys being deducted from their salaries are not being returned? Finally, would the Minister agree that there is an anomaly in that they are open to being dismissed during the first year of employment if they discover that such an eventuality is taking place and report it to the authorities, that this is an injustice and that they should be afforded full protection under the Unfair Dismissals Act? Would the Minister not agree that he has an immediate interest in the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 20, 31, 33, 41 and 43 together.  As explained by my predecessor, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in replies to previous Dáil questions on 27 February and 10 July 1991, the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights is being implemented through a Commission Action Programme. During the Irish Presidency in the first six months of 1990, the Minister, Deputy Ahern, as President-in-Office of the Social Affairs Council, was instrumental in drawing up and securing agreement to a timetable for completion of the action programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that concern has been expressed, particularly within the European Parliament, about the pace of progress in dealing with the Commission's <Col N="2526" /> Action Programme.  It is true that it has proved difficult to reach agreement at the Social Affairs Council on certain proposals, but concrete progress has been made, especially as regards measures in the occupational safety and health area. The main problem is that the social affairs area is characterised by a great diversity of circumstances in member states which can be difficult to reconcile.  There are also particular problems where cost implications are involved which could jeopardise competitiveness and employment.</P>
    <P>There are 47 initiatives listed in the Commission's Action Programme.  Seven of these represent legal instruments which have already been adopted by Council, a common position has been agreed on four such instruments while 13 proposed instruments are currently the subject of technical discussion in the social questions working group.  A total of 18 measures have yet to be submitted to the Council by the Commission.  A further five items which have been submitted by the Commission comprise reports or communications on which no further action is required by Council.  I am circulating in the Official Report a tabular statement outlining the current state of play in relation to all of the measures identified in the Social Action Programme.</P>
    <P>The question of compliance with the instruments adopted does not arise at this stage.  Where necessary, appropriate legislation will be prepared to comply with the requirements of the instruments. Ireland is committed to the charter as a basis for achieving a strong social dimension to complement the economic objective of completion of the Single Market and we are co-operating constructively in examination of each proposal submitted to the Council under the Commission's Action Programme.  Our approach is to examine each such proposal on its merits, seeking to achieve a fair balance between desirable social progress in the interests of workers and the capacity of employers and Governments to undertake the corresponding obligations.  We assess each proposal by reference to its implications <Col N="2527" /> for employment in Ireland because employment is the overriding social priority.</P>
    <P>It should be made clear that the relatively slow progress in dealing with measures under the action programme has not been due to any lack of goodwill on our part or indeed on the part of the social affairs Ministers generally.  If these <Col N="2528" /> legislative proposals are taking longer to process than had been expected, it is primarily because they have proved to be difficult and complicated and because each member state takes its responsibilities in relation to those proposals very seriously.</P>
    <P>At this stage, it is not possible to predict when consideration of all proposals under the Commission's Action Programme will be completed.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the Social Charter was dealt a mortal blow at the recent Maastricht summit? Will he confirm that, of all the areas of EC policy in the context of the Single Market, the Social Charter is the one that is furthest behind?  Will he explain why the Irish Government, particularly he as Minister for Labour, have effectively been adopting an obstructionist position at the Council of Ministers and will he confirm that the stated support by the Government for the Social Charter is no more than the Government's alleged support for the Irish language?</P>

      <P>Ba mhian liom a chur in iúl don Teachta go bhfuil an sprid chéanna againn i dtaobh an Social Charter agus atá againn i dtaobh cúrsaí na Gaeilge.  Más é sin an méid atá le rá aige, ní mórán é.  Bainimid úsáid as an Ghaeilge aon uair a bhíonn seans againn.  That will be our commitment in respect of the Social Charter.  The Deputy should leave the Irish language out of this because we all have a common obligation to and respect for it.  I agree with the Deputy that the outcome of the Maastricht summit in relation to social policy was not as we would have wished. <Col N="2533" /> No one would wish for a social policy programme which is not agreed by all 12 member states.  I agree with the Deputy that we cannot have an effective social action programme on a legal basis throughout the Community until all 12 members are equally involved, committed and bound to it.  Because one country opts out of this exercise for reasons of principle or otherwise the Deputy should not take that to mean that we are not committed to the Social Charter.  There is no evidence of that. The Deputy will see from the tabular statement exactly what our programme is.  Is the Deputy suggesting that we, in the course of discussions at the Social Council, ignore the impact of regulations on employment here?</P>

      <P>We are agreed on that.  Would the Deputy suggest that we should not inquire into the even-handed implementation in all 12 member states of the conditions of work and so on?  I presume he would not suggest that.  I hope that sooner rather than later we will have the confirmation we seek, namely that employment, which is our first priority, will not be affected.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister's response to the question. We are well behind the other countries in many areas.  Recently we abdicated our responsibility to pregnant workers.  The position of part-time workers is vulnerable under existing legislation and there is no statutory minimum wage here.  Many of the Twelve &mdash; we all know the spurious reasons Britain opted out &mdash; already enjoy a statutory minimum wage.  When will we amend our legislation so as to put it on an even footing with that of other European countries?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is getting back to the case he made earlier.  We are <Col N="2534" /> talking about the implementation of the EC charter, directives and the legal obligations that follow from that but the Deputy's question deals with a different matter.  I am tempted to read out in detail what is contained in the tabular statement to prove to Deputies that what they are suggesting is incorrect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said about the 11 member states.  Considering our peculiar and close association with the UK and the reciprocal arrangements that have existed over the years, will the Minister give particular attention to what may arise when and if these matters are sorted out between the 11 members.  Assuming that the twelfth country, the UK, opts to stay out, there will be chaos as regards our reciprocal arrangements.  I would like to refer to a matter which is not associated with the charter but which is very relevant at present, the manner in which citizens rights are dealt with in UK employment agencies and job finding centres, the speed with which they are dealt with and the manner in which telephone calls are dealt with.  Perhaps the Minister will consider taking action in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the fact that the UK has opted out of this exercise has very serious implications for us and for our people both here and in England.  This is a very important issue and one to which we will <Col N="2535" /> have to have regard in the implementation of this programme.  In my view it is unacceptable to opt out of a commitment as a member of the European Community.  Our people should not be disadvantaged as a consequence of the position adopted by the United Kingdom to stay apart &mdash; not for the first time &mdash; from the other 11 members in this case. I will be carefully considering the consequences of that action, particularly when the Commission introduce proposals, some of which may be outside the existing Treaty framework and will not involve the United Kingdom.  The other matter referred to by the Deputy is one I will be glad to consider.  We are, as the Deputy probably knows, in very close contact with a whole range of Irish representative organisations and societies in the United Kingdom.  They also brought this matter to our attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Minister's concern about employment but I find it strange that it should surface mostly in the context of the Social Charter.  Will the Minister respond to the question of a national timetable for the implementation of the measures contained in the Social Charter?  The Minister recently announced that he intends to have discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and has he any plans to present to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions an outline of a timetable in relation to the implementation of the measures contained in the Social Charter?</P>

      <P>Let us be realistic.  I have been asked to outline the timetable <Col N="2536" /> to do things that have not as of yet been fully considered by the Commission, in some cases, never mind the Council. What I can undertake to do is that as soon as the measures are presented to and decided by the Council, there will be no delay on our part in implementing them by way of regulation or legislation. I can give that commitment in the House and the social partners are well aware of that also.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that rather than it being a triumph for the British Prime Minister that Great Britain opted out of it, in fact, creating a major problem and undermines the very concept of the creation of a Common Market and its achievement through economic union in the context of dealing with both economic and social cohesion?  Do the Government intend to take any particular steps to engage in discussions with the UK Government to try to encourage them to come back in line with the rest of Europe with regard to the Social Charter?</P>

      <P>In the context of our regular bilateral discussions in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and discussions at the Council of Ministers' meetings, I hope we will be able to use our influence to persuade them in that direction.  I will reiterate what I said, I share the Deputy's feelings, although I do not want to take on to myself the role of judge and jury of any other jurisdiction but I agree that economic and social cohesion is inter-related and inevitably linked together &mdash; one cannot have one without the other. For that reason, until it is a Community of Twelve in every sense, the EC will not have achieved the purposes of the union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 10, 12, 13, and 38 together.  I assume that the reference in the first parts of these questions to proposals for Directives on part-time workers relate to proposals for Directives on non-standard employment which were contained in the Commission's Social Action Programme for the implementation of the Social Charter.  Three such proposals followed from the action programme. In one case, a Directive was adopted by the Council in June 1991 with the full support of Ireland.  This is a Directive supplementing measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of temporary workers or workers with a fixed-duration employment relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other two proposals for Directives on non-standard employment which have not yet been adopted by the Council are a proposal for a Directive on certain employment relationships with regard to working conditions and a proposal for a <Col N="2538" /> Directive on certain employment relationships with regard to distortions of competition.</P>
    <P>The draft Directive on certain employment relationships with regard to working conditions is based on Article 100 of the Treaty.  It proposes to extend to part-time and temporary workers access to company training, access to company social services and social assistance schemes, the right to be informed of vacancies on the permanent staff and the right for temporary agency workers not to be precluded from taking up employment with clients of the agencies.</P>
    <P>The draft Directive on certain employment relationships with regard to distortion of competition is based on Article 100A of the Treaty.  It proposes to extend to part-time employees, on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis, the same entitlements as apply to full-time employees in relation to holidays, dismissal allowances and seniority allowances.  It also proposes to prevent the exclusion of part-time and temporary employees from occupational social security schemes and proposes the imposition of significant restrictions on the renewal of temporary contracts.</P>
    <P>These two draft Directives on non-standard employment were discussed at working group level during 1990 and there was a preliminary exchange of views on the proposed Article 100A Directive at the Social Affairs Council on 18 December 1990.  However, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, who held the Presidency of the Council during the first and second half of 1991 respectively, did not place the proposals on the agendas of the Social Affairs Councils during 1991.</P>
    <P>In the discussions which have taken place to date on the proposals, this country has made it clear that it supports the view that there is a need to ensure that persons in non-standard employment are afforded adequate protection.  In that regard the House will be aware that we have earlier this year put on the Statute Book progressive legislation to extend a wide range of protective legislation to regular part-time employees.</P>
    <P>Our responses to the proposals which have not yet been adopted have been <Col N="2539" /> generally positive and constructive, although we, like other delegations, consider that certain features of the Commission's proposals need to be clarified further.  In this regard, Deputies will appreciate that measures which might have an impact on employment must be very carefully assessed and that it will not be possible to take final positions on the proposals until they have been discussed further under a future Presidency.</P>
    <P>The second part of the Deputies' questions refer to the proposed Directive on the organisation of working time.  This proposal has been presented by the Commission as a safety and health measure based on Article 118A of the Treaty as inserted by the Single European Act.  It deals with such issues as the limitation of maximum weekly working time, the limitation of the maximum duration of night work and the provision of daily, weekly and annual rest and rest during work.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports the principle that minimum legal standards in respect of working time or rest periods should be set in respect of certain types of employment or certain categories of employee, specifically for employments in which excessive working hours could be injurious to safety of health.  We are also concerned to avoid placing undue burdens on employers as this could endanger competitiveness and employment.  We favour a Directive which lays down minimum standards where necessary but which can be applied flexibly according to the circumstances of individual member states.</P>
    <P>In our view, the terms of the Commission's proposed Directive are too rigid, as they seek to set out a regulatory framework which it envisages would apply in a relatively inflexible manner across a great variety of employments. The Commission's proposals could also have an adverse impact on employment and competitiveness.  I expressed reservations about the level of regulation being proposed when the draft Directive was discussed for the first time at the Social Affairs Council on 3 December.  In particular, I was concerned at proposals <Col N="2540" /> that all workers should be limited to a maximum of 48 hours work each week and that all workers, in every situation, should have 11 hours consecutive rest between two periods of daily work.  I was also concerned about a proposal in relation to Sunday rest which I would regard as inappropriate in a health and safety Directive.  The proposals would, in my view, introduce an undue level of inflexibility and we have, therefore, been seeking amendments which would achieve the same objective without adverse consequences for employment. The combined impact of the provisions on unemployment and competitiveness was my primary concern.</P>
    <P>Ireland's concerns about the proposed Directive, based on the text presented to the Council on 3 December, were recognised and shared by several other member states, including Germany, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. Following the discussion, the Dutch Presidency agreed to consider the points made by the various member states and to forward the proposal to the incoming Portuguese Presidency for further consideration.</P>
    <P>In future discussion, my overall approach to this proposal will be constructive, but I will have regard to the likely impact of the final provisions on employment in Ireland.  I will continue to seek improvements in the text with a view to arriving at a Directive which will enable our particular employment circumstances to be taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am loath to ask the Minister a supplementary question for fear of getting an extraordinarily lengthy reply, but in fairness to the Minister it is a complicated topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate briefly the Government's reservations about the first Directive he referred to: has he had discussions with the Social Partners, particularly the FIE and the ICTU about this Directive?  Is it the Government's intention to do nothing about the Directive until some other country, which happens to have the Presidency, puts it on the agenda of the Social Affairs Council <Col N="2541" /> or will they actively seek to have it as a draft put on the agenda of the Social Affairs Council in the new year so that difficulties with it may be teased out?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to that particular Directive, the Government do not have any major reservations. However, as I indicated to the Deputy, the Presidencies concerned did not bring it to the Council for discussion.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate &mdash; and this is also relevant to the second part but I shall not deal with that now &mdash; that Directives are not adopted on the first day they go to Council.  In respect of the general principle of the first Directive, I assure the Deputy that the Government do not have major reservations but it is up to the Presidencies concerned to bring it to the Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Having passed legislation in relation to part time workers earlier this year, which had the support of all sides of the House, though some of us had reservations about the implementation of aspects of it, would the Minister not agree that it is in the interests of Irish workers, working part time, that the additional protections that the Directives seek to prescribe are put in place, obviously, subject to the proviso that that does not generate a problem in the creation of employment?  Would the Minister agree also that we should actively pursue having these Directives addressed, and, indeed, having any problems with them addressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree absolutely. Perhaps if I get to know my colleagues on the Social Affairs Council as well as I knew those on the Agricultural Council, from the next meeting on I will be in a position, in informal contact with them either before meetings or afterwards, to underline the importance we attach to this issue.  Perhaps we may be able to give an encouraging boost to the next Presidency, the Portuguese, to have that directive brought forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>On several occasions the <Col N="2542" /> Minister has used the term &ldquo;measures which might have an impact on employment&rdquo;. Perhaps he could explain that a little further, since any improvement in working conditions may be said to have an impact on employment.</P>
      <P>In relation to the meeting of 3 December at which the Minister oppossed the Directive to limit working hours to 48 hours, to reduce overtime, to provide for weekend rest periods and so on, could the Minister give his reason for considering that those measures would have an adverse effect on employment since, presumably, if hours of working, overtime and so on are restricted, there would be an increase in employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This instance was the first time that the proposals were brought to the Council of Social Affairs Ministers. From my experience over five Councils now I can tell the Deputy that with something as complicated as this issue you do not immediately give our agreement without even considering the implications.</P>
      <P>We are teasing out just some of the anomalies, and I shall give the House one example in that regard, although I cannot provide all of the examples.  The proposals to limit working hours to a maximum of 48 hours each week and that in every case workers should have 11 hours' consecutive rest between two periods of daily work seems reasonable on the face of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission was asked, but they would not give a definitive indication as to the position of, for example, a factory maintenance man, an electrician or a fitter, who was called to do important work for a quarter of an hour at, say, 10.30 at night.  Under the proposals that worker would not be free to resume work until at least another 11 hours had passed after that 15 minutes' attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a derogation for emergency workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>But this would not involve emergency work.  It would be normal maintenance of one form or another. We asked for clarification on a range of issues of that kind.</P>
      <P>My second point is that I was very anxious to ensure that what was decided would be implemented evenly, and I am sure that everyone in the House would want that to be done.  At this stage I am not satisfied that that would have been the case.  From discussions I have had since in other member states with business people, I have reason to believe that they seem to take a different view as to what their obligation would be if their governments did adopt the Directive.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I assure the House that after the Government have considered the impact of the Directives and the way in which they will be implemented we will have no reservations. But we will not agree to adopt something without even giving consideration to the implications and then find that others agree but take a completely different view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Minister's reply he said that many improvements would be considered to determine whether they would distort the market. A pre-condition was that if an improved measure was likely to distort the market it was unlikely that it would be introduced. The existing legislation deals with regular part-time workers but there is a growing body of casual part-time workers who have practically no protection.  Does the Minister intend to initiate action within the European Community or are we to wait until the Commission take action? Will Ireland initiate any action that would improve the lot of the casual worker?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree and I repeat that at all times the Government have made it clear that we support the view that there is a need to ensure that persons in what one might call non-standard employment are protected by European and domestic legislation.  It is my responsibility to make that point clear beyond &ldquo;yea&rdquo; or &ldquo;nay&rdquo;.  I assure the <Col N="2544" /> House that that will be our priority. However, the Deputy must know that we cannot act as if we were permanent presidents of the Council of Ministers.</P>

      <P>We are talking about procedures in the European Community. I assure the Deputy that in contacts with the Commission and with the Presidency for the time being we will bring those points across forcibly.  There is no procedure for us to take up the issue other than to introduce it under &ldquo;Any Other Business&rdquo; or a similar heading, but that will not lead to a regulation or a decision.</P>

The anomaly that arises in relation to part-time workers' liability for PRSI is having a devastating effect on the mushroom industry in my constituency. The people employed in that industry part time are quite willing to forego contributions of PRSI but there is an understanding with the mushroom growers that the levy on turnover or on the number of units on a farm would probably meet the requirement if there was a little flexibility <Col N="2545" /> from the Minister's Department.

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to an unsigned document which purports to represent the views of members of the Restaurants Association of Ireland which has been widely circulated recently.  The Restaurants Association of Ireland have disowned the document which expresses concern about the alleged presence of illegal immigrants in Ireland.  Matters related to illegal immigration or residence within the State are not within my area of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Conditions relating to the entry to the <Col N="2546" /> State of non-EC nationals and their residence here are governed by the Aliens Act, 1935, the Aliens Orders, 1946 and 1975, and the European Communities (Aliens) Regulations, 1977.  Under that legislation, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, a non-EC national may not take up employment in the State without a work permit issued by my Department.  My responsibility, therefore, relates only to the granting of work permits to an employer in respect of the employment of a non-EC national.</P>
    <P>Official policy in relation to the issue of work permits is a restrictive one, particularly in view of the current high level of unemployment.  In recent years, a number of reforms have been adopted in relation to the consideration of work permit applications, particularly in the case of the ethnic restaurant sector. These reforms were designed to safeguard the interests of Irish restaurants and workers by restricting the number of work permits granted for non-EC nationals.  I am satisfied that the system now in place achieves that aim.  I am not aware of any suggestions to the contrary.</P>
    <P>The number of work permits issued for the catering sector over the last six years is as follows:</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of cases of legal immigrants working in restaurants, where the restaurateur, or <Col N="2547" /> employer, is not prepared to apply for a work permit and makes it clear to the immigrant that if he or she insists on it, their employment will be discontinued? Has he any mechanism in his Department to provide assistance to such employees who, understandably, do not wish to lose their employment but who do wish to be regularised by having work permits?</P>

      <P>I am not so aware.  If any information in relation to cases like that is available to the Deputy or to anybody else I should like to have it.  There are two sides to this matter.  People do have entitlement to work permits.  When, for one reason or another, their employers would not want them to have such work permits that would suggest to me that such employers were not interested in meeting their responsibilities on every front, whether it be PRSI contributions, tax or whatever else.  I would definitely be glad to hear of any such cases because one does not want to see victimisation either way.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Labour</askee>
      <Quest>if he has considered the possible introduction of (1) longer maternity leave and (2) some form of paternity leave; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans at present to introduce longer maternity leave or to introduce paternity leave.</P>
      <P>The question of protection for pregnant workers has recently been considered in detail at European Community level.  As a result, a new directive on the protection at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding was the subject of political agreement at the council of Social Affairs Ministers on 6 November 1991 and is being referred to the European Parliament in accordance with the normal procedure relating to health and safety directives under Article 118A of the Treaty.  This directive is part of the overall social action programme for the implementation of the Social Charter.  Its focus is towards ensuring safe working conditions for pregnant workers.  It provides for 14 weeks maternity leave.  This proposal is in line with the existing national legislative provision under the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981.  That Act provides for 14 weeks maternity leave and 4 weeks additional maternity leave at the option of the employee.</P>
      <P>The question of paternity leave is a separate issue.  Such leave would involve additional costs for employers which would be difficult to contemplate in present circumstances because of the possible implications for competitiveness and employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that it is anomalous that maternity leave is made available to the mother of a couple fortunate enough to have a child themselves while no such leave is provided in circumstances in which a child is adopted?  Would the Minister agree that it is anomalous that a woman who is at <Col N="2549" /> work and makes social insurance contributions will get maternity leave and appropriate benefits whereas a woman unable to have a child, who adopts a child, is deprived of those benefits? Would the Minister agree that our legislation, and indeed the directive to which he referred which is now to go before the European Parliament, should be amended to include a provision to allow, in particular, the mother of an adopted child to have a period of weeks leave following the placement of a child with her for adoption purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the actual physical circumstances of the mother in each case varies considerably.  I do not claim to be an expert in this area but the Deputy will be aware that the provision in respect of a natural mother of 14 weeks maternity leave is linked to the date of birth of a child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>A significant portion of that maternity leave is post-date of birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but nonetheless it is linked, as I have said, to the date of birth, whereas the circumstances of an adoptive mother are somewhat different. Though the maternal responsibilities are quite the same, the circumstances, to say the least of it, are different.  It is not a matter I have been asked to address in this question.  I will consider it but I do not want to give any undue commitment at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give serious consideration to providing, by way of legislation, a period of six to eight weeks leave for adoptive mothers, which would be less than the full maternity leave and which would only partly precede the birth of a child, but would be a reasonable period bearing in mind that social insurance contributions are the same and that part of the purpose of the leave would be the same, which is to allow the mother to have time with the child, in the early days following the child's birth or placement, when the mother would have time to formulate a <Col N="2550" /> relationship with the child without being under work or financial pressures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This does not arise from the question.  Therefore, I do not want to give any commitment at this point on any such issue without having considered all of its implications.  The Deputy will appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was asked to consider in respect of this question was the introduction of longer maternity leave.  As the Deputy will know that does exclude at this point and in all respect adoptive mothers.  I do not have any information on that.  All I can say to the Deputy is that, while I am not prepared to exclude it from my considerations, I do not want to give the impression that that means there is a real prospect of a change at this point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In pursuit of the question of adoptive mothers, may I remind the Minister that on 29 May last his predecessor gave an undertaking in this House to have the question of maternity leave for adoptive mothers examined by his Department.  As a new Minister in the Department I appreciate that the present Minister would not be entirely <i>au fait</i> with every commitment given by his predecessor. Would he pursue that matter in his Department so that, when it is raised in the House again, there might be some progress to report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of paternity leave, would the Minister accept that paternity leave is now commonplace in that fathers play a more active role at the time of the birth of a child, that many good employers have already voluntarily concluded agreements with their employees for periods of paternity leave; and that it <Col N="2551" /> would be of assistance to those employers and their competitiveness if the Minister were to consider giving legislative effect to some length of paternity leave now in view of fathers commitments at the time of the birth of a child?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to say that if the Deputy were to ask our taxpayers, in particular PAYE taxpayers &mdash; who, as I have said, are already very hard pressed &mdash; whether they considered this proposal for paternity leave a priority or would fund that kind of programme, I do not think they would rush to support it. Probably they would tell one there were more urgent causes to which their tax could contribute rather than paternity leave.  I do not want to give the House any impression that it features fairly high on my priority list either at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Minister that many of the PAYE taxpayers to whom he refers are people who might avail of paternity leave?  May I express some surprise at what I consider to be a very unenlightened reply from the Minister, in view of his expressed public commitments to the family, that he should resist the provision of paternity leave which is now a standard provision in many good employments?  For example, there are agreements in many employments for paternity leave.  Understandably, the periods of paternity leave are much shorter than for maternity leave, but may I suggest to the Minister that it is not unreasonable to suggest that there be legislation introduced to provide for, say, one week's paternity leave for fathers who need such a facility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that we discourage the allowance of paternity leave by employers who are so minded.  A number of them are providing for it and I commend them but I cannot see that it has high priority as regards a State contribution.  Some small and medium-sized businesses would not be able to introduce this facility.  I do not want to impose a burden on people who <Col N="2552" /> would be unable to bear it.  Perhaps we can encourage it but not impose it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 35 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>FáS have been given authority, in exceptional circumstances, to allow the re-engagement of persons who have completed social employment scheme projects. The reasons would include the person being a key participant, the likelihood of the person getting employment with a little more work experience and a shortage of replacements available so as to enable completion of projects.</P>
      <P>The numbers involved are small with 103 persons having been re-engaged so far this year.  It is not possible to provide details today of the numbers of persons re-engaged in the social employment scheme in the last four years.  However, I have asked FáS to furnish the Deputies with the information sought as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The Minister says the numbers involved are small &mdash; currently 103 persons.  In the context of the 103 persons, in what parts of the country and in which Dáil constituencies were those living who were re-engaged?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information.  If the Deputy is saying that I should insist that FAS get that information in respect of the small numbers involved, I would be diverting them from more important work.

      <P>The Deputy might tell his colleagues on all sides of the House that they should not make recommendations to FáS or anybody else.  As a matter of course, FáS recommend that people who have completed their social employment scheme should not be re-engaged. Where there is specific application for re-employment and in circumstances which may be unusual or even unique in respect of a particular applicant, they would refer the matter for consideration by the Minister.  I have seen some such recently.  They are very small in number.  Normally they would only consider it where there is no other person available to do the kind of work that a particular social employment scheme member was doing.  They look into that in great detail.  On that basis they bring a report to the Minister.  I have been very slow to take any action except in the most exceptional cases.  There have been two cases since I came into the office.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by the Minister for Finance on 18 December 1991:</P>
    <P>That Dáil éireann takes note of the 1992 Estimates for the Public Services (Abridged Version) and of the 1992 Summary Public Capital Programme. </P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>noting that the 1992 Estimates for <Col N="2607" /> the Public Services and the 1991 Summary Public Capital Programme</P>
    <P>(a) fail to provide for a number of commitments freely entered into by the Government including those on public service pay, the reduction of the pupil/teacher ratio at primary level, and an increase in Overseas Development Aid;</P>
    <P>(b) provide for an increase in the daily charges for hospital patients of 25 per cent, representing a total increase of 50 per cent in 12 months, but do not include any specific commitments to assist the plight of the mentally handicapped and their families, despite the clearly established need in this area;</P>
    <P>(c) will result in further reduction in capital expenditure on areas like public housing and the construction and equipping of primary schools;</P>
    <P>(d) include no new initiatives to deal with unemployment, despite the fact that the Government estimate that the average jobless level in 1992 will reach 275,000,</P>
    <P>calls on the Government to withdraw the Estimates and to redraft them in such a manner as will ensure that essential public services are re-established on a sound basis and to enable employment to be tackled by stimulating a more rapid rate of job creation. </P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the essential trust, confidence and mutual respect which is a feature of the partnership element in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  I was assuring the partners, more particularly the trade union partners, that the Government are determined to act in accordance with that trust.  We want particularly to assure the trade unions that we are aware of the understandable anger and resentment on the part of a number of their members in the PAYE sector having regard to some <Col N="2608" /> of the scandals and tax evasion that have been widely spoken about in public recently.  Because of the major contribution made to this programme, particularly by the trade union partners, the Government are all the more determined to ensure that this programme will remain intact.</P>
      <P>Attempts have been made to undermine that trust but I am glad to say that that trust will remain a major feature of the discussions we will have with our trade union partners.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to some other matters in the industrial relations field.  Apart from trying to spread collective blame across the business sector, which is unfair and unreasonable, there have also been attempts to undermine confidence in the Government even where there is no basis for improper or irregular behaviour on the part of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For my part I have in the past been made a target by certain people, particularly by some members of the Opposition with no basis whatsoever, as having tolerated practices I have always unequivocally condemned when I was Minister for Agriculture and Food.  As Minister for Agriculture and Food I have always been consistent in implementing sanctions against anybody involved in irregularities.  Nevertheless, Members opposite decided to deliberately undermine confidence in the Government by levelling all kinds of spurious allegations which they knew in their hearts were false.  That is not the way to maintain confidence.  That is almost as reprehensible as the actions of those who have undermined mutual respect here through tax evasion and other unlawful activities.  I hope we will re-establish some standards of trust and respect for each other so that the partners who look to us to get a programme through will see that we are giving the proper example. The irony is that, having stayed at arms length from some individuals in the beef industry &mdash; which my predecessor never did &mdash; I am accused of this.  I never accompanied anybody on any promotion trip.  My predecessor did.  I assure the trade unions that I will follow through <Col N="2609" /> with the same standards as Minister for Labour as I did as Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>To turn to industrial relations matters, these may be a matter of frivolity for the Deputy opposite but not for the Government or me.  I hope we will not see another chapter such as we have seen where people attempt to undermine confidence in the Government in the full knowledge that the allegations they make are not true.  In my 26 years as a Member of this House I have never seen this happen until recently.</P>
    <P>In relation to other industrial relations matters, this year saw the establishment of the Labour Relations Commission under the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, with the specific role of promoting good industrial relations.  I am glad to note that it has been very effective.</P>
    <P>Since January there has been a substantial increase in the volume of activity in the conciliation service and also in the proportion of cases being settled at conciliation.  Of course, primary responsibility for the resolution of disputes rests with the parties and an important objective of the Commission is to bring about a change in attitudes. Employers and unions must realise that the resolution of disputes lies in their hands and the automatic referral of cases to a third party is not conducive to the creation of a good industrial relations climate.</P>
    <P>While the level of settlements at conciliation is encouraging, I would like to see more emphasis being placed on the resolution of disputes between the parties with the services of the LRC being used only when genuine efforts at settlement at local level have failed.  Through its various services the commission will encourage and facilitate this more active approach.</P>
    <P>The commission's responsibility for drawing up codes of practice is one which has received a considerable amount of attention over the past few months.  I hope to be in a position to introduce the codes of practice by ministerial order early in the New Year.  I am glad to say that the <Col N="2610" /> general pattern of industrial disputes has been diminishing because of the trust and understanding that exists between the partners, and that includes the Government. The involvement of ICTU and the FIE in this is something we greatly appreciate.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I will continue to implement the proposals consistent with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social progress.</i>  I assure our partners &mdash; especially our trade union partners &mdash; that we recognise their commitment and respect the issues they must now face. However, I am confident that the partnership trust which we have built together over the past number of years can be used to overcome the issues we have to deal with now and that the programme will remain intact.  It is in that spirit we have built up the programme and nobody wants to throw it away lightly.  I am convinced that we will be able to maintain this programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Estimate. The reaction of the Government, through the Minister for Social Welfare, was the meanest proposed legislation I ever heard in the House prior to Christmas.  The Government's &ldquo;Christmas box&rdquo; for the poorer sections of the community is nothing short of disgraceful. Indeed, part of the proposals may be illegal and unconstitutional, but I will come back to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not say how much revenue would be collected from the measures he announced, nor did he say what categories, if any, of social welfare recipients will benefit from the change. This is a knee-jerk reaction to the perilous situation in the Exchequer.  The Government have reneged on all the basic principles of fair play and decency. They have decided that the poor and the sick must carry the can for others, some of whom could make millions of pounds on a single deal in a couple of months. People who are sick, who do not have a job &mdash; or who had one and lost it &mdash; are revolted by being told a few days before Christmas that there will be changes in <Col N="2611" /> social welfare which will leave them worse off than they are at present.</P>
    <P>Many of the measures outlined by the Minister will have devastating effects. For instance, the rerouteing of short term sickness benefits through the employer and allowing such payments to be taxed will greatly hurt people.  When a doctor certifies an employee as sick it will be up to the employer to pay him or her for the first four weeks.  People working in small struggling enterprises will find it extremely difficult to pay a sick employee out of the firm's resources.  The Minister should re-examine the question of taxation of long term social welfare benefits. When you come down to brass tacks, if an employer &mdash; big or small &mdash; is unable to pay an employee for four weeks it means that the employee will not have any money for four weeks until social welfare benefits come into effect.  That is grossly unfair and should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>The proposed changes in the contribution condition for receipt of social welfare benefit will mean that most part-time workers will be unable to draw unemployment benefit despite having paid their contributions.  Many seasonal workers in the tourist trade, and in Bord na Móna, etc., will be debarred from unemployment benefit because, as the House is aware, at present one must have 39 PRSI or ordinary contributions paid in the previous tax year.  If the contributions required to qualify are raised it will mean that most part-time workers will not qualify for payment.  The only other route open to them is to apply for ordinary unemployment assistance, only to find that the money they earned during the year will be taken into account for assessment; most of them will be over the eligibility level.  Many part-time workers who become unemployed will have nothing to live on for some time.  There is no social justice, equity or fair play in that proposal.</P>
    <P>The decision to exclude from short term social welfare benefits people who do not have any insurance contributions will cause financial havoc.  I refer to <Col N="2612" /> people who do not have insurable employment, who are not in a position to pay stamps.  The only place they can approach will be the local health board and apply for the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  As a result of what the Minister said today, I understand that those people are likely to be debarred, which is a woeful step in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>The decision to exclude top earners from dental and optical benefit will certainly be strongly opposed by people in that category, with certain justification. The spouses of such earners were supposed to get benefits but that did not materialise.  People who pay large sums in income tax must be wondering if they will get any concessions.  There will be 275,000 people out of work in 1992; up to now redundant workers received severance pay and provided they had adequate contributions they were entitled to 15 months' unemployment benefit.  I note from the regulations that this will also be curtailed.  Does it mean that they will not get the top rate of unemployment benefit?  Will the 15 months' period be curtailed?  If so, it will add insult to injury to a man or woman who has just lost a job.  Is this a fair proposal?  At a sensitive time like Christmas why have the Government decided to bring in swingeing cuts?  If they implement the proposals outlined by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Daly, there will be savings in the region of up to £150 million.</P>
    <P>It is untold what can be collected if one decides to hit what can only be described as the soft underbelly of the poor and the sick in this country.  When I heard the announcement, following the Estimates and after the Government press conference, like everyone else I was appalled that the Government had accepted that 275,000 people would be without a job in 1992.  I hold a very important brief as spokesperson on social welfare and it is important that we protect the living standards of the less well off and the underprivileged.  It is important that we protect the people who have no voice and who do not have the strong <Col N="2613" /> sectional back-up which many groups in society have.  It was important that the views of the poor, the aged, the disabled and the unemployed be brought to the floor of this House today and, indeed, every other day for that matter.</P>
    <P>I had believed, innocently I suppose, despite the fact that we have such an overhang of Exchequer borrowing that we would arrive at a situation where 1992 would be a good one for social welfare recipients.  Nobody could have expected that but at least we should protect the people who are not in a position to protect themselves.  The Estimate which the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Daly, brought in here today is astonishing. Some people will say there is nothing wrong with taxing social welfare benefits as such.  If all things were equal there is no reason any Government would not actually look at the fairness of taxing social welfare benefits.  The target has been the soft underbelly, the sick and the poor, who have no recourse whatever, who have to take their medicine. Many unfortunate people who get up on a Monday morning have no job to go to, if they are middle-aged they know they will never have a job because of the manner in which the country is being run.  If they receive a small amount of severance pay or redundancy they will not be entitled to unemployment benefit for which they have paid stamps for a number of years.  I believe somebody will bring a case on that matter through the courts because no Government are entitled to tamper with those payments. It is certainly a knee-jerk reaction to the huge problems we have with the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Any Christian society worth its salt will protect the people I have mentioned.  I am not silly enough to talk about huge increases.  Let nobody tell me that a man and his wife and four children in receipt of long term unemployment assistance of £136 per week is doing well.  Any of us who happen to have children, and particularly when they get to their teens, will know that one would almost need a money-making machine to keep the show going.  Let nobody tell me that £55 is <Col N="2614" /> adequate to keep a single person body and soul for seven days of the week.  Let us get away from the idea that somehow or other people in receipt of social welfare are OK, they are not OK.  The terrible disease which is paralysing our economy is lack of jobs.</P>
    <P>I recall being in the House 12 months ago when the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, said the average unemployment rate for the year would be 225,000 people but we know now it was almost 30,000 higher.  Where were all the stategists who were supposed to know all those things?  Was it not plain that thousands of exiles returned at Christmas and afterwards and remained here?  Young people who would normally emigrate did not do so this summer.</P>
    <P>Having done some calculations in relation to the cost of unemployment I find the loss to the Exchequer when a person is on the dole and everything is taken into account is £12,000 to £13,000. If that is multiplied for 50,000 one is talking about a cost in excess of £600 million.  That is a monument to bad planning and bad Government.  After all the discussions we had since 1987 and 1988 we are back to where we started or even worse.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Department of Agriculture and Food Estimate in so far as the whole grant-in-aid to Teagasc, the state advisory board, is concerned. The House will be aware that the State funds Teagasc to the tune of £32 million per year.  The board of Teagasc have said clearly in the last few weeks there is no way they can continue to provide advice and research unless certain things happen.  In a leaked document the board said they would get rid of Grange, Kinsealy, Belclare and Athenry Agriculture College.  After much national pressure it appears Grange will remain open and I applaud that because I believe Grange is very important to every beef farmer in the country.</P>
    <P>So far as western development is concerned it is important for thousands of small farming families &mdash; and many others not involved &mdash; to continue to have independent research carried out by <Col N="2615" /> Teagasc in Belclare.  The idea was to close the most successful agricultural college in the country where there is a surplus of students and where we have nationally and internationally acclaimed courses on pig husbandry and poultry management where those young people have a job six months before they leave the college.</P>
    <P>So far as the Estimates are concerned the Government have decided to reduce the grant-in-aid by about £1 million.  If you take the rate of inflation at approximately 3 per cent into account that will amount to another £800,000 or £900,000. However bad the financial position of the Teagasc board was a week ago they are £2 million worse off now.  Ministers and Deputies in the Government parties tell me they will ensure &mdash; I hope they are right &mdash; there will be no reduction in the activities of Teagasc.  That is a very poor way of showing it.  Grant-in-aid to Teagasc was reduced in 1987-88 by 47 per cent and they have never recovered from that cut.  That organisation are at a level now below which they cannot withstand the demands on them.</P>
    <P>So far as the west is concerned, anything less than keeping a research station, a flag ship outfit &mdash; Mellowes' College in Athenry &mdash; open as the only State-run agricultural college in the west, from Clare to Donegal, is totally unacceptable.</P>

      <P>The framing of next year's spending Estimates and the putting together of the overall budget for the year ahead takes <Col N="2616" /> place against a background of very difficult economic conditions.  These conditions demand a political response that is imaginative and caring but one which is also firm and fiscally responsible.  The unemployment crisis which sadly is set to worsen in the year ahead is the overriding priority of the Progressive Democrats in Government.  The thrust of the recently revised Programme for Government for the next two and a half years is focused on that issue.  That is why so many of its provisions highlight the need for major changes in how we run our affairs, including such fundamental matters as industrial policy, tax reform and major institutional change at both central and local government levels.</P>
      <P>The challenge here is to bring imagination and efficiency to the way Government operates.  A caring ethos also prevades the work of this Government in framing the Estimates and in preparing next year's Estimates.  It is essential that our social services in health, education and social welfare combine to ensure the welfare of the weakest and the less well off in our society, and protects them from the economic retrenchment that must follow at times of worldwide economic recession.  We must also have an approach that is firm and fiscally responsible. The economic fortunes of this country in line with some of the world's leading economies, notably the US, Britain and many of the European Community countries, having worsened over the past year.  As a major exporting country with a small open economy we cannot insulate ourselves from the effects of recession overseas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The turnaround in the country's economic fortunes has been sudden and dramatic. In 1990 we experienced a record growth of 7.5 per cent GNP.  The total number employed, according to a labour force survey, increased by 36 per cent and unemployment reduced somewhat. This year as a result of the biting international recession economic growth has ground nearly to a halt.  The increase in the workforce has outpaced the growth in employment and with a dramatic reduction in emigration, along with the <Col N="2617" /> influx of returned emigrants, we continue to experience further growth in unemployment. The situation facing us is very grave on a number of fronts besides the unemployment crisis, the level of public debt while still falling remains unacceptably high.  Servicing the interest payments of this debt alone consumes three-quarters of all income tax receipts or £2.4 billion approximately and we continue to add to the debt mountain.  Our borrowing requirement for 1991 will be higher than that achieved last year and in cash terms will turn out at about £600 million.  That is why it is misleading and irresponsible for some people to claim that because the pace of fiscal correction in the past few years has exceeded target, we can afford to further loosen borrowing next year. That would be fine if we did not have the overhanging debt mountain of £26 billion.</P>
    <P>There are some very positive economic features amidst the gloom of the present situation.  Employment levels in industry have held up very well.  This is in marked contrast with the dismal performance of manufacturing industry during the previous recessional periods of the seventies and the mid-eighties.  Employment in the services sector has continued to grow. The preliminary labour force survey studies for 1991 suggest that an overall increase of 27,000 jobs was achieved in this sector over the last two years.</P>
    <P>Our trade balances remain very healthy.  Our most recent figures for September show the best export figures in 18 months.  The Progressive Democrats are confident that if the various sectors of our community continue to pull together, we can as a nation win the battle against high unemployment, high taxation, excessive debt and poor economic growth.  The Progressive Democrats are convinced that the solutions to these problems require a series of inter-related responses.</P>
    <P>Firstly, we must recognise that the unemployment crisis in our society cannot be cured by short term expansionary budgetary measures.  Our existing level of debt is far too high to contemplate that.  Our debt must be <Col N="2618" /> reduced and we must bring our current budget into balance.  That is why the revised Programme for Government's mid-term target of reducing the EBR to 1.5 per cent by 1993 is crucial, as is our target of reducing the current budget deficit to 1 per cent by the end of 1993.  In particular, we must reduce our borrowing for day to day spending purposes.  It is indefensible that we as a nation continue to run up bills that our children will have to pay.  We must learn to live within our means.</P>
    <P>Investment in our economy is sensitive to the overall level of fiscal stability and to the Government's capacity and determination to underpin it.  We must also recognise that the goal of participating in European Monetary Union at the earliest possible time is dependent on maintaining certain macro-economic targets, which are in themselves prudent and desirable for any properly managed economy.</P>
    <P>We must also recognise that, along with fiscal stability, other structural reforms must also be undertaken.  In this area the Progressive Democrats lay particular emphasis on the need for major tax reform and to remove its distorting and inhibiting impact on work, effort and enterprise.</P>
    <P>The gross Book of Estimates published on Tuesday allows for a 3.9 per cent growth in public spending next year.  This exceeds the likely rate of inflation and therefore involves a real increase in spending.  One-quarter of the increase, however, is to cover the projected rise in the live register.</P>
    <P>The Estimates do not provide for potential pay increases of £70 million for public servants, and neither do they anticipate the possible budget day increases for social welfare recipients. These are matters to which the Government must give further attention over the next month in framing the budget.  It is possible, therefore, that these Estimates will have to be further revised, and cut back next month when the overall budget aggregates are firmed up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2619" /> The Progressive Democrats are committed to ensuring that the overall borrowing target, or EBR, does not exceed 2.5 per cent of GNP in 1992.  We recognise that in the current economic climate, achieving this will be difficult and we cannot rule out further expenditure cuts to achieve this.</P>
    <P>It can be seen from the individual departmental Estimates where the additional spending arises, compared with this year's projected out-turn. Additional spending is limited to a small number of Departments, and increases in education, health and social welfare make up over three-quarters of the total. Many Departments will experience cuts in real terms.</P>
    <P>The issue of public sector pay has loomed large in recent months and the slump in economic growth has obliged the Government to adjust the pay proposals contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  Such a move, while regrettable, is provided for in the programme when sufficient levels of economic growth are not realised.  The public sector wage bill amounted to £3,160 million in 1990.  Next year, with the revised pay arrangements presented to the unions last week, it is set to rise to £3,681 million.  This represents an increase of 16.5 per cent over two years, when inflation will be less than half that over the same period.  It is questionable whether we can even afford this level of increase, not to mind increasing it by a futher £100 million as we are now being urged to do by the unions.</P>
    <P>I would ask all public sector employees to reflect on the economic and financial difficulties which the country and the Government now face.  I am sure that most public servants would not welcome futher increases in taxation to meet the Exchequer's wage bill, nor do I believe that workers or trade unions want to see public services cut back further to provide the money which the Exchequer does not otherwise have.</P>
    <P>I can understand the annoyance and upset of workers at having to countenance further delays in wage increases <Col N="2620" /> which they had expected, but the plain truth is that the Government have sought to go as far as we possibly can in trying to meet next year's projected wage bill. I am conscious too, that an appeal for further sacrifices on the part of public servants is made all the more difficult in the light of the recent business scandals that have unfolded.  Workers, like teachers, nurses, prison officers soldiers and gardaí providing vital public services, can rightly ask why they should go without legitimate pay demands while a handful of people in this country can apparently amass millions of pounds, with little or no tax liability.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats share that sense of outrage and that is why we, along with the whole Government, are pursuing the various public inquiries so zealously to ensure that any proven wrong doing in these recent business transactions will be properly dealt with.</P>
    <P>It is also evident from these recent business scandals that some aspects of our taxation laws, and our tax enforcement and collection systems are in need of overhaul.  The Progressive Democrats are fully committed to such initiatives, and a particular measure in the agreed Programme for Government, proposing the introduction of a universal ID system, would be a major step forward in this regard.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the coming budget it will be possible to introduce this measure, and to provide for the application of a universal ID number to all business and financial transactions.  Through that one measure, decisive action could be taken against tax evasion and the black economy and it could be the foundation of greater social equity in our society.</P>
    <P>I would also remind public sector workers, and workers generally, that the Government's tax reform programme will give many of them more money in their pocket.  It is surely preferable in our present economic circumstances that improved take-home-pay arises from tax reform rather than increased Exchequer payroll costs.</P>
    <P>Turning now to my own departmental <Col N="2621" /> responsibilities, the net Energy and Forestry Estimates for 1992, of £6.4 million and £9.5 million respectively, represent only a fraction of 1 per cent of the total 1992 Estimates for Public Services.  Net expenditure in my Department has been reduced by 41 per cent over the past four years.  The over-riding policy objective of this Government in relation to energy is to facilitate its provision at competitive cost, with every possible regard to security of supply, along with environmental and safety concerns.</P>
    <P>The strategic importance of both the Whitegate Refinery and the Whiddy Oil Terminal was brought to the forefront by the Gulf conflict earlier this year. Officials of my Department, together with the INPC, are continuing to evaluate projects for the modernisation of the refinery, and upgrading of the oil terminal to further underpin supply security and reduce costs.</P>
    <P>Natural gas now accounts for over 15 per cent of primary energy demand. Against this backbround, and to provide for assured supplies into the future, I have, as the House knows, given the highest priority to planning for interconnection with the UK gas grid.  The project is on target to meet its completion date of October 1993.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to announce that the Government have today given final approval for this project which they estimate will cost about £250 million.  Following my meeting with Commissioner Millan last week I was satisfied that the project would receive 35 per cent grant support under the EC Regen Programme and I am glad to be able to inform the House that the formal decision confirming a Regen grant of over £80 million has just been made this afternoon.</P>
    <P>One of my main priorities as Minister for Energy is to bring this project to effective implementation.  Because of the critical reliance on one source of supply gas interconnection had to command priority.</P>
    <P>The linking with European energy grids will not, however, stop at gas and I have already asked my Department and the ESB to look at ways which will best <Col N="2622" /> facilitate the bringing forward of an electricity interconnector as well.  My ultimate aim is to ensure that we can provide secure sources of energy for our industry and services at internationally competitive prices.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the recently negotiated agreement with Marathon Petroleum Ireland Limited, which will involve the drilling of seven exploration wells in the period to 1996, will also help to provide domestic supplies of gas into the future.</P>
    <P>In 1991, the demand for electricity has continued to grow at over 5 per cent per annum.  If this trend were to continue it would draw closer the time when extra generating capacity would be required.</P>
    <P>On the nuclear side, the most important development this year has been the passing of the Radiological Protection Act, 1991, providing for the establishment of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, to replace the existing Nuclear Energy Board.  I hope to formally establish the new institute early in the new year.</P>
    <P>On the issue of minerals exploration, I am aware that the whole issue of mining gives rise to great and understandable concern on the part of those who, like myself, wish to see our natural environment preserved.  I would like to take this opportunity to say again clearly that it is Government policy to facilitate the exploitation of the mineral wealth of the country only where this can be done in an environmentally acceptable way.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna derive about 60 per cent of their turnover from milled peat sold to the ESB at a price agreed between the two boards.  The remainder of their products are sold on a competitive basis into the solid fuel and horticultural markets.</P>
    <P>The company's financial situation continues to be a cause for concern in spite of the price it receives for milled peat sold to the ESB.  The report recently published by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies generally confirmed the conclusions of my Department and their consultants.</P>
    <P>Rationalisation and further cost reduction appear to be inescapable.  In these circumstances, and in the present <Col N="2623" /> financial situation, it is not possible to provide Exchequer aid for the company, but I am satisfied that a substantial reduction in debt can be achieved without it.</P>
    <P>Energy conservation is acknowledged as a potentially significant contributor to redressing environmental damage, as well as reducing costs to energy users.  A sum of £300,000 is being provided in the 1992 Estimates for energy conservation activities.</P>
    <P>The Government have identified forestry as a key development activity, and the increased resources being allocated to the Forestry Vote in 1992 is ample testimony to the Government's commitment to this.</P>
    <P>The gross Forestry Vote for 1992 shows a 42 per cent increase over the outturn for this year which is largely offset by an increase in EC funding.  Nearly all of these additional resources are being channelled into afforestation grants and forestry research.  It is very much a case of putting the money into areas where the maximum wealth creation and employment benefits will accrue.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to be able to report to the House that the level of afforestation in 1991 will be a new record high. I expect that the combined planting by Coillte Teoranta and the private sector this year will exceed 23,000 hectares.</P>
    <P>We cannot, however, rest on our laurels.  It is of vital economic and strategic importance to our economy that the area under forest in Ireland be increased from its present level of around 6 per cent to a level, over time, which is more closely aligned with the EC average of 24 per cent.  The drive towards increased afforestation must continue.  The expansion of planting and wood production in the public and private sectors planned under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will generate upwards of 300 extra jobs, gross, in 1992.</P>
    <P>The public forest estate of some 400,000 hectares which transferred to Coillte Teoranta on 1 January 1989 is a major asset base and resource which the company must manage and develop on <Col N="2624" /> a commercial basis.  This year, Coillte Teoranta will plant 12,000 hectares, more than 50 per cent of total national planting, and I expect a similarly good performance from Coillte Teoranta next year.</P>
    <P>Timber production from public forests has increased steadily as a greater percentage of the estate reaches exploitable age.  Revenue from timber sales in 1990 increased by 16 per cent to nearly £32 million.  Unfortunately, the market situation has deteriorated since the last quarter of 1990.  There has been a weakening in demand for construction timber in Ireland and for palletwood and fencing in Britain.  This situation has continued in 1991 but Coillte Teoranta still expect timber production to be reasonably close to last year's level.</P>
    <P>Production from public forests is set to rise to 2.3 million cubic metres by 1995 and to over 3 million cubic metres by the end of the century.  This increase will allow Ireland to become a major exporter of timber products, and will transform Coillte Teoranta into a very profitable and financially sound company.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased also to record the exceptional level of expansion in private forestry in recent years.  Last year an all time record level of planting of 9,217 hectares was achieved.  This year, planting by the private sector is projected to exceed 11,000 hectares, of which it is estimated more than half was by farmers. I intend to see this progress continue well into the future because forestry can play a very important role in supplementing rural incomes.</P>
    <P>The voted allocation of £15.64 million in 1992 for private forestry development will support planting of over 13,000 hectares, the building of over 20 kilometres of private forestry roads, investment in forestry harvesting machinery and various other back-up measures.</P>
    <P>In promoting increased afforestation, it is essential to ensure that such development is compatible with the environment. While the primary objectives of forestry are to produce raw material and create wealth and employment, particularly in rural areas, its potential effects <Col N="2625" /> on wildlife habitats, the landscape and recreation and leisure cannot be ignored. The grant schemes operated by my Department have been structured to encourage the establishment and management of forests which contribute positively to the environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>About three minutes each. I rise to briefly respond to what I see as the outrageous proposals contained in the package presented to the House by the Minister for Social Welfare.  I am shocked, amazed, angry and outraged at the savagery of the proposals.  They are an attack on the rights of insured workers.  The emphasis in the media on this matter has been on the taxation of disability benefit.  This measure is effectively a taxation on sickness rather than on the unemployed.  It is a tax on short term payments made to people to compensate them for lack of income during a period of unemployment.  These payments are made when workers are at their weakest and most vulnerable.  It is effectively a new, additional tax on PAYE workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that the Government, rather than dealing with poverty, are determined to increase the numbers of those living in poverty &mdash; at present one million people are deemed to be living within and below the poverty line.  This is the thin end of the wedge in an attempt by the Government to tax all short term social welfare payments.  I remind the <Col N="2626" /> House that the payment amounts to £55 a week and this will now be taxed.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that this package contains other measures.  There is provision for means-testing for deserted wives' benefit, optical and dental benefit and unemployment benefit for people who are made redundant.  Persons who are long term unemployed will no longer be entitled to disability benefit.  They will be forced, if they become ill during a period of long term unemployment, to go cap in hand to the community welfare officer to get the wherewithal to live. That is a most retrograde step which must be condemned by this House.  I ask the Minister to prevail on his colleagues in Government to withdraw these savage attacks on workers and the unemployed. Alternatively he should do the honourable thing &mdash; he has not been in this office long enough to be involved in the drawing up of these proposals &mdash; and resign from his position as Minister for Social Welfare. He is an honourable man and I believe that these are not his proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I am opposing these Estimates.  In the Minister's speech and, indeed in the speeches of the main Opposition parties, there has been much talk about growth in output and in our national product.  The Green Party have no objection to growth <i>per se</i> but the growth we have had here and the growth that all other political parties aspire to is not sustainable in that it presupposes further growth in the inputs of nonrenewable energy and in industries which clearly do not comply with acceptable environmental standards.  This type of growth will not result in a real increase in living standards in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the social welfare Estiamte is based on an average unemployment figure for next year of 275,000 people.  This is an appalling indictment of the Government's failure to tackle unemployment.  The cost to the country next year of this increase in unemployment is estimated at £66 million.  This money is paid by the Government to people on condition that they do not <Col N="2627" /> work or take study courses to improve their chances of re-employment.  The continued failure by the Government to introduce a basic income scheme for all Irish citizens is to be deplored.</P>
    <P>While there has been a small increase in the health budget allocation, it merely keeps pace with inflation.  The poor, unemployed and mentally handicapped will continue to suffer as a result of inadequate services.  If the Government are intent on tackling tax avoidance and tax evasion they should provide adequate sums.  Money collected from them would help alleviate unnecessary suffering.  The overseas aid budget, at £48 million, is still scandalously low, representing 0.6 per cent of Government expenditure.  There is real poverty here but it does not compare with the poverty in the Third World. The Government's response in this area was very poor.  Finally, I would like to refer to the Environmental Protection Agency for which a sum of £700,000 is provided.  It is quite obvious from this derisory sum that this agency will not come into operation until 1993, four years after it was promised by the Government.  That shows the level of commitment by the Government to the environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In the couple of minutes available to me I wish to comment on the literal despair provoked by the Minister for Health in her failure to find £6 million to permit the Tallaght regional hospital to commence in 1992.  That is in stark contrast to her ability to find £6 million almost this day last year to purchase Carysfort College for UCD.  I regard as ominous her comments today that she is examining alternative sources of funding for the Tallaght hospital.  What is required by the people of west County Dublin is a people's hospital, not a Blackrock type institution for graduates of the Carysfort-Smurfit School of Business.  It is a slap on the face to the people of west County Dublin and the surrounding region, a hugely populous area of almost 250,000 people, with no acute general hospital, that the Minister was not as <Col N="2628" /> capable at the Cabinet table this year in providing for that hospital as she was last year.</P>
      <P>I support entirely the remarks of Deputy Stagg about the social welfare provision which is now almost £3.5 billion. The fact that so much money has to be paid in social welfare highlights the reason we can make no progress in this economy.  While there is such a large number of people unemployed and dependent on social welfare, as is evident from this Book of Estimates, there is little hope that this economy will turn around.  The Minister provides for an additional 22,000 people on the live register next year, bringing the number to 275,000.  If that forecast is as much out of line as was the forecast last year, which was 14 per cent out of line, the unemployment figure for 1992 will be about 314,000 people.  That is the disastrous position facing a stagnant economy and a disprited people.  That is the Christmas present the Minister has provided.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that there will be social welfare cuts and pay cuts.  The pay cuts have brought a reaction from the trade union movement that is more explicable in terms of their confidence in the Government to deliver on promises than it is an immediate reaction to the cuts as have been announced.  From my contacts with the trade union movement they greatly doubt the commitment of the Government to deliver on the undertaking given for January 1993.  They do not believe the Government will find the money &mdash; the Government have given no indication of this &mdash; to make retrospective payments.</P>
      <P>It is sad that we are going out on a note of more cuts for the poor and the disadvantaged in our community.  We managed to agree an increase in ministerial pensions last night but we cut the budget for those on social welfare.  The area I represent desperately needs a hospital service but there is no ability to find the relatively small amount of money that would enable a start to the hospital in 1992.</P>

It is disappointing to note, however, how some contributions were of the set-piece variety, making predictable and parochial criticisms without any regard to the wider economic realities.</P>

      <P>Prior to the current international downturn, we witnessed the highest ever annual increase in private non-agricultural employment.  We have seen our inflation rate drop below the European average and have achieved international recognition as a stable, low-inflation economy.</P>
      <P>The national accounts which were published recently by the Central Statistics Office, and the results of the 1990 labour force survey, confirm that 1987 to 1990 was a period of outstanding economic success.  During those three years, gross domestic product expanded at an annual average rate of 6 per cent.  Inflation averaged just barely over 3 per cent per annum.  There was an annual surplus on the balance of payments which averaged over 2½ per cent of GNP.  The national debt-GNP ratio was reduced by over 20 percentage points.</P>

    <P>It is important, however, to keep things in perspective and to maintain a balanced view.  True, growth this year may be low compared with 1987-90. Investment certainly took a knock this year but this has to be seen against the background of the increase of no less than 30 per cent in the volume of fixed investment between 1987 and 1990.  Some favourable and very important trends did continue through 1991.  The inflation rate, as expected, remained well below the European average.  Another healthy <Col N="2631" /> balance of payments surplus will be recorded.</P>
    <P>Increased unemployment is, of course, the major blackspot; but this substantially reflects the huge job-losses suffered in the UK and other economies and which was not paralleled in Ireland essentially because of the improvements brought about here in recent years by the pursuit of sound economic and budgetary policies.  Nevertheless, we realise we have a serious situation to address on the unemployment front and I will return to this topic later in my speech.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan made the serious but unfounded charge that the Estimates, as published, were bogus.  I totally refute that allegation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the Government took £600 million off departmental expenditure demands.  Deputy Noonan argues that these were notional cuts on extravagant demands made by Departments, which the Government pretended to be resisting.  This is most definitely not the case.</P>
      <P>All Ministers, and their Departments, are well aware of the severity of the budgetary problem for 1992.  They are also aware of the important statement in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that the objective of reducing the national debt to GNP ratio towards 100 per cent by 1993 will be attained principally through restraint on current public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The context in which departmental <Col N="2632" /> expenditure demands were to be framed was thus clear and well known.  But in order to highlight it, my Department made sure that Departments were reminded of it.  Departmental demands were, from the point of view of those running spending programmes, not extravagant.  Very few Departments put in proposals for new programmes, or submitted wildly overcosted Estimates of what existing programmes would cost.</P>
    <P>The Government faced a difficult task in reducing these departmental demands. There are severe constraints on the degree to which expenditure can now be pruned back.  There are large areas of expenditure where we receive EC Structural Funds, and it would make neither economic nor budgetary sense to cut these back.  The cost of higher unemployment, largely due to developments abroad, has to be met.  Worldwide, governments face a problem in controlling spiralling health costs, as medical technology improves, and grows increasingly more expensive.  Departments, of course, naturally included in their Estimates provision for the non-pay elements of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>The Government went through the departmental demands extremely carefully. We eliminated all over-provision and all demands for new or improved programmes.  We amended schemes in ways that would generate saving without unacceptable economic or social consequences.  Finally, when it was clear that these steps alone would not be sufficient to generate the savings we need on budgetary grounds, we decided to eliminate provision for further improvements in 1992 in non-pay areas on the lines envisaged in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  We also decided that the emerging public service pay bill in 1992 was too high, and settled the additional provision at £70 million to be implemented on lines which we have made known to ICTU.</P>
    <P>The reductions we have made are real. They are, in all cases, backed up by clear policy decisions.  There is no fudge in our decisions.  There are no arbitrary cuts <Col N="2633" /> thrown in just to make a big imposing figure, without any clear ideas as to how the required savings are to be made.  The Government are determined that spending in 1992 will remain within the levels settled, subject to any changes I may announce in the budget.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that somehow the Government have been remiss in not including the allocation of £70 million in the Estimates for the pay arrangements announced last Friday.  I would like to assure Deputy Noonan, in particular, that there is nothing unusual about this. The normal procedure on the publication of the abridged Estimates volume is that public service pay allocations are based on pay rates actually in force on the day &mdash; no more.  Successive Minister for Finance have followed this procedure down through the years.</P>
    <P>I will be making the necessary provision in the budget to fund the increases set out in the Government's decision on public service pay &mdash; estimated at £70 million.  It gives me no pleasure to have to repeat to the House that this is the absolute limit of what can be afforded without severe cuts in the major social services of social welfare, education or health.  In constructing the package on public service pay, we have attempted to strike a balance between the concerns of those public servants who are due special pay increases, those who are in relatively lower paid grades and the overall needs of the community in what is undeniably going to be a difficult year.</P>
    <P>These are the facts of the situation now facing us all as a community.  I hope that most public servants will, on reflection, come to see things this way also.  I am aware that there are some issues, such as the treatment of pensioners, on the verges of the policy we have announced with which some groups of public servants are particularly concerned.  I believe that it would be useful to discuss with the public service unions such issues and any other issues which they may deem relevant within the overall parameters of the Government's decision.  I am available for such discussions at short notice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2634" /> Deputy Noonan said that capital expenditure is being increased by 8 per cent.  This is true of the Public Capital Programme as a whole.  But the Exchequer element of the Public Capital Programme is set to increase by 3 per cent in 1992.  The main force leading to an increase in public capital spending in 1992 is spending by State agencies which is funded out of their own resources, and without recourse to the Exchequer.  That spending is set to increase by 13 per cent. The reasons behind this increase are commercially sound, and reflect the fact that although growth slowed down this year, we still have a growing economy which creates needs for capital spending by State agencies which should go ahead.</P>
    <P>It is also relevant in considering capital expenditure to remember that much of this spending, both that funded by the Exchequer and that funded by State agencies themselves, receives EC support. Spending on national roads, for example, attracts European Regional Development Fund receipts.  To look simply at the increase in expenditure, without allowing for these receipts, is to form an exaggerated view of the net impact of such capital spending on the borrowing requirement.</P>
    <P>I would agree with the Deputy that it is not possible in the long term to increase public expenditure in real terms unless the economy is growing at a rate sufficient to fund this increase.  He is right when he says the Government must otherwise resort to increased taxation or extra borrowing. This is the message of the NESC report, which is reflected in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> I have no intention of introducing a budget which would increase Exchequer borrowing as a percentage of GNP.  My attitude to tax reform is that changes must be budget neutral.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also argued that the increases in PRSI income limits amount to an extra tax on jobs.  This is not the case.  The increase in the PRSI limits underlying the Social Welfare Estimate, reflects the normal practice of increasing those limits in line with the expected <Col N="2635" /> increase in average private sector earnings.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the fact that the rates support grant in 1992 is being held at the 1991 level.  This is a small reduction in real terms.  Furthermore, the rate support grant is only a small part of total local authority income. The reduction in the rate support grant of £6 million on the level that would have applied had we maintained the grant in real terms must be seen in the context that the overall spending of local authorities, excluding loan charges, is about £750 million.  Six million pounds is less than 1 per cent of this.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would point out that the Deputy is not being consistent.  On the one hand he is arguing that the Estimates are increasing by too much, while arguing that the reductions we have made will hit jobs.  Would he have preferred that we did not make these reductions?  If we had not, the Estimates, would have shown a major increase.</P>
    <P>The Government have, within the constraints that we face, done as much as possible to sustain job creation in the Estimates. As I have remarked already, the Public Capital Programme overall is set to increase by 8 per cent. This will benefit the construction industry, and the Department of the Environment estimate that the direct impact in that industry will be an additional 2,000 jobs.  On top of that, there should be additional jobs in areas such as professional services for the building industry. The Estimate for Labour shows an increase of 22 per cent in the allocation for the social employment scheme, bringing it to £72.9 million.  That increase reflects the fact that EC aid will not be available for the scheme in 1992.  With the withdrawal of EC aid the Government could have cut the allocation for the <Col N="2636" /> scheme, which would have resulted in a drastic reduction in the number of persons availing of the scheme.  We decided that this would be unacceptable, and have made up for the shortfall in EC funding.</P>
    <P>It was also argued that in providing in the Estimates for an average unemployment level of 275,000 in 1992 the Government have signalled that they regard that as an acceptable level.  That is not the case.  We are determined to do everything possible to reduce that figure, as is shown by the imaginative initiatives we have announced.  We could, of course, have produced an Estimate for Social Welfare which reflected a lower figure for unemployment.  We decided not to do so, but to accept the official advice that before allowing for the impact of the new employment initiatives, the level of unemployment could be 275,000.  That figure will, naturally, be reviewed in the budget.</P>
    <P>The Estimates are an appropriate vehicle for the end of session debate, given that when we resume it will be time to deal with the budget.  I should like, a Cheann Chomhairle, to thank those Deputies who made very many relevant points.  As I said at the outset, other Deputies made merely the normal parochial and political points.  I thank all Deputies for their contributions to the debate and I hope that my colleagues, who have dealt with the main issues raised, have answered most of the questions.</P>
    <P>Once again I commend the Estimates to the House.</P>

      <P>The items on the agenda for the Social Affairs Council on 3 December 1991 were as follows: a draft Directive on safety signs; a draft Directive on the organisation of working time; a draft Directive on European Works Councils; two draft regulations on social security for migrant workers; a draft recommendation on child care; a draft recommendation on sufficient resources for social security systems; a draft declaration on the dignity of women and men at work, and the final report on the second European poverty programme.</P>
      <P>The draft Directive on safety signs aims to improve safety signs systems in the workplace.  Ireland supported this proposal and the Council adopted a common position on the item.</P>
      <P>The Council had a constructive discussion on the draft Directive on the organisation of working time.  I have already spoken on this item in detail in reply to earlier questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A preliminary discussion was held on the draft Directive on European works councils.  I am pleased to say that the Commission responded positively to the widely expressed views favouring greater <Col N="2561" /> flexibility in the provisions of this instrument.</P>
    <P>The Council adopted two regulations on social security for migrant workers which will substantially improve the position of those workers.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Council could adopt a recommendation on child care.  This recommendation should stimulate interest in the promotion of more and better child care services and highlight the link between such provision and equality of opportunity.  The recommendation will encourage initiatives on the part of a combination of interests, including the public authorities, the social partners and voluntary bodies in the interests of making good quality, accessible, and affordable arrangements for the children of working parents.</P>
    <P>There was an exchange of views on a draft recommendation of sufficient resources in social protection systems, which Ireland also supports.  It was not possible to make further progress pending the receipt of the opinion of the European Parliament on this recommendation.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased that agreement in principle was reached on a declaration on the dignity of women and men at work.  This declaration concerns the implementation of the Commission's recommendation and accompanying code of practice on the problem of sexual harassment at work.  The Commission had undertaken to produce these guidelines on foot of the mandate provided by the Council resolution on the subject brought forward during the Irish Presidency in May 1990.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Council took note of the Commission's report on the second poverty programme covering the period 1985-89.</P>

      <P>The social employment scheme is a part time work scheme usually involving 20 hours participation in a week for participants. As such, comparison between the rates paid to participants on the scheme and the average industrial wage paid in respect of a full time job is not appropriate.</P>
      <P>The rates payable to participants on the social employment scheme were increased last July.  The current rate of payment is £72 per week for a participant without dependants.  An adult dependant payment of £31.50 per week is also payable, where applicable, together with a payment of up to £12 per week per child.</P>
      <P>In the case of Teamwork, which is directed at young people on the live register, the payment to participants, currently £63 per week, is not related to the average industrial wage.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the payment rates on the social employment scheme and Teamwork are kept under review in the context of the resources made available for the schemes.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 26, 27 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>State aid for voluntary emigrant welfare organisations in Britain is distributed on the recommendation of DíON &mdash; the London-based advisory committee on emigrant welfare services.</P>
      <P>DíON, on the basis of their assessment and analysis of the situation in consultation with the welfare agencies, determine their priorities, criteria and conditions for the granting of State aid.</P>
      <P>Each year, DíON decide on their particular funding priorities for that year, having regard to the most urgent needs of Irish workers in Britain and also other sources of funding for welfare activities. All applicants are kept fully informed of any changes contemplated in grant, conditions or criteria.</P>
      <P>The DíON priorities for 1991 were as follows: front-line advice service for emigrants; outreach services for unemployed youths, travellers, women and children in temporary accommodation; promoting emigrant access to employment and accommodation and social services for elderly emigrants.</P>
      <P>In response to the rise in net migration to around 46,000 in 1989, the allocation in my Department's Vote for grant assistance to voluntary emigrant welfare organisations for that year was doubled from £250,000 to £500,000.</P>
      <P>Despite a dramatic reduction in net emigration since 1989, and increasing pressure on the Exchequer, the Government have consistently maintained the same level of funding, even though net emigration has dwindled to 1,000 in the year up to April 1991.</P>
      <P>The total 1991 Government grant of £500,000 has already been distributed to 32 welfare organisations.  No further funds are available for distribution this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I fully appreciate the situation of our emigrants who are in difficulty in <Col N="2564" /> England, an increase in the DíON grant for the next year is not foreseen, given the tight budgetary constraints and the fact that the level of emigration has declined dramatically over the last two years.</P>

      <P>Assistance for projects to help the long term unemployed is provided by the European Social Fund mainly under Objective 1 &mdash; promoting the development and structural adjustment of the less developed regions &mdash; and Objective 3 &mdash; combating long term unemployment &mdash; of the reformed Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>Irish projects to assist the long term unemployed are sizeable and are operated by the Department of Education, FáS and the Department of Justice.  In addition, projects to assist the disabled long term unemployed are carried out by organisations under the guidance of the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
      <P>The measures operated by the organisations include&mdash;</P>
      <P>FáS social employment scheme (SES), alternance training (alternating work and training), specific skills training and non-traditional training for women.</P>
      <P>Department of Education: vocational training opportunity scheme (VTOS).</P>
      <P>Department of Justice: training of ex-offenders.</P>
      <P>National Rehabilitation Board: training of disabled persons. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the European Community Initiatives, the horizon programme which will cater for the disabled and disadvantaged will also assist the long term <Col N="2565" /> unemployed.  This programme will be delivered by a number of agencies.</P>
    <P>In addition, three Community initiatives to assist the long term unemployed are being operated in Dublin inner city, Tallaght, and Cork city north.</P>
    <P>In 1991 a total of IR£29.61 million in ESF assistance is committed by the Community to these programmes and a total of 13,521 persons will receive training.</P>
    <P>I am generally satisfied that this assistance from the Structural Funds is having a significant impact in assisting the long term unemployed.  There is one area where I am unhappy.  This relates to the decision of the Council to provide ESF assistance for the social employment scheme only up to the end of 1991.  I propose to seek the restoration of assistance for the SES at the next reform of the fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by the Deputy concerning the difficulties facing people answering advertisements for work from employers using only post box numbers.</P>
      <P>I am aware, however, that in most cases employers do give their names or the name of the company concerned.  I also accept that, exceptionally, there may be special circumstances where an employer, for quite legitimate business reasons, may not wish to disclose his identity generally.</P>
      <P>The problem really lies with a minority of employers who use box numbers to avoid having to reply to, or acknowledge receipt of, applications from prospective employees.</P>
      <P>While I understand the difficult task which can be imposed on employers by having to reply to a large number of unsuccessful applications I consider that the volume of applications could be reduced by clearer advertising of the employment on offer, in terms of job satisfaction, qualifications, pay and conditions.</P>
      <P>There is no legislation in place at present to regulate this practice, except where the notice/advertisement relates to employment outside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In such instances the Employment Agency Act, 1971, and regulations made <Col N="2567" /> under it require that the notice/advertisement include the name and address of the employer, or alternatively, the name and address of a holder of a licence issued under the Act. The object of this measure is to protect the interests of prospective emigrants.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to introduce legislation relating to employment within the State, as I understand there could be serious difficulties in framing and implementing legislation aimed at preventing employers from using post office box numbers except in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>In any event, such legislation, even if feasible, would not necessarily address the real problem which is the failure of some employers to acknowledge applications or to advise applicants of the outcome of their application.</P>
    <P>I believe the solution to the problem lies in urging employers to improve their advertising so as to limit the number of applications and to afford those who apply the courtesy of a reply while at the same time discouraging the minority of employers who abuse the use of the post box facility.</P>
    <P>I shall continue to use my office to drive home that message to employers and employer organisations as the opportunity arises.</P>

Compensating savings on the Department of Social Welfare Vote arise when persons on the live register go on the scheme.

Clearly, it is not possible at this stage, when the Commission itself has only begun to consider the implications of the matter, to make any estimate of the possible effects for Irish industry.</P>

      <P>In the time available, and because of the way in which data was complied in the past, it is not possible to supply the full information sought by the Deputy under points (1) to (3) of his question. However, I can inform the Deputy that from 1 January 1985 to date, a total of 6,293 residents of the Republic of South Africa successfully applied for registration in the foreign births register. From 1 January 1989 to date, a total of 579 applications for post-nuptial citizenship were received from citizens of South Africa, of which 454 have been granted and the remainder are awaiting decision.</P>

      <P>The Government are very conscious of the enormous needs existing in the Horn of Africa.  It has examined the United Nations consolidated interim appeal on behalf of the special emergency programme in the Horn of Africa area (SEPHA) which first issued in July 1991. The amount requested was $400 million. About one-quarter of that amount has been pledged by donors, leaving a very significant shortfall.</P>
      <P>In the course of 1991, the Government provided £910,000 in bilateral emergency assistance to countries in the Horn of Africa.  All of these allocations were made prior to the launching of the appeal for the UN special emergency programme.</P>
      <P>I am at present considering how I might respond to the United Nations appeal in 1991 or 1992.</P>

      <P>There are two schemes at present in operation for the set-aside of arable land.  The first provides for payment of a premium of £86.25 per acre each year for five years for land set-aside for non-agricultural uses, left fallow, or used for afforestation.  Half of this amount is payable where the land is used for non-intensive grazing of livestock. The second scheme, which applies to the 1992 cropping year only, provides for payment of a premium of between £46.57 and £51.75 per acre for eligible land left fallow.  Farmers who opt for the latter scheme may also qualify for a refund of this year's co-responsibility levy.</P>

      <P>The estimates on which grant aid is calculated are based on standard costings. They were revised as recently as August of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised scheme of installation aid for young farmers allows a young farmer taking up full-time farming for the first time up to two years to achieve the minimum labour requirement.  The same arrangement will apply in the case of a part-time farmer setting up on a full-time basis.  In addition land held under a long term lease may be taken into account in <Col N="2584" /> calculating the labour input requirement of the farm enterprise.</P>

      <Quest>the reason an animal in the herd of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare which was deemed in January 1991, following a TB test to be inconclusive was not tested again until October 1991, during which period the entire herd was locked up causing (1) financial loss to the herd owner and (2) continued infection risk to the rest of the herd and illustrated a poor attempt at disease eradication and where there was a failure to disclose if active lesions were found on the animal; if he intends to have the matter investigated with a view to payment of full market value of the animal as determined by sale of corresponding animals in the open market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the director of ERAD that a special check test carried out on the herd in question on 1 February 1991 revealed one inconclusive animal. In such circumstances the herdowner is advised that the inconclusive animal should be retested after 60 days.  In addition, while the herd is not restricted, the cattle identity cards are retained by the local office in order to monitor movement. The herdowner may, depending <Col N="2587" /> on circumstances, be given cards on request to the local office.</P>
      <P>Due to an oversight the herd was not retested until October 1991 and the same animal was again inconclusive which under the ERAD scheme meant that it was deemed a reactor and the herd was restricted.  The post mortem result indicated no visible lesions but this does not in any way mean that the animal was not infected.</P>
      <P>In relation to reactor grants I understand that the herdowner has been paid the grant in respect of this animal.  The reactor grant is designed to bridge the difference between the slaughter price and the cost of an equivalent replacement animal.</P>
      <P>The herd in question passed a reactor retest on 6 December 1991 and it may regain its clear status if it passes a second reactor retest after 60 days from that date.</P>

      <Col N="2593" /> Information in respect of 1990 is not readily available as the administration was not computerised at that time and the amount of time and effort required to compile the information at this stage would not be justified.</P>
    <P>The driving test procedures are in accordance with the requirements of an EC Directive and I have no proposals to change them.  However, with the better and more timely information flow now available from computerisation, I am arranging for more effective monitoring of test results in different centres with a view to determining what action, if any, may be necessary to ensure that inequalities as between centres do not arise from inconsistency in the application of the test.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the Adoption Acts of 1988 and 1991 are broadly based on recommendations made by the review committee on adoption services which reported to the then Minister for Health in 1984.</P>
      <P>The 1988 Act permits the adoption of any child, including a child born within marriage, whose parents are deemed by the courts to have failed in their constitutional duty to care for the child.  This gave effect to a central recommendation of the review committee that the law should be changed to allow for the adoption of children born within marriage.</P>
      <P>The 1988 Act also relieved the Adoption Board of the obligation to publish in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> a notice of every adoption order made by them.  This change was also recommended by the review committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Adoption Act, 1991, sets out a statutory framework for the recognition in the State of foreign adoptions and regulates the adoption of foreign children by Irish residents.  That Act also extended the categories of persons eligible to be granted an Irish adoption order and <Col N="2595" /> reduced the statutory minimum ages for adopting parents.  All of these measures are in line with recommendations made by the review committee.</P>
    <P>Apart from these statutes, the Status of Children Act, 1987, and the Child Care Act, 1991, have given effect to certain other recommendations made by the review committee.</P>
    <P>The Status of Children Act contains important provisions relating to the paternity of children, the rights of natural fathers of children born outside marriage and the property rights of adopted children, all of which address issues raised by the review committee.</P>
    <P>The Child Care Act, 1991, contains a specific provision requiring the health boards to provide or ensure the provision of an adoption service in their areas.  This was also recommended by the review committee.</P>
    <P>On an administrative basis, in accordance with recommendations made by the review committee, the Adoption Board have produced an information booklet for prospective adopters and the Central Council of Catholic Adoption Societies have recently produced a booklet outlining the various services provided by the adoption agencies.</P>

      <P>On 28 September 1991, my predecessor, Deputy O'Hanlon, announced that the Department of Health, together with the health boards, will undertake a major review of the organisation, management and co-ordination of the ambulance service. Among the main areas covered by <Col N="2596" /> this review will be the provision of cardiac ambulance services.</P>
      <P>It would be intended that the recommendations of the review group in relation to the provision of these services would be taken into account by the health boards when considering any future development in this area.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to indicate at this stage when the review group on the ambulance service will complete its deliberations.</P>
      <P>The provision of ambulance services is a matter for each health board in the first instance.  I understand that the provision of pre-hospital cardiac care, including the introduction of a cardiac ambulance service, is being actively considered by the Southern Health Board at present in the context of the development of cardiology services in general.</P>

      <P>My Department's scheme of building grants for second level schools requires that all projects must be planned in accordance with the Department's design procedures and that no commitment is entered into without the prior approval of the Department.</P>
      <P>In the case of this school, while initial agreement in principle had been reached in 1987 to provide additional classroom accommodation the planning of the project did not proceed further due to the many other commitments in planning or construction and financial constraints.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the school went ahead in 1990 and constructed a substantial amount of accommodation at its own expense, and now seeks grant aid. The decision to proceed was taken by the school without the prior written agreement of the Department.  In the circumstances because of the many demands on the scarce resources available and the need to allocate funds in an orderly way, I regret that it would not be possible to approve a retrospective grant for the building.</P>

They could only be granted the concession of fare-paying transport if accommodation was available after all the eligible children were catered for.  This is not the case here.</P>

      <P>The person in question was awarded a standard flat rate dependants allowance under the Army Pensions Acts 1923 to 1980, in respect of herself and her qualifying children on the death of her husband. Arising from the High Court judgment in the O'Carroll case in 1989, the children's element of such pensions is regarded for income tax purposes as the income of the children.  This procedure was commenced on 1 April 1990, and from that date qualifying children were issued, in the care of their surviving parent, with payment in respect of the children's element of the allowance.  The children's element of the category of pensioner in this case ceases when the child reaches 18 years of age and as the person <Col N="2606" /> in question reached this age on 26 September 1991, that element of the pension ceased from then.</P>
