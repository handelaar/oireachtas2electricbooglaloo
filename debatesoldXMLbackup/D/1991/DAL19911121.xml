      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 10, 15, 16, 17, 2 and 18.  It is also proposed that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, No. 10 shall be decided without debate.  It is further proposed that the Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m.</P>

      <P>In regard to the proposed European debate next week, could the Taoiseach agree to circulate some form of position paper to Members to give us an update on the negotiations and on the Government's position in advance of the debate so that the discussion and the contributions in the House will be more meaningful?  I ask this particularly in view of the fact that the Minister for Finance has effectively refused to answer written questions about the Govenment's position on various aspects of European Monetary Union.  We are left to debate this matter without sufficient information.</P>

      <P>Last week I asked the Taoiseach when various Bills would be debated.  He replied that it was not clear at that time what our legislative programme would be for the remainder of the session.  Is the Taoiseach in a position to indicate the Bills he expects to have through the House before Christmas?</P>

      <P>With regard to the second question, I hope that the Whips will be able to discuss that matter very shortly.  With regard to the form of the debate next week, I am not sure how far I can go to be of assistance to the House. The Deputy will understand that even at this stage there is a great deal still unclear and there are many aspects which are still the subject of intense negotiations, not just bilaterally but multilaterally.  It is very hard to see at what point I could give information to the House, but I will consider in what way I can be most helpful. The Deputy and others will understand that in a situation like this we, too, have to play our cards reasonably close to our chest because there is a great deal of bargaining, negotiation and possible compromise in the air.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach knows that nobody has any problems other than himself.  Two weeks ago on 8 November I asked the Taoiseach if he would indicate who was representing the public interest at the beef tribunal.  That matter has become more and more urgent.  It is a matter of concern for the Dáil since it was the Dáil which established the tribunal in the first place. Exchanges between counsel for the Attorney General yesterday and the chairman of the tribunal indicate that nobody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the former Minister for Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, who brought <Col N="538" /> this Bill before the House.  The outstanding progress she made in increasing the number of places in third level colleges over the past number of years will make a significant contribution to social and economic development in this country. I should like also to congratulate the newly appointed Minister for Education, Deputy Noel Davern.  I wish him every success in his endeavours.</P>
      <P>This Bill is long overdue.  One of the most remarkable success stories of modern Irish education has been the growth of the Regional Technical Colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology. I do not think this has manifested itself more clearly anywhere than in Cork city where the regional technical college has contributed greatly to the industrial development of the city and county.  One of the primary reasons industrialists decide to locate in Cork is the quality of graduates from both the regional technical college and the university.  Cork Regional Technical College has excelled in both science and catering, thus attracting foreign industry to the area.</P>
      <P>The importance of technological education in the development of our economy cannot be overstated.  This Bill which will establish the nine Regional Technical Colleges on a statutory basis is very welcome.  It is extremely important in a growing economy that we have the wherewithal to meet the demands and skills required by industry and the employment market.  Regional Technical Colleges have a particular role to play in this regard.  The Bill proposes to increase that role by giving additional functions and resources to the Regional Technical Colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill to allow Regional Technical Colleges to engage in research, consultancy and development work.  Even though some colleges have a reasonable track record in these areas, nevertheless there is enormous potential for further development.  Regional Technical Colleges should exploit their research facilities more and ensure greater liaison with industry and take on consultancy work.  They should also exploit research work to earn more <Col N="539" /> income.  Increased research would enhance the curriculum and ensure that graduates would be better qualified.  The Bill endeavours to give the colleges the impetus to do just that.  Research is one of the greatest potential growth areas for colleges.  They should develop their research and apply it more to industry and the marketplace.  While there have already been examples of this phenomenon in some colleges, there could be further growth in this area.</P>
    <P>The role of the Regional Technical Colleges has been to educate for trade and industry over a broad spectrum of occupations, ranging from crafts to the professional level, particularly in engineering and science and in the commercial, linguistic and other areas.  As the services sector and tourism became more important the Regional Technical Colleges developed very strong catering and tourism departments.  That is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Bill also endeavours to give greater autonomy to the Regional Technical Colleges which is long overdue.  I do not hold the fear which many in the vocational education committee sector hold, that somehow this Bill is negative in the sense that it is taking the Regional Technical Colleges away from the umbrella of the vocational education committees.  The Regional Technical Colleges should have autonomy and greater independence in the conduct of their operations and affairs, developing their own curriculum and governing themselves.  The Regional Technical Colleges have been at an unfair disadvantage in relation to the universities. The universities have been operating since their foundation in splendid isolation almost, in a more autonomous way than the Regional Technical Colleges.  Unfortunately, the Regional Technical Colleges have been perceived wrongly as the poor relation of the university sector.  That day has gone.  The Regional Technical Colleges have developed wonderfully and in some areas have surpassed the quality and expertise available in some of our universities.</P>
    <P>There should be greater liaison <Col N="540" /> between the universities and the Regional Technical Colleges and greater joint utilisation of resources.  For too long there has been a stand off.  I am aware of some developments in that area but the Department and the vocational education committees should strongly encourage the Regional Technical Colleges and universities to provide joint programmes of study, engage in joint research projects under which graduates in both colleges could inter mingle and share their knowledge and expertise.  The staff of both colleges should do so and share the facilities of both colleges.  For too long in particular spheres we have had the institutions pursuing separate agendas.  It is more desirable that there be greater liaison between the universities and the Regional Technical Colleges. I am glad that is happening in Cork between the Cork Regional Technical College and UCC.  There is tremendous potential for further development down that road.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister on Committee Stage to ease some of the fears expressed by staff in the colleges in relation to their staffing situation.  It should be an important principle of the Bill that existing staffing arrangements, particularly in relation to officers in the Regional Technical Colleges, should not in any way be diminished by the passage of this Bill. The rights of workers and teachers should be safeguarded and their representative bodies &mdash; unions or associations &mdash; should not lose any powers with the passage of this Bill.  They should have their full rights of negotiation on the allocation of staff duties.  That is an important point to take on board.</P>
    <P>The colleges are still very anxious that they be allowed make their own awards. Existing Regional Technical Colleges do this to a certain extent.  The Bill envisages that awards, from now on, would be made by the NCEA only.  A number of Regional Technical Colleges expressed the wish that they be allowed grant their own awards in certain disciplines. Obviously, certain national degrees, diplomas and certificates will continue.  If we are to allow colleges develop their own <Col N="541" /> curriculum which may be relevant to a particular locality it should follow that they should have the capacity and the right to make their own awards in those areas.  They are genuinely concerned about that.</P>
    <P>I understand there have been negotiations between the Cork vocational education committee, of which I am a member and the Department concerning proposals relating to the amalgamation of the Cork Regional Technical College, the Crawford School of Art and Design and the Cork School of Music into one body.  I will be raising the matter on Committee Stage.  In Cork we are very anxious that in any new arrangement the Cork School of Music and the Crawford School of Art and Design be allowed retain their unique and distinct ethos and that they not be harmed by an amalgamation.  The Minister should consider amending the Bill on Committee Stage to allow the colleges some degree of independence with their own principals and so on but in the context of a regional institute of technology; the name is irrelevant.  Those colleges should be allowed maintain their existing traditions.  They are much older than any of the Dublin Institutes of Technology in Dublin.  The Cork School of Music and the Crawford School of Art and Design are historic institutions in the city of Cork.  It is important that they be allowed retain the identity and tradition they have carved out for themselves over many years.  It should not be beyond the imagination of the Department or the Minister to accommodate that aspiration in the Bill on Committee Stage.  I urge the Minister to take that suggestion on board.  I understand that the former Minister received representations from the Cork vocational education committee in that regard.</P>
    <P>The central point is that because of the demands of our economy &mdash; we discussed this last night &mdash; and unemployment the Regional Technical Colleges have a huge role to play to meet the employment demands of the future.  The Regional Technical Colleges produce graduates who are well qualified, who can apply themselves to trades, crafts, science, <Col N="542" /> business, commerce and tourism.  If we do not equip people with skills so that they can create further activity in the economy, we will be very poorly placed to reduce the unemployment problem here.  Education and economic growth are inseparable.  The growth of the Regional Technical Colleges has been the success story of modern Irish education. Long may it continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to congratulate the new Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, on his appointment. It is unfortunate he is not in the House today but I wish him the best of luck for the future.  Also, I wish to pay a special tribute to the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke.  During her time she introduced many innovations to education.  I regret her moving on to another Department. She will be recognised always as having been a very successful reforming Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>Like previous speakers on this side of the House, I welcome this Bill.  It is in line with Fine Gael policy on the Regional Technical Colleges.  I wish to make some observations on the Bill and its effects on these colleges.  My observations will cover what this House must do to provide for the full development of this great and uniquely useful national system of colleges.  Therefore, my contribution to this debate will be based on what I know of the Regional Technical College in my constituency.  While many of my remarks will concern this regional college, the one about which I know most, &mdash; using Tralee as my example &mdash; they can be applied equally to the ten Regional Technical Colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constituency I represent is a typical west coast constituency on the periphery of the European Community.  It has problems of unemployment, under employment and emigration. However, it has great potential.  Economic and social development can only occur through a well educated workforce.  Primary and second level education are best <Col N="543" /> organised locally.  However, higher education in the shrinking world of minitel and electronic mail must fit into the same type of framework used in other EC member states, particularly if the Maastricht Summit proves successful in building a Europe of the regions.</P>
    <P>Tralee is lucky to have a regional college. It is the most westerly institute of higher education in the European Community. The college was initially designated by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Liam Cosgrave, in 1977.  When former Deputy Hussey was Minister for Education a new building was erected between 1985 and 1986 to cater for 800 students.  Today the college has over twice that number of students.  Over each of the past five years there has been a growth in student numbers from 10 to 20 per cent.  This level of growth has taken place in most of the Regional Technical Colleges.  Entrance to Regional Technical Colleges now accounts for half of the entrants to higher education.  That reflects their success.</P>
    <P>Tralee Regional Technical College has now over 2,000 students offering a wide range of whole time and part-time courses.  Over 1,600 students attend the college on any one day.  The courses are in business, catering, computer studies, construction, electronics, engineering, science and tourism studies.  The Regional Technical College provides a significant number of day and block release courses for apprentices.  They provide a wide range of short, tailor made courses under their technology transfer programme to meet the immediate needs of business and industry locally.  They are involved in research and consultancy for local industry.  The college has already had its first masters degree graduate.  All of this has a major beneficial effect on the local economy.</P>
    <P>There is a hunger for education in Kerry.  The college has built a good reputation for itself.  Demand for college places in Tralee increased from fewer than 1,000 in 1986 to over 4,000 last year, and up to 20,000 this year.  The college <Col N="544" /> has a dedicated staff who are maintaining the highest third level standards of teaching and research.  Despite the welcome allocation of additional staff this year, the college is clearly under-resourced in terms of buildings, teaching staff and support staff and in terms of decent budgets for class materials.  The work of Regional Technical Colleges must be fully recognised by the provision of adequate resources in addition to providing the legal framework in this Bill, otherwise they will not achieve the full potential of which they are capable.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure in the Estimates the Regional Technical Colleges will not be ignored.  All Members would agree that it is one thing to introduce a legal framework but quite another to provide the necessary resources to ensure that the colleges can reach their full potential.</P>
    <P>The staff of Regional Technical Colleges deserve our thanks for the way in which they have coped with the dramatic expansion of student numbers.  I have watched the growth of Tralee Regional Technical College and a doubling of student numbers in five years is no mean feat.  Further growth at diploma and degree level is clearly on the cards.  The impact of the European Social and Regional Funds on Regional Technical Colleges has been considerable.  Colleges have truly become Euro colleges.  All Regional Technical Colleges now require management structures which will take full account of their present size and complexity and of their Euro links, and which gives them an adequate legal framework for further growth into the 21st century. The Regional Technical Colleges do not deserve less, on the eve of the Maastricht Summit.</P>
    <P>Regional Technical College management structures were last reviewed by Deputy Wilson in 1979 and, even then, were inadequate.  Deputy Hussey addressed this point in her Green Paper in 1985 and even then it was clear that the Regional Technical Colleges needed appropriate autonomous governing structures established by this House. Each Regional Technical College needs the twin structures of an autonomous governing body and an academic council. <Col N="545" /> In higher education colleges all over the developed world these autonomous bodies are the structural benchmarks by which higher education is separated from the other levels of education.  Academic councils are very important in colleges. They consist of groups of academic staff, some elected and some who, by virtue of the offices they hold in the college, are prepared to act as the academic quality control watchdog of the college.  They research course structures and content and ensure that academic material is consistently updated to reflect the needs of business and industry.  They encourage new course developments as the needs of the region change.  This activity needs an appropriate legal base, as provided by this Bill.  Academic staffs and colleges will welcome and support a statutorily established academic council with appropriate sub-committees to enable them to make a fully professional contribution to the academic work of the college.</P>
    <P>The Regional Technical Colleges are now of a size when they must have an autonomous governing body.  There must be a strong input to these bodies from elected local representatives.  At the moment, the associated vocational education committees who nominate members on to the boards of management of the nearest vocational education committee have negligible direct input into the formulation of programmes of work of the Regional Technical Colleges.  If Regional Technical Colleges are fully clued into regional needs and aspirations, into the work of the IDA and other development organisations such as SFADCo, they can act as a think-tank to assist in regional development. There is a significant role in the think-tank process for all members of the associated vocational education committees in helping to identify and articulate regional needs which require incorporation within section 13 of the Bill, which deals with programmes and budgets.</P>
    <P>This revamped and enhanced regional role is particularly important where the vocational education committee area in <Col N="546" /> which the Regional Technical College is situated is a borough or town vocational education committee or a vocational education committee of a small county covering only a part of the geographical area and only a part of the population of the larger region served by the Regional Technical College.  In our democratic system of local government the political accountability of Regional Technical Colleges in their regions would best be protected by such a system.  It is important that politicians would have a say in the running of Regional Technical Colleges as proposed by this Bill.  Politicians must have an input into educational policy in their local areas.  There is not a better way for politicians to become involved than to be involved in the new structures of Regional Technical Colleges. It is important that politicians should have a major say in designing courses, in the direction of policy and in future development because, as Deputy Martin said, if Regional Technical Colleges are to play the role they can play in the development of the regions it is importsaid, if Regional Technical Colleges are to play the role they can play in the development of the regions it is important to have a strong input from elected representatives.  Regions will depend on the strength of Regional Technical Colleges. They can become a catalyst within the regions for various developments if they are handled properly.  If the local input is not suffcient Regional Technical Colleges could lose their relevance and might not develop to benefit the community commensurate with their potential.</P>
    <P>Regional Technical Colleges must be politically accountable and, under the terms of this Bill, each Regional Technical College must make an annual report.  The evolving pattern of development in higher education and the major level of finance from the taxpayer required to fund it means that the Oireachtas needs to consider the work of the Regional Technical College sector of education at least once a year.  Under this system of annual reports this House should be able to consider the efficiency of the use of taxpayers' funds by each Regional Technical College.  They could look at the staff/student ratios, the student space ratios and other cost indicators.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> The value of buildings and equipment in the average Regional Technical College is somewhere between £15 million and £30 million.  Annual budgets for staff salaries, class materials, replacement of worn equipment, maintenance of buildings, etc., run to approximately £5 million to £10 million per college.</P>
    <P>While each Regional Technical College has a predominantly regional role, the combined effort of all the Regional Technical Colleges has a major impact on the national provision of higher education. Oireachtas Éireann needs to look at and scrutinise fully this level of investment in a national programme for human resource development.  The Comptroller and Auditor General must scrutinise the State's investment.  The Committee of Public Accounts of this House must be allowed its input where appropriate.  The Ombudsman must also be allowed to scrutinise the administrative practices of the Regional Technical Colleges on behalf of this House.  I would like the Minister to clarify what role the Ombudsman will play under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with political accountability at regional and national levels. However, the proposed autonomous governing bodies of the Regional Technical Colleges must have a variety of inputs.  The best balance would be for one-third of the governing body to be composed of public representatives from the region, one-third independent members drawn either from the region or nationally from bodies or groups such as TEAGASC, the IFA or the ICMSA, chambers of commerce, rotary clubs, the Confederation of Irish Industry, the IDA or SFADCo, from CERT, the Hotels Federation or Bord Fáilte, from the National Youth Federation or the National Youth Council or other youth organisations and, indeed, from sporting organisations.  These representatives should not be staff members of the college nor officers or servants of the vocational education committees who have nominating rights to Government bodies.  In addition, it is important that the chairman of a governing body of a <Col N="548" /> college be a person of stature, be independent of the pressures on the other groups represented on the governing body and have the characteristics of a chairman as outlined in a recent newspaper article by Prefessor Michael Mac-Cormack, the recently retired Dean of Commerce from UCD who has been chairman of a number of governing/ management bodies.</P>
    <P>The principles of autonomy, of provision for programmes and budgets, of a legal basis for research and consultancy, which are now incorporated into this Bill, are principles with which Fine Gael have agreed for several years now.  The principles have also been advocated by a number of independent committees.  In more recent times these include the NESC Report 1984 under the Chairmanship of Miriam Hederman O'Brien; the NBST Barriers Report 1986 prepared by Dr. Jim Fitzpatrick; the International Study Group report under the Chairmanship of Tom Hardiman in 1989 and on foot of which the University of Limerick and Dublin City Univeristy were established.</P>
    <P>It is not often realised that this International Study Group, which was appointed by Pat Cooney, when Minister for Education, made equally radical proposals for the Regional Technical Colleges. Although the former Minister legislated quickly for the legitimate aspirations of the old NIHEs, now Dublin City University and the University of Limerick, she did not move so quickly in regard to the Regional Technical Colleges, probably because of pressure on her from various sources.  I am glad that this Bill is at last before us.  The new Minister should now move rapidly to bring its provisions into force as early as possible in the new year.</P>
    <P>I now wish to address the issue of an appropriate title for the Regional Technical Colleges.  There are two issues.  I believe that the title &ldquo;regional technical college&rdquo; has to be looked at again in terms of the polytechnic character of the work of Regional Technical Colleges.  In Britain, the term regional technical college is used to describe colleges with a <Col N="549" /> range of academic programmes of lower level than Ireland's Regional Technical Colleges.  This puts students who have graduated from Regional Technical Colleges at a disadvantage in that country. Let us not undersell the qualifications of our young people.  The former NIHEs had the same difficulties with the old title.</P>
    <P>There is a second difficulty with title. Many college staff feel that the title &ldquo;regional technical college&rdquo; fails to give full recognition to the very large element of business and social studies, and of art and design studies in the Regional Technical Colleges.  In Tralee 40 per cent of the students are in the School of Business &amp; Social Studies.  If this House is inwardly changing and restructuring the Regional Technical Colleges, then let us also change their outward title to give them full polytechnic recognition.</P>
    <P>The needs of Regional Technical College students outside the classroom must also be addressed.  In the case of Tralee, I believe this is typical of Regional Technical Colleges, the number of students aged 18-21 attending the college who come from outside Tralee, is approximately the same as the number of people in that age group who live permanently in Tralee.  This doubling of the 18-21 year old age cohort places great pressure on housing, on sports and recreational facilities and on transport facilities.  The Minister should look at this whole aspect of accommodation and the provision of proper facilities, including transport facilities, when this Bill is being put in place.  It is one thing to provide a legislative framework but it is another to provide the resources to ensure that the Regional Technical Colleges can develop to their full potential. The Minister must consider the needs of the students.  In Tralee, for example, there is a very big college now with more than 2,000 students.  However, there are no recreational facilities and no sports centre. Although the local sports centre is quite close to the college, they can use it only at certain times.  When the Minister is providing resources for regional technical colleges I would strongly urge him to <Col N="550" /> provide proper recreational facilities as well.</P>
    <P>Students need to play a full part in all aspects of the governance of colleges, save the one exception of the determination of grades in examinations.  The governing body could be a daunting place for any student to articulate the needs of their fellow students.  There may not be a great deal of sympathy for a student proposal, particularly if it is of a radical bent.  A solitary student Governor could find that a proposal which he or she made did not even have a seconder. Accordingly, I believe there should be two student members on the governing body.  In addition, it is clear that staff representation, both teaching and non-teaching, on the governing body must be increased significantly.  This was already dealt with by Deputy Ahearn and I am sure it will be dealt with again on Committee Stage.  It is very important that students should have more of a say in the running of Regional Technical Colleges. This Bill affords us the opportunity to give them that say.  The students would welcome a greater say in the running and future direction of policy in the colleges and the academic content of the courses they are pursuing.</P>
    <P>The end of 1992 sees the coming into operation of the Single Market.  This will bring freedom of movement of labour within the Single Market.  In 1988 all national diploma courses received EC wide recognition.  This is of importance not just for those who may work or study in other EC countries but also in attracting inward investment by multi-nationals into the different regions.  Deputy Martin made this point very forcibly.  I agree with him that one of the few advantages we can offer international business people in the regions is the standard of courses in our Regional Technical Colleges. This could become the regions' strong point in the future.  When business people come to this country with a view to investing in the regions the standard of education on offer, the level of reseach being carried out and the expertise available in our Regional Technical Colleges will be a major advantage for us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> The presence of the Regional Technical College in Tralee encouraged business people to County Kerry.  Indeed, one of the main reasons Nylerin was set up in Castleisland was that the person involved was confident that a well trained and well educated workforce would be available locally for the company.  In future Regional Technical Colleges will play a central role in attracting foreign industry to the regions and we will have to build on this advantage.</P>
    <P>The Regional Technical Colleges are participating in the ERASMUS and COMETT programmes.  There are French, German and Dutch students in Tralee.   Full recognition of college graduates with NCEA qualifications throughout the 12 member states is a very important concern in my region.  If young people have to emigrate &mdash; we should do everything to create employment to keep them at home &mdash; the status of the college they have attended must be no less than that of similar colleges elsewhere in Europe.  This House cannot permit vested interest groups to create artificial barriers to full Euro-comparability of our Regional Technical Colleges.  It is very important that the qualifications on offer in the Regional Technical Colleges are recognised throughout Europe.  It would be a major advantage for the graduates the Regional Technical Colleges are turning out to have their qualifications recognised throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about Regional Technical Colleges as a resource and think-tank for economic and social development in the regions.  The provision of a legal persona and, thus, a legal base for research and consultancy is welcome.  In enacting these provisions into law this House will establish a network of high-powered research centres in all regions.  Tralee is 65 miles from Limerick and 80 miles from Cork. If the Regional Technical College in Tralee does not take a leading role in the south-west region in carrying out research which stimulates innovation and new products in the industrial base of the region then, as a college, it will fail to make a full return to the people of the region.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> Unemployment, under employment and emigration are major preoccupations in my constituency. Peripherality is a problem and this House must give Tralee an autonomous college structure which can deliver an industrial liaison service to the region.  Kerry Innovation Limited, working with Tralee Chamber of Commerce, raised £75,000 which was matched pound for pound by the Industrial Development Authority and SFADCo to build an innovation centre on the campus of Tralee Regional Technical College. There is a willingness in the south-west region to use the resources of the college for industrial development.</P>
    <P>For Kerry, the college at Tralee is very important.  I am proud of it; it has great potential and I should like to compliment the staff of the college.  Before the provisions in this Bill were drawn up they were co-operating with and helping local industries to create employment in Kerry and the region in general.  What this Bill will do is put the work they have been doing on a statutory base.</P>
    <P>Tralee Regional Technical College needs to be established on a statutory base and this Bill, although not perfect, is a good start towards providing what is needed.  The Regional Technical Colleges have been waiting for six years for this legislation and its provisions need to be enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Although we will get an opportunity to deal with the various sections in detail on Committee Stage I would like to make some general observations now.  I would like to see the composition of the governing bodies changed to allow for greater staff representation and to see the staff representatives directly elected, as opposed to being appointed.  The conditions of service of staff should be determined on a national basis which would imply that the existing machinery for the determination of pay and conditions would continue and that any change envisaged in this area would take place through the existing negotiating machinery. Deputy Martin also referred to this matter.</P>
    <P>I also wish to see staff representatives on the academic council directly elected <Col N="553" /> and the number so elected increased. This Bill should be used to do away with the iniquitous practice of suspending teachers without pay.  All agree that a person is innocent until proven guilty but at present a teacher who is suspended and who may be proven innocent is condemned to long periods without pay.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify what is meant by teaching assistantships in the Bill.  Neither I nor my colleagues would want to see teachers replaced by quasi-teachers on low salaries and working under unacceptable conditions.  The Minister, when replying to Second Stage, should clarify in full what is meant by teaching assistantships.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider how the staffing structure of the colleges should be amended to allow staff to develop, overcome the static nature of grading within the colleges and to prevent the recruitment grade being the career grade.  The Minister should take the initiative in introducing this Bill to do a complete job on the Regional Technical Colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges to allow them to meaningfully face future challenges.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Bill has been introduced at last.  It will give our Regional Technical Colleges the strengths they deserve and enable them develop to their full potential.  I see the Regional Technical Colleges as being a dynamic force within the regions and the catalyst for many of the developments we talk about in this House.  I see them fitting in uniquely with what is being proposed in Europe at present, that there should be more regional involvement.  I see them as being the focal point for research and development, the production of properly trained personnel for international businesses and local industry and as the group who will exploit local indigenous industry as Tralee Regional Technical college have been doing.  I see the role of our Regional Technical Colleges as more important for our regions than the role of our major educational institutions in the larger cities.  Arising out of what I have seen take place in Tralee Regional Technical College I am confident that the <Col N="554" /> Regional Technical Colleges can grow and be a powerful force in the future.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to have this relatively early opportunity to contribute to the debate on these two Bills.  However, in expressing pleasure at my good luck at being called so soon I must express disappointment that there is no speaker from the Government benches offering in the debate at this stage.  I understand that only a handful of Government speakers have contributed to this debate so far.  I do not know whether the absence of a Government speaker offering at this stage is purely accidental or whether it is an indication that the interest of the two Government parties in educational matters, in particular their interest in the Regional Technical Colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges, is very low.  If that is the case it would be very regrettable.  As we all know, there is considerable public interest in what happens in the colleges, which make a very important educational and economic contribution in their respective towns and areas.  I am surprised that there does not appear to be a greater degree of interest in their welfare and future on the Government benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the glowing tributes paid to the role of the Regional Technical Colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges and to the contribution which they are making to education.  In doing so I recall that not so very long after these colleges were established they were considered very much the poor relation in the third level education sector.  I recall, for example, a time when the suggestion that the courses in Regional Technical Colleges, or indeed in what are now the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges, might merit degree status was regarded in Government and some educational circles as being out of court.  It is worth recalling that a very difficult battle was fought by the staff and students in those colleges over many years to secure the right to have degree courses, to secure validation and recognition of those courses, and to secure the <Col N="555" /> valuable place which they now have in the educational sector.  It is a measure of the work which the staff of those colleges have put in and of the commitment of the vocational education committees under whose aegis they have operated that these colleges have now reached the stage at which legislation is being introduced in this House to establish them on a statutory basis, when glowing tributes are being paid to their work, relevance and role by speakers from all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>In her introductory remarks the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, stated that in these two Bills she was attempting to strike a balance between the desire on the one hand by the colleges, in particular by the principals of the colleges, for a degree of independence and on the other the desire of the vocational education committees to retain those colleges in a relationship of public accountability with the vocational education committees themselves. I can understand the reasons and the motivation of the principals of the colleges and of the interests within the colleges themselves which would wish to have their colleges formally recognised on a statutory basis.  I can understand the wish of those colleges to have a degree of independence from the vocational education committees but I can also understand the frustration which is very often felt by the principals and staffs of the colleges in their relationship with the vocational education committees.  I am saying that in a very fraternal way because it is said from a position in which my party and I are absolutely committed to the concept of public control of education and public accountability in the education sector.  I am saying it from a position in which I recognise and applaud the tremendous work of the vocational education committees down through the years.  However, the circumstances which have given rise to these Bills, and to the way in which they have been presented, to some extent has been contributed to by the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>In regard to the colleges, perhaps the <Col N="556" /> vocational education committees might look at the role that certainly some of the vocational education committees have played in relation to them and ask themselves whether they have behaved to some extent like a parent who cannot let go of a child, that they have on some occasions perhaps taken too deep an interest in the details of what has happened within the colleges.  There is a need for a degree of self-criticism on the part of the vocational education committees and those of us who support the vocational education committee system.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I think that the direction in which these Bills have gone is very undemocratic.  People who have promoted the idea of independence and autonomy for the Regional Technical Colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges will find in the course of time that they are getting far less independence and autonomy under these Bills than they did under the vocational education committees.  These Bills are simply transferring the powers and the role of the vocational education committee, of local representatives and local control, to the Minister for Education. However, they are doing more than that: they are conferring on the Minister for Education a degree of control, authority and involvement in the Regional Technical Colleges and in the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges which the vocational education committees never had.</P>
    <P>Both Bills are riddled with references to the Minister for Education.  I will refer to the Colleges Bill because it is in many ways replicated in the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill.  The decision as to which colleges will come under this legislation will be a matter for the Minister.  The Minister can decide the names of the colleges.  The Minister can decide effectively what courses of study are pursued in the colleges.  The Minister can prescribe certain courses of study.  I know that the answer will be that the Minister does this in consultation with the governing body of the colleges and the vocational education committees but, at the end of the day under this Bill, the <Col N="557" /> Minister will make the decision in these matters.  For example, the Minister can decide what bodies will validate courses in these colleges.  Section 5 (1) (c) states that, subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine, the colleges can engage in research, consultancy and development work.  Where is the concept of academic freedom?  I am sure that many of the people who promoted the idea of independence and autonomy for the colleges&mdash;and who have looked enviously at the degree of academic freedom in the universities, for example&mdash;look in vain for the academic freedom here. Where is the academic freedom if the Minister for Education can ultimately decide on what research activities the colleges may engage in, the courses of studies they pursue and so on?</P>
    <P>The Minister can also decide on the awarding of scholarships and prizes. After all that, the Minister may also revoke any order he makes under this subsection.  He can give and he can take away.  The legislation sets down the way in which the governing bodies of the colleges are to be appointed.  The Minister reserves the right to sack a governing body under this legislation.  That is an extraordinary power.  The programmes to be pursued by the colleges and the budgets for those programmes have to be referred to the Minister.  Section 13 provides that the vocational education committee, before 1 May each year, have to submit to the Minister their programmes and budget for the approval of the Minister.  I do not envisage the Minister for Education spending his or her working week studying the details of the programmes for courses submitted by the regional technical colleges or any of the other proposals for research and so on that would be submitted from time to time.  In practice that will not happen. It is as absurd as thinking, for example that the Minister for the Environment examines individually all the national lottery applications made to him.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the powers of the vocational education committee and of local representatives are being transferred to the Civil Service.  People who <Col N="558" /> up to now within the regional colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges have perhaps moaned about the chief executive officer, the vocational education committee or whoever within a couple of years will very much regret that they have swapped accountability, through local representation, for the diktat of the Department of Education. These Bills provide for unprecedented involvement by the Department of Education in the internal day-to-day affairs of third level institutions.  That is something that should be opposed by this House.</P>
    <P>A number of concerns have been expressed by the staffs of the colleges, particularly by their representatives. Those concerns revolve essentially around sections 11 and 12 of the Bills which contain the provisions relating to staff.  One aspect of this matter needs clarification by the Minister.  As I understand it, the staffs of the existing regional technical colleges are to be transferred to the new colleges as officers and servants &mdash; I dislike those terms &mdash; of the vocational education committees with their existing conditions of employment intact, and will continue as officers and servants of the vocational education committees within the new colleges.  It is not clear, however, that new staff employed by the colleges to all intents and purposes, will also be officers and servants of vocational education committees. It seems that a two-tier system will operate in the colleges which will give rise to concern on the part of the staff about security of employment.  It will also give rise to industrial relations difficulties.</P>
    <P>Under present arrangements, officers of vocational education committees are not covered by the Industrial Relations Act or the Unfair Dismissals Act.  It seems that, under this arrangement, in a few years time some of the staff of the colleges will be officers of vocational education committees for all purposes to do with pay and conditions and for example will not be covered by, the Industrial Relations Act, whereas other staff will be covered by that Act.  That would give <Col N="559" /> rise to a most complicated situation and to potential conflict in the industrial relations arena.  What would happen, for example, in the case of a dispute?  Would some members of staff have access to the Labour Relations Commission while other members would have to pursue their grievance through the mechanism of the conciliation and arbitration scheme? Would some members of staff be entitled to pursue a dismissal case through the Unfair Dismissals Act while others would be denied that right?  None of this is clear from sections 11 and 12 and it will have to be cleared up by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is a very worrying clause in the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, section 12 (2) (a). It reads:</P>
    <P>The college may, following consultation with any recognised staff associations or trade unions concerned, redistribute or rearrange the duties to be performed by officers or servants who are appointed or deemed to be appointed to a college under subsection (1) and every such officer or servant shall be bound to perform the duties allocated to that officer or servant in any such redistribution or rearrangement.</P>
    <P>That clause sits very uneasily with the apparent commitment that the conditions of service of staff transferred to the colleges will be protected.  The only requirement under this section is that the college will have to consult with the staff association or trade union concerned.  Having done so, they are then empowered under this clause to issue an instruction or delegate any function to the member of staff. That will give rise to enormous complications in the new colleges and also to considerable concern on the part of the staff that, when transferred to the college, they can be allocated any duty irrespective of what their previous duties may have been.</P>
    <P>The Bills before us deal primarily with the existing colleges.  The Dublin Institute of Technology colleges and the colleges listed in the First Schedule are already in existence.  Apart from what <Col N="560" /> was said about the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, there has been very little reference to the need for additional third level places in the greater Dublin area.  That matter has already been commented on in many reports and the facts are already well known.  Dublin is under-provided for with regard to third level education, particularly below degree level.</P>
    <P>In the early eighties in order to redress that imbalance a promise was made by successive Governments that three new regional technical colleges would be provided in Dublin.  To date the only one of those colleges that appears to be coming on stream is the Tallaght college.  I am surprised that there is no reference in the Regional Technical Colleges Bill to that college.  I would have thought that as this college is now being built, a principal has been appointed and it is due to have its first intake of students next September, it would be appropriate that that college would be identified in the First Schedule to the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister intends to nominate that college as one of the colleges which will come under the First Schedule at a later stage, but the Minister's intentions in that regard should be made clear.  For example, the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee, under which it will operate, should know what type of governing body it will have and whether it will be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no mention of the proposed regional technical colleges for Blanchardstown or Dún Laoghaire.  Before I deal more fully with the proposed regional technical college for Dún Laoghaire, I will deal with the existing third level college which is not mentioned in the Bill.  The Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design have had to fight a battle over the years in order to be recognised as a third level college.  The college caters for 250 full-time students and runs courses for several hundred part-time students.  The college specialises in communications which link into the television and film media.  It is strategically located in that it is near RTE and the centre of that film area.  The demand for places in <Col N="561" /> the college is very high, which is understandable given that college productions have won many international awards. One will regularly see college productions not on RTE 1 and RTE 2, but on BBC and Channel 4.  In fact there are approximately ten applicants for every place on offer.  This year, for example, there were 12,000 applicants for the 150 first year places.  I make this point because the college are greatly constrained because they have not been allowed to expand.</P>
    <P>They are located in the grounds of Carriglea House.  Carriglea House, which has been owned by the Department of Education for the past ten years, is in a state of disrepair.  The house has been vandalised, and attempts have been made to burn it.  If it was renovated, it would provide the necessary space to enable the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design to expand.  I have raised this on a number of occasions both by correspondence and in this House.  It is absurd that the Department of Education own a building which lies idle and is falling into ruin on the campus where there is very considerable demand for additional college places.  I know that in recent times there has been some suggestion that additional space will be provided in that building.  The Department should renovate the entire building and make it available to the College of Art and Design to allow them to expand.</P>
    <P>The Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design should be recognised now as a third level college, by their inclusion in the arrangements being made under this Bill.  I do not understand why Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design of all the colleges have not been included under the terms of the Bill, although I enter the <i>caveat</i> that their inclusion might well be a mixed blessing.  The fact that they are not included suggests, however, that there is some reluctance on the part of the Minister to confer full recognition, to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>A promise was made in the eighties that one of the three proposed regional technical colleges, which were to provide additional third level places in the Dublin <Col N="562" /> area would be located in Dún Laoghaire. The Department of Education purchased a 25-acre site and asked the vocational education committee to draw up plans for the site.  The plans are ready, and a planning application could be lodged with the planning office.  Before the local elections in 1985, the then Minister for Education, Mrs. Hussey, promised that the Department were ready to go ahead and build the colleges.  On foot of that, the vocational education committee drew up the details of the courses to be provided in the colleges.  We all thought that the establishment of the Regional Technical College in Dún Laoghaire was on the way.  However, the idea was dropped somewhere along the line.</P>
    <P>The regional technical college at Tallaght is being proceeded with but there is no mention of the other two.  It would appear that suggestions about the proposals for a regional technical college in Castlebar and more recently in Thurles or somewhere else in Tipperary, are gaining greater credence in Government circles. There can be no question of jumping the queue.  If the Minister for Education were to come in here and make an announcement that a regional technical college were to be provided in Tipperary or anywhere else, prior to a regional technical college in Dún Laoghaire &mdash; with all due respects to Deputy Ahearn&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree, but for some it is not entirely out of necessity.  When Carysfort College first came on the market in mid-1989 I suggested to the then Minister for Education that this was an ideal opportunity to proceed with the proposed Dún Laoghaire regional technical college.  The Minister acknowledged that to all intents and purposes Carysfort had been provided out of taxpayers' money.  I suggested that she should enter into negotiations with the Sisters of Mercy to try to keep the college in public ownership and use it for public education.  Indeed, Dún Laoghaire Vocational Educational Committee also made the case that Carysfort could be used for the proposed regional technical college.  I again made that case when the college came back on the market in February 1990.  On both occasions the then Minister rejected the idea.  Her rejection was two-fold.  First she claimed that the building was unsuitable so far as converting it to a regional technical college was concerned.  She said that the Department had examined the building in that respect.  Secondly, the then Minister indicated that it would be too costly to convert the college for use as a regional technical college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of what has been learned and subsequently about the cost of Carysfort College, the position taken by the former Minister for Education needs to be re-examined. It needs to be re-examined, first on the question of suitability.  The former Minister said her Department carried out an examination.  I should certainly like to see the departmental reports that indicated the unsuitability of the property.  As we know, a regional college does not have to fit exactly into the stereotype of the regional colleges built originally.  For example, the kind of courses offered can vary.  I simply do not accept that Carysfort College would have been unsuitable for a regional technical college or that it could not have been <Col N="564" /> converted to suitability for the amount of money that was subsequently paid to convert it to a private business school.</P>
    <P>I also query very strongly the suggestion that it would have been too costly to develop Carysfort as a regional technical college.  As is now known, the reality is that the State spent almost £10 million in order to provide Carysfort as a private educational institution.  It is also known now that Carysfort could have been bought cheaper than the price eventually paid by the State.</P>
    <P>Until very recently the suggestion that Carysfort could have been bought cheaper was a suggestion made mainly by Opposition Deputies and some educational commentators, but there is now solid evidence that Carysfort could have been bought for less than what was eventually paid for it.  We have the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which states:</P>
    <P>On 29 August 1989 the Valuation Office stated that in its opinion the current open market value of the property offered and a further five acres of playingfield was in the region of £3.8 million.  In arriving at this opinion, the Valuation Office stated that it had taken into account the various restrictions on development on the property.</P>
    <P>That report is very clear to me.  I know that the property that was on offer consisted of the college buildings and 20 acres of land; that was the total property on offer.  The day after the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General was published the Department of Education issued a statement stating that the valuation related only to the land and not to the buildings.  Within hours the Comptroller and Auditor General was on radio saying that he stood over what was in his report&mdash;that is something that I had never known a Comptroller and Auditor General to do.  There is a clear contradiction between the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the statement made by the Department of Education.  The property that was on offer clearly included the buildings.  I now want the Minister for Education to <Col N="565" /> release the report of the Valuation Office to show where the truth lies in this matter.  Either the property on offer included the buildings or it did not include the buildings, and the only way in which that can be established is by perusal of the report.</P>
    <P>I have never known of a time when the Comptroller and Auditor General and a Department of State were so much at odds in relation to the valuation of property. If the report is correct and the valuation at the time was £3.8 million then the big question to arise is why the State 18 months later paid £8 million for the same property.  At least, why was a second valuation not obtained?  I raise the issue now because I consistently raised it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It has.  It concerns regional technical colleges.  I have consistently made the case that Carysfort College could have been the location for a Dún Laoghaire regional technical college but the former Minister for Education in her argument against that cited two reasons, one that the college could not be converted.  If it could be converted to a business school then it could have been converted to a regional technical college.  Regional colleges do business courses, and if UCD graduates can be taught business in Carysfort then it seems to me that people studying for certificates and national diplomas in business studies could be taught at Carysfort.  Therefore I do not accept that Carysfort was unsuitable.  The second reason cited was that of cost.  The reason I raise the matter of cost now is that the former Minister claimed that it would have been too costly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1989 the Valuation Office struck a valuation of £3.8 million for the property. For the remaining £6.2 million eventually paid by the State much conversion work <Col N="566" /> could have been done to make Carysfort suitable as a regional technical college. The second opportunity for the State arose when Carysfort came back on the market.  Again, the former Minister for Education said that Carysfort could not be purchased, that it was never on offer for less than £8 million.  That may be true as far as it goes, but we now know from the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that the vendors of the property were prepared to negotiate.  As early as 2 October 1989 the Department were informed by the vendors' solicitors that the price of £8.5 million was negotiable on the basis of a realistic offer being made urgently.  That point was not acknowledged here in any of the debates, in any of the replies given by the former Minister for Education or, indeed, in any of the public statements she made on the matter.</P>
    <P>My interest in raising this issue in the context of the Bill is that I represent a constituency that was promised a regional technical college.  On several occasions here in the House I have made the case for that regional technical college. I identified a possible location for the college, a location that could have been obtained for less than the price eventually paid for it in order to provide a business school, as is now clearly shown in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>The explanations that have been given to date to the case that has been made that the property could have been purchased for less than the State originally paid for it are not satisfactory, nor is the failure to explain why Carysfort was bought by a private individual or a private company in July 1990 for £6.5 million and was then back on the market within days &mdash; within days the property was back on the market, and that has never been explained.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy representing the constituency in which that institution is located, I certainly want explanations for that.  I want explanations not just in the whole realm of public accountability, value for money and all of the debate that has gone on here in the past few <Col N="567" /> weeks, I want explanations about that for my constituents.  I want explanations for those young people in my constituency who have to travel to Waterford, Carlow and other places because there are no third level places available for them within their own areas.  I want to know why explanations given here before as to why Carysfort could not be converted to a regional technical college have now disappeared in a puff of smoke.  The ground of unsuitability does not hold up and, quite clearly, on the basis of what is now known from the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the ground of cost does not hold up either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>The two Bills before the House today generally are welcomed and supported in principle by the Fine Gael Party.  While I agree with the comments of previous speakers on the significant contribution of the regional technical colleges over the past 20 years or so in providing educational opportunities for many students, it is now appropriate and fitting that these colleges be allowed more autonomy and scope for development.  Nevertheless, I am somewhat puzzled that these Bills should be introduced at this time in view of the fact that the Government are about to publish a Green Paper on education before the end of this year, that if one is to believe the recently concluded review of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Programme for Government, which programme states:</P>
      <P>The Government will publish a Green Paper on education before the end of 1991.  This will be a comprehensive policy discussion document leading to a White Paper and ultimately an Education Act.  The publication of the Green Paper is intended to initiate a nation-wide debate on a whole range of important education issues.  The Green Paper will summarise the current status of the Irish education system and will propose a framework for its development into the next century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a laudable and ambitious objective and will be most welcome by all <Col N="568" /> involved directly or indirectly in our education system.  A national debate on the shape and form of our education system on the threshold of the 21st century is an exciting prospect.  If real debate is initiated and takes place it will lead to a more enlightened, relevant education policy for the future.  However, one must pose the question whether consideration of these two Bills pre-empts the Green Paper on education to be issued before the end of this year and the resultant White Paper and Education Act.  For example, will the framework for the development of the regional technical colleges into the next century be decided in advance of the issue of the Green Paper which is intended as &mdash; and again I quote from the Programme for Government &mdash;&ldquo;.... a comprehensive policy discussion document&rdquo;.?.</P>
    <P>I presume that discussion document will deal with the subject at third level and regional technical education.  Why should we pre-empt this portion of the legislation on a piecemeal basis?  Would not the proposed Regional Technical Colleges Bill have been greatly enhanced and given a more comprehensive and valid framework within the overall education system by proper and due consideration through the process of a Green Paper, White Paper and, ultimately, the promised Education Act?  One is bound to ask the question: what is the exteme urgency for the introduction of these two Bills at this time?  In the context of the agreed Programme for Government one must also ask: are these Bills being rushed through in undue haste?  Will the Houses of the Oireachtas be in a position to repent at leisure for such haste?  Indeed, the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, made more or less the same point while contributing in the House a few weeks ago on Deputy Jim Higgins's Education Bill when she accused Deputy Higgins of pre-empting the Green and White Papers, of being unduly hasty, contending that we should have the national debate before any such Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>I might take this opportunity of congratulating the new Minister on his <Col N="569" /> appointment and to wish him every success in his office.  Perhaps the new Minister will understand the contradiction in the statment of his predecessor.  Having made that point I want to be positive and constructive in this matter and say that the regional technical colleges have provided educational opportunities for many thousands of our young people who, in the absence of these opportunities, probably would never have had a chance of attending third level institutions.  Their location throughout the country has rendered it possible for many students to continue their education having sat their Leaving Certificate examinations.  A major factor in favour of the regional technical colleges is that students attending their courses are assisted financially through the European Social Fund.  Since such funding is not subject to a means test, as are most higher education grants, this has meant that all students attending regional technical colleges were entitled to funding irrespective of means.</P>
    <P>Not alone do these regional technical colleges provide certificates and diplomas in technical subjects but have developed many other courses over the years, not only in the area of technology but also in the scientific and business fields, with courses such as art and design, legal studies, social sciences and business studies.  In the regional technical college with which I am most familiar, namely, the Donogh O'Malley Regional Technical College in Letterkenny, they have been operating an Irish language secretarial and business course.  This has meant that there is a corps of young people throughout the north west and other parts of the country who can provide an excellent secretarial service through the medium of the Irish language. Section 5 of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1991, prescribes the functions of the colleges as:</P>
    <P>... to provide vocational and technical education and training for the economic, technological, scientific, commercial, industrial, social and cultural development of the State, ...</P>
    <P>This means that the regional technical <Col N="570" /> colleges will be empowered to contribute in a positive and meaningful way to the economic, social and cultural development of their regions.</P>
    <P>Coming from County Donegal, I am acutely aware of the contribution made by the two colleges mentioned in the Bill, namely, the Regional Technical College in Letterkenny and the Hotel Training and Catering College in Killybegs.  Donegal Vocational Education Committee have played a distinguished role in the development of those two colleges over a 24 year period.  As a member of that vocational education committee I realise the future potential of both colleges to education and training in the north west. However, it is regrettable that the future role of the vocational education committees in relation to the colleges is being marginalised by the measures proposed in this Bill.  I contend that the main weakness of the Bill is that it takes local democratic control from the regional technical colleges, which control had not been found wanting in the past.  If one looks at the way such colleges have developed, the increased number of courses available and the increased numbers of students attending those colleges under the auspices and control of the vocational education committees such examination demonstrates in a very positive way that these colleges were allowed develop adequately when under the control of the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1991, claims to create autonomous management structures, to provide for research and consultancy in the colleges and retain them within the vocational education sector.  The provisions of the Bill will marginalise the functions of the vocational education committees, that their role is now being assumed by the Department of Education.  As a consequence, instead of autonomous management structures within the colleges, their operational freedom may be interfered with directly on a regular basis by the Department of Education.  The danger is that the colleges may cease to <Col N="571" /> be regional in anything but name and, instead, could become State colleges.</P>
    <P>In Donegal we are particularly proud of the contribution of the Hotel Training and Catering College in Killybegs.  Killybegs is a unique college in that it trains and prepares hundreds of young people for every sector of the catering and service industry, particularly in tourist facilities and services which will play an increasingly important role in our economy in the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the amalgamation of the Regional Technical College in Letterkenny and the Hotel Training and Catering College in Killybegs.  I and the vocational education committee of which I am a member strongly disagree with this proposal.  We believe that Killybegs, because of its uniqueness and the specialised nature of its disciplines and courses, should be allowed to remain independent and continue to develop in its own field of endeavour.  The Minister should realise that there are 45 miles between Letterkenny and Killybegs, which would present such an amalgamation with certain logistical difficulties.  The college in Killybegs has an excellent reputation and it has been put on record many times that all its graduates find full-time employment in this country.  I appeal to the Minister to look again at their position and to allow them to maintain their separate and independent identity.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals specifically with regional technical colleges.  I come from a Border county where there is an established tradition of students attending regional technical colleges in Northern Ireland such as the North West College of Technology in Derry.  The Minister should seriously consider giving official recognition to courses attended by Southern students in regional technical colleges and polytechnics in Northern Ireland.  A number of such courses are already recognised and students attending those courses are entitled to maintenance allowance.  However, many students are attending other courses which are not as yet recognised by our educational authorities and, consequently, do not receive <Col N="572" /> any assistance for this State. The only assistance they obtain is from the Northern authorities who pay their fees.  I would strongly appeal to the Minister to look urgently at this matter with a view to clearing up any discrepancy that exists between recognised and unrecognised courses attended by Southern students in Northern Ireland.  It would be a great relief to students from Donegal and other Border areas, many of whom have limited financial means, who are attending these colleges in the North.</P>
    <P>There is a further glaring discrepancy in the area of educational grants and assistance to third level students in the immediate area of the Border.  I know families on our side of the Border who send their children to post-primary schools in the North due to the fact that the Northern school may be only a mile up the road, whereas the post-primary school on the Southern side may be ten or more miles away.  I know some students who have obtained a high standard in their A levels but do not qualify for grants to attend regional technical colleges and other institutes of higher education in the Republic, even though they are citizens of this State.  This matter should be investigated by the Minister.  It is an area in which genuine and meaningful cross-Border co-operation in the field of education could be profitably initiated.</P>
    <P>More resources are urgently needed for the regional technical colleges throughout the country.  Since they were built 20 years ago many have experienced a doubling in their student population. In Letterkenny, for instance, where the original plan was for 600 students there are now over 1,200.  Facilities of all kinds, including library space, study areas and recreational facilities are completely inadequate to deal with the present demands on these colleges.  Compared with our established universities they are absolutely under-funded.  I hope one of the results of the passing of these Bills will be that more resources will be provided so that the colleges can develop in all areas to meet the demands of the student population.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé níos luaithe tá cúrsa <Col N="573" /> speisialta rúnaíochta agus staidéar gnó ar siúl sa Choláiste Réigiúnach Teicneolaíochta i Leitir Ceanainn agus tugtar aitheantas ceart agus caoi do chearta agus stádas na Gaeilge sa choláiste sin.</P>
    <P>Déantar tagairt ar leith do cheist na teanga in alt 7 (4) den Bhille seo, na gColáistí Teicniúla Réigiúnacha, 1991.  Deir an t-alt sin:</P>
    <P>In performing its functions a governing body shall bear constantly in mind the national aim of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Tá an cuspóir sin ceart go leor chomh fada is a théann sé.  Mar sin féin sílim go bhféadfadh sé a bheith níos deimhne agus níos láidre.  Is iad na focail a bhfuil mé amhrasach fúthu ná &ldquo;shall bear constantly in mind&rdquo;.  Is iomaí rud a bhíonn de shíor ar an intinn agus nach ndéantar aon rud ina thaobh.  Ní dualgas ró-mhór ná ró-throm rud a bheith de shíor ar d'intinn, mar a deirtear sa Bhille.</P>
    <P>Sílim go mbeidh leasú á mholadh ag na bpáirtí seo againne, is é sin Páirtí Fhine Gael, chun seasamh níos daingne agus níos láidre a thabhairt do staid na Gaeilge sna coláistí réigiúnacha ná mar atá luaite sa Bhille seo.  Ba mhaith liom féin go mbeadh an seasamh céanna agus an dualgas céanna i leith na Gaeilge ar na coláistí teicniúla réigiúnacha agus ar Institiúid Teicneolaíochta Bhaile Atha Cliath agus atá ar Ollscoil Luimnigh, mar a leagtar síos é sa Bhille úr Ollscoil Luimnigh (Coláiste Thuamhumhan a dhíscaoileadh) 1991.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh leasú á mholadh ag Fine Gael ag Céim an Choiste den Bhille seo pé uair a thógfar é.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhfuil feabhas agus fiúntas cruthaithe ag na coláistí réigiúnacha ó bunaíodh iad.  Tá forbairt agus fás tagtha orthu.  Tá líon na ndaltaí ag freastal orthu ag dul in airde agus i méid go mór.  Is cruthú é seo ar mhuinín tuismitheoirí san oideachas agus sa traenáil a chuirtear ar fáil sna coláistí seo.  Sílim gur an laige is mó sa Bhille ná go bhfuil na coistí <Col N="574" /> Gairmoideachais ag cailleadh an cheannais agus na freagrachta a bhí orthu go dtí seo.  Sílim go ndearna siad cúis an-mhaith ó thaobh na gcoláistí de chomh fada is a bhí siad faoin a gcúram.  Tá an ceannas agus an fhreagracht sin á thabhairt anois don Aire agus don Roinn.  Ní shílim go bhfuil sé sin ag cur le daonlathas áitiúil. Ba chóir go mbeadh oiread ceannas agus cumhacht agus freagracht ar ionadaithe áitiúla agus a d'fhéadfadh a bheith.  Silim gur céim ar chúl í sin ó thaobh an Bhille. Is é an t-aon rud maith atá sa Bhille, agus an fáth go bhfuilimid taobh thiar de i bprionsabal ná go bhfuil sé chun deis a thabhairt dóibh forbairt go neamhspleách. Tá súil agam nuair a bheidh an reachtaíocht tríd leis na leasuithe go rachaidh sé chun tairbhe do na coláistí agus do na daltaí a bheidh ag freastal orthu.</P>

      <P>Even though many people have praised this Bill I have some reservations about it as I believe it is an attack on the democratic system.  Despite what the Minister may say, I regard the Bill as the first step in dismantling the vocational education committees.  This is regrettable in view of the tremendous work they have done.  In her speech the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, referred to the history of the vocational education committees and the progress they have made over the years. She referred to the 1930 Act but omitted to refer to the setting up of 30 vocational education committees by the the then Minister for Education, John Marcus O'Sullivan.  I wonder why she did not refer to this point when she was referring to the history of the vocational education committees.  This is why I have grave reservations about this Bill and what it is intended to do.  Many members of the teaching profession have also indicated that they have reservations about the Bill and they want it amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vocational education committees have carried out tremendous work over the years and can be held up to other academic institutions as an example of what can be achieved in education.  One thinks particularly of colleges, such as the Bolton Street and Kevin Street Colleges <Col N="575" /> of Technology.  Engineering and architectural graduates of these colleges hold some of the highest positions in their professions througout the world.  Unfortunately, many of them cannot find work in this country.  This leads me to pose the question: why are the changes proposed in this Bill necessary?  I am not against change but I should like to know what is wrong with the present system.</P>
    <P>Vocational education committees were always regarded as the poor relation in education.  They were set up against a background of strong opposition from vested interests who did not want them to succeed.  There was so much opposition to these schools that people who attended them could not sit the leaving certificate course.  This gives us some idea of the kind of opposition these schools had to contend with in their infancy.  They were regarded by many as providing a poor people's education charter. Obviously the thinking at that time was that poor people should not be educated beyond a certain standard.  This reflects rather badly on the attitude of people at that time.</P>
    <P>Credit for the progress made by vocational education committees should not go to the Department: the vocational education committees and their teaching staff built up the colleges from nothing into first class learning institutions.  These people had a real interest in education and progress and the tremendous work they did over the years filled a gap which existed in education in terms of technical subjects and the ordinary trades.  Many young people who received a basic training in these subjects in vocational schools went on to serve their apprenticeships.  That kind of education is highly desirable and necessary.  I hope I am wrong, but I think a move is being made to get away from that kind of education. Even though we now have community schools, we do not have vocational schools like those which existed when I was going to school.  I am a product of vocational education.  I attended secondary school for a while <Col N="576" /> and then progressed to Kevin Street College of Technology.  At night I attended a school which was held over some shops in Capel Street.  I can say with pride that that was a first class educational institution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The wonderful men and women who taught in that institution were dedicated to education.  I am afraid that we are moving away from the system of education and the pioneering educational spirit which existed at that time. That kind of education is more necessary today then ever.  Many young people in housing estates and inner city areas need special education not just in academic subjects but in technical subjects and the trades.  We pay a lot of lip service to poverty but the only way we can eradicate this problem is by meeting the educational needs of people living in poor areas.</P>
      <P>Vocational education was the ideal form of education for areas like these.  I should like to see a greater concentration on this type of education in areas which are marginalised.  I should also like to see greater emphasis on this type of education in national schools.  By increasing the school leaving age all we are doing is trapping kids who want to leave school. Once children reach 11 or 12 years of age they should be given a basic training in skills using their hands.  Unfortunately, we seem to be moving away from the concept of vocational schools, which were originally set up to provide this type of education.  The Minister may say we are now doing this, but I am not happy with the situation.  In view of our high level of unemployment there is a great need to give children a basic training in technical and trade subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS, which was set up as a training institution, should have been kept within the educational system.  The Department of Education, which probably did not want to take on this body, hived it off to the Department of Labour.  I do not think <Col N="577" /> FÁS has anything to do with the Department of Labour but it should have everything to do with education.  Again, I think we are seeing the fruits of that kind of training.  Many people are inducted into these courses and trundle out of them after a year with very little to show for their time other than the fact that they were off the unemployment register and out of the way for 12 months.  That is not what training is about and that is why I say we missed the boat when we did not leave that kind of training within the vocational education committee.  Historically that kind of education was never acceptable, it has been and continues to be the Cinderella of Irish education.</P>
    <P>The regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology have all graduated to a much higher plane and that is a tremendous development.  I would like to see all these institutions being able to confer degrees and have university status.  We should look at where they are now and where they should be going.  I am talking at a slightly lower level because all of these colleges graduated, certainly in the Dublin area, from the ordinary technical school status. I do not know why that sort of development cannot still take place.  What upsets me about the vocational schools not being more involved in training is that, within that system, there were professionals with the ability to train young people and bring in a whole new cadre of personnel.  If young people cannot be guaranteed a job on completion of their training, we should at least be able to guarantee them skills of some kind or other.  Otherwise we are misleading them and they become cynical.  A one year training course is not sufficient, it should extend to two years.  Following such a period of training young people can be first class blocklayers, pipelayers and so on in the construction industry.  In engineering there is a vast array of skills in which people could be trained.  I am aware that I may be bringing the wrath of the trade unions, particularly the trade section, on my house for saying these things but I am not terribly worried about that, they are a vested interest group, <Col N="578" /> they have to look after their members. However, we, as public representatives, have to have regard to the general good of the public and the general good of young people.  That is my interest.  That is why I say this type of training is necessary, at the end of which certificates for proficiency would be awarded.  Before being admitted to a particular course students should undertake an IQ test for the purpose of determining their suitability for any particular area of training, to ensure that they would not finish up as square pegs in round holes.  To proceed on such lines would afford our young people hope for the future.  As public representatives, we all meet many people who go on courses but who are disillusioned at the end of the day because they had not acquired any real skill.  One would have to admit there is a certain degree of dishonesty in all of this area.  It is papering over cracks and is misleading.  That is not what we are about.  I am not pointing the finger at anybody in saying that.</P>
    <P>We have set up an apprenticeship board but one must ask why that was not done within the structure of vocational education.  Why do we always have to set up different bodies and institutions? When something new has to be provided for, instead of slotting it in with existing structures we set up another board or semi-State body, in other words, we set up another cadre of bureaucracy.  That is what is bedevilling this country.  In the Estimate for Tourism and Transport last week provision was made for setting up an aeronics board.  This section is being taken out of the Department and is to be set up as a semi-State body.  Could provision for that section not have been made within Aer Rianta, for example? Why not use the existing agencies even if it means expanding them or dressing them up?</P>
    <P>The same applies to the apprenticeship board and to FÁS.  We are always setting up something new.  The sooner we realise that that is not the way to go about such matters the better.  When we have something good it should be developed, and we have something good in the vocational <Col N="579" /> education committee structure, in the colleges of technology and, indeed, in the ordinary technical school.  These are the structures that should be improved.  It seems to me that, as I said earlier, there is a move to whittle them down.  I hope I am wrong in that because they have been doing a tremendous job.  The need for them is greater now in Dublin and in other large urban areas where there are high unemployment rates, where, literally, there are time bombs waiting to go off.  Unless we look at that area and give these young people some reason for hope we are going nowhere.  Training is very important in developing our bright young people.</P>
    <P>Education in Ireland basically is for those who have the wherewithal or who have parents who encourage them to develop their talents.  In areas of high unemployment or where there is a poor tradition in terms of education, children are at a disadvantage educationally. There is no point in raising the age at which children may leave school if they are not encouraged to take an interest in their education.  We have got to stimulate them.</P>
    <P>Traditionally in the inner city areas the fathers and grandfathers of today's children were tradesmen.  Now we have streamlined the system so that it is geared much more towards education.  Unless one obtains X number of honours one will not be in a position to be apprenticed to a trade.  I wonder whether this is the way forward.  The type of training we should be seeking is in all these areas.  There is a great demand for skilled and semiskilled operators.  We all know how difficult it is to get someone to do a job in the house.  If a boy or girl who has had training has to go to England they are going with something they can sell, they are not hewers of wood or drawers of water.  Knowing the ways of most of the Irish, they can also chance their arm a little.  Many of our people have become big contractors abroad without very much training.</P>
    <P>We owe our young people a vocational <Col N="580" /> education.  We have serious unemployment and there is a lack of opportunity for our young people.  The reality is that we have an over 17 per cent unemployment rate.  We have an obligation to do what we can to help people on the margins.  I noticed recently a programme to include the teaching of French in primary schools.  It is a great idea but how many youngsters would like to see a better English programme in the schools? How many pupils leave schools unable to read and write?  This should not happen. That problem can be tackled through a whole new programme of education.</P>
    <P>The vocational education system was set up to cater for poor people.  This Bill should dovetail with the principles enshrined in vocational education so that we can cherish all our children equally. Years ago we had a more balanced community with doctors, dentists, publicans, shopkeepers and others living in the same area and attending the same school.  That is all changed and we have children from the same socio-economic group attending one school.  Children from areas where there is 70 per cent and 80 per cent unemployment do not come in contact with anyone who is working and we are perpetuating problems connected with poverty unless we tackle education at that level.  Money is not a solution although it gets people by from week to week.  The only solution is an appropriate education system.  The education system we have is working effectively for more well-off people who are benefitting from it and going on to third level education.  They are doing all right but the people on the margins are not getting a fair share.  We should have a new look at the system and consider perhaps integrating vocational education into national schools.  The principle of vocational education should be a priority.  If it is maintained as a priority we will be able to eradicate many of our social ills particularly in the inner cities and in the larger suburbs which we have created without much planning over the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>I agree with the setting up of better <Col N="581" /> structures to develop the vocational education committees and regional technical colleges but we should not remove the democratic element, the role of the elected representative.  The system has worked well and now everyone wants to claim the success and shove aside those who made it possible.  There is a bit of window dressing in this Bill.  There is no question but that those who made it possible will be slowly shoved aside and it will be a tremendous loss.</P>
    <P>The Bill shows that the Minister wants a greater hand in all of this.  I am suspicious as to why. Vocational education was successful without an input from the Minister and the Department so the old adage applies, &ldquo;if it is not broken, why mend it?&rdquo;  I have grave reservations about this Bill.  I am afraid the Minister will become too involved.  Education should be left to the educationalists. The Department should provide the funding and control the purse strings.  The success of these colleges is a tribute to public representatives, dedicated teachers and all those involved in them.  They have done a tremendous job. If there have to be modifications to the system, we should keep these people in mind and encourage their pioneering spirit.  We should not do anything to stifle initiatives that have been successful over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In an ironic way I welcome the debate.  I do not welcome all aspects of the Bills, but I do not want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. As the spokesperson for the Labour Party has already indicated, we have the gravest reservations about the core of these Bills, that is how they impact on the democratic accountability of education here.  It is useful to have a debate on the issue of education in this House.  There have been many contributors who have talked in a wide-ranging way about education. The issue on which politics and debate will focus for the next decade and into the next century will be education. <Col N="582" /> We have seen fundamental changes in the way society is organised, in the way people are employed, and education is at the heart of that, third level education in particular.  If our education system is not geared to face the challenges of mass unemployment, to prepare our young people, the fastest growing youth population in the European Community, for the next century, we will have fundamentally failed the people of Ireland. We will have doomed ourselves to a second tier existence while our European partners continue to thrive in the way they have shown they can.</P>
      <P>We are debating two separate Bills and I will approach each with different emphases.  The Dublin Institute of Technology Bill deals with the colleges that exist primarily or exclusively in the city and county of Dublin while the Regional Technical Colleges Bill has a much broader geographical scope, dealing with regional colleges from Letterkenny to Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will focus primarily on the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.  The regional technical colleges have been the success story of Irish third level education in the last two decades.  Their success is part of the reason some people want to change the ground rules.  There is a truism which Americans put very ably: &ldquo;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&rdquo;.  I do not know why the most successful and least resourced area of education is to be subject to fundamental change.  The technological sector has mushroomed since the last war and we have latterly caught up with developments which have taken place in mainland Europe, America and Britain where there is a huge emphasis on technological education.  It derives fundamentally from a different philosophy. The old liberal education philosophy that underscored traditional university education, it was felt, would be inadequate to meet the new technological challenges of the latter part of the 20th century.  That has proved true.  Our society has changed in the last 20 or 30 years.  Technology is now accepted as a force that is daily changing the way we lead our lives. The flagship technological third level <Col N="583" /> institutions are as well known and as highly regarded now as the traditional centres of learning such as Oxford, the Sorbonne, Cambridge or Trinity College, seats of learning that have been in existence for centuries.  In the last number of decades on a par with those we have the colleges of technology, the MITS and the polytechnics who are performing on a par with them in terms of excellence but in a different dimension.</P>
    <P>We have neglected to focus our resources, assistance and help on the technological third level sector here to enable them to be on a par with the best. There is obviously an ongoing debate within education on the value of pure learning.  I strongly commend the notion of learning for learning's sake.  That is why we have two separate branches of education, a liberal education that can be carried out in the universities &mdash; obviously there is a professional education that is carried out in the universities in the professional faculties also &mdash; and a new separate entity that has thrived in the last number of decades, has focused on the cutting edge of new technology and advanced us in relation to developments in energy, in industry, in space research and so on that has fundamentally changed the way we have lived our lives in recent decades.</P>
    <P>Before I get into the meat of this Bill I want to put in context our attitude to education because it is a fundamental question that was touched upon by Deputy O'Brien.  What do we, as a people, want of our third level colleges which are funded by the taxpayer and which, unfortunately, do not allow equal access to all our citizens?  We still have an elitist third level sector to which many, when they start primary school, never aspire; they know they are just not going to make it because they come from a certain socio-economic background. They are two steps behind the posse before they get into junior infants and by the time they get to second level they know that third level education is not for them.</P>
    <P>Many people do not even think the <Col N="584" /> possibility of third level education is there for them.  We have gradually, in a painful, slow process moved away from that to try to broaden the opportunities for all our citizens of a chance of third level education.  To the forefront of that expansion, slow and painful as it was, have been the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institutes of Technology. They have provided an opportunity for people to participate in a third level facility which is reasonably close to home without having to go to major cities.  They have afforded the opportunity of participating at third level without having to achieve the impossible points that are now standard for admission to some of our university faculties. They have been a tremendous force for liberalising and opening up third level education in this country over 20 years. We have to use the opportunity of this debate to applaud their great success and the crucial role played in their success by the structures that nurtured them over the last two decades.  Foremost among those were the vocational education committees, the only democratic structures of education currently in place in our country, to our great shame.</P>
    <P>The total imbalance in terms of resources from the State as between the universities and the regional technical colleges is a point to note.  The universities have traditionally got the lion's share of the money and a lesser allocation was deemed appropriate for the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institutes of Technology although they now cater for approaching half of all students involved in third level education. That is a fundamental imbalance that we have to address.  Those of us who visited regional colleges around the country know there is a certain sameness even about their design. They were built from a standard model, from Sligo to Letterkenny, to Waterford and to Carlow.  They are utilitarian, to put it at its mildest, in terms of design and construction.  There were no ivy covered granite stoned buildings for the technological sector.  They were utilitarian buildings with, in many cases, raw bricks <Col N="585" /> painted; they were not even plastered. The colleges did not complain about that or about the under-funding.  They, obviously, looked for more resources on the basis of success and achievement. Despite the under-valuing of their contribution in terms of resource recognition, they have defied those who would starve them of the necessary resources and thrived.</P>
    <P>That is the backdrop.  In virtually every advanced country there are two distinct divisions in third level education, the traditional universities and the cutting edge of technological development.  We have to decide at this juncture what we want in terms of third level education in catering for the needs of the people of this country from now into the next century. We should make an assessment now, listen to the views of all those with an interest in education and the elected Members of this House before coming to a conclusion on that fundamental issue.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I find the timing of the Bills extraordinary.  We have been told that a Green Paper on education is ready to be published.  According to some newspaper reports it has been printed and will be distributed in early December. Why then should there be a pre-emptive strike on one sector in advance of the discussion that will obviously flow from the Green Paper on education?  I am puzzled and bemused at the logic which says we should put the structures in place, nail down the Bills and then have a discussion.  That is bizarre in the extreme.  When the Minister comes to reply to this debate perhaps he would give us some cogent, logical reasons for this pre-emptive strike as I have classified it.</P>
    <P>I am machiavellian enough to believe that vested interests want this issue nailed down before an open debate takes place.  That is unfortunate because the most fundamental issue that will face us as a people during the next decade, as I have already said, is education. I had expected, particularly from the former Minister for Education, to have an open, non-bordered debate on <Col N="586" /> education at all levels which would have commenced with the publication of the Government's views in the Green Paper and which would have then ranged broadly and allowed participation by all the providers and consumers of education and the elected representatives of the people before definitive conclusions were arrived at.  It is a negation of that pledge and understanding to introduce these Bills to the House in advance of that open and proper debate.</P>
    <P>I have said that technological education has been the poor relation in third level education.  In the context of the real challenge that we face to provide jobs for the 260,000 people who are unemployed at present and the projected 300,000 people who will be unemployed next year or the year after, if present trends continue, we must address this matter in a more open way than to present proposals and then have a debate.  That is a flawed approach and indeed the wrong one.  I appeal to the Minister, even if the debate on Second Stage concludes in advance of the publication of the Green Paper, to defer Committee Stage, when the provisions of the Bill will be discussed in detail, to allow adequate time to be made available for a discussion following the publication of the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>I have a number of concerns about the specifics of this legislation.  The umbrella organisation for vocational education is the IVEA.  That is the structure which brings together and synthesises the views of the democratically elected vocational education committees.  I am sure the Minister is aware that they have been very active in lobbying and in expressing their views on these two Bills.  They have produced very detailed documentation and a long list of amendments which they would like to see encompassed in the Bills.  Foremost among the issues of concern to them is centralisation under this legislation.  What is envisaged is not a freeing up of the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges to allow them to develop, expand and grow to meet their needs, according to their means and the wishes of the consumers of education, but <Col N="587" /> rather an attack on the democratic structures which are in place and which have served third level education so well during the past two decades; and the dead hand of the Department of Education reaching out to gain further control.</P>
    <P>Centralisation is a recurring theme in legislation which has passed through these Houses in recent months.  Members will recall the long debate on the Local Government Act to which I tabled on behalf of the Labour Party 164 amendments, two of which were eventually accepted but I fear both were rather minor and technical.  The underlying philosophy of that Bill was to interfere with local democratic structures and centre power in the Department of the Environment and in the person of the Minister for the Environment.  That philosophy is mirrored in this proposal before us today.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;subject to conditions to be determined by the Minister&rdquo; is like a mantra which recurs in virtually every section of the Bills.  Neither the Minister nor the Department of Education is the repository of all wisdom and it is time we trusted the democratic structures.  I am sick, sore and weary of lip service being paid to democracy and the concept of devolving powers and functions to the lowest possible level, the lovely principle which our European brethren call subsidiarity. This is the wonderful aspiration that we defy at every given opportunity. Rather than move to allow decentralisation and functions to be carried out at the lowest possible base consistent with efficiency, we do the opposite repeatedly in legislation.  That is what we seek to do in these Bills.</P>
    <P>The Government, and perhaps the civil servants who support them, have a fundamental fear of democracy particularly as it operates at ground level.  The notion of democratic accountability is a joke. We want to stifle the autonomy of local politicians to make any decisions.  It is a &ldquo;Catch 22&rdquo; situation because there are those who say we should not give powers to local authorities because we do not trust them or because some of them are not competent but, if we want to attract <Col N="588" /> people with talent into local government &mdash; we are blessed with a great number of them working at the coal face of local democracy &mdash; we should give them more functions and powers.  The erosion of powers in measures such as the ones currently before the House will drive people with talent out of local democracy.  Why would anyone stand for election for a local authority or seek election to a vocational education committee when their role is to be reduced to rubber stamping decisions of Government?</P>
    <P>The former Minister for the Environment said that I had a penchant for bringing up one issue, that is, the recurring tendency in virtually every Bill to give blanket powers to a Minister to deal with fundamental issues by way of statutory instruments.  That power is to be conferred in this Bill.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Local Government Bill the Minister for the Environment said that he was giving himself this power in that legislation but he had no intention of abusing or using it unless absolutely necessary.  Why do we need these safeguards if we trust local democracy?</P>
    <P>At the core of this Bill is a mistrust of the democratic structures at ground level and a determination to stifle any decisionmaking powers which are not immediately within the control of the bureaucracy in a Government Department and of the Minister directly responsible.  For that reason alone I oppose the Bills which will be yet another body-blow to those who are striving for an expansion of the role of local elected members at ground level.  They are now in despair as a result of the series of blows which they have already had and this new blow might prove fatal.</P>
    <P>The irony is that the counterbalance to this debate is the growing debate within the European Community for devolving powers.  As I said, the principle of subsidiarity is holy writ within the European Community, all our EC partners are working hard to give new powers to local communities at town, city and county levels throughout the Community.  We are building a Europe of the regions but <Col N="589" /> the Government here are terrified of it and want to have everything decided in Dublin by a corps of people who think they know best.  It underscores a frightening lack of trust in elected representatives.</P>
    <P>I want to ask a fundamental question which perhaps the Minister &mdash; or the Minister of State &mdash; will answer when responding to this debate.  What role is envisaged for vocational education committees in future?  The Minister may say that I am pre-empting the discussions on the Green Paper.  Unfortunately, I am forced into that by the publication in a pre-emptive fashion of these Bills in advance of a rational discussion.  There is a fear among many vocational education committees that their days are numbered and that this is just another chipping away of the powers and functions as a prelude to final abolition.  Will the Minister of State say categorically what he believes is the correct and future role of vocational education committees so that their members who have worked so hard, for decades in many instances, will know what is their future?  Many of them are already feeling under-valued even though they have given a lifetime of voluntary commitment.  For instance, the chairman of Wexford Vocational Education Committee, a Fianna Fáil colleague of the Minister of State, has 40 years' service in vocational education and is weary of the constant threats either to abolish his vocational education committee or to erode the powers of all vocational education committees to such an extent that it may no longer be worth his while to continue to serve at that level.  We must signal to those members that their work and efforts are valued and that they are important.  Instead of continued centralisation, I hope that the thrust of policy and legislation will be to devolve more powers and authority so that they could not only debate issues but make important decisions in relation to them.</P>
    <P>The IVEA raised an issue which has obviously caused great concern, the role of research and development.  There is again an ambivalence in relation to the <Col N="590" /> impact of this Bill in so far as research and development are concerned.  It is my wish that all colleges are allowed to carry on research and development, to develop new products, processes and practices and allowed to do so in-house for the benefit of the colleges so that there would be an organic link between industry, job creation and the technological third level sector.  Some efforts have been made to do that in recent years and I should like to know the Minister's position in that regard.  I want an assurance that the research in third level institutes and colleges will benefit the colleges and that, if they wanted to establish an industry in the college by way of a new invention, practice or process, they would have the resources, capacity and wherewithal to do so.  I hope that the Minister will clarify that issue and put fears at rest.</P>
    <P>Those working in education, particularly in third level education, have also expressed great concern in relation to this legislation.  The Teachers' Union of Ireland represent most of the teachers employed in the colleges and they have a number of concerns and fears.  Unfortunately, it seems that there was very inadequate consultation with the practitioners on the ground in advance of drafting this Bill, which was a mistake.  It runs counter to the promises and impression given by the former Minister for Education that we would move forward by way of consensus.</P>
    <P>I will raise one or two of the issues which I was requested to do by the Teachers' Union of Ireland.  No doubt, the details of their fears will be expressed by amendments on Committee Stage.  In section 11 (4) there is a reference to &ldquo;teaching assistantships&rdquo;.  That is a new phrase.  What does it mean?  What role will that category of employee have?  Will it be a teaching role?  It is not very clearly defined in the Bill.  There are obvious fears being engendered in relation to a new category of personnel which had not previously existed.  Perhaps, before Committee Stage, the Minister will clarify the matter.</P>
    <P>Another issue which has caused great concern &mdash; perhaps the Minister of State <Col N="591" /> will address it &mdash; is the question of the establishment of academic councils in each of the colleges concerned.  It is of fundamental importance that the staff representatives who will serve on these academic councils are democratically elected by the staff.  One would imagine that that would be taken for granted but it is not.  I hope the Minister will address this issue and ensure that such a basic principle of democracy will be enshrined in clear legislative terms in the Bill. Obviously, the single most important issue for the staff is their terms of employment. These Bills have raised a number of queries and fears in relation to future terms and conditions of employment of teachers in third level technological colleges. One fear is that there will not be uniformity of pay, conditions and standards. It is quite clear that some issues should be uniform and standard; it would be quite wrong for lecturers involved in the same business in two parallel colleges to be treated differently in terms of conditions of employment or remuneration. I hope that issue will be clarified because I am sure it is not the intention of the Minister or the Department to create a disparity in the way staff members are treated in one college as against another.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to raise one other issue in relation to the whole question of pay and conditions.  I want to signal to the Minister the reluctance of any association to depart from the principle of collective agreement.  Section 12 of the Bill refers to consultation with staff associations and trade unions.  There is in place clearly defined procedures that should not be altered in any way.  I hope that the question of the way colleges deal with staff members will be treated very sensitively and sensibly by the Minister and the Department.  I will conclude in relation to staff matters because my colleague, Deputy O'Shea, will deal in some detail with the concerns of the TUI by way of specific amendments on Committee Stage.  I hope there will be adequate time to tease out those amendments and to allay all fears before the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> I said some time ago that there are two fundamental issues that underscore the fears of the IVEA in relation to these measures.  The first I dealt with at some length, that is the clear centralisation of functions that will result from this Bill. The other is important for all of us who live outside Dublin, that is the principle of regionalisation.  The decision of 21 or 22 years ago to establish regional technical colleges mirrored the scattering of vocational education committees around the country.  They were not called national technical colleges; they were called regional technical colleges because they were to serve the needs of the regions in which they were sited, and they have done that very successfully.  I am very anxious that the principle of regionalisation, serving in a real sense the region in which the colleges are located, is preserved; but I fear that it will be struck down by the enactment of these Bills.</P>
    <P>There was an erosion &mdash; I support this erosion &mdash; of the principle of regionalisation last year when central applications were accepted.  Unfortunately, I see no way around that.  Sometimes an applicant in one college has very high points but is unable to get into a particular course while a parallel course in another college accepts fewer points.  There was need for balancing there and I do not take issue with the central applications procedure. Unfortunately, it was necessary in order to be fair to all applicants who wanted a place at third level in the technological area.  It is grossly unfortunate that, due to the inadequate provision of third level places, there is mad competition and a mad scramble by our young people to attain points.  For many young people who reach leaving certificate it is as if a horrible sentence is passed upon them in that they feel they have to prove themselves.  It is not acceptable that young people at the age of 17 or 18 years of age are faced with such pressure. Their whole lives are determined by how they perform in a three week period in June and the whole focus of their education is on those three weeks. Such pressure on young people is <Col N="593" /> nothing short of cruel and we not only accept it but allow it to continue.</P>
    <P>There is only one solution, and it is very clear and straightforward, that we provide adequate third level places for all those who are able to benefit from it and wish to avail of it.  That is a simple principle.  I know there are huge resource implications involved, but education will be the political and social focus of our country for the next ten years and if we are to create employment and provide a future for our country and our people we should ensure that those resources are provided.</P>
    <P>In the absence, certainly in the short term, of adequate third level places for all who wish to avail of it we certainly need to improve the machinery that currently exists for access to all third level colleges across the sector.  Accepting that there is erosion of the principle of regionalisation I am certainly anxious that there be no further erosion.  The colleges have in the last 20 years kept a close organic link with the communities they have served.  They are linked with industry and with the geography, history and outlook of the areas they serve.  I am fundamentally of the belief that that link should be preserved and I am equally of the opinion that that link is threatened by the provisions in these Bills.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the blanket powers the Minister is given in these Bills.  For instance, in the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill the Minister takes unto himself the power to cease provision of any course he sees fit.  How can you talk to colleges about autonomy when at the stroke of a pen the Minister can determine what courses can be run?  That is a negation of democracy and autonomy at local level and, for that reason, I find it bizarre, extreme and unacceptable.  That simply underscores the rationale behind the Bills.  It is a clinging yet again by the Minister to powers to which he has no right.  I hope that philosophy can be defeated in this House and that we can trust people to make decisions that affect their lives without deciding everything centrally here.</P>
    <P>I want to move to a more domestic <Col N="594" /> vein, to talk about my own constituency in relation to these Bills.  I am particularly interested in the education participation rate of my county.  Unfortunately, I cannot come before this House and say that it is a rate of which I am proud.  The Clancy report on participation rates in third level education shows that Wexford is well below the average.  In fact it has the third lowest rate of participation in third level education in the country. There are reasons for that, the prime one being that we have no third level institute.  That is a major factor.  The correlation between the location of a college and the participation rates from that county is evident.  Unfortunately, Wexford as a county has repeatedly lost out by way of regional structures.  That is the geographical fall out from being on the periphery.  When you are in the south east corner it is difficult to be the centre of a region.</P>
    <P>There are 102,000 people resident in the county.  We had hoped that we could develop third level colleges or at least third level courses to serve that population and boost the dreadfully poor participation rate in third level education. There is unfortunately a link between that statistic, that is the low rate of participation in third level education, and another statistic which is equally harrowing for me to admit to this House, that we have the second highest rate of unemployment in Ireland.  That will come as a surprise to many people who regard Wexford as a model county with the best of agricultural land and a tradition of industry.  Wexford also is a good location <i>vis-à-vis</i> markets in Europe and the UK. Yet we have this appalling problem of unemployment, which is not unlinked to the statistic of our low participation rate in third level education.  Industry is attracted to sites near third level institutes.  We are greatly disadvantaged by the lack of such a facility in our county.</P>
    <P>I understand that 12 per cent of the national age cohort participate in third level education, but the rate for Wexford is 7.5 per cent, which is disastrously below the national average.  In Wexford we have sought by every means possible <Col N="595" /> to address that disadvantage.  Indeed, the two nearest regional technical colleges, Waterford and Carlow, have been of great help to the town of Wexford Vocational Education Committee in developing a third level degree course. This was offered to students last September and is the start of a number of satellite courses that we have looked for in the absence of a third level college. The Department of Education should support, commend and resource such courses.  It should be a fundamental policy and principle to provide third level courses in counties which are not directly served by a third level college.  This would boost participation rates in third level education.</P>
    <P>The south east is now, with the establishment of the University of Limerick, the only region that does not have a university. There is a natural pull between the university and its hinterland.  Not only do the south east counties not have a Minister or a Minister of State, we do not have a university either&mdash;I am not saying that one necessarily follows on from the other.  It is important that there is a regional balance in the provision of third level educational facilities and I regret that we are so disadvantaged in the south east.</P>
    <P>I hope the basic first step taken by the Town of Wexford Vocational Education Committee will not be a once off course but that Department of Education policy will allow further development of third level degree courses.  I commend the chairman and members of the Town of Wexford Vocational Education Committee for initiating this course and the Waterford Regional Technical College for their help and participation in its establishment.</P>
    <P>Technology is changing our lives. There is no reason that we need huge buildings or edifices costing tens of millions of pounds to provide third level courses.  Technology allows us to decentralise the provisions of third level education. I hope that this first step will grow into a procedure that will dramatically change the disastrous participation rate, <Col N="596" /> indicated in the Clancy report, in third level education in the county.  The Minister or Minister of State should signal that the Department will do everything possible to encourage satellite courses.</P>
    <P>The philosophy underscoring third level education should have many strands.  It should be based on democratic accountability and openness and should be geared to facilitate all young people and students who want to partake in it and take advantage of it.  There should be open access to third level education which should be resourced adequately even if we have to channel resources from other sectors of the economy into it.  The location of third level facilities should have a geographical spread that rights the terrible imbalances that the Clancy report, in particular, has highlighted.  The Minister should deal with these issues when responding to the debate.</P>
    <P>I have much more to say on the Bills and on education in general but I will restrain myself because I have spoken for a long time.  The IVEA have set out their views on these Bills.  They regard these Bills as doing four things which they find unacceptable: first, they provide centralised control over the colleges; second, they diminish public accountability; third, they duplicate existing administrative services; and fourth, they create imaginary links with local democratic structures.  These imaginary links give a veneer of democratic accountability but have no substance in reality.  While I am on the subject of the IVEA's representations to the Department I will pose a question which may be answered later &mdash; I hope somebody is taking note in the Minister's absence or perhaps the Minister of State will respond to it.  In an open letter to Members, the IVEA say that in March 1985 the IVEA and the Association of Vocational Education Colleges made a detailed submission to the Department of Education on autonomous management structures in the colleges and received no reply.  Is that true? If it is true, it is shameful.  They say also that in November 1982 the Association of Vocational Education Colleges made a detailed submission to the Department <Col N="597" /> of Education proposing a legal framework for colleges to engage in research and consultancy, but again they received no reply.  If the allegations in this well published statement are true it underscores the contempt for those bodies in the Department at some level, whether political or administrative, gives expression to their belief that all wisdom lies in Marlborough Street or in the new satellites for that Department in Athlone.  That is fundamentally wrong.</P>
    <P>The principle of democratic accountability is negated by these Bills.  This should be resisted.  The principle of regionalisation, which should be to the forefront of our thinking on this and every other issue, is negated.  This is unfortunate and unacceptable and it is a signal that the work of the vocational education committees is not appreciated and that members, after two decades of services, should not bother any longer. Basically, that is what members of the vocational education committees on the ground have been telling me about the Department's attitude.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have outlined and the unfortunate timing of these Bills in advance of a proper, open, structured and all embracing debate on education which would follow on the publication of the Green Paper, the Labour Party will be opposing these Bills on Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to welcome the new Minister, in his absence, and wish him every success in his portfolio.  I hope he does not see his appointment as a reward for services rendered.</P>
      <P>Education is one of the most important Ministries in Government.  The role of education is vital if we are to succeed in breaking the spiralling tide of growing unemployment.  In paying tribute to the outgoing Minister, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, I acknowledge all her work in the field of education.  I have no doubt that she always meant well, even though we did not agree always with some of her proposals.  I will appreciate always the personal interest she took in disadvantaged and handicapped children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" /> When I brought particular instances to her notice she took a personal interest in getting problems resolved.  That will always be remembered.</P>
    <P>I must first say that I am amazed that the Bill is before the House at this time. Quite simply, the Government are again putting the cart before the horse.  We have been promised a Green Paper on all aspects of education that is due to be published next month, yet, lo and behold, the Government come along with a Bill dealing with one specific section of education.</P>
    <P>Vocational education committees and regional technical colleges are the real success story of education.  Regional technical colleges brought education to rural Ireland.  Why are the Government meddling with that outstanding success story?  The only reason for that goes back to a failure of Fianna Fáil Governments from the foundation of this State.  Fianna Fáil Governments could never stop themselves from meddling in success stories. I shall go back to the mid-fifties for an example of that.  When the Marshall aid money came into Ireland after the war the Inter-Party Government of the time and its Minister for Agriculture, the late James Dillon, decided to spend the money on agricultural development and land reclamation to bring our farmers to the forefront of European agricultural production.  That marvellous scheme got off the ground, the Inter-Party Government were removed from office, then successive Fianna Fáil Governments did not stop until they had whittled away that outstanding scheme which would have done so much for this country.  We would have reaped rich benefits from that scheme on entry to the EC in 1973; our farmers would have been to the foremost in the Community and our whole economy would have benefited.  That opportunity was lost because successive Fianna Fáil Governments could not see further than their noses and dismantled that good scheme.</P>
    <P>Today we are discussing a Bill that sets out, in a different way, to do the same thing.  What is wrong with the present system of vocational education?  What is <Col N="599" /> wrong with regional colleges at present that it is deemed so necessary to rush the Bill through the Dáil and make a change? Is it change for the sake of change?  Is it change because somebody in Marlborough Street decided the regional colleges were getting too far ahead of themselves or too powerful?</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to this issue, and I should like to know whether the people who put this Bill on the Minister's desk are the same people who brought the C level to leaving certificate maths?  C level maths is of no benefit to our children.  How many Deputies know, even the Minister &mdash; because it is only now emerging and becoming known to parents and secondary school students &mdash; that students studying C level maths for the 1992 leaving certificate are being refused entry to a great many courses in third level publicly funded institutions?  What is especially galling are the refusals of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges to accept C level maths as a minimum entry requirement.  In the name of God, and all that is commonsense in education, would somebody tell me what was the benefit in introducing a C level in maths when that will get a child nowhere?  That level of maths was introduced last year in the intermediate certificate examination.  For many children maths is a difficult subject and I have met parents of children who opted for the soft choice and took C level maths rather than A level or B level. Those children are now going into their leaving year, unaware &mdash; because it has never been spelt out for them &mdash; that C level maths will not gain them entry to regional technical colleges or the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I do not understand the thinking behind the introduction of C level maths for the leaving certificate.  When a child, his or her teacher and his or her parents felt that that child was not able for honours maths then the child could be nursed through with encouragement and grinds to pass maths and gain entry to third level institutions. For God's sake, if the people <Col N="600" /> who brought in the C level to the maths grades are the same people who are advising the Minister on this Bill then the sooner the Bill is put through the shredder the better.</P>
    <P>I am not paying lip service to the vocational education system; I am an avid supporter of it.  As I have said here before, there are many people who would seek membership of various vocational education committees as a local platform but who would not themselves send their children to vocational schools.  My children attend a vocational school and I am proud to state that I am chairman of the Cavan Vocational Education Committee parents' committee, who are a marvellous group.</P>
    <P>Through the hard work of the rank and file members of the Cavan Vocational Education Committee a third level of education was set up in Cavan town, the College of Further Studies.  That college is one of the outstanding success stories of the vocational system.  In a short few years it blossomed to an extent that I certainly did not expect to witness.  We have children coming from Galway, Limerick, Cork and Dublin, finding digs in and around Cavan town and attending the third level college.  Why is the college so good?  It is because the college was established by people who had their feet on the ground and who understood what was needed at this point in the development of our country.  Children leaving that school are fully qualified and are in high demand from offices and businesses all over the country.  The standard of education reached with computers and modern office technology puts them in demand nationally and outside this country. Those children have no difficulty in gaining employment.</P>
    <P>Coupled with that course, the school has now introduced a pre-nursing course, which is an excellent introductory programme for young girls who feel that they might like to take up nursing as a career. They can attend a 12 month course at the College of Further Studies in Cavan and gain a feel for nursing and an important introduction to that career.  They can then be placed in various hospitals both <Col N="601" /> within and outside Ireland.  All that has come about through the very basis of education, the very basis of democracy &mdash; the people who are elected at local government elections who are then nominated to vocational education committees. These people in turn have the opportunity to bring on to those committees people from outside the political field whom they feel have expertise and could help in the development of the educational system.  That is a marvellous success story and one of which we should be proud.  I shall not stand idly by that success story and see it tampered with by people who are obviously far removed from the needs of the young people of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be parochial, but I found when I arrived here in Dublin that, if I did not voice the problems from my end of the country, they seemed to be ignored.  We will continue to fight for our rights.  Before the regional technical colleges were set up in my region of Cavan-Monaghan and further afield &mdash; and Deputy Reynolds is beside me and will be able to speak for that region &mdash; the universities were far removed and provided education to which our young children could never aspire.  With the vocational education system a third level of education was feasible and possible.</P>
    <P>The regional technical colleges in Dundalk and Sligo are outstanding.  I have heard Members pay tribute to the Hotel Training and Catering College in Killybegs attended by many young people from my area who wish to be educated in the proper presentation of food.  That college contributes to the development of tourism, a very important and expanding industry.  Those young people leaving Killybegs College are well qualified to take over the management of small and large guesthouses, hotels and, in many cases, to go back to their home towns to develop their own businesses, looking after and catering for tourists in the manner they might expect in this day and age and providing them with the requisite facilities and services.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister improve that <Col N="602" /> system through the provisions of this Bill?  The opportunities exist already. The education system is in place.  There are still some of our people who believe that the technical and vocational schools are for a certain sector of our society; but, thank God, that belief is fast disappearing. While such schools were established for the purpose of providing various technical courses, parents of students in the middle income group and upwards foresaw that many of their children would benefit from attendance at those schools in that they provided, with academic courses, a wide range of subjects not available in universities at that time.  I maintain that the vocational education system set the standard, led the field.  Universities that heretofore frowned on technical subjects such as carpentry, metalwork and mechanical drawing discovered that if they were to retain their quota of students they would have to provide courses in those subjects. There was nothing wrong with that.  That is competition, the spice of life, one system of education competing with the other and both constantly improving.</P>
    <P>As I see it, that was the benefit of the vocational system.  To interfere with that system in any way will, I predict, do untold harm.  It is entirely unnecessary and will detract from the efforts of people who have given a lifetime of service on vocational education committees and will take away their voluntary initiative of attending monthly and fortnightly meetings as the need arose.  With the vocational education committees there was a committee on the ground that monitored the system ensuring that, whenever and wherever problems arose in any of their schools, they were quickly ironed out.  They were the people on the ground who understood and appreciated the needs of the people in their respective regions.  It would be disastrous to take away that initiative or control, or add another layer of bureaucracy to it, just because somebody in Marlborough Street says: &ldquo;We need to change the system&rdquo;.  If such were the case one might well ask why should those vocational education committees continue to meet, why <Col N="603" /> should they continue to take responsibility for courses in those schools since they will no longer have any say.</P>
    <P>I contend that the provisions of this Bill will take from such committees the educational facilities they generated through their hard work.  One cannot overemphasise the importance of a committee having a say in the affairs they administer.  I have received representations from a large number of vocational education committees, all unanimous, that the provisions of this Bill will do them untold harm.  The Minister will be well aware that those committees are comprised of the various shades of political thought and opinion here, but they are unanimous in their total opposition to the changes the Minister proposes.  In my local authority, Cavan County Council, standing orders were suspended so that the chairman of the local vocational education committee and one member could publicly voice their disapproval, calling on me as a Member of Dáil Éireann to speak out solidly against the present proposals. That has been the general trend nation-wide.</P>
    <P>I have listened to contributions from Fianna Fáil backbench Deputies.  I admire them for having come into the House to express their opposition.  It is good at long last to see democracy awakening on that side of the House, with people not afraid to come into the House and say what they think, clearly demonstrating that they are not being muzzled or told to toe the line.  These proposals are wrong and cannot be allowed to be implemented.  I appeal to the new Minister, for heaven's sake, to leave well enough alone.</P>
    <P>There are two additional points I want to make in regard to third level education being available in Northern Ireland &mdash; a point made by some Members &mdash; and that such should be recognised.  I go along with those sentiments.  I do not want to be misunderstood in this respect because it is something to which I have given much thought.  Where courses are not available, say, in Letterkenny, Sligo, in <Col N="604" /> the third level centre in Cavan town or indeed in Dundalk but are available in Northern Ireland &mdash; for example, at colleges for further studies in Derry &mdash; they should be recognised here, grant-aided and assistance given to parents of students wanting to attend them.  I believe there are a number of children opting to attend courses there.  Of course, such courses may be available in Bolton Street College of Technology in Dublin, a college for which I have a very high regard, but Dublin is far removed from the Border regions.  We must remember that there will be a large cost saving for children who can travel across the Border to, say, Enniskillen or Derry and attend such courses nearer them.  I should stress that the standard of education obtaining at Bolton Street College of Technology is second to none, not only within the country or Europe but worldwide, with the qualifications of young people who take diploma courses and degrees there sought by manufacturers worldwide.  Of course, students in my area would like to have such courses available closer to them in the Border region.  However, I appreciate that all of these colleges cannot be located at everybody's back door.  Nonetheless, if they are available in Northern Ireland and are within bounds for students in Border regions, I would ask the Minister to recognise such courses and have them grant-aided.</P>

      <P>Another aspect of education sponsored by the vocational education committees was adult education. The various courses run by them are attended by many people in part-time employment, those who unfortunately find themselves out of employment, and housewives whose families may have grown up and are keen to participate in a course, not necessarily with a view to resuming employment but to pursue a subject they feel they might have liked to have studied in their youth.  The vocational education committees throughout the length and breadth of this country sponsor such adult education <Col N="605" /> courses.  Some people follow full-time FÁS courses.  Others attend part-time or evening classes.  In my constituency the two vocational education committees of Cavan and Monaghan find the demand for such courses is greater than can be catered for.  If those vocational education committees did not exist, if that system of education was not in place, who would sponsor such courses and who would have run them for people in rural areas? Would somebody from Marlborough Street?  Of course they would not and, even if they did, the cost would have been astronomical, whereas the same courses laid on in the vocational education committee colleges are provided at a reasonable cost.  Teachers, some of whom work in vocational schools, come back in the evenings.  People in business and industry who have particular skills are prepared to offer their services to the vocational education committee for a nominal fee in order to give people in the community an insight into drawing, painting, languages, needlework, horticulture and so on.  The list extends every year.  These courses provide relaxation for people who may be tied to the house during the day.  Those who are unemployed may acquire new skills which will help them to gain jobs. All this is part of the work of the vocational education committees whom the Minister intends to cover with this blanket of bureaucracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within our educational system there is far too much emphasis on gaining the points required for entry into third level colleges.  The leaving certificate is a nerve racking experience for children, parents and teachers.  There must be some other system.  Children should not be judged simply on the points they gain.  The child who does only moderately well may be wiser in the ways of the world than the child who is academically brilliant.  It is great to be able to achieve seven, eight or nine honours but we should not denigrate a young person who might be very capable in other areas.  Entry to veterinary college requires 27 or 28 points, which is the equivalent to seven or eight honours in the leaving certificate, <Col N="606" /> yet the academically minded person capable of gaining entry might not know a cow on the road and would not have the interest.  Another young person might be very interested in farming, with a keen interest in animals and so on, and might be highly suitable to practise as a general veterinary practitioner.  Without the required number of points that young person cannot gain entry to a veterinary college.</P>
    <P>The people in Marlborough Street say that only people who have 28 points can follow that course, whether or not they are suited to it.  Of course, there is need for the academically minded person in that field.  Administration is an important aspect of veterinary medicine.  It has been shown at the beef tribunal that people have not been properly diligent.  A young boy or girl wise to the ways of the world might have been more suitably qualified to deal with people who were trying to change various veterinary stamps. Natural aptitude should be assessed by way of interview when young people apply for courses in veterinary medicine, nursing and other specialised jobs where their personal qualities may be more important than academic ability.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to centralised control of the colleges, diminished public accountability, the duplication of existing services and imaginary links with local democratic structures.  I commend to the Minister the comments which have been made by a wide range of Deputies in the course of this debate.  Perhaps it is time to drop the Bill and move on to more important matters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has caused a lot of discussion. The regional technical colleges have played a very important role in the development of education over the years. The Bill is in line with Fine Gael policy <Col N="607" /> on the strengthening and development of regional technical colleges.  They have developed under successive Fine Gael Ministers for Education since Richard Burke in 1973.  His concerns and ideas were developed by Deputy Peter Barry and former Deputies John Boland, Gemma Hussey and Patrick Cooney.</P>
    <P>The principles incorporated into this Bill have been advocated by a number of independent committees.  In more recent times these include the NESC report of 1984 produced under the chairmanship of Miriam Hederman O'Brien, the NBST report of 1984 and the International Study Group report produced under the chairmanship of Dr. Tom Hardiman, on foot of which the University of Limerick and Dublin City University were established. It is not often realised that this committee made equally radical proposals for the regional technical colleges and that the Minister has been tardy in bringing forth legislation.  The universities were established in June 1989 within six months of the report's publication. If we have a Minister who is inclined towards progress, this House can pass legislation of benefit to the general public.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the regional technical colleges participated in the CAO-CAS common applications system with the universities.  Final offers were made on 25 October and statistics on student entry to third level in autumn 1991 will soon be available.  These will be the first national figures allowing for direct comparisons to be drawn between the higher education institutions.  There is little doubt that the data for the regional technical colleges will surprise many.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael welcome the principles clearly established in this Bill, that regional technical colleges have a dual role in teaching and research.  Where the research programmes of regional technical colleges focus on the needs of their region they will contribute powerfully to regional development.  Fine Gael also welcome the clarification in the Bill that regional technical colleges may provide courses for certificates, diplomas <Col N="608" /> and degrees.  It is very important that regional technical colleges be given the recognition to which they are entitled. During the past 20 years education has been geared towards academic qualifications. This was a good thing, but the country has progressed and we may have placed too little emphasis on technical education.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Boylan and a number of other speakers said, it is becoming increasingly difficult for students to gain admission to universities because of the high academic qualifications required.  In some cases students need seven and eight honours of A and B grade in the leaving certificate in order to gain entry to university. This puts undue pressure on second level students.  Over the past number of years more and more pressure has been put on students to attain high grades in their leaving certificate.  This is not a good development.  While I accept that we need to develop our educational system, we should also consider changing some aspects of it.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the management structures within businesses.  The upper management level of companies is usually made up of highly qualified individuals while those at the lower levels may have left second level education having attained their intermediate certificate. Because of the way our educational system is structured, the middle management level is causing problems for many businesses.  It is essential that technical skills are given the priority they deserve.  This training can be given by regional technical colleges.  I cannot help thinking that our educational system produces too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  People who are successful at second level education normally progress to third level education so that they can attain higher qualifications.  Unfortunately many of these people, particularly university graduates, have to emigrate because of the lack of employment opportunities here.  This difficulty has been caused to some extent by our educational system which is not properly focused.  Even though there are many opportunities in the technical area in <Col N="609" /> middle management, it is unfortunate that people with university qualifications usually regard it as a backward step to take up such jobs.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a number of proposals in the Bill.  While teachers and lecturers are an important component of the educational system, the most important component is the student body.  The number of students attending regional technical colleges increased from 6,500 in 1980 to 20,000 in 1990.  I believe this increase has been due to people's realisation of the need to have further educational qualifications in order to attain employment.  The student body is the most significant part of regional technical colleges.  Most students enter third level education at 17 or 18 years of age; in my case it was 16½ years.  Many of these students who are living away from home for the first time have hard decisions to make.  It is extremely important that they are adequately represented on the governing bodies of colleges.  The Bill proposes that there should be one student representative on the governing body of a regional technical college.  If this representation was increased to two, students might not feel so intimidated in raising issues which affect them.  I believe Fine Gael propose putting down an amendment in this respect on Committee Stage.  This will be of benefit to the students who are the most important cog in the wheel of third level education.</P>
    <P>The outgoing Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, said she would like to see greater links between colleges and industry in terms of research.  It is extremely important that these links be maintained and expanded so that students have a better chance of being taken on by firms when they graduate.  It is vital that this aspect is made a priority of Government.  Over the past ten years regional technical colleges have undertaken research projects.  In the early days questions were raised by auditors as to whether college resources could be used for research.  Staff will go stale, and their knowledge base will cease to be up to date and relevant unless they renew <Col N="610" /> themselves professionally.  It is internationally recognised that the undertaking of research by third level colleges is the most potent mechanism of professional renewal for any lecturer.</P>
    <P>The 1986 Barriers report by Dr. Jim Fitzpatrick was a landmark.  The steering committee for that report were carefully drawn from a wide spectrum of persons, each with significant experience of research at home and abroad.  The report presented a painstakingly detailed amount of barriers to research and consultancy in college.  It identified variations of practice between some vocational education committees towards research in colleges.  For example, some vocational education committees were very helpful while others were obstructive.  The report noted that perceived barriers could be as powerful inhibitors as real barriers.  Thus Fine Gael welcome the clear and unequivocal principle in the Bill that research will be part of the mission of regional technical colleges.  This is a very important step forward for regional colleges and should be given all the financial and moral support needed.</P>
    <P>Like many other regional technical colleges, the Regional Technical College in Sligo in my constituency has been a great success.  It has given third level education to people from the surrounding regions.  However, regional technical colleges should be allowed to run degree courses so that they are not regarded as institutions to which people go because they cannot gain entry to university.  This Bill goes a long way towards achieving that and is extremely important.</P>

      <P>Self-employed persons became insured under the social insurance system for pension purposes with effect from 6 April 1988, the commencement of the 1988-89 contribution year.  Contributions at the class S rate are payable by this group and provide cover for Old Age (Contributory) and Widow's and Orphans Pensions.</P>
      <P>One of the contribution conditions to qualify for a widow's contributory pension is that contributions must have been paid in respect of at least 156 contribution weeks between the late husband's date of entry into insurance and the date of his death.</P>
      <P>A person who commenced paying self-employment contributions from April 1988 would have contributions paid in respect of 156 contribution weeks by 6 April 1991 and, accordingly, would have built up a title to contributory widow's pension based solely on those contributions. Any employee contributions reckonable for widow's contributory pension purposes may be combined with self-employment contributions when determining entitlement to pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to cases in which the self-employed contributor has died prior to the end of the third contribution year and widow's contributory pension could not be awarded as the 156 paid contributions condition had not been satisfied.  This is due to the fact that contributions paid in respect of periods after the husband died are not <Col N="612" /> reckonable under the legislation for the purposes of widow's pensions.</P>

When this scheme, under which widows of the self employed become eligible for widow's pension after three years contributions was introduced, the payments had to be made in November.  Is it not being scrooge-like, if the husband had paid the three years's contribution in the November before he died, for the Department to say the widow cannot benefit until April? Considering that there are only about 70 widows in this position will the Minister, as an act of magnanimity on his first day in the Dáil as Minister for Social Welfare, have a serious look at their position?</P>

I am not clear as to what the Deputy has in mind in the question.  There was some confusion because some persons thought that after the husband died they could continue to contribute and in this way become eligible.  Certainly, a number of widows were under the impression that if they paid the balance of the contributions after the husband died this would entitle them to benefit.  This mistaken impression was conveyed by some farm organisations also.  If the Deputy wishes to give me particulars of the cases he has in mind I will certainly have them examined very closely.</P>

      <P>The means test criteria are broadly similar for all social welfare schemes although there are variations in the manner in which some of the components, principally capital and income from earnings, are assessed.  For example, the rules of means assessment in the case of widows, lone parents and the elderly are generally more favourable.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of progress has been made in informing social welfare recipients about the means test.  The information leaflets on each of the schemes administered by the Department have been revised.  These leaflets contain detailed information in relation to each scheme, including comprehensive information on the means assessment provisions.</P>
      <P>Under the arrangements for localisation of the services of my Department, the objective is to allow for the service to be co-ordinated to that duplication of procedures such as means tests for unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance can be eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No question of creating a deterrent to employment arises in relation to social welfare means-tested schemes.  In this regard particular employment incentives are provided under the lone parents allowance scheme.  If a lone parent takes up employment £312 a year of the earnings of this lone parent is disregarded in respect of each child.  Reasonable allowance is also made for child-minding and <Col N="614" /> travelling expenses incurred by taking up a job.</P>
    <P>The application of a single means test for all social welfare schemes would have significant costs.  In line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Programme for Government, however, the meanstesting arrangements will be kept under review with a view to their further simplification as resources permit.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Will the Minister agree that, while it might appear initially that one means test would cost money, the present system whereby county councils, health boards and the Department of Social Welfare carry out means tests, must be the most expensive system of all?  Will the Minister accept that one system of means testing could cover all schemes thus avoiding the necessity for three people to carry out tests?  We must bear in mind the long delay between visits by social welfare officers and receipt of their reports.  Far from being expensive it would save the nation much expense and frustration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Deputy's view on this matter.  First, rationalisation, in some cases, may involve modifying some of the concessionary features of the means tests which apply to some of these schemes, otherwise it may become very expensive.  Second, rationalisation may require easing the more restrictive features of certain schemes. Each applicant has individual needs and considerations which have to be taken into account.  It is not easy to draw up a broad system of dealing with matters because, in certain cases, the particular circumstances of the person have to be taken into account.  An overall system may not be the most advantageous in individual cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Social insurance contributions are already related to ability to pay.  They are charged at a rate of 5.5 per cent of income, up to the ceiling.  This means that high earners pay higher contributions than the low-paid.  Furthermore, those earning £60 per week or less do not have to pay contributions; this eases the impact of contributions on the low-paid although it creates a small poverty trap at the £60 per week threshold.</P>
      <P>The review of the Programme for Government contains a commitment to restructuring employee PRSI, with the health and employment levies, on an Exchequer neutral basis, so as to make it more progressive and to consolidate it into a single main rate close to 6 per cent.

Would the Minister not agree that it is rather outrageous and ludicrous that a person earning £60 per week is exempt from paying PRSI, while a person in receipt of £61 per week pays £3.10, so that the person getting an increase of £1 is losing £2.10; hence the poverty trap?  Would the Minister not agree that the exemption should be on the first £60 of all earners and then everything should be taxed after that?</P>

It has already been the subject of some discussion at official level between my Department and the Department of Finance.  A comparison is often made between PRSI and income tax but there is a difference because people who pay PRSI have an automatic entitlement to certain benefits and pensions.  I appreciate the point made by the Deputy and it is something that we have already identified as being an area that needs some attention.  In the context of the budget and the review we will endeavour to see what progress we can make.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the review of the Programme for Government, one of the specific objectives of the Government <Col N="617" /> is the review of social welfare rates with the aim of providing greater equity between recipients, and families in particular, who are in similar circumstances. This process, as the House will appreciate, is a continuing and evolving one.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made over the past few years in improving and steamlining the basic rates of social welfare payments.  All long-term assistance payments, including non-contributory old age pension, long term unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance, lone parent's allowance and single women's allowance now have a uniform weekly rate of £55.  This rate exceeds the Commission on Social Welfare's priority rate which is £54.60 in 1991 terms.</P>
      <P>Short-term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance were increased last July to a uniform weekly rate of £50.  This was a major step towards achieving the commission's priority rate for these short-term payments by 1993, in line with the Government's commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>Recent research has indicated that large families in particular need support from the social welfare system.  In this regard, child income support has been improved substantially.  In the last three years the number of child dependant allowance rates has been streamlined from 36 to three rates.  As well as general increases in line with inflation, the minimum child dependent allowance has been increased to £12, representing a 100 per cent increase on the 1987 rate.  Child benefit has been increased to £22.90 for the fourth and subsequent child and the family income supplement &mdash; which supports families on low incomes &mdash; has been improved, thus ensuring that those who are working for low wages are not worse off than if they were unemployed.</P>

    <P>As I already said, the process of review of the social welfare system is a continuing one.  In formulating further proposals for reform I will take account of the recommendations of the Commission <Col N="618" /> on Social Welfare and of the Government's commitments under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the review of the Programme for Government.  I can assure the House that any measures which can be taken to reform and develop the social welfare system, within the financial constraints which exist, will be taken.</P>

      <P>I, like other Members, welcome the Minister to his new portfolio. Will the Minister give a commitment that when the review is completed he will not, like his predecessor, review the rates, applicable to co-habiting couples downwards? Does the Minister agree that the review should upgrade the low rates? Does the Minister acknowledge that there is a great variation between the rates for single men and single women varying from £40 to £64 along with variations for adult dependants from £28 to £37 and that when one comes then to child dependants there are variations from £12 to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In my short time in the Department I saw at first hand the number of schemes and their variety and complexity.  The general intention is to review upwards rather than downwards.  While there may be a case for rationalisation, it will certainly not be in the best interests of people to rationalise payments downwards.  A commitment has been given under the <Col N="619" /><i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in this regard.  I will closely examine the system and during my term of office here I hope to be able to implement a system of rationalisation of schemes without reducing payments to people who are in need.</P>

Lest the Minister might have thought I was being frivolous about equalisation between insured workers and those in receipt of State assistance, is the Minister aware that even at present unemployment benefit, which is running at £50 to an insured worker is £55 to those on long-term unemployment assistance?  Those who are on assistance are getting £5 more than those who are on unemployment benefit who have been insured during their working lives.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department are currently implementing a new regional management structure.  Eight regions, each composing a number of counties, have been set up.  In general, the regional boundaries coincide with county boundaries and also with the boundaries of health board and FÁS regions.</P>
      <P>At this early stage of implementation the arrangments have to take account of available resources such as accommodation, staffing and computer support. As new payment arrangements are introduced for the unemployed, the various constraints are expected to ease and opportunities for refining and improving the regional boundaries will become available.</P>
      <P>The new arrangments represent an improvement over the old position.  I accept, however, that where circumstances permit county boundaries should be maintained.  The position in this area will be reviewed on a priority basis when the improved payment facilities for the unemployed are established in Limerick county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are at present reorganising the areas.  We are endeavouring to keep the county boundaries.  There are areas <Col N="621" /> where there will be an overlap but, when we get the system fully in place, we will be able to deal with these initial difficulties.</P>

      <P>On a previous occasion I met senior members of the Department of Social Welfare in relation to the difficulties prevailing in west Limerick.  At that stage they assured me that rationalisation was taking place.  I understand from a recent circular from the Minister that that rationalisation is currently taking place.  I am concerned about the Abbeyfeale and Mount Collins area.  I am sure the Minister himself would be concerned that that area should remain within the ambit of Newcastle West and should not be referred to Listowel Employment Exchange, which I am concerned may happen.  In Newcastle West there is a modern building, built six years ago, which has been upgraded recently in the context of staffing.  Newcastle West is capable with the resources, computer facilities etc., to retain the people in that area.  I would appeal to the Minister to give me an assurance that Newcastle West will be the first choice of location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy an assurance that the long term aim is to have all of west Limerick serviced by Newcastle West.  After consultations between the regional managers in Limerick and Cork and the staff of the two regions concerned it was decided to leave the electoral division of Mount Collins to be serviced by the employment exchange in Newcastle West and to transfer the investigatory work which was to be done by an officer in Tralee to an officer in Newcastle West.  It is also proposed to transfer all the work in the Cahir electoral <Col N="622" /> division to Newcastle West.  That resolves the problems in those areas.</P>
      <P>The other electoral divisions of Port, Dromtrasna and Abbeyfeale will remain in the Listowel catchment area.  It includes the town of Abbeyfeale and has a claim load of 340 between unemployment assistance and benefit.  This is a sizeable claim load and would stretch the busy office further.  It would also have staffing implications.</P>
      <P>To avoid confusion, investigation work is being transferred from Newcastle West to Listowel.  Abbeyfeale, if anything, is marginally closer to Listowel.  The Deputy could advise me about that as he knows the area better than I do.</P>
      <P>The long term aim is that all of west Limerick would be serviced from Newcastle West and we have had some discussions at regional level to see if we can make progress.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the serious exploitation of workers in the security industry; the reason he has not introduced regulations which would have the effect of ensuring that all companies pay (a) PRSI and (b) pensions; and if he will outline his proposals to remedy this situation.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>A set of comprehensive regulations governing the payment of <Col N="623" /> PRSI by employers is already in operation. Since January 1989 additional regulations apply to the security industry and to a number of other specified industries whereby employers are obliged to notify my Department of the commencement of employment of new employees.  I consider that these regulations and the powers they confer are adequate to ensure compliance with PRSI collection and payment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be referring to some trends on the part of a minority of employers who attempt to evade payment of their share of PRSI.  One such area is where the employer unilaterally deems employees to be self-employed contractors.  In these circumstances the employees pay PRSI at the self-employed rate which is practically the same as the full PRSI rate; however they would not have cover for all short term benefits.</P>
      <P>Another area relates to part-time workers.  When the income threshold of £25 per week for full social insurance cover was introduced last April, my predecessor was particularly concerned that employers would not seek to evade payment of their share of PRSI contributions; especially by the introduction of practices which exploited the lower paid.  I am watching these practices very closely and will be prepared to introduce additional measures, if required.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that this year my Department have undertaken a campaign of visits to employers to ensure that PRSI is being paid at the correct rate for all employees and that their PRSI affairs are generally kept up to date.  This campaign covers employers in all industrial sectors, including the security industry.  Up to 15,000 employers will be visited this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to pensions for workers, the Deputy will be aware that there is no legal requirement for an employer to operate a pension scheme for his/her employees. Occupational pension schemes are voluntary agreements entered into by employers and their employees designed to provide cash benefits to employees on retirement or to their dependants on the <Col N="624" /> employee's death.  If the Deputy has specific types of exploitation in mind I would be glad to have the matter fully investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 7 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of EC Regulation 1408/71 workers returning to Ireland after a period of employment in Britain or any other EC member state can have their foreign social insurance contributions taken into account for social welfare benefit purposes in Ireland. However, before eligibility can be determined a statement of the insurance record must be obtained from the member state concerned.  For people who do not already have their foreign insurance records in their possession my Department request the records from the relevant social security institution.</P>
      <P>There can be considerable delays before the information necessary for updating insurance records is obtained. Delays can be for a number of reasons. For instance, necessary details may not be recorded centrally in other member states.  These details may have to be retrieved from regional or local offices or even from previous employers.</P>
      <P>One way in which Irish workers returning from Britain could speed up processing of subsequent benefits claims in Ireland is to request a statement of their insurance records from the unemployment benefit offices of the Department of Employment before departure from Britain.  I am examining ways of raising awareness of the procedure among Irish workers in Britain and other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very conscious of the increase in the movement of workers between Ireland and Britain and the other EC member states, a trend that we may <Col N="626" /> expect to accelerate as barriers to movement are removed with completion of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>The member states and the European Commission are well aware of the problems involved in transferring insurance records.  My Department are actively participating in an EC working group examining proposals for the establishment of a telecommunications network for transfer of insurance records among member states.  Parallel with and complementary to this activity, my Department and the United Kingdom Department of Social Security are working towards the early completion of a telecommunications link between our two administrations. Officials of my Department are in regular contact with their counterparts in the Department of Social Security and preparations are being made for a full meeting on these and other issues in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to note that efforts are being made to improve the arrangements for the transfer of records. However, is the Minister aware that it can take up to a couple of months to process a claim? Surely there must be something that the Minister can do in conjunction with his counterpart in the United Kingdom because it is on the United Kingdom side that delays occur. My question does not cast any reflection on the Irish side who, as the Minister is well aware, continually send reminders. Pending the installation of telecommunications facilities would the Minister do something in the near future, with his counterpart in the United Kingdom, in an effort to improve the position on the United Kingdom's side given that most of the claims are made by people returning from the United Kingdom</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the position and I repeat that in the main delays are due to the difficulty in obtaining records of the person making the claim from the United Kingdom.  As the Deputy said, it can take up to three or <Col N="627" /> four months to have cases sorted out. Delays can occur for various reasons. Even though the operations of the United Kingdom department have been regionalised it is sometimes difficult to get particulars from a region where a person may have worked.  Furthermore, some British employers are reluctant to respond to inquiries.  Apparently, the Department of Health and Social Security do not have the power to compel them to supply information with the result that they sometimes find it difficult to obtain details from employers in the United Kingdom.  Another difficulty is that people may use different names in the United Kingdom and other member states.  However, we are endeavouring to speed things up by installing a new system, as I have already indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that great hardship is being caused by the delays.  May I ask him if he is aware that the section which deals with Irish emigrants who have returned home and now require records is the only section in the Department of Health and Social Security which does not have computers and that its operatives seem to have quill pens and write all their letters by hand and cannot be read?  These letters are sent to pensioners who cannot read them.  Indeed, in some cases I have been unable to read them.  Would the Minister make a special case to the British authorities to have the Irish section of the international department of the Department of Health and Social Security treated equally given that it is not computerised at present and it does not seen to have access to computers or even typewriters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of these delays and, as I have already indicated, we are taking steps to improve the position.  One way by which we can improve the position substantially is by making people aware of the importance of getting their records before they return home.  I have a number of leaflets which I will circulate to Deputies who can make a contribution <Col N="628" /> by making people who intend to return home aware of the necessity to get the information together before they return home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain that great hardship is being caused because there are schemes which people can avail of pending the receipt of records.  I take the point however, that it is important to update the systems.  For this reason, we intend installing a new telecommunications network.  I have not come across any quill pens yet but I am sure there are some around.  However, we do not have any in our Department.</P>

      <P>They do send out hand written letters some of which are very difficult to read.  This is regrettable given that 1992 will bring a free flow of labour between the Twelve.  In view of the fact that there are almost as many Irish people living in England as on the island itself and the fact that 350,000 people emigrated in the eighties while 200,000 returned, would the Minister agree that we provide our emigrants with a terrible service and that pressure will have to be brought to bear on his counterpart in Great Britain to move away, as has been pointed out, from the quill and the handwritten notes and letters to a more sophisticated communications system?  Would the Minister make his British counterpart aware of the fact that returned Irish emigrants are dissatisfied that it takes so long to process claims in Great Britain?</P>

      <P>Criticism has been levelled at the scheme, in particular at the means test, because people expected to benefit under the scheme but did not.  The main reason claims were rejected was that the carers had means in excess of the limit. As Deputies are aware, there is a means test.  Thirty-nine per cent were refused on that basis.  Twenty-five per cent were refused because it was considered they would be better off on some other payment, such as the prescribed relative allowance, while 17 per cent were pensioners who were in receipt of other pensions and, consequently, ineligible for the carer's allowance and approximately 19 per cent were refused on other grounds. The scheme has attracted much attention and in the main criticism has been levelled against the means test.  Representations have been made constantly to have the means test eased.  If the means test is to be eased, further resources will have to be provided.  This year the scheme will cost approximately £8 million. Improvements to the means test to bring other people into the scheme could only be made if additional financial resources are made available for the scheme.  That is a matter which would have to be dealt with in the context of the budget.</P>

      <Quest>if, in relation to the social welfare response to the drastic fall in small farmers' incomes, he will consider the following changes in the eligibility code for unemployment assistance (1) a disregard of the first £20 weekly income in the means test of an applicant similar to that operating for old age and widows pensions (2) the removal of unfair notional procedures in the determination of applicants farm incomes namely value of average yearly sales and (3) a set of allowances in determination of farm income for social welfare similar to allowances applicable in determination of income for farm income tax purposes.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The means test for smallholder's assistance is based on the net income from the holding after allowance <Col N="632" /> is made for expenses actually and necessarily incurred.  Allowance is made for stock replacement, feeding costs, electricity and other factors.  In determining income for farm income tax purposes, allowances are also made by the Revenue Commissioners for these expenses but special allowances are made in some cases in line with taxation policy generally. In addition the Revenue Commissioners allow the usual personal tax allowances which are available to all taxpayers. The means test operated by my Department is designed to ascertain the actual income position in a particular year.</P>
      <P>In determining the income of farm applicants for social assistance the net income received during the year immediately preceding the date of claim is normally taken for the purpose of assessing their means.  This is only done after the social welfare officer of my Department is satisfied that similar opportunities for income from the holding will arise in the coming year.</P>
      <P>If the social welfare officer is of the opinion that the income from a farm holding will have increased or decreased, the officer will estimate the expected income in the coming 12 months based on the circumstances in each particular case.</P>
      <P>While the assessment procedure is kept under review, there are no plans at present to change the rules for assessment of farm incomes for unemployment assistance purposes.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not address two parts of my question in relation to disregarding the first £20 weekly income which is allowed in the case of old age non-contributory pensioners or widows.  The figure in those cases is £7 but recently, in answer to a question in this House, the Minister's predecessor said that, taking cost of living increases into account, it should be about £28 per week.  I am surprised the Minister did not answer that question and the other part which refers to unfair notional procedures in the determination of a farmer's income.  The Minister used the <Col N="633" /> words &ldquo;factual&rdquo; and &ldquo;actual&rdquo; but while these notional procedures are in place the process is neither factual nor actual.</P>

      <P>The system of calculating farmers' income under this scheme has been a notional one for some time; by and large it has not been adhered to since 1982 or 1983.  A farmer's income is determined on the basis of income for the previous year.  Each case is dealt with by the social welfare officer on its merits and the farmer may appeal if he is not satisfied with the decision.  The Deputy seems to have a particular case in mind and if he gives me particulars I will have it thoroughly examined to see if anything can be done about it.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that the farming scene is very volatile at present.  I am sure he is aware that the main determinant in many cases is the price the farmer gets for milk. There has to be a degree of flexibility in relation to the preceding year as far as the Department of Social Welfare are concerned.  Is the Minister happy with the operation of the present system?  Will he take cognisance of the problems in farming at present and show a little more sensitivity?  As Deputy Connor said, the notional aspect in the scheme should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is adopting a constructive approach and he will be aware that there is a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that arrangements will be made to address the problems of low income farming families in consultation with the farm organisations.  There have already been discussions between the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Agriculture and the farm organisations, and possibilities have been discussed. However, no decisions have been taken in relation to changes in the scheme.  There are about 14,500 smallholders in receipt of unemployment assistance at present and in July 1990 some improvement was made by providing that home produce would no longer be assessed against smallholders as means.  I fully understand the view put <Col N="636" /> forward by Deputy Garland, as I live in an area which is very much dependent on the supplement given to small farmers to help to maintain their families, especially on the small farms in the west.</P>
      <P>In any further discussions on this matter I will be taking a very keen interest to ensure that any system put in place is reasonable and fair and that no hardship is suffered by small farm families who need special attention.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment payments is subject to <i>inter alia,</i> the conditions that a claimant must be unemployed, available for, capable of and genuinely seeking employment.  My Department must be satisfied that claimants continue to satisfy these conditions while they are in receipt of payment, and for this reason all claims are subject to review from time to time.</P>
      <P>Two control officers of my Department's external control unit attended at the Clane Garda station on 22 October 1991 and accepted unemployment dockets from up to 350 persons, who prove unemployment there.  The officers asked each person a few questions, to satisfy themselves that each docket was being presented by the person named on it, and that the conditions for receipt of unemployment payments were understood and met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The information the Minister has given is not in accordance with the facts of the case.  Among the unemployed the system we are dealing with is known as the heavy gang system.  Is the Minister aware that on the day in question the officials arrived at the Garda station at 9.30 a.m. and delayed by about half an hour the first three applicants?  In the meantime the other applicants had to stand in the rain and in public view while waiting to be interviewed.  Is the Minister aware that the interview consists not only of a few questions but of an examination of shoes, of hands to check for welts and finger nails for dirt.  The people are threatened that if they do not have a job by the time of the next visit their payments will be cut off.  That occurs only occasionally but there seems to be a cycle of these visits.  I ask the Minister to call off these officials from depressed rural areas in the midlands where there is no work available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>My note on the matter does not entirely correspond with the information provided by the Deputy, but I <Col N="638" /> take the statement he made quite seriously.  My information is that two officers from the external control unit arrived at the Garda station at 9.30 a.m. but the station did not open until 10.25 a.m. by which time 20 people had gathered.  Therefore if people had to queue it was not the fault of the officers concerned.  On gaining entry to the station the control officers dealt with the people who had gathered, and at no stage thereafter were there more than five people waiting to have their dockets accepted.  The officers operate under standing instructions that no undue delay or inconvenience be caused to anybody. The operation at Clane Garda station continued until 1 p.m. and because of the large number of people to be dealt with, in general the interviews lasted for not much more than one minute.  Officers have been instructed that on days of inclement weather there should be no queueing in the rain.  However, my information is that the day in question was dry.</P>

      <P>The average waiting time for the last 150 people interviewed was two and a quarter hours, as can be confirmed by people from the organisations for the unemployed who were sent for on that day.  I ask the Minister to change the position whereby a tiny room is provided in a barracks for interview purposes and people have to wait in public view. Regardless of weather conditions, that is degrading to the people concerned and I know the Minister would not support that type of action.  People are forced to say that they are genuinely seeking work when everybody knows that in the midlands there is no work available.  Even Bord na Móna have to let people go, as the Minister and his colleague beside him knows.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions <Col N="640" /> Nos. 11, 57 and 59 together.  Since last July, increases in respect of dependent children in full-time education are payable up to age 21 in the case of recipients of all long term social welfare payments, including long term unemployment assistance.  Increases in respect of dependent children of recipients of short term payments are payable up to age 18 years. Payment of such increases beyond 18 would have major financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.  Payment of increases in respect of dependants over 21 would also have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The Minister's response is rather disappointing in the light of the previous reply which dealt with the Government's specific objectives under the new Programme for Government. They gave a commitment to consider the position and ensure greater equity in this area.  A deserted wife with dependent children in full time education may have to wait up to three months for her claim for allowance to be processed.  These people are extremely vulnerable.  Will the Minister agree that those in receipt of short term unemployment assistance are being discriminated against by only allowing entitlement for children up to the age of 18 years of age?  Will the Minister regularise the position pertaining to short term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance?</P>

      <P>The social security rights of persons who move within the member states of the European Community are protected by EC Regulation 1408/71. Article 5 of that regulation provides that the regulation does not apply to social assistance.  The schemes which come within the scope of the regulations are social insurance based schemes and child benefit which is a universal benefit available to all children resident in the State. The regulation does not apply to social assistance schemes.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the scope of Regulation 1408/71 to cover non-contributory benefits and the conditions under which this might be done are at present the subject of a proposal to the Council of Ministers by the EC Commission. This proposal is due to be discussed by the Council shortly and the question of extending the scope of the regulation to other social welfare schemes will be considered in the light of those discussions.</P>

Does the Minister agree that he will have to organise a section of the Department to deal with the social security rights of persons from other member states, because as and from 1992 the staff will have to deal with Greek, Italian, Flemish, Portuguese and Spanish nationals?

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the onus of proof for means is placed on the applicants, who in many cases have no income, and in cases where the social welfare officer decides that any income is above the social welfare limits, it is difficult for genuine applicants on appeal to succeed in their statutory entitlements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to qualify for social assistance payments claimed each applicant must satisfy the deciding officers that he or she complies with the statutory conditions laid down for the various social welfare assistance schemes.</P>
      <P>The long established practice is that the onus of establishing entitlement is on the claimant.  This principle has been confirmed in the courts.  The deciding officers, who are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions, must be in possession of all the material facts before giving a decision.  Investigative staff have instructions to help claimants in every way possible.  Indeed, this is also a long established practice.  Officers write to various institutions and individuals seeking information on behalf of claimants, for example to banks, solicitors, etc.  However, if the person concerned does not supply the required information the onus clearly remains on him or her to provide it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Appeals of the nature referred to by the Deputy are dealt with by the independent social welfare appeals office.  I understand that there is substantial tendency to offer oral appeals in such cases. In any event, any appellant who indicates a wish to have an oral hearing in order <Col N="644" /> to present his or her case fully is facilitated in that regard.  Detailed statistics on the numbers of appeals by circumstances of disallowance are not available.  Last year 16,500 appeals were dealt with and 50 per cent of these were given an oral hearing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  The reality on the ground, however, is not like that.  I realise that the onus of proof rests with the applicant but where the applicant provides the proof and gives permission for officials to examine bank accounts, post office accounts and every other possible source of income, is the Minister aware that some social welfare officers are adamant that the claimant's income is above the social welfare limit which makes it well nigh impossible for the claimant to prove his case on appeal?  I have been forced on occasion to submit such problems to the Ombudsman when it has been impossible to convince some social welfare officers that the person has no income.  I am not worried about cases where one can prove the income but where one does not have proof of income the social welfare officer will not accept that.  I wish to make the Minister aware of what is happening on the ground.</P>

      <P>With the onus of proof resting on the claimant, some feel they are <Col N="645" /> guilty until proven innocent.  The problem usually arises when someone cannot account for how he has spent redundancy money.  The person is expected to have proof of how the money was spent.  Even if he drank or gambled all this money, he still has not got it now, but he is deemed to be guilty because he cannot prove his innocence.  A person is entitled to do what he likes with his money.  Will the Minister do something about this or, alternatively, ensure that the people receiving redundancy are instructed to retain receipts in order to account for every penny of it?</P>

The proposed revised agreement will apply to any person who is or has been subject to the legislation of Great Britain, Northern Ireland, Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.

    <Title>Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1991: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="680" />
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have several points regarding the Regional Technical Colleges Bill that I should like to make before I finish my speech.  Before Question Time I talked about the colleges covering links with industry in relation to the research programme and consultancy programme named in the Bill.  It is most important that that programme be afforded the priority it deserves in that it will have far-reaching implications for the regions where the colleges are located, for the colleges themselves, for the people living within those regions and the progress that can be made within those regions.  It has much potential which must be nurtured by the Department of Education, public representatives, teachers, lecturers and so on.  Also its implications are enormous for regions where unemployment is at quite horrific levels, but the State will have to contribute the necessary funding to render such projects worthwhile.  It is one thing to aspire to an ideal but quite another to ensure it works in practice.  The only way this specific ideal will work in practice is if it is adequately funded.  There must be such financial incentive given to the colleges, and business people who want research undertaken and so on.</P>
      <P>Sligo Regional Technical College, in my constituency, has undertaken excellent work in recent years.  For example, a course in tourism initiated in that college has been very successful.  There is also an exchange programme with a college in Germany which has proved quite successful. This clearly demonstrates that if the Regional Technical Colleges are willing to become involved in such exchange programmes German and Irish industry can interact and much progress can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told by a number of Government Ministers that tourism is the saviour of the west.  To some extent that is true but it is an important industry for the nation as a whole.  The fact that Sligo Regional Technical College has taken the initiative in an educated approach to tourism is excellent but they must be financially supported in their research and consultancy undertakings.  If not that <Col N="681" /> programme will not be successful.  While it is a nice ideal, unless adequately funded it will not work in practice.  We must remember that tourism has so much potential for areas such as Letterkenny, Tralee and Dundalk, regions in which Regional Technical Colleges are located. They endeavour to provide various courses in their respective regions.  We must remember also that when research is undertaken in those regions the regions benefit.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (1) (d) reads:</P>
    <P>(d)  subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine to enter into arrangements with other institutions in or outside the State for the purpose of offering joint courses of study and of engaging jointly in programmes of research, consultancy and development work in relation to such matters as the governing body of the college considers appropriate;</P>
    <P>At present Regional Technical Colleges do not have links with any of the colleges in Northern Ireland.  That is a pity, especially in the constituency I represent, where there are many links, personal and educational across the Border.  For example, many of Sligo Grammar School who have completed their second-level education have gone forward to third-level in Northern Ireland.  Scope for such liaison could be provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the membership of the governing bodies allowing the colleges an opportunity to become truly regional.  For example, subsection (4) (b) reads:</P>
    <P>(b)  if the region served by the college includes all or part of the functional area of one or more than one vocational education committee other than the vocational education committee in whose functional area the college is situated, the Minister may direct that one or more, but not more than four in all, of the persons to whom paragraph (a) relates, shall be nominated to the vocational education committee by such of those other <Col N="682" /> committees as the Minister may specify;</P>
    <P>It would be my hope that subsection (4) (g) also would be taken into account and given prominence, thereby providing a useful framework for regionalisation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Students attending regional technical colleges should be entitled to the same assistance as students attending, say, UCD, UCC, UCG and Trinity College, Dublin which, as of now, unfortunately, they are not.  There should not be that differentiation drawn between the different third-level institutions.  For example, if students want to pursue a technical course at third-level they should be given the same assistance as their counterparts following an academic course at a university, which is not the case at present.</P>
    <P>A number of different interest groups have made submissions about the provisions of this Bill.  I realise it is extremely difficult to accommodate all the submissions and viewpoints advanced. Nonetheless the Minister should do his utmost in this respect because some very valid points are included in the submissions and representations.  The Minister should endeavour to marry these in the hope that the implementation of such valid recommendations will make this a better Bill.  As a member of Leitrim Vocational Education Committee I am aware that the IVEA lobbied strongly and made a number of important points in relation to the provisions of this Bill. For example, they suggested an amendment to section 11 &mdash; which deals with the selection of officers and servants &mdash; contending that the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; in section 11 (8) be deleted and substituted by the phrase <i>&ldquo;inter alia&rdquo;</i>.  That would clarify who was the employer of such officers and servants.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the annual report and information.  Here the IVEA amendment suggests the deletion of the words &ldquo;with the agreement of the Minister&rdquo; in section 14 (2) which would allow for reporting directly to the vocational education committees, who have responsibility for regional technical colleges, and <Col N="683" /> give an element of local responsibility to elected representatives of the statutory body, in that they would continue to report to the Minister.  It is vital that the regional aspect of the Regional Technical Colleges is taken into account and that public representatives are given a say in their running.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make is in respect of section 16 which deals with accounts and audits.  The IVEA amendment suggests the deletion in section 16 (1) of the words &ldquo;with the agreement of the Minister&rdquo;, similar to what they proposed in relation to section 14 (2), allowing financial reporting to the relevant vocational education committees. Again, that gives elected representatives local responsibility which is the essence of regionalisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In his absence I should like to convey my good wishes to the new Minister for Education.  In passing, I should like to congratulate the outgoing Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, on the fine job she did in education, its development over the past four years and, indeed, previously as a spokesperson on Education. All sides of the House have acknowledged that she brought a fresh approach to education and to many of the problems confronting us in that field over the past decade or so, leaving a fine legacy.</P>
      <P>The most welcome aspect of the two Bills before the House is the fact that they will give legal status to our regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technologys, undoubtedly enhancing their position, not merely in terms of Irish education but also within the wider European context.  The legislation will provide the necessary legal framework within which these colleges can operate and clarify some issues that may have been the subject of difficulty in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Regional Technical Colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges for the marvellous <Col N="684" /> work they have done since their establishment over 20 years ago.  I pay this tribute not just as a public representative but also as a former teacher and career guidance counsellor.  In that role as guidance counsellor I had contact with many of the Regional Technical Colleges, but Dundalk and Athlone were the ones with which I was most familiar.  I had very many contacts also with the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges in Dublin because of their proximity.  I have the height of praise for the staff and management of these colleges.  They were very professional, committed and dedicated. They had an open and flexible approach to the needs of students and the needs of people in their regions.  They were adaptable and willing to change and experiment with various courses.  In all this they never lost the human touch, which is probably the most vital ingredient in education at every level.  The most sophisticated techniques and ultramodern state of the art equipment assist in the education process but can never replace the human factor.</P>
    <P>The approach of the Regional Technical Colleges is exemplified for me in Dundalk where they take an individual interest in the welfare of each of their students.  Deputies from all parts of the country have the same thing to say about each of the Regional Technical Colleges. In Dundalk when courses are completed every effort is made to place students. These efforts begin during their final year.  Strong ties are maintained with the local community, business people, manufacturers and industry and this close relationship has helped and has often led to the placement of students.  It ensures that a ready pool of expertise is available to the college and to the students when required.</P>
    <P>While the human touch has not been lost by the colleges, they have expanded rapidly over the past 20 years.  The number of students has increased by over 200 per cent in the Regional Technical Colleges and in the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges enrolment has doubled. The colleges have also increased <Col N="685" /> the numbers and types of courses as rapidly as the demand has arisen.  Many of the colleges anticipated that demand and met it almost immediately.  This rapid response was possible because of the local democratic base from which the colleges operated.  Because they were close to their local communities and because of the close links with local business and industry, the colleges were able to anticipate needs and respond.  This has been the secret of the success of the colleges and in this context we have to look at these two Bills.</P>
    <P>We have to ask whether the Bills before us will build on that fine tradition, enhance the adaptability, flexibility and responsiveness of the colleges to local needs.  Will the Bills enable these colleges to become more deeply bedded in their communities and more responsive to the needs of those communities?  Sadly, I do not think they will.  The Minister stated in opening the debate that the aims of the Bill were, first, to strike a reasonable balance between greater freedom and autonomy for the institutions in their day to day operations while maintaining strong vocational education committee links and, second, to enable research, development and consultancy to take place on a legal basis.  I will deal first with the second point.</P>
    <P>There is no great legal argument about the fact that a simple amendment to the 1930 Vocational Education Committee Act would achieve the aim set out by the Minister as contained in section 5 of the Bill.  The need to allow the colleges freedom to carry out research and development and consultancy work is not in question.  It is a practical and essential response to the position which has evolved over the past 20 years.  It is simply a recognition of a <i>de facto</i> situation.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the research and development and consultancy work carried out by colleges currently has arisen in spite of the Department rather than because of any assistance from them.  I have serious reservations about the wording of section 5 because I see in it the heavy hand of the Department of <Col N="686" /> Education.  I see interference, the posiblity of interference and the right to interfere in this area being taken upon themselves by the Department of Education. Instead of helping the colleges, as the Minister undoubtedly intends, I see grave dangers that once the Bill is passed officials in the Department will see this as their entrée to begin laying down rules, regulations, guidelines etc. which will stifle initiative and enterprise and choke off any serious research in these colleges.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that when the colleges were being set up the Department sought to restrict the colleges and to prevent them from entering the areas of research and development and consultancy.  It seemed that the basic concept was to provide technical education and that the only research would be merely problem solving.  The colleges were to act basically as laboratories for universities.  Despite that restrictive approach, the colleges have expanded and research and development and consultancy have thrived.  I fear that section 5 will have a detrimental effect on that progress.  I would ask the Minister to look again at the section and to remove the heavy hand of the Department and let the decision on these matters rest where it should, locally with the vocational education committee and with the college managements.</P>
    <P>The second aim outlined by the former Minister was to strike a reasonable balance between greater freedom and autonomy for the institutions in their day to day operations while maintaining strong vocational education committee links.  There is no doubt that the colleges need and should have greater autonomy and freedom.  While I have not heard any great complaint about lack of freedom or autonomy heretofore in this regard, there are undoubtedly many improvements which could be made to allow greater freedom on a day to day basis.  It is vital that each college should have maximum freedom to make day to day decisions which are necessary for the smooth operation of organisations as complex and varied as the colleges.</P>
    <P>I challenge the view put forward by <Col N="687" /> some people within the Department and within the colleges, most notably the principals, that the present governing and administrative procedures have inhibited growth and expansion.  I have already outlined the growth in student numbers and courses available over the past 20 years and particularly over the past five years.  It has been extraordinary, particularly in view of the enormous financial constraints faced by the colleges.  The existing governing structures have served the colleges well because they allow for local and regional participation.  They allow the colleges the flexibility to respond and change in the face of local and regional needs.  They also allow for participation by all the social partners in the region.  The structures proposed would leave less power with the board of governors, less power with locally elected representatives, would allow less academic freedom and less flexibility in responding to changing demands in local communities.  There are of course bureaucratic difficulties inherent in the system at present, but the proposed system will not solve these.  If anything, it will increase the bureaucracy because of the regulatory mechanisms the Department will have to put in place.  I have my own experience of the procedures of the Department of Education in relation to primary and second level education.  I know how slow and cumbersome they can be.  Anybody who thinks that direct control by the Department will lesson bureaucracy is not living in the real world.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Education referred to the need for colleges to maintain strong links with the vocational education committees.  I regret that these Bills will not do that.  They will diminish and almost break the link with the vocational education committees.  The only functions the vocational education committees will have will be to act as trustees for the land and property of the colleges, to pay superannuation to the staff and to nominate people to the governing bodies.  It is clear that the vocational education committee link will <Col N="688" /> be almost non-existent.  This is a serious mistake.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this issue seriously before Committee Stage.  I suggest that the Minister should consider holding off Committee Stage until he has had time to fully consider the measures in the context of the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>The reality is that under these Bills all the major decision-making will be centralised in the Department of Education. Practically all the provisions in the Bill are preceded by phrases such as &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Minister&rdquo; or &ldquo;on consideration by the Minister&rdquo;.  The role of the vocational education committees and the democratically elected public representatives will be almost totally removed.  This will be detrimental to the development and expansion of the colleges. I would have no difficulty with the Minister for Education having all these powers if he had time to exercise them. However, as we all know he will not have time to do this.  Therefore, we have to read the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in the Bill as &ldquo;officials of the Department&rdquo;.  I have no wish to impugn the integrity of these officials who are dedicated, committed and carry out their duties in an exemplary manner.  However, they are not elected by the public or directly answerable to the public or responsive to the public needs; they have a different perspective and a different role to play.</P>
    <P>These Bills will do nothing for local democracy.  Down through the years we have heard many expressions of support for the concept of local democracy.  Every party in this House claims to be committed to local democracy but regularly in this House we pass legislation which is a direct negation of the whole concept of local democracy and local accountability. We regularly talk about decentralisation. Again, most parties in the House support that concept.  However, decentralisation is not just about shifting 200 or 300 civil servants to some provincial town; decentralisation should be about shifting power from the centre to the regions.</P>
    <P>The regional technical colleges were one of the best examples of decentralisation. Indeed, I would venture to <Col N="689" /> say that they were the only real example of it in the history of this State.  With their foundation, provincial towns and cities were renewed and reinvigorated, local economies were boosted, employment was provided directly in the colleges and ancillary services and local businesses boomed.  The arrival of the student population gave a fresh injection to the local economy and those who provided accommodation prospered.  There was also a decentralisation of power in that these institutions were under the control and direction of the vocational education committees and were accountable to them.  In this way they were accountable to the local communities and regions which they served.  Because the colleges were directly answerable to these communities they showed more flexibility and adaptability than any other educational institutions.</P>
    <P>I want to contrast the flexibility of the Regional Technical Colleges with the lack of responsiveness by the university sector to the rapidly changing society in the Ireland of the sixties, seventies and eighties.  While I concede that the universities have become more responsive over the past decade they should have responded to the changes in Irish society much more effectively prior to that.  I believe their structures and approach prevented them from doing this.  It is not good enough to argue that they were constrained at that time by statute or regulations.  If the Regional Technical Colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology adopted the same attitude as the universities then their syllabi would have progressed very little and would have mainly consisted of part-time technical courses and apprenticeships.</P>
    <P>As I stated previously, local democratic input was vital in the development and expansion of Regional Technical Colleges.  It is absolutely vital that this input is maintained and strengthened. For that reason I again appeal to the Minister, in considering these Bills either in the context of the Green Paper or the Committee Stage debate, to restore the vocational education committees to their rightful place in the Regional Technical <Col N="690" /> Colleges scheme of things.  I believe these Bills pander to the wishes of a small but powerful minority, including some principals of the regional technical colleges who see an enhancement of their status in the Bills and the opportunity to rid themselves of the shackles of local democratic control and accountability.  I believe this small minority is supported by highly placed officials in the Department who are anxious to regain control of the success story of Irish education over the past two decades.</P>
    <P>No doubt these people regard these Bills as the first step in the process of moving Regional Technical Colleges away from their roots in the local communities and technical education.  I fear that part of this process would lead the Regional Technical Colleges to introduce a more academic type syllabus which would be less responsive to local communities, businesses and industry.  Such a move would lead to a greater concentration on more academic pursuits and a lessening of the role they must play in maintaining their status as centres of excellence in the provision of technical and vocational education.  I have no doubt that most of these people are pursuing their agendas which have more to do with their status than with the continuance of democratic accountability at regional technical college level.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that many of these people look with disdain on many local councillors, some of whom may have little formal education but who have an input into the thrust and direction of education policy.  It is totally unacceptable to these people that anyone other than academics should have any say in educational policy.  However, these people fail to realise that there have to be checks and balances in any democracy; institutions have to be answerable to the public and respond to local needs and public opinion.  This public opinion is generally articulated by public representatives, both local and national.  For all their faults and failings, they generally reflect the views and, more importantly, the needs of the people.  The vocational education sector has succeeded better <Col N="691" /> than most in articulating the opinions and views of the general public.  They have responded well to the needs of their communities. The regional technical colleges have benefited from this local democratic input and any attempt to diminish it should be considered very carefully. These are regional colleges and they are there to serve the needs of the regions, not to conform to any preconceived ideas which some official in the Department might have.</P>
    <P>The committee who originally prepared the brief for the colleges made the following recommendation: &ldquo;If they are to make their most effective contribution to the needs of society and the economy they must be capable of continuing adaptation to social, economic and technological changes.  Initiative at local and national levels will largely determine how far this vital characteristic will develop&rdquo;. The success of the colleges has proven the wisdom of that approach.  I again appeal to the Minister to reconsider the provisions in the Bill relating to vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>A point that needs to be underlined is that the funding and resources made available to Regional Technical Colleges should be increased so that they get a larger slice of the educational cake. Section 6 (4) (e) of this Bill provides that there may be one student representative on the governing body of the college. Perhaps the Minister would consider changing it to two student representatives, specifying that one of either sex be included.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome in that it gives legal status.  I have some reservations which I have expressed.  I note that the Minister in introducing the Bill indicated that a flexible approach would be adopted by her during Committee Stage, and I look forward to that particular section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking to both of those Bills which are being taken simultaneously and, essentially, do one and the same thing.  The regional technical colleges, in the eyes of many people, are the last <Col N="692" /> hope for the regions of Ireland and, in particular, for the west.  The regions of Ireland are dying slowly and surely, and inexorably the population graph is downwards.</P>
      <P>Apart from a brief period of resurgence in the late sixties and the early and mid seventies, every single census of population signals rural decline.  Indeed, the preliminary results from the 1991 census indicates that the west has only two centres showing any signs of growth at present, Sligo and Galway.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State was present, as I was, in Galway two weeks ago at the western bishops conference, where the theme was &ldquo;survival through togetherness&rdquo;. We saw in very graphic terms the downward spiral, the inexorable decline, the rampant decay in the west and the fact that there is absolutely nothing on the horizon that would signal an end to that.  Somebody from my own county, many years ago, wrote a book entitled <i>Nobody Shouted Stop,</i> and nobody has shouted stop thus far to the decay and the death of the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A drive through the most selected tracts of rural Ireland &mdash; indeed, through any tracts &mdash; will give a stark and vivid reminder of the decline and the decay. There are closed homesteads, dilapidated and abandoned farms, substandard and worsening road conditions, railway lines being ripped up, secondhand sleepers being used which are taken from the lines in the east, untended drainage channels, tumbledown derelict closed rural schools, and broken or non-existent sign posting.  As a peripheral, region Ireland would always have tremendous disadvantages and enormous competitive challenges.  As remote regions within Ireland the entire western seaboard will face particular challenges. However, the entire suction movement towards the centre is now very much accelerated by the passing of the Single European Act which provides for the completion of the internal market by the end of 1992.  Rapid movement towards <Col N="693" /> political union and economic and monetary union all increase the pace of events and certainly increase the challenges facing rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I know that politicians and EC officials will inevitably counterbalance the argument of the challenge by pointing out that while there are challenges there are also tremendous opportunities opening up for Ireland.  However, the challenge and the threat is there.  It is real and we have not even begun to face up to it.  The challenge is that we are now part of an integrated Europe with a market of 340 million people; the challenge is that economically weak regions like Ireland will not be able to erect any protective barriers from now on; the challenge is that in such a competitive situation economic cannibalism prevails.  Marketplace competition is the order of the day and only the fittest and most resilient will survive.</P>
    <P>If the regions of Ireland have continued to decline under the more benign and protected economic climate up until now, there is absolutely no doubt but that Ireland as a whole and as a region &mdash; and particularly the regions within Ireland &mdash; will all become increasingly marginalised unless there is a calculated, immediate political decision to transfer from the Community and from the centre the necessary physical and human resources and the infrastructure to enable survival and development to occur.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the inherent dangers of peripherality, this country will face even stronger competition within the next five years.  The European centre for precision engineering was Czechoslovakia until it went into economic decline; crystal glass, tool making etc., were Czechoslovakian specialities; Romania was a huge operator in the agricultural field and a major producer of food; and Poland and Hungary were large extremely efficient industrial and commercial nations.</P>
    <P>The economic decline in those countries and recent political developments all have given rise to what is but a temporary <Col N="694" /> recession and setback.  There is little doubt that as soon as these countries get their administrative, fiscal, productive and legislative systems up and running again and geared towards the modern Europe, they will be major competitive players on the larger European commercial map for the future.  Within five years the full brunt of their competitive edge will be felt.  It is obvious, therefore, that the economic centre of gravity will move very much to the east, again exacerbating Ireland's geographical and economic disadvantage.</P>
    <P>One of the problems with Ireland is that we have failed to identify, to act upon and to exploit our areas of advantage.  The Institut for Wirtschaftsforshung of Munich identified positive factors where Ireland does possess real economic advantage: the very modern telecommunications network, the general availability of labour, the availability and quality of education and training facilities, the favourable social climate, and the abundant availability of skilled labour.  It is obvious, therefore, that we in Ireland should be concentrating on our areas of strength.  In other words, we should be concentrating on the development of people's skills, their aptitudes and abilities.  This is where education and particularly vocational education and technical education comes in and where the role of regional technical colleges will have to be further enhanced.</P>
    <P>When the member states embarked on their policy of European integration it was recognised that one of the main purposes of this integration, cohesion, strength, or unity was to strengthen the capacity of the EC in science and technology. Science and technology is the area where there has been the greatest partnership between education and industry.  It is business enterprises and industry which transform science and technology into economic and social progress. The role of the regional technical colleges is to translate their work into <Col N="695" /> viable long term jobs and higher living standards.</P>
    <P>Higher education and industry therefore must act together and must be more responsive to the general needs of the society surrounding them.  We have in the regional technical colleges, strategically positional throughout the regions &mdash; in Letterkenny, Sligo, Athlone, Galway, Limerick, Tralee, Dundalk and Waterford &mdash; tremendous potential economic incubators and generators.  That is why I welcome the general thrust of this Bill. It liberalises the colleges.  I empathise with some of the sentiments of Deputies Dempsey and Boylan in that I agree that there should be a stronger linkage between the vocational education committees, the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology. I do not accept the argument that the vocational education committee structure has been the constraining influence in relation to the development of the regional technical colleges or the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Rather, any constraint that has been put on them in relation to their development, any stultifying of their potential, has arisen more from a lack of resources than from any management structure that currently exists.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there is a natural desire on the part of the Regional Technical Colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology for greater autonomy.  I appreciate that in the eyes of some Regional Technical Colleges, vocational education committees are essentially second level management structures unsuited to the management of third level institutions, but I exhort the Minister on Committee Stage to look again at the possibility of strengthening the links between the vocational education committees and the new college structures.  I take the points made in various submissions we have received from vocational education committees and the IVEA that they should not be blamed for <Col N="696" /> the so-called limitation of the development of the third level colleges until now. It should be possible to accommodate both aspirations, to give them greater autonomy and still retain a somewhat stronger modicum of the vocational education committee input that exists at present.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill because it enables the colleges to enter partnerships, to involve themselves in joint ventures, to get involved in commercial research and development, which has been very much part and parcel of the success of our universities since the universities were founded and particularly since the universities began to show some entrepreneurial flair and adventure in the general area of business, science and research.  This Bill will allow the colleges to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the area they should be able to harness the strengths of the area and project an outward dynamic movement into the community &mdash; in other words, to breathe economic life into the community, to breathe hope, confidence and development into the regions.  Do people expect too much from the regional and technical colleges?  I do not believe so.  They have the potential, the capacity and the ambition to deliver.  We as legislators must do everything to encourage them at official level to face the challenges and to grasp the opportunities there; but if they are to face the challenges they will have to be given the resources by the Government and the European Community.</P>
    <P>We have a very strong case for additional European Community funding, but the case has not been sufficiently strongly put at Commission level to achieve the necessary consciousness at EC level in relation to the obligation of the Community to this country by way of additional educational funding.  This country has become the educational conveyor belt of the European Community, supplying top level graduates of certificate, diploma and degree level to feed <Col N="697" /> the enterprise, the business and the economies of the stronger European Community countries.  There is additional social funding and structural funding for the colleges if the case is strongly put.  If we are to develop on our strength, which is our human resource, there is a obligation on the Community to recognise that with adequate funding for third level colleges so that every pupil coming from second level education will have an opportunity to go to third level college if he or she wishes.  To date the colleges have not been given the resources.  The real economic and social convergence within the European Community to date has been only minimal.  We are fed on an ample diet of jargon in relation to convergence, integration and cohesion; but the success rate so far has been minimal in real terms.</P>
    <P>Our living standards are only 67 per cent of the average of the European Community, yet our unemployment rate is double the EC average.  In 1980 Irish living standards amounted to 64.5 per cent of the EC average measured in GDP terms.  Despite all the talk of progress, this had only advanced to 67.3 per cent of the EC average by 1990.  On the unemployment front Ireland, with 18.6 per cent of the workforce unemployed, has the highest unemployment figure in the European Community.  Ireland is the only member of the European Community which had not recovered its employment level of 1980 by the year 1990.  Ireland has to immediately seek specialisation in industrial and commercial areas where we can compete on an international scale.</P>
    <P>If we are to develop as a country we need education at the highest level, education involving the development of people who have the skills and abilities to produce goods, to successfully market those goods, to produce services and to successfully market those services at home and abroad.  We need to create a generation of people who can generate a <Col N="698" /> spirit of enterprise in the general community, a generation who see economic opportunities and who have the confidence to exploit those opportunities. We need to see education as the dynamic which will encourage enterprise, which will encourage motivation in people who in turn will motivate other people to create more jobs.  We need an education system which will encourage people to be innovative, to be versatile, to be flexible in their approach to problem solving. Quickly changing patterns also mean that there is an urgent need for emphasis on lifelong upgrading of skills and knowledge.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest economic growth areas in the whole area of internationally traded services such as finance consultancies etc. is the third level sector, including the regional technical colleges. These colleges should continue to place emphasis on all areas of development such as data processing, computer servicing, education services, architectural and engineering consultancy work, etc.</P>
    <P>Again, areas such as the greatly underdeveloped food industry, horticulture, forestry, mining and mineral exploration, the marine, inland fisheries, etc. are wide open for development and exploitation. I could envisage the regional technical college for Mayo &mdash; promised, but not delivered on by this Government &mdash; placing a major emphasis on something that is indigenous to the region, for example, tourism, with facilities based around language and cultural development, agri-tourism, adventure tourism, business tourism, etc.</P>
    <P>At this juncture let me congratulate the new Minister, Deputy Davern, in his absence.  I wish him well for the duration of his term of office as Minister for Education. We will suspend judgment on his performance until we see how he measures up.  We have a full appreciation that in taking on the Education portfolio he is taking on one of the most challenging, if not the most challenging, most complex and most costly in terms of cost <Col N="699" /> to the Exchequer of all of the portfolios. We wish him well in that.</P>
    <P>As a Tipperary man he will also come under pressure to deliver the long promised regional technical college for Thurles.  My colleague, Deputy Lowry, will be waxing lyrical and exhorting the Minister in a suitable direction later or when the debate resumes.</P>
    <P>There are three priorities in terms of regional technical colleges &mdash; Tallaght, Thurles and Castlebar.  Tallaght is a reality.  Thurles and Castlebar are far from realities.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Enda Kenny was Minister of State and sat where Deputy Fahey now sits, he told Dáil Éireann that he was very happy that a site had been acquired in Castlebar for a regional technical college and he did so on the assumption that, irrespective of who donned the mantle of Minister for Education, that would be delivered upon.</P>

      <P>There is overwhelming justification for both those regional technical colleges.  I would make the point that County Mayo has the third highest participation rate in third level education in the country.  Every September- October 3,200 third level students leave County Mayo by bus or train to go to the universities and the regional technical <Col N="700" /> colleges or to go overseas.  There are over 250 people from Mayo in third level colleges either in the North or overseas. We have a very high participation rate. We have an outstanding case for a third level college.  I believe it should be the catalyst for growth in the county and in the region.  I cannot see that it should pose a threat to Galway, Sligo or Athlone.  I would make the point that there are ample specialist faculties that are not catered for in existing third level colleges and which would find a fertile home in County Mayo.  Let me exhort Minister Davern to fulfil the other two-thirds of that promise and deliver a college to both Thurles and Castlebar. There is no need to say but that he will have the full support of this side of the House in that regard.</P>
      <P>Some of the regional technical colleges have already done quite a substantial amount of work on tourism.  They have identified certain areas that need experimentation and possible growth and development and they have been providing a lot of stimulating ideas in relation to what can and should be done.  But there is a lot of work yet to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regional technical colleges celebrate their 21st birthday this year.  I want to pay particular tribute to those who pioneered them, particularly the steering committee on technical education, and to those people in the technical instruction branch of the Department of Education who had a clear vision and an unwavering conviction that technical education in Ireland deserved a more rightful place than it enjoyed at that time.  These are the people who saw the need for a new deal for technical education and the urgent economic necessity of providing technically competent and skilled people to meet the challenges of the decade ahead.  The steering committee report, published in 1969, was a short, crisp, business-like document.  It turned down what it saw as the liberal arts concept of the new college which was proposed by the Commission on Higher Education at <Col N="701" /> the time and it made a firm pronouncement on the enormous potential of vocational education and the intention that the new colleges should proceed in that direction.  Thankfully, the sceptics at the time &mdash; and there were many &mdash; and those from the world of academia who thought that it would not and could not succeed, were proven wrong.  By any standards the regional technical colleges have been an enormous success.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest achievements of the regional technical colleges and their sister colleges in the Dublin Institute of Technology has been their central role in providing greater access to third level education.  They removed a lot of the mystique and a lot of the elitism that surrounds third level education.  Their opening up to people who heretofore have been disadvantaged because of their social background or their remoteness from the centres was a major step forward. Their capacity and potential to contribute in a very significant way to economic and technological development was soon realised and students began to flock to them.  They were no longer seen, as they were initially, as the poor man's university.</P>
    <P>However, despite the huge influx, there are still major imbalances with under-representation from the lower socio-economic groups.  There is a marked lack of involvement by the adult population.  Finally, the non-participation of females in certain faculties, such as engineering and technology, will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>All the areas of third level education &mdash; certificate, diploma and degree level activities &mdash; will have to be opened up to far greater numbers of people.  If we believe that education and training are to play these vitally important roles in the development of a united Europe we must channel more resources into investment in people, investment in their skills and investment in their creativity.  One of the most notable features of the regional technical colleges has been the fact that <Col N="702" /> they have provided a national network of third level colleges integrating with each other, interlinking with each other, complementing each other and allowing the all important facility of transferability from one college to the other.  However, there is an obvious need to open up greater dialogue and liaison with the conduits between the regional technical colleges and the Irish university system.  I appreciate that this does exist but, again, only to a minimal or limited degree.  Each of them, in particular the universities, will have to recognise and accept each other's qualifications.</P>
    <P>We also need to recognise educational credits.  If somebody gets part of a course, be it 20 per cent, 30 per cent, 50 per cent or two thirds, they should be entitled to a credit irrespective of where they go throughout the educational world.  It should be seen as part of their educational baggage and they should be able to use it as a means of entering another third level college or, after a period be able to take up the course at the point they discontinued it initially.  We have got to create a common currency of educational achievement transferable between all institutions to enable people involve themselves in education as an ongoing lifelong process.</P>
    <P>No words of praise could adequately express the achievements of the six Dublin Institute of Technology colleges. They have been the pioneers of third level technical education but, unfortunately, they have never received anything like the recognition they deserve in terms of accommodation and resources. Kevin Street College of Technology, for example, is 104 years old, Bolton Street College of Technology was founded in 1912 while the College of Commerce in Rathmines have their operations spread throughout several buildings.</P>
    <P>In visiting any one of those colleges one gets the impression that they are not perceived at official level as having the same entitlement to resources or funding <Col N="703" /> as the universities.  If one visits the College of Commerce in Rathmines one will find that there is the main building, a red brick building which has been leased nearby and several other halls scattered the length and breadth of the Borough of Rathmines.  This is unbecoming for a college which has given tremendous and unstinting service to the third level commercial sector during the years.</P>
    <P>As I have said, these colleges have been the pioneers of technological advances and have involved themselves in experimentation and projects which eventually led to very fruitful commercial ventures in the real world; yet, unfortunately, when it came to prioritising funding these have always been seen as the poor relation by comparison with the universities.  A good example of this is that in relation to measures Nos. 1 to 5 of the Structural Funds the universities received £99 million whereas the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges received a mere £2 million despite the fact that they teach almost 50 per cent of the total student complement at third level, with 24,000 students comprising 8,800 full time students, 10,000 part time students and over 5,000 apprentices and craft technician students.  I pay particular tribute to them for providing apprenticeship and craft technician courses.</P>
    <P>If there was ever a time to carry out a major reappraisal of where we are going in the area of craft technician and apprenticeship training it is now because such training is virtually non-existent.  I am talking here in particular about the semi-State bodies, such as CIE, Bord na Móna, the Air Corps, Aer Lingus and Telecom Éireann.  When Telecom Éireann formed part of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs there was a large influx of people from vocational schools with the group certificate or a higher certificate, and they were trained to the highest possible standard but now because of economic exigencies and <Col N="704" /> demands these agencies no longer provide the number of places they once provided. As a result the question of training has been left to FÁS.</P>
    <P>As a person who has made numerous unsuccessful representations to FÁS to get people onto apprenticeship courses I can testify to the fact that people with tremendous manual skills and ability are working in breakers' and builders' yards in Great Britain because they cannot circumvent the system or meet the requirements and demands made.  I am talking here about sponsorship.  Because of commercial pressures the vast majority of would-be sponsors cannot afford to sponsor an apprentice given the cost involved, on average £5,000 between board and lodgings, tool kits, travelling expenses, public liability insurance, etc.  As a result places are being filled by people who have the ability to circumvent the system. They provide employers with the form which is merely stamped and then sent to the FÁS centre.  In essence, it is the parents who are paying FÁS.</P>
    <P>The FÁS operation should be taken and shaken from top to bottom.  If there is one area of semi-State activity which is in urgent need of re-examination it is the FÁS operation which is gobbling up huge resources without in many cases giving good value for money.  I therefore pay tribute to the colleges for providing on an annual basis up to 5,000 craft and apprenticeship places.</P>
    <P>In the ten years since 1981 the number of full time students has doubled, from 4,000 to 8,000.  If we take part time students and apprentices into consideration we are talking about 24,000 and the number continues to grow. However, the facilities are a major constraint on further development.  It is a mark of the commitment and resilience of the staff that they have achieved so much in what one could be forgiven for describing as slumland third level facilities. There are literally no staff facilities with 20 staff per room.  The <i>per capita</i> grant in respect of each student is <Col N="705" /> approximately £1,000 per head which, again, lags way behind the figure for the universities.</P>
    <P>If one imagines what these colleges could and would have done had they been given £11.7 million which was politically targeted for Carysfort College, and compares Kevin Street and Bolton Street Colleges of Technology and the College of Commerce in Rathmines with the palatial surroundings of the universities one gets the impression that the grim hand of bureaucracy and politics set out deliberately to stifle their growth and expansion.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I welcome the Bill is that I anticipate it will enable the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges to challenge the system and realise something like their true potential.  Up to now they have never had the benefit of sponsorship or joint ventures despite the fact that there are glaring opportunities for such developments.  Indeed, in the past they have had to turn down numerous lucrative and attractive offers because of the constraints on what they could and could not do.  A good example is the offer made to Kevin Street College of Technology to establish a micro-electronics park there. This subsequently went to University College Cork by default.  The college because of the constraints upon them could not avail of the offer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation, therefore, because it will enable the enterprise and the entrepreneurial flair which is present, but stunted, in the colleges to be used untrammelled.  However, I want to see the Minister give a commitment that these colleges will now receive the resources they so badly need, but have been denied, to achieve the ambitious targets they have set for themselves.</P>
    <P>During the years the Dublin Institute of Technology qualifications, certificates and diplomas, have been recognised internationally by educational and professional employers, the trade unions and other organisations operating in the commerical sphere.</P>

      <P>It has been agreed to take first the question addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the name of Deputy Taylor.  Deputy Taylor has five minutes to present his case and the Minister &mdash; or the Minister of State &mdash; has five minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this most important matter on the Adjournment.  It concerns the very serious position in which many hundreds of would-be drivers are unable to obtain insurance to drive motor cars.  In many cases they cannot get it at all and, in others, it is available to them only at extortionate and prohibitive premiums. One can imagine the sense of extreme frustration and anger among young people who are being forced to become criminals.  We know that the numbers of young people driving without insurance is extremely high and is on the increase. Why?  One of the reasons is that it is so difficult, if not impossible, for young drivers to get insurance to enable them to do the lawful thing, which so many of them want to do.  I am sure that all Deputies have had representations made to them on how frustrating it is to approach insurance companies and try to get any kind of reasonable response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One young man in particular consulted me within the last few days.  He is aged 23 and holds a provisional licence; he approached five insurance companies to try to get insurance cover and I will relate the response in each case.  The first insurance company told him to forget it, that they did not quote for anybody under 25 years of age.  The second insurance company said precisely the same thing; the third company said that they would quote for <Col N="707" /> somebody under 25 years of age provided that the person had a full licence.  As I said, the person concerned has a provisional licence.  The fourth company said the same as the first two; they do not quote for anybody under 25 years of age. The fifth company were prepared to give him insurance cover but the premium quoted was £1,783 for third party, fire and theft.</P>
    <P>One can imagine a young person earning a modest income having to pay £14 per week on car insurance alone without taking petrol, depreciation and so on into account.  It is a disgraceful situation.  The insistence on a full licence is catch 22 because if you apply for a full licence you will not receive it unless you can show the Motor Registration Office that you have insurance.  However, you cannot get insurance unless you have a full licence. Hundreds of our young people are in this position.  It is not necessarily a matter of wanting cars for social activities, the employment prospects of many of them are affected by the lack of insurance. Many people, to get employment, or to advance themselves in employment, need car insurance at a reasonable rate.</P>
    <P>Is the position the same in the UK or other EC countries?  Not at all.  In the United Kingdom young people can get insurance for £150 or £200 per annum. Why are we the fall guys?  The same insurance companies are involved.  Are we saying that our young people are a different calibre of driver from those in the UK?  They are not, there is no difference. The reality is that the insurance companies are having us on.  It is the Minister's responsibility to call them in and tell them that we want a fair deal for our would-be young drivers.  If they want to trade in this country they should be brought into line and provide reasonably priced insurance to our young drivers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I applogise for the absence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is attending a Cabinet meeting at present.  I do not propose to go into the fundamental causes <Col N="708" /> of high insurance as everybody knows the reasons.  In the course of various contributions already in this House, details were given of a comprehensive list of measures to improve the environment for motor insurance, including the cost of insurance for young drivers, identified by the Inter-Ministerial Group on Motor Insurance, and subsequently endorsed by Government.</P>
      <P>The measures, announced but not yet implemented, including the introduction of the necessary legislation by the Ministers for the Environment and Justice, are being given priority attention. Deputies will, of course, have an opportunity of debating the proposed text and objectives of the legislation in full in due course.  Deputies will appreciate that questions about road traffic legislation and legislation in relation to the courts are properly addressed to the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The measures identified by the Inter-Ministerial Group on Motor Insurance have the objective of improving the environment for insurance, particularly motor insurance.  The extent to which this objective is achieved will depend on the timing and the scope of their implementation and the impact which implemented measures will have on the frequency and cost of insurance claims.  In this context, insurers and the general public, including motorists both young and old, have a role to play.  Insurers are expected to control those factors within their ambit so that inefficiencies in the insurance sector do not give rise to any unnecessary costs which have to be borne by the community as a whole.  The general public, particularly motorists, must play their part by increased awareness of the need for road safety.  Indeed, I note that a recent report by the consumers' association stresses the responsibility that motorists themselves have, not just in relation to road safety, but also in relation to the cost of injury compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, I would point out that unless and until the claims experience &mdash; including the claims frequency and levels of <Col N="709" /> compensation paid to victims of road accidents &mdash; in Ireland matches that obtaining in other European countries there will be divergencies between motor insurance premia in Ireland and those applying in other countries.</P>
    <P>This House should be fully aware that as the insurance supervisory authority the statutory responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is to ensure that insurers maintain their solvency and reserve requirements.  He is not responsible for the day-to-day operations of insurance companies, who must exercise their own commercial judgment in the conduct of their business.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to inform the Deputies, that under the declined cases agreement difficulties in obtaining motor insurance, including such for young and more mature drivers, are dealt with by the declined cases committee which are comprised of representatives of the authorised motor insurance companies.  This committee, not the Department of Industry and Commerce, examine cases where refusals have been obtained from five or more insurance companies and nominate one of the companies to quote for the risk involved.</P>
    <P>The refusals and details of previous insurance should be sent directly to the Irish Insurance Federation as it is the declined cases committee which nominate a company to quote and not the Department.  I would add that the insurance industry have undertaken to ensure that insurance brokers are fully aware of the way in which the declined cases agreement operates so that any delays in obtaining quotations for motor insurance are minimised.  I am a little saddened that Deputy Taylor did not put forward some solutions to what everybody accepts is a very serious problem and one that must be tackled urgently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

There may be further initiatives that can be taken to tackle this problem in an effective way.  I accept what the Deputy has said, that we all hear of such problems in the course of our constituency work and, inevitably, something must be done with regard to the difficulties experienced by young people in trying to get motor insurance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to thank the Chair for affording me the opportunity of raising this important issue on the Adjournment.  I hope the Minister will clarify the position regarding the future of the Kinsealy research centre and adjoining lands.  I believe the decision has been taken by the board of Teagasc to dispose of land at Kinsealy.  The bottom line in any future transaction in respect of such land must be the common good.</P>
      <P>I am aware that certain proposals which are at a very advanced stage do not meet the necessary criteria.  Any proposals that emerge must be critically examined, particularly in light of the future value of the land at this location. I am unhappy that the staff were not made aware of these developments at Teagasc.  Some of them learned of it in <i>Farm News</i> of 11 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closure of the Kinsealy research centre would be a disaster for the horticulture industry, particularly in north County Dublin.  This centre was set up in 1959 and located at Kinsealy because of its close proximity to the heartland of horticulture production in north County Dublin, north Kildare, Meath and Louth. Today these areas account for 33 per cent of the national fruit and vegetable production.  This centre has been very effective in providing specialised back-up <Col N="711" /> to the advisers to the horticulture industry.</P>
    <P>Growers' representatives recently confirmed to the Teagasc authorities that they favour the retention of the research facilities at Kinsealy.  Kinsealy is considered by Irish mushroom growers to be the ideal location for mushroom research and training.  Bord Glas have recommended that the Kinsealy research centre be developed as the national mushroom centre with responsibility for research and advice.  Can we disregard this advice from those groups?</P>
    <P>The phasing out or relocation of the centre will immediately put at risk up to 63 research, technical and other staff positions.  In addition, the livelihood of hundreds of workers and their families, involved in growing mushrooms, vegetables, nursery stock, greenhouse crops, soft fruit and amenity horticulture will be gradually affected and jobs will be lost. If Teagasc proceed with the proposals it will be purely for internal political reasons.  The interests of the industry and the hundreds of small growers in north County Dublin and adjoining counties must be the only consideration.  The best interests of the industry lie in the retention of the Kinsealy research centre.  This is the opinion of those who work in the industry and in the research centre.</P>
    <P>The closure of this centre would mean that the expert team which has been built up over the years will be laid off and service to horticulture will deteriorate. Horticulture specialists will be retired &mdash; indeed we need more such people &mdash; or moved to peripheral locations.  In the long run the moving of staff and replacement of facilities will be very expensive and will not be in the interests of the industry.  This move would be inconsistent with stated Government policy and would be a bad deal for the country.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have consistently, particularly prior to elections, placed much emphasis on horticulture, but this has proved to be lip service.  Decision time is <Col N="712" /> now at hand.  The growers in north County Dublin and adjoining counties await the Minister's response and I hope it will be positive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of a periodic review I am informed that Teagasc have under consideration the sale of land and other assets which are surplus to their requirements.  In this connection a part of the lands at Kinsealy, which the authority consider to be no longer needed for research, is regarded as suitable for sale.  No final decision has yet been taken on this issue.  Any decision to proceed would be taken only if it was clear that it would not adversely impact on the research centre at Kinsealy or on the horticultural industry in general.</P>
      <P>Teagasc, as a nationwide organisation, have many land and other assets dispersed throughout the country.  As a large national organisation they need, from time to time, to dispose of some assets and indeed to acquire new ones in the light of changing circumstances and policy priorities for the organisation.</P>
      <P>The sale of surplus assets is part of an on-going Teagasc policy to sell such assets and to use the proceeds to fund essential capital works.  Examples of this policy are the recent building and equipping with the most up-to-date research equipment of the Food Hall, Dunsinea, and the development of the Dairy Research Centre, Moorepark.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting this item for debate.  At this time of the year there is the usual hassle between the Department of the Environment and local authorities on the amount of the rate support grant for 1992.  Each year time is wasted in the Dáil <Col N="713" /> pressurising the Minister to decide on the figure for each authority.  This is an extremely unsatisfactory way of doing business.  The Minister knows that this is the time of year when estimates have to be approved by local authorities.</P>
      <P>Everyone would agree that the country should be administered in a more business-like way.  Can one imagine a large private business employing thousands of people, as Dublin Corporation do, not knowing on 21 November what their income for the following year will be.  I remind the Minister that Dublin City Council meet on Monday next to agree the estimates.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from my party colleagues on Dublin City Council asking that I put every possible pressure on the Minister to make a decision.  When the Minister announces his decision I hope the rate support grant will have been increased.  At the very least, Dublin Corporation would require that this year's grant be index linked to the cost of living to allow for inflation.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware, I am sure, that services in the Dublin area have been cut to the bone, particularly in the areas of traffic control and safety, where expenditure of comparatively small sums &mdash; for example, £50,000 on speed ramps or £200,000 for cycleways &mdash; would be a very small price to pay for a reduction in road accidents and which undoubtedly would be self-financing.  Other essential items included in the estimate at the behest of the Civic Alliance will be under threat if there is any reduction in real terms in the amount of the grant.  Public lighting has been neglected and the excellent work of the parks department is under threat once again.</P>

    <P>The provision of housing by Dublin Corporation is almost at a standstill.  The once flourishing scheme for purchasing houses, restoring them and letting them to families has just about ceased altogether. Many inner city landbanks accumulated over the years for housing, which Dublin Corporation would <Col N="714" /> now like to sell, lie derelict and useless, an eyesore in the middle of the city.  What use are the provisions of the Derelict Sites Act?</P>
    <P>We must also consider the staff of Dublin Corporation, who are always under pressure.  At this time of the year they naturally wonder if they will have a job next year.  Failure to increase the rate support grant to Dublin Corporation, and indeed other local authorities, could well result in staffing levels being reduced with a consequent increase in the already high levels of unemployment.  It must be obvious to everyone that if this happens it will be another example of supposed savings in one area being negatived by increased social welfare payments.  It is a case of more people being paid provided they do not work.</P>
    <P>The rate support grant has been consistently reduced in real terms since it was introduced 12 years ago.  Clearly, the whole system no longer works.  The very narrow base of commercial rates is quite inadequate to provide a significant part of the local authority revenue.  In their desperate search for money councils have savagely increased rates on the commercial sector, particularly on small businesses, which are the backbone of this country and which are now being actively discriminated against.  I have little doubt that the actions of the local authority in this area are unconstitutional and we can expect a test case to be taken in the near future.  We need a complete rethink on local authority financing in order to broaden the base in conjunction with real tax reform at national level.  This type of reform would represent a genuine decentralisation of power, which this country badly needs.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has raised an important matter and I appreciate his concern, but in the first instance let me point out that we have brought forward the estimates process over the past four years to ensure <Col N="715" /> that the estimates are adopted before the beginning of the year.  Before I took office the estimates for the year were often debated in March or April of that year and then the local authorities concerned put through the estimate.  There has been a vast improvement and we will continue to make improvements.</P>
      <P>The latest statutory dates for holding these meetings are 16 November for county councils and 30 November for county borough and urban district councils. As the Deputy may know, local authorities may adjourn their estimates meetings in accordance with section 10 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, &ldquo;subject to the limitation that no such adjournment shall be to a day not within the period of 21 days beginning on the day on which the estimates meeting begins&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, while it would be useful for the city council to adopt their estimates at their meeting next Monday, the council may adjourn their adoption of the estimates up to 14 December, if that were to be necessary.  I well understand, <Col N="716" /> however, that the city council would wish to complete their estimates next Monday. I hope and expect they will be able to do so.</P>
    <P>The Government are at present discussing the departmental estimates for 1992.  The Minister is attending a Government meeting all day today.  He is, in fact, still at the meeting, where they are considering all the Estimates for 1992. We hope to notify local authorities of their 1992 rate support grant in the next few days.  I hope to notify Dublin Corporation and other local authorities concerned of their 1992 rate support grant before their meetings on Monday, 25 November.  They should be hearing from us very shortly.</P>

As a result of these investigations a deciding officer assessed the means in each case at £19.30 per week.  This assessment is derived from the value of board and lodging in their parents' home.  The home income is derived from their father's earnings. The rate of unemployment assistance payable in each case is the maximum appropriate rate less the means assessed.

      <P>The free travel scheme applies to all those who have attained pensionable age (i.e. 66 years of age or over), to blind persons aged 18 or over and to persons receiving social welfare type payments as permanently incapacitated person.

      <P>A reduction to 60 years of age in the age requirement for those in receipt of widows pensions would create a demand for similar treatment to be given to those in receipt of other social welfare payments.

      <P>The value to a claimant of free board and lodgings occurs, in the main, in the assessment of the benefit accruing to a young person living at home and claiming unemployment assistance.  It covers the value of accommodation, meals, support <Col N="655" /> and maintenance as well as generally sharing in the standard of living of the household and facilities which the household enjoys.  The assessment achieves a degree of equity as between applicants in different household circumstances.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget a minimum weekly payment of £5 was introduced for unemployment assistance claimants whose current entitlement is less than £5 and whose only means is the yearly value of free board and lodgings at home.</P>

    <P>Every effort is being made to keep the length of time taken to investigate <Col N="657" /> entitlement to Old Age Non-Contributory Pensions to a minimum.  Unfortunately there are delays on occasions but these are mainly due to circumstances in which information is awaited from either the applicant or a third party, e.g. in relation to a bank account or evidence of transfer or property, rather than action on that part of the social welfare officer.</P>
    <P>As Deputies may know, it is open to any person to apply for the pension for months before reaching pension age. Where people do so, pension can be awarded in time.  My officials advise the public of this right.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks my Department have been restructured on a regional basis and one of the main aims of this reorganisation is to bring a more localised and a more speedy service to the public. This localisation process will involve the concept of the one stop shop where members of the public will be able to apply for any social welfare payment, including Old Age Non-Contributory Pension, and have decisions on entitlement made locally.  This procedure will further speed up the delivery process.</P>
    <P>My Department have this year recruited 25 new investigative staff and these are being used in conjunction with the new structural arrangements to speed up the delivery of all our assistance services.</P>

      <P>The Government are committed to introducing a universal ID system based on extending the current revenue and social insurance number (that is RSI number) to every resident.  A good deal of progress towards the realisation of this objective has already been made.</P>
      <P>The function of assigning RSI numbers has been transferred from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to my Department.  This transfer of responsibility took place in April of this year and the new system is working well.</P>
      <P>In the past, RSI numbers were only assigned to people taking up employment. This meant that RSI numbers were confined to people who were in the social insurance scheme.  However, my Department are now allocating RSI numbers to other categories of social welfare clients, such as persons receiving social welfare assistance and to persons on FÁS courses.</P>
      <P>It has also been decided to assign RSI numbers to young people in respect of whom child benefit is or was being paid. This means that most people in future will have an RSI number before they actually start work.  This represents a major step forward towards extending the system of all residents.  At this stage RSI numbers have been allocated to most young people in the 16 to 20 years old age group.  It is also intended to issue RSI numbers to spouses of insured people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with these changes, I am arranging to replace the existing cardboard registration card with a more durable plastic registration card which can be <Col N="660" /> used by people when they have occasion to contact Social Welfare or Revenue. The new card will facilitate quick and accurate retrieval of a person's record and enable speedier processing of claims. Initially this card will be issued mainly to the younger age group and extended to other age groups in due course.</P>
    <P>On the question of the compatibility of the computer systems used by the Revenue Commissioners and my Department, there is already a huge flow of data between the two offices.  This transfer is achieved by means of magnetic tape which is still considered to be the most appropriate arrangement for these purposes. There is no particular need for a more direct link between the computers at present but the matter is kept under review.  Where the circumstances warrant, my Department have sophisticated computer-to-computer links to other agencies.  In general, these linkages have been provided to facilitate a faster and more integrated service to social welfare clients who contact community welfare officers, FÁS, and who make claims for redundancy payments.</P>

      <P>Disability benefit climants are referred at intervals for examination by my Department's medical referees.  The vast majority of claimants would be referred for such an examination at least once, and possibly more often, during their first 12 months on disability benefit.  If a medical referee considers the disability to be permanent, the client is invited to apply for invalidity pension, provided he or she has been on disability benefit (DB) for 12 months and meets the contribution conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In certain cases, it is not possible to predict the future course of the disease <Col N="661" /> or disability.  Such cases are referred for re-examination at intervals determined by the medical referee in each individual case.  However, any client who has been on disability benefit for 12 months or more can apply to be transferred to invalidity pension.  On receipt of such applications, a further medical examination is carried out to see if suitability for invalidity pension can be established at that stage.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware my Department have in recent years been engaged in a programme of works aimed at providing new offices and replacing or improving existing offices.  The main objective of this programme is to improve facilities for the staff and members of the public who use them.  In the design of new and refurbished offices particular attention is being paid to the provision of facilities for privacy at new claims reception areas and at points where interviews with applicants are conducted.</P>
      <P>Since 1987 ten new offices have been provided all of which include facilities for interviews to be held in private.  In addition, nine others have been extensively refurbished in this period and seven more have had improvements to deal specifically with privacy.  The number of offices with specific privacy facilities will be progressively increased as part of the ongoing improvement programme. In all cases where particularly sensitive business is being conducted, staff are conscious of the need for privacy and endeavour to ensure that business in these cases is conducted with due regard to the dignity of, and the need for privacy for, the claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, construction work on <Col N="663" /> another new office is in progress while one refurbishment project is nearing completion.  It is planned to start work on three new offices and to refurbish three others within the next 12 months. All of these offices will incorporate privacy facilities for the public.</P>
    <P>This programme of improvement is being advanced as quickly as technical and financial resources will allow and it will continue until the same improved standard of facilities is available at all the Department's local offices.</P>

      <P>The Pensions Act, 1990, which came into effect in January this year safeguards the interests of members of occupational pension schemes by setting down minimum standards which all schemes will have to comply with.  It provides for a regulatory framework for the future supervision of pension schemes.</P>
      <P>The specific objectives of the Act are: The establishment of a new statutory board to monitor and supervise the new statutory requirements; the introduction of aspects of a system of compulsory preservation and revaluation of pension entitlements of members who change employments; the introduction of a statutory minimum funding standard for certain funded schemes; the mandatory disclosure of information to scheme members; clarification of the directives and responsibilities of scheme trustees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new minimum funding standard is designed to ensure that over a period <Col N="664" /> there are sufficient funds in a scheme to meet liabilities in the event of the scheme being wound up.  Under the disclosure provisions the trustees of a scheme are required to produce annual reports and audited accounts on their scheme and to disclose a comprehensive range of other information to members concerning the operation and the financial procedures of the scheme.  There are strict penalties for trustees of schemes who fail to comply with the regulations.  I am satisfied that these new measures will provide adequately for the security of member's pension entitlements.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of the difficulties experienced by pension funds/managers in recent times in relation to the investment of pension fund assets.  These difficulties can be directly attributed to the effects on pension funds of the collapse of global equity markets in the wake of the Gulf crisis.  However, despite this setback the indications are that pension funds have produced substantial real returns over the last decade.</P>

      <Quest>if he has given consideration to the plight of many married women who were forced to leave their jobs prior to 1973 because of the marriage ban, many of whom subsequently re-entered the workforce but who now find on retirement that they are ineligible for contributory retirement pensions because of the break in their contribution record during that period.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of women who ceased employment prior to 1973 because of the marriage ban would have been employed in public service type employment and accordingly would have paid PRSI contributions at the modified rate of insurance.  This rate of contribution provides entitlement to widows and orphans pensions but not to contributory retirement or old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If at a subsequent date they re-entered the workforce at the full rate of social <Col N="665" /> insurance contribution, that date would in the normal course be their date of entry for pension purposes and they would not be affected by the break in their insurance record.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in the Social Welfare Act, 1991, to provide <i>pro-rata</i> pensions to persons with a mixture of full and modified contributions.  The necessary regulations to give effect to this provision are being finalised at present. Women who were affected by the marriage ban and who subsequently re-entered the workforce could qualify under these arrangements for a <i>pro rata</i> pension if they do not qualify for a retirement or old age contributiory pension under normal criteria.</P>
    <P>The whole area of conditions for entitlement to pensions, including the question of pension coverage for people who leave the workforce for periods and return, is being examined at present by the National Pensions Board.  I expect to receive the board's final report shortly. Any changes in the contribution conditions for pensions will be considered in the light of the board's recommendations in this area.</P>

      <P>The medical care scheme is a part of the occupational injuries scheme and provides for a refund of the cost of medical care and attention required as a result of an accident or a prescribed disease developed at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the conditions of the scheme benefit is limited to the costs of medical care and attention which are not met <Col N="666" /> under the health acts or under the social welfare treatment benefit scheme.  The claimant is required to give notice of intention to claim within six weeks of commencement of the course of medical care.</P>
    <P>The medical care for which expenses may be claimed are as follows: doctor's visits; doctor's prescriptions; certain medical or surgical appliances such as artificial limbs or hearing aids and their repair or replacement; certain dental and optical treatment; specialist care where not met under the Health Acts; certain qualified nursing at home or on the instructions of a doctor; certain treatments prescribed by a doctor; certain travelling expenses, which are usually limited to the cost of public transport.</P>
    <P>Notice of claim for medical care can be given by writing or lodging a completed form, available as part of the medical care information leaflet SW 34 which also sets out the qualifying conditions.  Very few complaints have been received concerning lack of information or difficulties in claiming medical care.</P>
    <P>Most claims under the occupation injury scheme first present themselves as claims to injury benefit, which is a weekly payment during periods of incapacity in the six months following the accident or onset of a prescribed disease.

      <P>There is no provision under social welfare legislation which would permit orphan's pension to continue beyond the age of 21 years.  Orphan's pension is payable up to 18 years in all cases and payment can continue during periods of fulltime education up to 21 years of age.</P>
      <P>There was a delay in identifying a person who was willing to act as guardian for the purpose of child benefit in this case.  Recently a guardian for this purpose was appointed by my Department and arrears of child benefit, totalling £180.60, have been paid to the guardian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to an administrative error there was a delay in paying arrears or orphan's pension for a period in 1990.  The case <Col N="668" /> was complicated by the loss of the pension book, a change in relation to the person entitled to receive the pension and the arrangements which had to be made to continue payment after age 18 when it has been established that the orphan concerned was continuing in full time education.  Additional arrears of £307.40 are due to her for this period and she should receive a cheque for this amount shortly.</P>
    <P>Changes are being introduced to streamline the continuation of payments up to age 21 in full time education cases. I believe that these new measures will eliminate delays such as arose in this case.</P>

      <P>Appeals against the decisions under the social welfare system are dealt with by the social welfare appeals office which is an independent office established in September 1990.</P>
      <P>The social welfare appeals office receives approximately 18,000 appeals each year of which about half are dealt with as oral hearings.  An important feature of the appeals system is that oral hearings are kept as simple and as informal as possible.  For that reason, appellants may bring along to the oral hearing any bona fide person with a genuine interest in the case to speak on their behalf.  In the normal course that would include solicitors, accountants, trade union officials, public representatives or doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> Where a client has such professional representation, the appeals officer may make an award towards expenses.  In the circumstances, as there is already provision for the award of expenses by an appeals officer to the professional representative of an appellant, I do not propose to make any changes regarding representation at appeal hearings.</P>

      <P>An application for retirement pension was received from the person concerned in May 1990.  This was refused in July 1990 as he failed to satisfy the contribution conditions of the scheme &mdash; his yearly average of 17 contributions from 1955 to 1990 was too low.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for minimum rate retirement pension, a person must have a yearly average of at least 24 contributions. To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions. There is no record of contributions paid in respect of the person concerned for the year 1957 and from 1959 to 1975 and this accounts for the low yearly average in his case.</P>
      <P>The person concerned subsequently provided additional information regarding the period 1954 to 1958.  However, following extensive investigations by the social welfare officer earlier this year it was determined that the person concerned was not in insurable employment during this period.</P>
      <P>The person concerned may be entitled to an old age non-contributory pension. In this regard, an application form for this pension was issued to him recently. As soon as this is completed and returned to my Department, his entitlement will be examined and he will be notified of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The benefits payable under an occupational pension scheme in the event of a member's death while in service are determined by the provisions made in the rules of each scheme.</P>
      <P>With the exception of public sector pension schemes the State plays no part in deciding on the rules and benefit provisions of occupational pension schemes. These are entirely a matter for the members and their employers.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of pension schemes make some provision for the death in service of a member.  This mainly comprises of a lump sum payment expressed as a multiple of the deceased member's salary and, in addition, may include a pension payable to the deceased member's spouse or dependant.  It is normal practice in the case of a single member for the lump sum benefit to be paid to the deceased member's estate. However, in many schemes payment of the pension element is conditional on the deceased member having been married.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the media article to which the Deputy refers but I have not seen the report to which it relates.</P>
      <P>It would be erroneous to assume that medical graduates who emigrate do so because they are dissatisfied with career opportunities here.  There has been a longstanding tradition of young Irish doctors going abroad to centres of excellence to gain valuable experience and hone their skills.  The vast majority of these return home in due course to take up senior posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a number of manpower issues alluded to in the article which, I accept, need to be addressed in the context of a structured medical manpower planning exercise.  Such an exercise was initiated by my predecessor shortly before he left office and an expert group under the chairmanship of the chief medical officer of my Department have recently commenced work on the matter.  All of the issues referred to in the media article together with some others are being fully taken into account by the expert group. I look forward to receiving their report <Col N="677" /> and recommendations as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Ireland participates in an EC pilot project which collects a range of information on home and leisure accidents.  The European Home and Leisure Accident Surveillance System (EHLASS) gathers data through the casualty departments of two Irish hospitals &mdash; Cork Regional and Castlebar General.  Sports injuries, including rugby, are included in the survey.</P>
      <P>The article referred to by the Deputy (British Medical Journal, volume 303, 2 November 1991) indicates that the main advantages of such a register would be to identify the most frequent causes of injury and to see how the rules and practices of the game could be modified to reduce the risk of occurrence.  The article also envisages that it is the relevant sporting organisations which would establish a register of this type.  It notes that this was the approach taken in the United States in relation to American football.</P>
