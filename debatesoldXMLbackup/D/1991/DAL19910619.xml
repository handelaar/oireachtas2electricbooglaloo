      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 2, 3, 7, 10 and 11.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that: (1) business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m. tonight; (2) the following arrangements shall apply for the debate on No. 7: (a) speeches, which shall be confined to the main spokesperson nominated by each of the groups as defined in Standing Order 89 (1) (a) shall not exceed 15 minutes, and (b) the concluding speech of the Minister for Justice shall not exceed five minutes and (3) the proceedings on the Committee Stage of No. 10, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 10.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Justice.

      <P>In view of the suggestion that we may not have business to fully take up the time of the House tomorrow, will the Taoiseach agree to give time this week for the debate he promised on affairs in the European Community before the Summit?  There is an urgent necessity for us to discuss the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy which could cost this country 16,000 industrial jobs and 22,000 farm jobs.  Does the Taoiseach not agree that this matter must be discussed at the Summit and that this House must be given the opportunity of putting forward its views on the matter to him before he goes to the Summit?</P>

      <P>On a similar and related matter, I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that the 34th and 35th reports on developments in the European Communities have come to hand in recent days.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that these reports should form the basis of a debate in this House.  Like Deputy Bruton, I too will be requesting a debate if the House does not have adequate business to keep it employed tomorrow.  The Taoiseach will not be available for such a debate tomorrow but we should use the 34th and 35th reports as the basis for a debate on developments in the European Community at the earliest possible date.  Such a debate has to recognise the serious difficulties this country is facing in relation to European developments.</P>

    <Title>Select Committee on Crime: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P> (1)  That a Select Committee, which shall be called the Select Committee on Crime, consisting of 15 members of Dáil Éireann, none of whom shall be a member of the Government or Minister of State, be established to examine such aspects of</P>
      <P> (a) the administration of justice,</P>
      <P>(b) the implementation of the criminal law, and</P>
      <P>(c) existing legislation </P>
      <P>as, in the opinion of the Select Committee, affect the personal safety and security of our citizens in their homes, on the streets and in public places and to report thereon, with recommendations where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  That in the absence from a particular meeting of the Select Committee of a member, another member nominated by the Party to which the absent member belongs may take part <Col N="2303" /> in the proceedings and vote in the members' stead.</P>
    <P>(3)  That every report which the Select Committee proposes to make shall, on adoption by the Select Committee, be laid before the House forthwith, whereupon the Select Committee shall be empowered to print and publish such report together with such related documents as it thinks fit. </P>
    <P>That four members of the Select Committee shall form a quorum. </P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the Select Committee on Crime and I wish the Committee well in their task.  I can assure the House that the Committee will receive my full co-co-operation and that of my Department and I look forward to considering any reports which come within my area of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately crime affects every modern democratic society and Ireland is no exception.  Crime in this country reached an unprecedented level in 1983 when 102,387 indictable crimes were recorded.  Our crime rate has been brought down considerably since then by a combination of Government action and by effective Garda strategies.  The provision figure for recorded crime in 1990 was 87,658 &mdash; almost 15 per cent less than in 1983.</P>
    <P>This crime situation met with a determined response and the level of crime has consequently been dramatically reduced. What has been shown is that crime will not be tolerated in this country and that the State has the resources and the knowhow to deal with various crime trends which have emerged from time to time. I am satisfied that crime is being tackled in the right way but one can never become complacent.  New criminal activities are always awaiting the opportunity to emerge and the situation must be constantly monitored.</P>
    <P>In saying this I am aware, of course, that the indications so far this year are that crime in Dublin is increasing and that some areas have been particularly <Col N="2304" /> badly hit.  It is important to make the point that estimated figures gathered over a relatively short period for particular areas cannot be regarded as being firmly indicative of a longer term trend. However, I am concerned about the increase and I am having on-going discussions with the commissioner on the subject.  He has informed me that a number of measures are being taken to deal with the situation, including deployment of specialist units and patrols to the worst affected areas.  I am satisfied that these measures will prove successful but I am arranging that the situation will be carefully watched and whatever further action may be necessary will be taken to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Crime and disorder are not, of course, purely features of modern life.  Indeed, they have troubled every society since time began.  What has changed through history has been the means by which different nations have coped with crime and indeed, defined it.</P>
    <P>Democracies like ours have a body of laws and State institutions to protect the public and treat the offender, having first established his or her guilt by due process. The primary agency in law enforcement worldwide is the police service, but any study of the crime situation in Ireland which ignores the role of the probation service, the courts and prison service is only dealing with a segment of our response to the problem.</P>
    <P>I do acknowledge, however, that like every other study on crime this Committee will be forced to dwell heavily on the powers, strength and deployment of the gardaí.  Despite our history prior to independence, policing in this jurisdiction has been carried out under native Government with the consent, indeed usually the active support, of our people. Since its inception, the Garda Síochána have enjoyed this privileged position. The Force's prudent leadership down the years has, if anything, enhanced their standing in all the communities in which their members have served.  The decision to keep the gardaí unarmed to the greatest extent possible, taken early on, has stood the test of time.  It has served, I <Col N="2305" /> believe, to generate great public respect for and confidence in this national institution.</P>
    <P>In modern times the emphasis on community oriented policing practices, from juvenile liaison to Neighbourhood Watch to community alert schemes has also helped to maintain support for the fight against crime and has indeed kept crime levels in Ireland far below the European norm.</P>
    <P>I would be very wary of any proposal put to this new Committee for a major departure in the present style of policing by the gardaí.  International experience suggests that the &ldquo;gung-ho&rdquo; approach to policing does not work even if, in the early stages, such methods appear to be physically effective.  I propose to look at a number of what I would characterise as the &ldquo;gung-ho&rdquo; ideas which may be floated to this Committee and to explain why I would counsel caution in respect of them.</P>
    <P>The first such catch cry will be that we need far more gardaí than the Government are committed to recruiting at present.  In fact, the number of gardaí in the Force is fast approaching a record number between members serving and in training.  The difference now is that far more Garda time is being spent on the beat, thanks to an influx of 250 civilian staff to release members of the Force from desk work.</P>
    <P>The final couple of hundred of the 1,000 young men and women recruited since 1989 will go through the gates of Templemore for the first time this side of Christmas.  Not long after that, the new entrants from this year's recruitment campaign to bring in another 1,000 gardaí will commence their training.  This heavy flow of young people into the Force coupled with the retirement age extension currently in force for gardaí, sergeants and inspectors would appear to any reasonable observer as a solid earnest of the Government's determination to keep Garda numbers up to strength.</P>
    <P>I would really question the wisdom and indeed the practicality of increasing the Force more rapidly than we are already doing at the moment.  Let us look for a moment at the ratio of gardaí to the <Col N="2306" /> population at present.  In fact, it stands at one garda to every 335 people, which is a high ratio by any reckoning.</P>
    <P>While appropriate deployment of the Force is a constant preoccupation of Garda management, I do not think anyone in this House will make a justified proposal for a significantly higher proportion of gardaí within the population. The taxpayer simply could not possibly afford it.</P>
    <P>In the current year some £230 million is committed for the payment of wages and associated allowances for members of the Force.  Every extra 1,000 members attested to the Force would cost £20 million per annum more, not counting transport, kit and equipment costs plus, of course, pensions payments further down the line.  Realistically, what we have to do as a society is to get the best possible value from the police service we have.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated my opposition to another &ldquo;gung-ho&rdquo; type suggestion which could be put to this Committee, namely, arming the gardaí in significant numbers.  I believe this would be a retrograde step which ironically could increase the risk of gardaí getting killed or injured by armed criminals.  The casualty levels experienced in armed police services worldwide are frankly horrific.</P>
    <P>I am equally sceptical of the draconian legal approach which is sometimes advocated as a panacea to urban crime.  This style of policing tends to incur widespread disaffection in the community and ultimately becomes counterproductive.  We do not want the gardaí to end up sowing dragons' teeth &mdash; in terms of long term hostility &mdash; in the communities among which the members of the Force must live and serve.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge there is a need at present for more custodial spaces especially for juvenile offenders.  This problem is being tackled.  In the case of the acute lack of spaces for juvenile offenders, 45 new places will be available in the Department of Education's special school facility at Lusk, County Dublin, this September.  The physical work necessary for these places is already at an <Col N="2307" /> advanced stage.  The intensive supervision by court appointed probation officers and the community service order system is paying tremendous dividends in the treatment of offenders.  This response to crime rarely grabs the headlines and may fail to impress the more reactionary observers, but its best defence is that it works in the majority of cases and that it is far less capital intensive than the custodial remedies which must remain as the last resort.</P>
    <P>In counselling this new Oireachtas Committee against accepting simplistic solutions to complex problems, I would commend positive consideration of the micro and macro factors which lead to crime in our society.  Of course, Ireland suffers, like every modern society, from a rising degree of anti-social behaviour compared to past experience.  The reasons are complex.  On the macro side, we must consider general economic and social conditions.  There is also a general search for new values coupled with a tendency to reject existing authorities and traditions.  On the micro side this social unease manifests itself in a failure by families to stick together and a refusal by parents to control their children.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, our criminal justice system is forced to deal every day with the fall out from these social problems. No narrow approach solution will work in dealing with these issues.  The House can be assured, however, that all the institutions for which I have any responsibility as Minister for Justice are developing new strategies on a continuous basis to deal with the law enforcement consequences of our social problems.  These institutions are also more open to new ideas in this respect than is generally acknowledged.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the sterling work of our probation service and to the community service orders made by our courts which afford the offender a chance to make practical reparation for his offence.</P>
    <P>A Juvenile Justice Bill will be introduced by me next year to update the whole legal approach to young offenders. <Col N="2308" /> In the meantime, I am invoking the powers conferred on me as Minister for Justice under the 1908 Children Act to bring in new rules of court which will change the regime in regard to the attendance of the parents or guardians of young offenders at juvenile court hearings.</P>
    <P>A number of other initiatives to address the problems underlying crime and lawlessness in certain areas have been established or encouraged by me in recent times.  I would include in this regard the Garda schools programme and special Garda/Probation Service/Community programmes in Ballyfermot, Coolock and Darndale in Dublin and Southill in Limerick.  In the coming days, I will be launching two more initiative of this type in the Killinarden and Ronanstown areas of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the demands which today's society places on the administration of justice and I have been actively involved in ensuring that a body of legislation is enacted to update and revise existing outmoded laws and provide legislation which can protect our people against the type of criminality which tends to develop in a modern society.  I have no doubt that the committee will wish to take account of these developments in their deliberations.</P>
    <P>I would like to signal some recent important developments in this regard: the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990 and the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>The Garda must also have laws which address crime as it is carried out in our modern society and by which convictions can be obtained fairly and competently. Such laws as these would include: the Criminal Justice Forensic Evidence Act, 1990 and the Larceny Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>The committee will, I am sure, be interested in my proposed legislation for the freezing, seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime.</P>

In the case of drug trafficking in particular, <Col N="2309" /> it has been increasingly recognised that the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; approach is not enough and that what is required is the power to deprive the trafficker of the fruits of his enterprise.</P>
      <P>The committee will, I am sure, also be interested to know that the Law Reform Commission are currently in the process of finalising their review of the law relating to dishonesty generally.  The Government are awaiting the commission's final recommendations in this whole area with interest and it is the intention to modernise our law in this regard, particularly to combat so-called white collar crime and computer-based fraud.</P>
      <P>Legislation already enacted and the proposals being considered at present are an indication of the progress being made in a very comprehensive programme of criminal law reform.  These developments will form important cornerstones of the legislative framework of our new Irish society.</P>
      <P>Central to that framework is the provision of the right balance in providing the Garda with the resources and legislative backing to fight crime in the modern setting while at the same time recognising the rights of the individual and the long term interests of our cherished democratic society.</P>
      <P>If you will allow me, a Cheann Comhairle, I will also deal with Deputy Higgins's amendment proposing that the committee should have the power to send for persons, papers and records.  This is a very wide-ranging and extensive power, which, in my view, is not appropriate in the case of this particular committee.  It was not included in the terms of reference of the previous Select Committee on Crime and I fail to see why it should be included in the powers of this committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference of this committee are concerned with aspects of the administration of justice and the implementation of the criminal law. These are sensitive and delicate areas which involve such agencies as the Garda Síochána, the law officers and the courts. The confidential and, in many respects, independent nature of the way these <Col N="2310" /> agencies operate places them in a different category from other agencies of the State.</P>
    <P>It is difficult, for example, to see how persons directly involved in the administration of justice and the implementation of the criminal law could appear before the committee, or produce papers and records for the committee, and have a full and frank exchange without compromising the very way in which they perform their duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long-established practice that the Minister for Justice does not report to the Houses on the progress of Garda investigations or on the decisions of the DPP to prosecute or not to prosecute in particular cases.  In such circumstances, it is hardly appropriate that information which would normally be withheld from the House in the public interest could be the subject of examination and discussion by a committee of the House.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from that, I do not believe that the committee need to have such access in order to succeed in fulfilling their terms of reference.  The committee are charged with producing recommendations affecting the personal safety and security of our citizens in their homes, on the streets and in public places and there is sufficient scope within these terms of reference to allow the members a wide-ranging brief in their examination. Therefore, a Cheann Comhairle, I oppose the amendment as proposed by Deputy Higgins.</P>
      <P>Those are my considered views concerning the work which the committee will soon have before them.  In concluding, I would like to again say that I welcome the establishment of this committee and I assure members of my co-operation and that of the officials in my Department in their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add to the motion the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2311" /> (5)  That the Select Committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records and, subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance, to engage the services of persons with specialised or technical knowledge to assist it.</P>
    <P>(6)  That the Committee, previous to the commencement of business, shall elect one of its members to be Chairman who shall be a member of the Opposition and who shall have only one vote. </P>
    <P>Fine Gael very much welcome the reestablishment of the all-party Dáil committee on crime after an inexplicable lapse of four years.  I wish to express my concern and that of the Fine Gael Party at certain parts of the Minister's speech where he appeared to be blatantly setting the agenda for the committee.  During the past few years Fine Gael have put forward a reason why the committee were not reconstituted following the change of Government in 1987.  We suspected that that would not have been to the liking of the Minister for Justice or the officials of his Department.  The Minister confirmed this view during the course of his speech.  It is unfair of him in reestablishing the committee to attempt to set the agenda.  I hope the committee will bear this in mind during the course of their deliberations and in setting their own agenda in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The Government never put forward a reason or an excuse why the Dáil should not select an all-party committee on crime.  It is sad that the setting up of the committee and in particular the choice of their chairperson has been something of a political football.  It is a great pity that the Government have not followed precedent on this occasion with regard to the Chair and obviated the need for Fine Gael to spell out the position of the chairperson, in the form of an amendment, to the House.  It is important that the committee have sufficient teeth to be powerful while it is essential that they have the power to send for persons, papers and records and to engage the <Col N="2312" /> services of experts to assist them.  It suits the Minister &mdash; he as much as said it himself &mdash; to have a committee who do not have wide-ranging powers.  This is sad having regard to the need for us on all sides of the House to examine the criminal law process with a view to updating our laws and addressing the problem of crime within society.</P>
    <P>I should say in passing that it is regrettable that a foreign affairs committee is not being constituted at the same time but, as the House is aware, that was to be the consolation prize for Deputy Brian Lenihan.  However that was withdrawn following the publication of a book on the events of last autumn.  I understand that the chair has been offered to the junior partner in Government and testimony to that is the presence of a member of the Progressive Democrats for a justice debate which is something we have not seen for quite some time.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Government have re-established the committee is reprehensible and creates a very bad precedent. The record of the House testifies to the fact that on decisions of this nature all-party discussions take place with a view to reaching consensus.  For the Government to take the chair is unacceptable and Fine Gael oppose this move in the strongest possible terms.  We believe it is disgraceful, just because the Government have a slender majority in the House, that they are prepared to exercise autocratic dominance and choose a member of one of the Government parties to chair the committee.</P>
    <P>The House has an opportunity this morning to vote for the Fine Gael amendment in order to ensure, in accordance with the best traditions of the House, that the chair of an important select committee is held by a member of the Opposition, in particular the Opposition spokesperson on Justice.  That having been said, the committee have a great deal of work to do and I trust they will get down to business in the next few weeks.  The matters I would like to see addressed are numerous, and to name but a few we have to address the entire <Col N="2313" /> function and operation of our criminal courts; the powers to appeal a lenient sentence; the setting up of a law reform commission to deal solely and exclusively with criminal legal matters; the future of rural Garda stations; the sad reality of the under-nourished Garda fraud squad; the European dimension with particular reference to the opening of our borders after 1992 and its consequences; the prison system and places of detention, with particular reference to the recommendations in the Whitaker report much of which has been left on the back burner for many years.  The criminal justice system is clearly not working and there is vast room for improvement in terms of modernising and codifying the criminal legal process.  The criminals are walking our streets because of our outdated legal system.  I believe the committee must look at the whole administration of justice and ask why people become criminals and the reason that people from a certain socio-economic background and residents in certain areas turn to criminal activity more than people from other areas.</P>
    <P>The committee should look at the role of the education system <i>vis-à-vis</i> the criminal law and the role, function and responsibility of parents in the matter of juvenile crime.  The committee must take a serious and hard look at what the Director of Public Prosecutions called some time ago our outdated legal system inherited from another regime.  The committee should also examine the right to silence, the bail laws and other mechanisms that can be exploited by criminals to avoid being brought to justice.</P>
    <P>The committee must also examine the wide disparity in sentencing policy being handed down by our courts.  In my view similar sentences should be imposed for similar offences.  The attitude adopted by various judges in a given set of circumstances is in many ways inconsistent and gives rise to serious concern.  There needs to be more consistency in sentencing policy and guidelines should be drawn up for the benefit of the Judiciary. If these guidelines are not going to be drawn up by the Judiciary themselves, <Col N="2314" /> the matter has to be taken on board by some other group.  It is regrettable that for many years we have had this disparity in sentencing from the courts and that the Judiciary themselves have not addressed the problem which I believe it is their duty to do.</P>
    <P>The whole method of punishment should come under scrutiny.  Are people being taken out of society and incarcerated to penalise them or to protect society?  Where does rehabilitation fit into the criminal justice system?  The cost of maintaining a person in prison has been widely publicised and we must ask whether we should be making more use of community service orders or could we look at new forms of detention, for example, confinement by use of electronic tagging or other systems.</P>
    <P>This committee have a great deal of work to do, and I hope the committee which has been approved by this House this morning will sit at the earliest opportunity. The area to be covered is enormous and I hope that these matters will be addressed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The committee will work effectively only if it is not seen to be a tool of the Minister for Justice.  I am fearful in view of what the Minister has said here this morning that the Government are insisting that the chair of the committee be held by a member of one of the Government parties.  The committee must not be choked but allowed to discuss across party lines the various matters on the agenda.  The committee must not be interfered with or stage-managed by the Minister or the Department of Justice. The fact that the chair will be held by a member of one of the Government parties gives rise to the fear that the committee will be little more than a puppet of the Minister.  It was in view of this that I formally moved the Fine Gael amendment.</P>
    <P>I wish to share the remainder of the time available to me with my colleagues, Deputies Shatter and Barrett, subject to the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

I must refer again to the decision of the House this morning that speeches shall be confined to the main spokesperson &mdash; singular &mdash; nominated by each of the groups as defined in Standing Order 89 (1) (a).  That is the predicament the Chair finds itself in.  Normally the Chair would be only too happy to allow this, subject to its acceptance by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;subject to the agreement of the House.  The Minister has indicated his intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as I have said, I hope this Committee on Crime will not be prevented from dealing with the very important matters that they will face over the coming months.  The record of the previous committee, the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism from 1982-87, speaks for itself.  That committee was very workmanlike in their deliberations and produced a number of very important reports, many of which have been acted upon by the Department of Justice.  If we are going to seriously tackle the problems of crime and seriously debate the roots of crime in the society, we have to take an all-party approach in the form of a select committee. Over the past number of years &mdash; and it is the Fine Gael policy for many years &mdash; that we would have as many select committees as possible representing the views of Members from all sides to deal with matters of a particular hue.  Between the years 1982-87 we had more committees than we ever had in the life of any other Government and the chair of these committees was held by a <Col N="2317" /> member of the Opposition, particularly by the Opposition spokesperson, in this case the Opposition spokesperson on Justice.</P>
    <P>On the reintroduction of this committee after a four year lapse it is sad that it has become something of a plum or perk between the Government parties and that we have had the unedifying internal wrangling over the past number of months as to which party should get the chair.  It has not been formally announced as yet who will be the chairperson of this committee and we still hear that the chairperson will be decided by the members of the committee on the first day that the committee meet.  Everybody knows that the selection of the chairperson is a <i>fait accompli</i> and that the Government, in accordance with the tradition and practice of the House and in accordance with precedent, will have an eight:seven majority, so the chair of the committee will be held by the nominee proposed by the Government.  That suits the Minister for Justice, it suits Fianna Fáil.  I have no doubt it will suit the Progressive Democrats who have twisted the arm of Fianna Fáil on this issue.  It is sad for the working, the practices and the traditions of this House that the Select Committee on Crime cannot have an Opposition spokesperson on Justice as chairperson.  In 1982 there was no objection from Fine Gael or the Labour Party when the name of Deputy Woods was proposed; in fact, there was all-party agreement on it before the committee was constituted.  There was absolutely no difficulty on that occasion.  Why is there a difficulty now?  Why has there been a difficulty in setting up this committee over the past four years?</P>
    <P>The reason has been adverted to by the Minister in the course of his speech this morning when he said he would be very wary indeed of any proposal by this new committee for a major departure from the present style of policing by the Garda. The Minister saw fit to come to this House and set down markers as to what this committee may or may not discuss. Are we dealing with a situation where the Select Committee on Crime will deal <Col N="2318" /> only with matters which have the consent and formal approval of the Minister for Justice?  Will the Minister for Justice be lurking in the background at every move this committee might make over the coming months?  If so that is regrettable. I hope this committee will set about dealing with the vast amount of work that must be undertaken and I have made reference to some of that work so far as the entire criminal legal process is concerned.</P>

      <P>Having moved the amendment which I think would give extra powers and the necessary teeth to this important committee I reaffirm my regret, and that of the Fine Gael Party, that the chair of that committee will not be allocated to the Opposition spokesperson on Justice, in accordance with the precedent and traditions of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the belated moving of this motion.  It seeks to establish the Select Committee on Crime.  It is an issue we have pursued in this House over a great many months.  It is with regret that this issue which should be the basis of consensus in this House has been allowed by the Government parties to become one of dissent and conflict.  We are united in a common purpose in relation to crime. It is a matter that affects all of us and if it is to be defeated it can be done only by way of common cause.  For this committee which was to be a very important mechanism in the fight against crime to be used for party political ends in a divisive manner by the Government is nothing short of deplorable.  It impinges on the whole issue of reform.  For some years there have been signals from the Government that they are interested in Dáil reform and in making this legislative assembly more efficient and more effective in carrying out the duties placed on us by the electorate.  Quite candidly, as <Col N="2319" /> my party's representative on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the sub-committee on Dáil Reform, the utterances of the Government more often than not have been hollow, without meaning, without intent and without purpose.</P>
      <P>One of the prime areas signalled years ago to make this House more relevant, to involve all the Members of this House in the business of legislation and in the monitoring and scrutiny of Government and of the agents of the State, was to be a comprehensive series of committees to work in conjunction with Ministers and the Government Departments to sharpen focus and to keep the element of public accountability to the fore.  Surely one of the first areas which would have demanded the attention of this House is crime and crime prevention.  Yet, it was seen necessary by the Government parties, for petty reasons, to deprive the Opposition parties of the chair of that committee, to put on the long finger this important committee almost indefinitely. The matter became nothing less than a standing joke to be raised either on the Floor of this House on the Order of Business or during Whips' meetings on a Thursday morning when various reasons were proffered either by the Taoiseach or a Government spokesman on the Order of Business, when he bothered to give any reason at all, or by the Government Chief Whip to the other Whips. There was no reason this motion should not have been before us a year ago other than the pettiness of trying to grab every chair for the two parties in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between 1982 and 1987 the committee system worked very well.  It has been promised it would be expanded because of the success of that experiment on the basis of a consensus approach to it.  The chair of each committee is of utmost importance.  Many of the most effective committees established in this Dáil have Opposition chairpersons.  Unfortunately, not a single committee is chaired currently by a member of the Labour Party. That is unprecedented since these committees were established.  There seems to <Col N="2320" /> be a view that a chair from this side of the House, or from this section of the House, might be too effective for this Minister or this Government.</P>
    <P>As we are approaching the establishment of this committee I appeal to the Government to think again and to allow somebody who has the respect of every party in this House &mdash; if not every Member of this House &mdash; to chair this committee.  We had almost arrived at that position.  I do not think I am breaking any secrets when I say that the proposal of the Labour Party that Deputy Liam Kavanagh would chair this committee was agreed by the Opposition parties and I thought it was on the way to being agreed by the Government.  Their delay in moving forward obviously signalled something deeper and clearly somewhere along the lines outside the Whips' offices &mdash; perhaps in the office of the Minister for Justice &mdash; that suggestion was shot down.  Because of that decision, wherever it was made, I regret that this committee was simply put in cold storage. The real issue of crime in this country, both urban and rural, was allowed to go unmonitored by the democratic procedures of this House.</P>
    <P>We are frustrated repeatedly by the lack of mechanisms in this House to focus on issues that are of utmost relevance to the people we represent.  That may well suit Government.  I know when we go into recess for three or four months the Government sigh with relief because they cannot be scrutinised on the day-to-day running affairs of this country.  There is a tendency within Government and within the bureaucracy of Government to resist any form of scrutiny, any form of further review, by the elected Members of this House or the other House.  That is an attitude we have to change.  I thought some years ago we were building towards that change by consensus in this House.</P>
    <P>I regret that the view expressed by the Government's inaction on this issue in recent months shows all too clearly that the old stale tradition of secrecy, lack of monitoring, lack of openness, is still all too rampant in the present Coalition, at least in theory, a certain element are <Col N="2321" /> committed to scrutiny and the notion of open Government, although even on that score their conscience could not be matched by their actions in relation to the Ethics in Government Bill which was put before the House a short few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>The issue of crime has captured the imagination of the people who suffer from it.  The Minister's speech today smacks of further complacency.  It was complacent of the Minister to put the setting up of this Committee to one side for months on end, but that might have suited his own ends.  For him to come here and give what to me sounds like a smug, self-satisfied statement that all is well, is consistent with his annual reports that seem to suggest serious crime is on the decline.  However, in spite of the fall in the number of serious crimes committed, the overall crime statistics for last year show a 1 per cent increase largely due to the increase in petty crime &mdash; joyriding, community vandalism, street intimidation and attacks on the elderly. Nothing will sap public morale, intimidate people and destroy communities than that type of petty crime.</P>
    <P>Major crimes, such as bank robberies, have to be addressed but they do not create the same level of fear in the community, especially among elderly people &mdash; as those petty crimes to which I have referred &mdash; who do not feel secure or feel they cannot walk the streets of our towns in safety.  I have done a great deal of canvassing in recent weeks and I know these people do not feel secure even in our rural areas where thuggery and intimidation seem to have become rampant.</P>
    <P>We have to preserve communities.  We have lost sight of this goal in the greater Dublin area for a number of reasons, many of them environmental.  We have broken down the sharp focus on the small community where people had heart, and interacted with one another.  We have lost that feeling in the Dublin area and there is a fear that we will soon lose it in rural areas too.</P>
    <P>What is the future of rural Garda stations? Many village communities fear that their Garda station will be closed <Col N="2322" /> and that their sergeant, their gardaí, will be moved.  They also fear that a patrol car or motor cycle garda from the town will be their only police presence and that the only contact they will have with the police will be these boxes on the side of a not discused but seldom used Garda station where they can have some sort of intercom system with the gardaí.</P>
    <P>As I said, the greatest threat to community life is fear.  Statistics show that the category of citizen most likely to be assaulted on the street are teenagers.  If young people grow up in fear and old people do not feel secure, then there will be a serious erosion of community and that has all sorts of knock-on effects for employment and everything else.</P>
    <P>A number of crucial issues are to be addressed by this new committee.  The operation of our courts has been touched upon, right down to how barristers and lawyers are dressed, and formalised so that people will not feel intimidated by them.  A major health problem still exists in our prisons with the incidence of HIV. The view among people in the community and within the public service is that many of our prisons can be described as incubators for HIV.  That needs to be addressed. We need to restore confidence that people's health will not be put at risk by contact with our prison system.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the issue of victim support. Often all sorts of mechanisms are put in place to focus on the perpetrator or alleged perpetrator of a crime but much less on the victims of crime.  Voluntary agencies try to heal very serious, psychological and physical wounds among people who have been victimised or visited by crime and whose homes or whose persons have been violated and really need an established mechanism to support them.  These agencies are getting scant support from the State.</P>
    <P>I have only a couple of minutes left and I do not want to spend too long preempting, so to speak, the work of this committee.  Again I regret that we are not well on the way to having all this work done and the legislation enacted. Unfortunately that is largely due to this Minister's complacency and that of this <Col N="2323" /> Government in not bringing this motion before the House months ago.  I appeal through you, a Cheann Comhairle, to the Minister to think again about the establishment of this committee.  On behalf of the Labour Party I support the amendment in the name of Fine Gael to give broad sweeping powers to this committee so that they can be an effective voice, thus enabling this House to meet the growing consensus as to its role as a reforming body of scrutiny and accountability that the nation wants it to be. To appoint my colleague, Deputy Liam Kavanagh as chairperson of this committee would be to the betterment of this House and I think to the betterment of the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point that has to be made on the motion before the House this morning is in regard to the long delay that has taken place in bringing before the House this motion for the establishment of a select committee on crime.  As I recall it, it was one of the propositions contained in the Joint Programme for Government of the present Coalition of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats which was formulated and put before this House in July two years ago.  Subsequent efforts at various Whips' meetings and at the Order of Businesses in the House here on a weekly basis failed to get any response from the Coalition Government in regard to when, if ever, they proposed to establish the committee and meet that commitment in the joint programme of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Howlin has talked about the desire and preference that this matter might have come before the House months ago.  In fact, we should be talking about years.  It is clear that at this stage difficulties are beginning to establish, cracks are beginning to appear in the composition of the present Coalition, and one simply does not know the extent and term of life of the Government now standing.  Therefore, two years after this Government come into office we begin <Col N="2324" /> to establish a simple, effective committee, so called, on crime.  I am concerned that the event that has prompted and proved the catalyst of the establishment of this committee has nothing to do with the Government's concern about crime but the Government's concern to be seen to be doing something in the run-up to the local elections to take place here on 27 June.  I commented on this matter last evening at some greater length when the Minister brought in his Court (No. 2) Bill, 1991, a measure scant in its detail and again seeming to indicate a response made in haste by the Minister in an attempt to be seen to be doing something in a programme and campaign of Government coming towards the local elections.  It is evident that the Minister for Justice, being a Deputy representing a constituency on the north side of the city of Dublin, is particularly concerned with the emerging figures and facts now being presented to us.  The areas close to his constituency, in my own and that of the former chairperson of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, Deputy Woods, are experiencing a spiralling in crime unprecedented in the experience of any Government.  I am concerned that again we are getting a hasty and ill-considered proposal by the Minister, despite strenous efforts by the Opposition to have progress in this regard over the last two years.</P>
    <P>The second matter of concern relates to the terms of reference of the proposed committee.  In moving the motion the Minister said the committee's terms of reference would be to examine aspects of the administration of justice, implementation of the criminal law and existing legislation, to be an examining and inquiring committee.  However, there is no reference as to what effective powers or resources will be made available to the committee to carry out their duties.  If the Minister wants to limit the terms of reference he should have given some indication of the remit, resources and powers which the committee could exercise.  The only thing he said throughout his speech was that he and his Department will fully <Col N="2325" /> co-operate with the committee.  That co-operation needs to be more closely examined in the Minister's pursuit of these new phenomenon of the &ldquo;new Irish society&rdquo;. What new Irish society is the Minister talking about?  Has he a secret plan or agenda which he or the Government will unveil before 27 June to herald this new Irish society?</P>
    <P>Specifically with regard to the terms of reference, the Minister said that the areas of examination, the administration of justice and the implementation of the criminal law are sensitive and delicate areas which involve such agencies as the Garda Síochána, the law officers and the courts. He goes on to say that these are areas of sensitivity and confidentiality and states:</P>
    <P>It is difficult, for example, to see how persons directly involved in the administration of justice and the implementation of the criminal law could appear before the committee, or produce papers and records for the committee, and have a full and frank exchange without compromising the very way in which they perform their duties. </P>
    <P>I do not have any difficulty with the proposition that these officers and officials should &mdash; and could &mdash; appear before our committee and have frank discussions and exchanges.  There will be no difficulty in relation to a responsible member of any committee recognising a proposition being put forward reasonably as is done every day in our courts under the laws of privilege.  It can be explained that there are matters of trespass which simply cannot be engaged in by the committee in public, which will be respected. However, the Minister is clearly saying that this committee will not have the power to look for documents or send for people: in all probability he has sent out a signal to officials and others working in the area that if they get a message saying the committee want to talk to them they can say that the Minister said the matter is too sensitive, confidential and, in any event, none of their business.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to instance the <Col N="2326" /> long established practice that the Minister does not report to the Houses on the progress of Garda investigations. However, he did not say that this practice is deviated from in important and exceptional circumstances.  The Minister also said that the Director of Public Prosecutions does not give reasons for his failure to prosecute.  While these may be long established practices it might well be the remit of the committee to decide whether those practices should continue. Certainly there is a demand outside that the Director of Public Prosecutions is answerable or accountable at some stage to some agency and perhaps he might be questioned by this committee in regard to some of the decisions he has taken.  I do not know, I do not have a firm view on it, but it seems that the Minister for Justice is laying down clear indications that he has a very limited and restricted view of how this committee will operate. His most remarkable statement in that regard is the proposition that he does not want to hear any new ideas about the way in which policing might be conducted.  He has his mind made up in regard to new ideas or objectives, which is a very regrettable attitude in moving a motion to establish a committee to investigate these matters.</P>
    <P>The terms of this motion allow spokespersons from the groups in the House to contribute to the debate.  There would not have been the slightest difficulty if it had been proposed that the spokespersons were from the parties in the House.  It is no secret that the Government propose nominating Deputy Quill as the chairperson of this committee.  I would have loved and very much appreciated the opportunity to hear Deputy Quill &mdash; or a member of the Progressive Democrats &mdash; addressing the House on the way the committee will operate.  I understand that they specifically asked that this committee should be included in their joint programme and I should have liked to hear her comments in regard to the strictures of the Minister for Justice. In regard to the chairperson, there is a very important aspect and principle in <Col N="2327" /> relation to the independence of the committee. If Deputy Quill is to be chairperson, she or any representative of her party should not be restricted in the way the Minister is seeking to have them restricted.  She should be able to act independently and in the interests of the effective working of that committee. However, the Minister will not give such an assurance.  We very strongly support the idea that the chairperson should be a member of the Opposition and we clearly indicated our preference for Deputy Kavanagh, if he was available.  However, to break the farcical merry-go-round in relation to the establishment of this committee, some time ago The Workers' Party clearly indicated to the Government Chief Whip that we could accept a Government nominee, simply to get the committee established.  The farcical playacting then stopped.</P>
    <P>Of course the fact that an Opposition member is in the chair does not necessarily mean good work by that chair or committee.  Yesterday we were told that Raheny, in my constituency and at the back door of the former chairperson on the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, Deputy Woods, had experienced the single greatest explosion of crime throughout the last year.  There was an almost 30 per cent increase of indictable crimes in the back yard of the previous chairperson.  Obviously, while he was chairing the committee he failed to recognise what was happening in his constituency.  In establishing the committee, the Government should have given them a semblance of independence and allowed a member of the Opposition to take the chair.  I hope next week, when the chair has been decided on, the Government will reflect on this matter. No matter who is in the chair, the committee should get to work immediately; I invite the chair to use the vacation to get to work.  We should start with the long ignored document on the reform of the prison system which was compiled by Mr. Ken Whitaker and known as the Whitaker report.</P>
    <P>There was a proposition in the Fine <Col N="2328" /> Gael amendment that the committee would also have the power to engage the services of persons with specialised or technical knowledge to assist them.  Who better than Mr. Whitaker?  Even if we do not get majority support for the Fine Gael amendment, will the committee have the power and resources available to them to employ experts?  Will we be in a position &mdash; which applies to other committees of the House &mdash; to bring in people on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to commission or update work they have already done and to give us reports, for example, as to what extent the Whitaker report has been implemented?  We hear much from the Minister about what he is doing in this area, but this committee should have the power to engage experts on an on-going basis.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the establishment of this committee is a small step forward.  It is regrettable that the Minister has taken the opportunity in moving the motion to lay down what appear to be very strong strictures on the functions and concepts in which this committee can engage.  It is also regrettable that the chairperson of this committee will not be independent of Government.  As Deputy Quill is in the House I will finish by saying that I will represent The Workers' Party on that committee.  If the Deputy has not accepted what I said to her on the radio on Saturday, she will learn that I will be a full time member of that committee with no other conflicting interests or outside activities.  I will attend the committee day in and day out to ensure that the Deputy is not just what she has proved to be in her party up to now, a minor puppet of a bigger Minister.</P>

      <P>That is appalling.  Unfortunately Deputy McCartan concluded on behalf of his party with the usual form of personal abuse which seems to typify his contributions in the House, on this occasion directed at Deputy Quill. Deputy McCartan is unfortunately, as the record will show, incapable of discussing any issue, whether a Courts Bill as we discussed last night or any other issue, without bringing it down to the <Col N="2329" /> level of personal abuse.  The Deputy talked about cracks in Government and the composition of the Government. Coming from a party which changed their name about four times in the last number of years and who at the moment, if one is to believe public reports, are busily engaged in trying to shake off the northern element of their party, that is a bit of a joke.</P>

      <P>As regards Deputy McCartan's suggestion that the DPP should be asked to report to the House or to some other committee, it would be a retrograde step indeed if the independent position of the Director of Public Prosecutions was in any way interfered with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan marred his contribution with some recrimination.  The committee have been set up and I want to put on the record quite clearly that I am not in any way trying to direct or indicate how this independent committee of the House will conduct their business. If I failed to outline my views on policing and criminal justice I should have been castigated by Deputy Flanagan, but all I was attempting to do was indicate the situation.  I accept fully what Deputy Flanagan has said in relation to the social issues and other problems.  I was amused to hear him return to the very same issues <Col N="2330" /> I suggested that the committee should consider, the whole social area and family problems.  We both referred to reparation and rehabilitation for offenders within the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flangan and others referred to the success of the committee's predecessor, and I agree with that comment. It is strange that the Deputies feel that the new committee will need much more by way of powers compared to the last committee of this House.  That committee was very successful and I believe this committee will also be successful.  I regret that Deputy Flanagan's colleagues were unable to contribute to the discussion but the record will show that this was not of my doing.  I indicated my willingness to allow them to contribute.</P>

      <P>Deputy Howlin made a number of points.  I want to put on the record quite clearly that there is no question whatsoever of the scenario being created as outlined by Deputy Howlin in relation to less policing in rural areas. The proposal before me from the management of the Garda, rather than envisaging a reduction in resources in rural Ireland, envisages more resources.</P>
      <P>As far as attacks on the elderly are concerned, in 1984 there was a peak in such attacks &mdash; the number of attacks at that stage was 432 &mdash; whereas last year it was reduced to the still unacceptable figure of 51, but it is a dramatic reduction. I welcome this committee and I will do everything possible to work with them. They will have full assistance from me and my Department at all times.</P>

      <P>The section is straightforward. However, an amendment in my name was ruled out of order by the office of the Ceann Comhairle.  I am clearly bound by that ruling and I am not in a position to move the amendment at this stage.  I would like to put on record why I intened to pursue this amendment in the hope that before Report Stage the Minister of State will reflect on the over-all scope of the Bill to see if there might be a means of extending its scope with a view to taking on board the relevant point which was raised by the Law Society.</P>

      <P>I am not moving the amendment.  I am speaking to the section.  The succinct point made by the Law Society which was circulated to me by letter of 29 January and, I presume, to all Deputies of the House, was that the Bill should cover all actions claiming damages in tort and not merely actions for certain personal injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment I had in mind was to add to section 1 a second subsection <Col N="2334" /> providing that in this Bill and in the principal Act personal injury should include all injuries or personal loss whether caused to the person or property or caused by any act of negligence or breach of duty or tortious action.  I understand that Deputies Barrett and Bell also attempted to broaden the scope of the measure.  I want to know why the Government decided to take such a narrow approach as to confine matters to the very specific base they have done in respect of certain actions for damages for personal loss and no other.</P>
    <P>In regard to my amendment I was notified only this morning that it was not in order.  I accept that ruling although it took me by surprise coming so late in the day.  My amendments, and I understand those of other spokespersons, have been in circulation for many weeks and it would have been helpful in readdressing our minds to the Bill if we had had a bit more notice of the fact that our amendments were not square with the terms of the Bill.  I make that point in the hope that it will be taken back to the Ceann Comhairle.  I felt it was important that the point raised by the Law Society that the Bill should have a wider scope and application should be raised at this stage. Perhaps the Minister of State would respond, if not now, on Report Stage on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I also received a letter this morning which surprised me, informing me that the amendment tabled to extend this Bill to include latent damage to property has been ruled our of order. Again, this amendment has been in circulation for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section provides that this Bill and the principal Act means the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957.  The Statute of Limitations Act, 1957 deals with both personal and non-personal injuries and any amending legislation should do likewise. If we are amending the Principal Act of 1957 I do not see why we should not amend it to refer to both personal <Col N="2335" /> and non-personal injuries.  It was mere chance that the Supreme Court case which decided there was a need to amend the existing 1957 Act was taken in respect of personal injuries only.  It could easily have been the other way round.  It could have been in respect of non-personal injuries.  Are we to assume that if that had been the case the Minister would have been in here this morning with legislation amending the Statute of Limitations Act in respect solely of non-personal injuries?  He would not.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of legislation that does not grab the headlines because it is not every day of the week that a person finds himself in need of this legislation.  The most common thing is for a person, having struggled to pay a mortgage, discovering five, six, seven or eight years into paying this mortgage that a major problem has arisen as a result of a fault in the building he is purchasing and this has happened through no fault of his own. He could not reasonably be expected to know that this would happen.  He has got a mortgage based on surveyors' reports and would have assumed that the property he was buying was in good order.  He then, discovers, eight or nine years later, that this House is about to fall down around his ears and he has no comeback against the person who built the House. It has happened in a couple of cases I personally know about and it is causing immense personal difficulties for the people involved.  I fail to see why the Minister has not used this occasion to extend the legislation to non-personal injuries in accordance with the principal Act of 1957.  That Act, as referred to in section 1, refers to both personal injuries and non-personal injuries.  This legislation only refers to personal injuries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I am referring to the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957.  Like Deputy McCartan I would ask the Minister not to make fools of us in this House.  Let him go outside <Col N="2336" /> and try to explain to people who are deeply concerned that this legislation does not refer to non-personal injuries. There is no logic for not extending the legislation as the 1957 Act does.  Like Deputy McCartan, I am asking the Minister to use basic common sense and give us an assurance that he will come back on Report Stage with his own amendment if he so wishes.  I am not particularly concerned about whether my amendment or another amendment achieves this.  The section should extend to non-personal injuries as well as to personal injuries.  I am asking the Minister at this stage, under this section &mdash; because the 1957 Act refers to both personal and non-personal injuries &mdash; to give an indication that he is sympathetic to the request from all Opposition parties to extend this legislation to include non-personal injuries, and to listen to the advice given to his Department by the law society and by various well respected people in the legal profession.  Not everybody can be wrong. I cannot see why the Minister will not keep this legislation totally in accordance with the 1957 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This section defines the expression &ldquo;the Principal Act&rdquo;, as the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957.  The 1957 Act contains most of the law of the State pertaining to limitation of actions.  Where subsequent legislation has set up a cause of action, it has either made it its own limitation provision, as for instance section 48 of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, dealing with claims by dependent relatives of the deceased in fatal injuries cases, or applied the provisions of the 1957 Act whether with modification, as in section 13 of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, dealing with claims by third parties for damages in respect of defective vehicles, or without section 21 of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, dealing with injuries caused by dogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was already stated on Second Stage, nine years ago the Law Reform Commission published a report which deals with aspects of material damage, namely <Col N="2337" /> those concerning latent defects in buildings. However, there have been significant changes in the law since that time and it is clear that the commission's original 1982 proposals would need to be further examined and, perhaps, amended to take account of judicial decisions in this area in the meantime.  In relation to material damage, particularly, the commission's proposals might need to be extended as they envisaged action being taken against the original builder and those associated with the original building work.  That approach might be regarded by some as being too restrictive.</P>
    <P>It may very well be that the law should be changed not only to cover material damage but also all cases of negligence. The law was changed in England in that respect in 1986 by the Latent Damage Act of that year and is of general application. However, any such change here now would have far-reaching implications for architects, engineers and other professions, apart from surveyors and the building industry generally.  The insurance industry, too, would have views in the matter, as Deputy Barrett would know.</P>
    <P>Any proposed change of that nature in the law would have to be considered very carefully and the affected interests would have to be consulted before the Government could consider bringing forward the necessary draft legislation.  I would remind the House, and particularly Deputy Barrett, that his party's Private Members' Bill did not deal with latent damage to property.  It covered the same ground as this Bill.  It applied to personal injuries only.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps worth noting at this point that in their Fifth Report on the Insurance Problems of Small Businesses in March 1986, the Joint Committee on Small Businesses, under the heading of &ldquo;professional indemnity&rdquo;, expressed the view that some restriction would need to be put on the right to sue for professional negligence in return for affordable insurance.  Otherwise, the situation would disimprove, either through insurance cover being unobtainable or the level of some professional services <Col N="2338" /> being reduced.  This is a very important consideration in the present context and underlines the point I am making about separate and detailed examination of the matter.</P>
    <P>It is not the Government's intention to take a narrow view of any legislation, but here we are dealing with something very specific.  We cannot change it now.  We are dealing with the Bill as published and we should proceed in that fashion.  Any further consideration of the matter referred to by the Deputies needs to be considered in the context of an amendment to existing laws or in an entirely new Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Private Members' Bill responded to a particular problem.  I accept that it referred only to personal injuries but that is not a good argument for not using a Government Bill, having listened to the advice given by various people, to extend it to include non-personal injuries.  I regret that sort of political answer.  What has that to do with this Bill?  The fact that we produced a Private Members' Bill three or four years ago which referred only to personal injuries has nothing to do with what we are doing here this morning.  We are not making party politics out of this.  There are no votes to be gained from this at the end of the day.  This is a question of whether or not one does the right thing. The Minister does not have to listen all the time to what he is being told by civil servants.  I know they have to do their job, but let us talk as politicians.  Can the Minister honestly say that it is wise when we have legislation here not to go the full way and extend it to non-personal injuries?  I will put on the record a couple of points made by eminent people.</P>

      <P>I understand that quite well.  I have allowed some latitude. Whereas the Bill amends the 1957 Statute <Col N="2339" /> of Limitations Act it only does so in a restricted way.  By reason of that fact the amendments were deemed to be out of order.  As the Chair has allowed some latitude, advantage should not be taken of it, even though the Deputy may have some strong points to make.  The Chair has to rule that only a certain amount of latitude is allowed when the amendments are ruled out of order.  Will the Deputy please keep that in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, of course.  Like Deputy McCartan, I got a letter this morning saying that the amendment was ruled out.  This amendment has been down certainly since 6 March 1991 and this is 19 June.  Nearly four months later I was told that the amendment was ruled out.  Like Deputy McCartan, and I am sure the representative of the Labour Party, I have been contacted by people about this issue.  People get in touch with Opposition spokespersons when a serious matter like this arises, to advise us.  They also get in touch with the Government and the Department to advise them.  I am obliged to make the case.  It was not reasonable to be told this morning that the amendment was ruled out.  I respect the rule of the Chair and I will try to confine myself to the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957, but to understand the problem one has to consider what people said in the past.  If an action is taken in relation to non-personal injuries, the Department of Justice will be forced to come in here with amending legislation. There is not any doubt from the advice of many eminent people that the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957, as it refers to non-personal injuries, is unconstitutional. Professor Brady and Mr. Kerr of UCD in their book on the limitation of actions in the Republic of Ireland state that to hold that the cause of action accrues before a person knows or is even capable of knowing of the damage is manifestly unreasonable and unjustifiable in principle.  If one relates that sort of advice to Article 40 of the Constitution, it is quite clear that we are treading on very dangerous ground.  I <Col N="2340" /> should like to quote from what Miss Justice Carroll had to say in the Morgan <i>v.</i> Park Developments case.  She said that a date of damage rule was unreasonable and unjustifiable, that it produced a result that was harsh and absurd and that to bar a plaintiff's action before he knew he had one was indefensible in the light of the Constitution.  Those are not my words, they are the words of Miss Justice Carroll, a very respected member of the Judiciary, in the Morgan <i>v.</i> Park Developments case.  I should like the Minister to look at the findings in that case between now and Report Stage so that he can see that Members on this side of the House are not making these points for any political reasons.  We are making these points on the grounds that we are legislating to amend the 1957 Act and referring solely to personal injuries and ignoring non-personal injuries.  All the advice we have received from very eminent people clearly indicates that the present law in relation to non-personal injuries is unconstitutional and we would be failing in our duty if we did not point this out to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission also believe that the legislation should be extended to cover non-personal injuries. The law society have advised the Dáil that there is a need to extend the provisions of this Bill to include non-personal injuries.  How far do we have to go before the Minister accepts this?  It makes basic common sense to me to do this.  Having listened to what has been said by experts whom I respect, my colleague, Deputy Cotter, and Deputy McCartan &mdash; I have not yet heard the views of the Labour Party on this point and I shall not speak for them &mdash; we all seem to agree that the scope of the Bill should be extended to include non-personal injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point made by the Minister about the difficulties which this might cause for insurance companies, architects and so on, if he so wishes he can do what was done in Britain and put a limit of, say, 15 years on latent damage cases.  However, the Minister does not seem to think that this is necessary in relation to personal injury cases.  I do not <Col N="2341" /> accept for one minute that extending this legislation to include non-personal injuries would cause any more difficulties for insurance companies than personal injuries are already causing them.  It appears from section 7 that this legislation is retrospective, which is very unusual, and it will be very difficult for insurance companies to deal with personal injuries cases.  However, we are not here to worry solely about insurance companies, architects or builders; we are here to protect the interests of society and those involved in the commercial world will have to overcome the difficulties posed by this legislation.  I am sure the Minister has already thought of this problem.  I do not accept that extending the legislation to include non-personal injuries will make life totally intolerable for insurance companies, builders or architects.</P>
    <P>If a builder erects a house on a foundation that is clearly faulty or acts in a very unreasonable way from day one, it would be unreasonable to expect the occupier of that house to know that the work was faulty at the building stage.  He may only discover seven or eight years later that a cowboy builder had put in a faulty foundation or carried out other faulty work.  This can cause immense upset to an individual who may have a big mortgage round his neck.  If his house falls down on top of him and injures him personally, under this legislation he will have some comeback but if the house falls down while he is in the garden he will have no comeback.  This does not make sense.  If someone carries out faulty or improper work and tries to get away with it, it is irrelevant whether the owner of the house discovers this after two or five years.  It does not make any difference whether it takes a person two or five years to discover whether the work is faulty.  They should have some comeback and should not be debarred, as they are by the 1957 Act and as proposed under this legislation, from having some comeback.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the Minister will give us a concrete assurance on Report Stage that these people will have some comeback. If he wants to think about this for <Col N="2342" /> a month or two and leave Report Stage until after the summer recess I have no objection.  We should not pass this legislation without extending it to cover non-personal injuries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to respond briefly to the Minister's response to the points raised by Deputies on this side of the House.  Amendment No. 1, which I tabled as long ago as 7 March and which sought to extend the scope of the Bill, and amendment No. 15 have been ruled out of order.  I understand that ruling and accept it fully.  However, I understood that it was open to Deputies on Committee Stage to seek to extend the scope of the Bill by tabling amendments to extend the Title.  I raise this point to query why we are being so restricted on this occasion.  Because of the way the Bill has been drafted and introduced by the Minister, the issue of latent and other tortious damages cannot be pursued.  I had sought in my amendment to extend the Title of the Bill so that we could discuss these issues.</P>
      <P>I would have been happy, if one can be happy and unhappy at the same time, if the Minister had merely said that the scope of the Bill is limited, that it will be dealt with expeditiously on that basis and is a specific response to a ruling of the Supreme Court which has already been made.  However, he went a little further &mdash; this is what worries me &mdash; and suggested that extending the scope of the Bill to cover non-personal injuries would have widespread implications for architects, builders and others involved in the construction industry.  His response to the point raised by Deputy Barrett in relation to latent defects worries me entirely.  He seemed to suggest that once this legislation is out of the way that that will be it and because of the vested interests or otherwise of those involved in the construction industry he will not be moving any further in extending the rights of people, particularly those who find after six years that their property has been poorly constructed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the products liability Bill which we debated recently <Col N="2343" /> would never have been introduced if we had adopted the attitude that it would have widespread implications for the manufacturing industry.  The Minister acknowledges in the explanatory memorandum that certain provisions of this legislation might have widespread implications for the Government in that actions which had expired heretofore, being statute barred, might be resurrected. The Minister acknowledges on the one hand that certain litigations may be reopened against the State because the provisions of this Bill will require it and it is proper that it should be so but, on the other hand, he says that the Bill will have implications for architects and other elements in the construction industry which might make it very difficult to legislate in this area.</P>
    <P>The principle should be to ensure that the ordinary man in the street is given a reasonable opportunity to bring a case before the court and not to be disadvantaged because knowledge had not accrued to him that a building was defective. The single biggest element which militates against people accruing knowledge is the latency of a defect under the rafters of a roof or the foundations in the ground which may not emerge until the cracks appear.  The Law Society and others, as Deputy Barrett illustrated, argue that this principle should be applied.  The ordinary man and woman in the street should be given a reasonable right to seek redress in respect of personal losses and damage and the difficulty encountered in acquiring knowledge or expertise or in amassing information should not militate against that right.  I am disappointed with the Minister of State's response.  If he had confined himself to the narrow application of the legislation, well and good, but his later remarks are a source of concern.  It appears that his view is that we should close the door on the issue once we pass from this legislation.  I would ask him to re-examine the matter and to reassure us, if nothing else, before Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I am <Col N="2344" /> of the view that this measure is extremely restrictive, deals with a narrow area and to some extent is a reaction to particular events.  When the Government decide to introduce a Bill such as the one before the House they should examine all the issues involved because we would be wasting our time in introducing a Bill on such a narrow base if other matters could be covered.  One of the matters which the Labour Party are seeking to have addressed in the Bill is ground rents, in particular the matter of arrears of ground rent.</P>
      <P>There is agreement in the House that ground rents are an anachronism, that they are unjust and unfair.  That view is strongly held by the Labour Party.  Unfortunately, there is no legal definition of &ldquo;ground rent&rdquo;.  We are seeking to have such definition included in the Bill.  We are also seeking to have the time limit within which one can take an action to claim arrears of ground rent reduced to two years and for both parties to meet their own costs.  However the Ceann Comhairle has ruled the amendment out of order but I should point out that, according to the legal advice we have received, it would be necessary to hold a referendum before ground rents could be abolished.  This would impose a great expense on the State and would be difficult, too, in terms of time.  The Labour Party have come up with a formula which effectively would abolish ground rents legally so that they could not be collected.</P>
      <P>It is my view that the Bill is too narrow. It is obvious that the Government see the Bill as their response to the need to deal with the Statute of Limitations and do not want to deal with the problems highlighted by other speakers this morning, in particular the issue of ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>First I want to say that it is not my intention to get at or have a go at anybody or to make political points. I thought I had made it clear in making reference to the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill, which was similar to the one before us, that we are being consistent. I want to make it quite clear that this Bill is a direct response to the report <Col N="2345" /> of the Law Reform Commission report &mdash; No. 21 of 1987 &mdash; on personal injuries. Deputy McCartan said he was disappointed with my reply &mdash; Deputy Barrett also expressed similar concern &mdash; in relation to professionals.  All I am saying is that it would be very foolish not to take into account the effect this measure will have on the professionals involved in the building and insurance industries in framing the legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett referred to the decision handed down by Miss Justice Mella Carroll in the High Court in the case of Hegarty <i>v.</i> O'Loughran I think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I refer the Deputy to the decision handed down by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Finlay, on 8 February 1990.  He said:</P>
      <P>After careful consideration, I find that I must disagree with Carroll J in the conclusion reached by her in <i>Morgan v. Park Developments Ltd.</i>, that two or more alternative constructions of s. 11 (2) (a) of the Act of 1957 are open and if I reach that conclusion I must also find it impossible to conclude that two alternative constructions of the provisions of s. 11 (2) (b) of that Act are open. </P>
      <P>He went on to refer to section 71 (1) of that Act.  Therefore the interpretation of the Supreme Court is different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea referred to ground rents and to the amendment proposed by Fine Gael.  As in the case of the Deputy, we were notified this morning that the amendment had been ruled out of order. We must accept the ruling of the Chair but with regard to the amendment in the name of Deputy Bell on ground rents, and to which Deputy O'Shea referred, similar amendments are contained in a Labour Party Private Members' Bill, the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill, 1991 which is at present awaiting Second Stage, in Private Members' time, in the Dáil.  The amendments propose to <Col N="2346" /> make the collection of ground rents by landlords so difficult as to encourage ground rent lessees not to pay them and to make it not worth the while of ground rent landlords to collect them.  They seek to do so by not allowing any action for recovery of arrears of ground rent after two years from the date on which the arrears became due and not allowing the court to make an order in favour of the landlord in relation to the costs of any action brought to recover arrears.</P>
    <P>The amendments attempt to abolish ground rents without compensation by stealth.  In reality they represent an attack on private property, are probably unconstitutional and would be open to the charge that they ignore our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  The European Court of Human Rights has held that any restriction on the general right to the protection of property must strike a just balance between the protection of the community and the respect due to fundamental rights with particular reference to the latter. According to the court, compensation terms are material in assessing whether any measure strikes a fair balance.  It is hard to see any difference in principle between a proposal that would, for example, make it uneconomic for a finance agency to pursue bad debts through the courts and the Labour Party proposals in relation to ground rents.</P>
    <P>I trust this throws some further light on the matter.  I also hope that I have made it clear that the Bill is not narrow and is a response to the report of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take the Minister of State up on a point he made in reply to the points made by me in my contribution.  He quoted the decision of the Supreme Court but it looked at the matter from a technical point of view and gave its opinion based on the law as it stood.  That was its opinion and we have to respect it but I quoted what Miss Justice Carroll actually said.  She gave her opinion which is different from the findings of the court on a technical point based on the law as it stands.  Miss Justice <Col N="2347" /> Carroll said a date of damage rule was unreasonable and unjustifiable and produced a result that was harsh and absurd. She also said that to bar the plaintiff's action before he knew he had one was indefensible in the light of the Constitution. She is clearly saying that in her opinion that principle is not in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Had an action been taken under the 1957 Act &mdash; which we are discussing under section 1 of the Bill &mdash; in relation to non-personal injuries, the Law Reform Commission would have recommended or, indeed, the Minister would have been in here with legislation to deal with that point.  It just so happens that this change has been brought about as a result of a personal injuries case, but had somebody taken a case in respect of non-personal injuries I am quite certain and so, indeed, is Miss Justice Carroll, that the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957, would have been found to be unconstitutional.  Commonsense would tell you that and you do not need to be an expert in constitutional law.</P>
      <P>When I referred in passing to having had advice from civil servants I was not referring to the two civil servants in the House, in case anybody took personal offence at my remark, I did not mean to cause offence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As the law stands in relation to non-personal injuries, it is clear from the advice we are getting that it is unconstitutional.  In response to the point the Minister made about the difficulties amending the law might cause to architects, builders and insurance companies, let me say that most of the insurance companies operating in this country are British based and Britain amended her laws, the Latent Damage Act, in 1986 and this does not seem to have put the insurance companies in Britain out of business.  If the Minister wants to see this legislation in operation, Britain has had five years experience of <Col N="2348" /> this law in operation.  They have put a 15 year stop on claims and a person cannot make a claim after 15 years.  We could argue about the time limit.  The principle was established in the 1986 Act and this does not seem to put architects, builders and insurance companies out of business. They are still motoring away.  In fact they are making more money in Britain than they are over here.  I think the insurance companies have far more problems than dealing with the extension of the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957 to cover non-personal injuries and the question of occurrence or discoverability.</P>
      <P>My advice is that the Minister should not be fooled by that argument.  As I said, the British have had five years experience of the operation of similar legislation and people do not appear to be suffering. Even if they were &mdash; and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who is a very fair and reasonable man who has represented the people in Finglas and adjoining areas very well for a long time, knows that what we are supposed to be doing here is looking after the interests of the people who elected us.  I appeal to the Minister to take this point on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I decide to buy a house I have to take out a mortgage of anything in the region of £30,000 to £50,000.  My wife, if she is fortunate enough to have a job, and I have to struggle to meet our mortgage repayments.  If after seven or eight years I discover the house is collapsing around my ears mainly because this cowboy builder, who made a very nice profit, was negligent or greedy and did not put in proper foundations or the roof was faulty I am debarred from taking any action against that person.  Whether this happens two, five, seven, or ten years after the house was built the fact is that the builder acted in an unreasonable way from day one and should therefore carry liability for it for a reasonably long period of time.  I could not reasonably know the house was faulty.  When the ordinary individual buys his house he gets reports from surveyors and then gets his loan from a building society and it appears that everybody is doing his job properly. How is the ordinary individual supposed <Col N="2349" /> to know that the foundations of the house were faulty?  How could it be reasonable to debar me from taking an action against the person who built the house seven or eight years previously?  The only thing I know is that I have to satisfy the bank or building society by making my monthly mortgage repayments.  We should be worrying about the ordinary individual and not the cowboys&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I acknowledge Deputy Barrett's kind reference to the Chair.  The Deputy has referred to what we are supposed to be doing.  The occupant of the Chair knows what he is supposed to do and I am obligated to direct Deputies to direct their comments entirely to section 1.  This section is a definition section and refers to the statute of limitations.  The previous holder of the Chair told me he had indicated that he would allow a little latitude but I think we have allowed more than a little latitude in respect of section 1 which defines the expression &ldquo;the Principal Act&rdquo; as the Statute of Limitations, 1957. Whether the Minister inadvertently referred to other matters cannot be used as an excuse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  We would have been discussing this point under an amendment but unfortunately it has been ruled out of order and I took the opportunity to make the point of the need to amend the law now, in its entirety as we are talking about the existing Act.  There is a need to amend it in its entirety especially in relation to non-personal injury cases.  I do not want to stretch the goodwill of the Chair too far so I will heed the Chair's remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel strongly about this matter.  Part and parcel of what is wrong with this <Col N="2350" /> House and what brings this House into disrepute is that we do not have a reasonable answer when people suggest that we should use the occasion to amend and go the full hog.  When something makes basic commonsense to me I tend to fight for it and in this instance I cannot see the sense of not tackling this problem which will have to be tackled in the future but in the meantime people are suffering who are entitled to the protection of the law. Finally, will the Minister give a commitment that between now and Report Stage he will reconsider his position?</P>

      <P>I will take your advice, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I dealt with the issue of ground rents in the context of broadening the scope of the Bill but obviously the Minister only heard this morning, like myself, that this amendment had been ruled out of order.  It appears from his answer that he was not unhappy with that.  The points he raised in his reply in terms of the right to private property and the right under the European Convention of Human Rights, which were his alibi for not tackling the ground rents issue along the lines of the Labour Party Private Members' Bill, ring very hollow to me.  Ground rents are an anachronism and a relic of the worst excesses of landlordism in this country when a foreign power was in charge here.  They have lived on.  They are neither just nor fair and again interests outside the State are buying up these ground rents and are bringing our citizens to court who have refused to pay this unjust and unfair tax on the grounds of principled opposition. I believe that if other issues can be dealt with speedily in the legislation &mdash; and Deputy Barrett made this point also &mdash;<Col N="2351" /> we should take the opportunity to do so as this speeds up the work of this House and makes it more meaningful to the people.  We could then get things done more quickly instead of hiding behind procedures and so on.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 not moved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), line 21, to delete &ldquo;the following facts&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;all of the following facts where relevant&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This is merely a drafting amendment to tidy up this provision.  The section relates to the whole issue of the date on which knowledge becomes available and it goes on in general terms to define what facts comprise the concept of knowledge.  The section provides that the date of a person's knowledge shall refer to the date on which he had knowledge of the following facts and these facts are listed in paragraphs (a) to (e).  My amendment provides that the facts should be relevant. Some facts may not have any relevance to the cause of action.  The five types of fact referred to in the section as drafted are as follows:</P>
      <P> (a)  that the person alleged to have been injured had been injured,</P>
      <P>(b)  that the injury in question was significant,</P>
      <P>(c)  that the injury was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence, nuisance or breach of duty,</P>
      <P>(d)  the identity of the defendant, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e)  if it is alleged that the act or omission was that of a person other <Col N="2352" /> than the defendant, the identity of that person and the additional facts supporting the bringing of an action against the defendant;  </P>
    <P>I am suggesting in my amendment that knowledge of facts where relevant should be relied upon.  What is relevant or not would be a matter for a judge to decide.</P>
    <P>I am prompted in tabling this amendment by what is proposed in the Law Reform Commission's report to which the Minister has referred.  The point was also raised in correspondence with me. The Minister may find the amendment acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the facts listed in section 2 (1), we would all agree that those in paragraphs (a) to (d) will always be relevant in every case.  No claim can proceed in the absence of knowledge of at least all of those facts.  The matter at paragraph (e) refers to circumstances which may be relevant in a particular case.  For example, the plaintiff may not know that an employer may be held vicariously liable for the tort of an employee committed during the course of his employment.  In such a case the identity of the employee and the additional facts supporting the claim will be relevant to the question of the plaintiff's knowledge.  There is, therefore, no need to repeat the words &ldquo;where relevant&rdquo; at the beginning of the list.  Perhaps in view of these comments Deputy McCartan might consider withdrawing his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister says it is almost superfluous, he might accept it since it does not take from or add to the section.  Paragraph (e) might on occasion give rise to some debate as to the matter of avoidance of responsibility by a litigant. To obviate any doubt, I would urge the Minister to accept my amendment.  If the Minister says that all these paragraphs are indicators of fact that will be relevant in all instances, then the inclusion of the word &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; does not take from that in any way.  Perhaps he would be willing to include it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (2), lines 5 to 7, to delete paragraph (b). </P>
      <P>My proposition is that we delete in its entirety this paragraph (b) of subsection (2) which states:</P>
      <P>from facts ascertainable by him with the help of medical or other appropriate expert advice which it is reasonable for him to seek. </P>
      <P>I suggest in amendment No. 6 that paragraph (a) of subsection (3) should also be deleted.  That paragraph states:</P>
      <P>a person shall not be fixed under this section with knowledge of a fact ascertainable only with the help of expert advice so long as he has taken all reasonable steps to obtain (and, where appropriate, to act on) that advice; and </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the introduction of a third party and the extent to which a right of a litigant might be done down by the failure of a third party expert to <Col N="2354" /> aid, provide information, come to the assistance of or properly advise a litigant in the course of an attempt to assemble facts to support an action.  We should keep matters simple and settled between the two parties, the plaintiff and the defendant.  Because we are dealing with personal injury, the advice of medical experts comes to mind.  We will not deal with the question of property because my amendment in that regard has been ruled out of order.  The issue is dealt with by the law society in their submission, although not as directly as I have proposed.  They attempt to address the problems that could emerge from the introduction of the third party, potentially, to the litigation. If the failure is due to the negligence of that expert, the law society make the point that if the definition were extended in the way I have proposed, which is the way they recommend, then the legal action might lie against the expert rather than against the primary litigant.  That indicates the way in which this matter can become tortuous and complex.  The way to deal with the issue of advice and knowledge from a third source is to avoid it entirely, to delete the subsections relating to it and leave the matters then resting on the shoulders of the primary litigent, that is the plaintiff, and dwell on the standards required of him or her in terms of assembling facts. I am concerned that the way in which the expertise of lawyers, litigants, the legal system and the profession itself can create complexities and exploit the nuances of every process and active set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am reminded particularly, not only because Deputy Rabbitte has moved into the Chamber close to me, of the scales to which the balances can be thrown.  One is reminded of the case he was so closely involved in, that was the Holles Street litigation involving the Dunne family from County Wicklow and the scales that were thrown up on the one hand by the hospital and all its resources and the insurance company, and the extent to which every nuance, every opportunity was seized and every device used to avoid liability descending and justice and <Col N="2355" /> repose being granted to the Dunne family and, on the other hand, their efforts in terms of mortgaging their home and putting themselves almost into total &ldquo;hock&rdquo; and ruin to pursue an issue.  Those are the kinds of powers or interests that can be drawn into litigation of this sort where we are dealing with personal injury &mdash; the medical experts and advice and information that may come out of it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned when one moves into this area and sets up the possibility that insurance companies with their resources, hospitals with their reputation, doctors with their practices, will do everything possible to slip out, slip around and be as unhelpful as possible. Rather than create that whole scenario and that possibility, let us keep matters straight and succinct between the litigation on either side and avoid this deviation and diversion into the issue of what an expert adviser did or did not do and how that would reflect upon the state of knowledge of the litigant, here the plaintiff, on any occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Both these amendments seek to exclude references to the obtaining of knowledge of an injury by seeking expert advice.  These references are in aid of the injured person or other person whose knowledge is at issue.  To omit these references, as the amendments propose, would have the effect of making the operation of the section less certain.  On one reading of the provision without the references in question, it is possible that a person who failed to obtain knowledge despite having consulted an expert might nonetheless find himself or herself fixed with that knowledge, notwithstanding that it was as a result of a failure on the part of the expert in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The specific references to expert advice make clear how the law is intended to operate and it is perfectly reasonable that the law should operate in the way set out in the Bill.  If the Bill were drafted with the omission of these provisions it would be rightly open to criticism on the grounds that it was incomplete and left <Col N="2356" /> an area of uncertainty which should be spelt out in the statute.</P>
    <P>The only argument for leaving out these provisions is that their omission would in some way absolve a plaintiff from the responsibility of seeking medical or other expert advice even though he or she could reasonably be expected to have done so.  Not only is this an invalid reason for omitting these provisions, as it would seek to reward unreasonable behaviour on the part of a potential plaintiff; but there is no guarantee whatsoever that the omission would achieve that aim.  All that would remain would be expensive uncertainty.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned that the possible effect of the words sought to be deleted by the Deputy's second amendment would be to remove the protection which they give to a plaintiff who has taken all reasonable steps to obtain expert advice on the facts of the case from being fixed with constructive knowledge of a fact discoverable by seeking expert advice, but which as it may turn out, the advice does not, in fact reveal.  In view of these comments I would ask the Deputy to reconsider the situation and perhaps he would wish to withdraw these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response, considered as it was, but I would like to pursue this matter a little more.  He represents the provisions in the section as providing protection for the plaintiff-litigant.  I am not at all convinced of that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Society sent their initial circular by letter of 25 January and I presume the Minister of State has received the same submission as myself and other Members.  The society in their submission say of section 2 (3) (a) of the Bill, which they quote, that the committee consider that the person should be fixed with this section with knowledge if his failure to obtain knowledge of the relevant fact was due to the negligence of the expert consulted by him.  In fact, the law society are arguing for an extension of what is provided in the Bill and I am quoting it simply to show the type of difficulties that <Col N="2357" /> could arise and the area into which we are tending to move.</P>
    <P>The Law Society are suggesting that if the expert consulted by the litigant, the plaintiff, was in some way negligent in imparting information to the litigant, particularly of a medical condition, or whatever, because we are now talking about personal injuries having restricted the Bill in the way we have, the litigant should be fixed with constructive knowledge as the Minister describes it.  Even if the litigant has acted fairly and reasonably in all respects and is let down by the medical expert then the law society argue in their submission, &ldquo;Well, so be it.  The defendant-litigant should not be aggrieved by this or have a way out because of that&rdquo;.  They go on to argue that the relief for the plaintiff would be in having an action against the medical expert for failure to act properly. I do not accept the law society's position on that.  I am not arguing for their proposition but I am using it merely to illustrate the pitfalls we are pushing the plaintiff-litigant into in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the two subsections I propose to delete entirely, subsection (2) generally is an effort to define further what a person's knowledge should consist of and how it should be assembled. Section 2 (2) provides:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this section, a person's knowledge includes knowledge which he might reasonably have been expected to acquire&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) from facts observable or ascertainable by him, </P>
    <P>That is the litigant.  That clearly means anything the litigant should have known and which was observable and ascertainable by him.  However, section 2 (2) (b) is: &ldquo;from facts ascertainable by him with the help of medical or other appropriate expert advice which it is reasonable for him to seek&rdquo;.  Here we see a proposition opening up.  Where, after a lapse of time, a litigant comes before the court seeking damages against another party for personal injury the other party might well say, &ldquo;Sorry, you are coming too late <Col N="2358" /> in the day.  You should have known reasonably of all this heretofore.  You are coming much too late.  You should have got this curious non-statutory concept of health or whatever it is that is included in the subsection from the medical or other appropriate expert long before now and it is unreasonable of you to come at such a removed time&rdquo;.  That is the problem I see opening up here and it is provided for under the vehicle of this subsection.  It is mirrored again in section 2 (3) (a).</P>
    <P>Rather than these provisions being a protection for the plaintiff-litigant, as the Minister of State suggests they might be, if anything they are opening up a whole area of potential argument and device that will undermine the position on many occasions for the plaintiff-litigant. Section 2 (3) (a) suggests: &ldquo;a person shall not be fixed under this section with knowledge of a fact ascertainable only with the help of expert advice so long as he has taken all reasonable steps to obtain... that advice;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Here the argument will be what was reasonable and what steps should the person have taken to secure the medical or expert advice?  One of the recurring problems for the litigant in medical negligence cases is the assembly of facts: finding out from one section of the medical profession what was wrong with the advice or actions of another section of the medical profession.  Deputy Taylor, who has arrived in the Chamber, and who is a lawyer working in this area is an undoubted expert on medical negligence generally and would agree that often lawyers have to go outside the Republic to Northern Ireland, to England, to the continent or to America to find medical experts and witnesses who will assist in the reasonable pursuit of inquiry by way of litigation against other members of the medical profession at home.  Therefore, what is reasonable in this respect?  Who will decide and to what extent?  If a litigant had gone to a general practitioner down the road, consulted with him or her, and had been told: &ldquo;it is a pain in your head, take a few panadol or whatever else and forget about it&rdquo;, <Col N="2359" /> and subsequently it proved to be a lot more, has that person been reasonable or should they have gone much further afield?  Whenever we get a headache, if we are concerned that litigation might arise or that issues might surround what are reasonable steps in terms of ascertaining advice or assistance, are we obliged not only to consult our general practitioner but also to bear in mind the possibility that it might be argued later that we should have gone much further, and, as well as having taken the two panadol, gone to see a leading expert in Fitzwilliam Square?  These are the types of issues which are being opened up under these two provisions.  I am concerned about them.  I believe the issues should be kept succinct and to the point of facts observable and ascertainable by the plaintiff litigant as provided under the provisions of paragraph (a) of subsection (2) without introducing the further issues as provided by the other subsections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I too received the submissions from the law society and I am inclined to agree with their point.  What bothers me is a case taken by, say, a personal representative of somebody who is deceased.  A problem can arise as to what is reasonable and what is not reasonable.  The person is not around to be questioned on whether the pain in the head was severe enough to suggest that a panadol was sufficient, in so far as a reasonable person would take a panadol, when they should have gone to see some expert.  There is a problem here and I would like the Minister to satisfy us that he has thought about it and that all angles are covered.  When one is trying to deal with something after the person has died and one is dealing on their behalf as a personal representative there can be difficulties in trying to establish what would be regarded as reasonable knowledge. Perhaps the Minister would address his mind to that aspect of the problem as I see it in relation to section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the thrust of what Deputy McCartan has said and I <Col N="2360" /> fully support his amendment.  There is an aspect of this matter which is crucial, and which I do not think he referred to, but possibly he did while I was not in the Chamber.  The manner in which this section is drafted puts an onus on a person who has a claim &mdash; who has sustained an injury, loss or whatever &mdash; to obtain expert advice and to act on that advice. I concede that at a first glance that seems eminently fair and reasonable, but the practicalities of the situation are very different.  The one aspect of this matter I want to talk about is the cost.  It is very easy to say: go and seek expert advice from an expert, a specialist, an orthopaedic surgeon, architect or whatever, but first one has to contend with a number of serious problems.  First, you must find an expert who is prepared to do it, but the most serious problem is that of cost. It costs money to get expert advice from any expert.  I can tell the House that it costs very substantial amounts of money which would be beyond the resources of the overwhelming majority of people who are faced with the need of the service. That is why the number of actions for medical negligence, and other cases of professional negligence, involving people other than doctors is so small in this country. The reason for this is the cost of obtaining expert advice and the absence of legal aid to enable people to secure that advice.</P>
      <P>To put an obligation on an ordinary citizen to say that their position from a limitation point of view will be prejudiced or that they may lose their rights because they have not obtained and acted on expert advice is a very serious matter, because it is tantamount to depriving them of a perfectly valid claim that they may well have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister, while introducing this Bill, was making adequate provision for legal aid to enable the fees charged up front and in advance by these experts, I would have much more sympathy and understanding for it.  If an unfortunate man or woman in the Minister's or my constituency suspects they have a claim for medical negligence &mdash; that is what we are talking about &mdash; they may wish to get <Col N="2361" /> the expert advice but they will not have the few thousand pounds to put up front to get that advice.  Will they lose out because of this subsection if it remains unamended?  I think they will.  Is that fair, reasonable, or just?  I say &ldquo;no&rdquo; that it is totally unacceptable that the absence of the money to pay the expert up front will deprive a person who has a valid claim of the right to pursue it.</P>
    <P>Even if you have the money to put up front &mdash; and very few people have &mdash; the availability of the expert is another matter that will have to be considered here.  The fact is that there is great reluctance among the specialists in the medical profession to give an opinion on a matter that would cast a reflection on one of their colleagues.  I suppose that is understandable, but it does not help the person who wants to take an action and may well have a valid claim and be entitled to take it.</P>
    <P>Many would-be litigants have had to go abroad to get experts.  I have had the experience of having to telephone specialists in a particular field and asking them to help in relation to a certain matter.  They asked which doctor was involved and when I told them they said they were sorry but because of the fact that he was a colleague, they could not be involved.  I was turned down flat on several Occasions for this reason and, eventually, I had to go outside the jurisdiction to get a doctor to examine the person.  He confirmed that something wrong had been done and, after great hassle, difficulty and a tremendous fight by the medical organisation, compensation was obtained.  It was extremely difficult and costly.  Why should there now be an added obstacle in this Bill?  If the Minister wants to help why not tell the House that he will consult the Minister for Justice with a view to obtaining a fair and reasonable legal aid service which would enable people to seek and obtain expert advice?  If that was done, I would have much more sympathy for the section as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the various contributions.  It <Col N="2362" /> seems that the only profession which does not have a society to protect it is the political profession.  All the other professions consistently protect themselves in a very co-ordinated and strong manner.</P>
      <P>As I said, this Bill is based on the report of the Law Reform Commission.  The technical details of the Bill are based on the recommendations contained in the report.  We considered the document in detail and had consultations with the law society.  We had detailed, co-ordinated work with the parliamentary draftsman in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and, based on all that, the Bill was introduced.  I should like to quote from page 46 of the report of the Law Reform Commission:</P>
      <P>We recommend that in determining when the limitation period begins, a person's knowledge should include knowledge which he might reasonably have been expected to acquire from facts ascertainable by him with the help of medical or other appropriate expert advice which it is reasonable for him to seek, but that he should not be fixed with knowledge of a fact ascertainable only with the help of such advice so long as he has taken all reasonable steps to obtain (and, where appropriate, to act on) that advice.  We furthere recommend that knowledge that any acts or omissions did or did not, as a matter of law, involve negligence, nuisance or breach of duty should be irrelevant. </P>
      <P>Section 2 is based on the recommendations of the report of the Law Reform Commission on the general scheme of the Bill to amend the Statute of Limitations, 1957, and the Civil Liability Act, 1961.  Those technical recommendations are on page 59 of the report and are contained in section 2.  We have had expert recommendations and consultations and the Bill is framed in accordance with their views.  We have gone a long way in ensuring that it is as detailed, clear and as legally fair and binding as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2363" /> Subsection (2) has the effect of introducing the notion of constructive knowledge, that is knowledge which may be inferred not directly attributable or expressly to the date of knowledge concept. It does so by setting out those circumstances where a person may be fixed with knowledge that he should reasonably have obtained at or by a particular time.  The subsection provides that knowledge includes knowledge which a person might reasonably have been expected to acquire &mdash; (a) from facts observable or ascertainable by him or, (b) from facts ascertainable by him with the help of medical or other appropriate expert advice which it is reasonable for him to seek.  This was alluded to by a number of speakers earlier.  Thus a court may treat a person as having knowledge of a particular fact if it is of the view that he should have known it or found it out.  The test which the court will apply is that of reasonableness, in other words, if the court thinks that a person could not reasonably be expected to know a particular fact or that it was not unreasonable for him to have failed to seek expert advice which might have established that fact, then the court will not fix him with knowledge of that fact.  This seems eminently fair.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) limits the court's power to attribute knowledge which a person did not have available to him in two important respects.  If a person has taken all reasonable steps to obtain and, if necessary, to act on expert advice, then he will not be fixed with knowledge which could only have been elicited through such advice but which he, nonetheless, failed to acquire.  Furthermore, an injured person who, as a result of the injury, fails to acquire knowledge of a fact relevant to the injury, will not be fixed with knowledge of that fact.  I hope this clarifies the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the Minister a hypothetical question which arises on the amendment.  If a person sought expert advice from, say, an orthopaedic surgeon, and was told that the surgeon was <Col N="2364" /> prepared to carry out an examination and give a report but that the fee would be £1,000 and that person could not raise the money to pay him, what would be the effect of the section if he had taken all reasonable steps to obtain the necessary advice?  If, some years later, he was in a position to pay a fee of that kind would the fact that he did not have the money earlier make a difference?  Does the Minister understand my point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I would not expect anybody to look for expert advice unless it was so recommended by their own legal adviser.  I would not expect a legal adviser to recommend this course unless it was a very grave matter which needed expert, detailed and meticulous advice to confirm a situation.  If the person did not have the money, I cannot say what a legal adviser would recommend, but I presume the court would take the factual position into account and, based on the evidence available to it, make a decision.</P>

They would be eminently fair if we lived in a society which enjoyed the services of an open medical profession which was easily accessible. However, Deputy Taylor supported my view that this is often not the case.  It would be different if there was a comprehensive legal aid system available to people to avail of expert advice.  We are not dealing with an eminently fair and open society and, therefore, I ask that this amendment be put.</P>

      <P>First, I have to express my disappointment at the Taoiseach's response to Deputy Barry's question.  It is widely accepted in this House and by many of the Taoiseach's parliamentary colleagues that this House needs a committee on foreign affairs.  The Taoiseach <Col N="2367" /> has accepted in principle the necessity of establishing such a committee.  Would he confirm whether discussions took place with Deputy Lenihan in relation to Deputy Lenihan chairing this committee? Despite the fact that the Taoiseach is unable to say when the committee will be set up, does he accept in principle that the workings of this House require a committee on foreign policy?</P>

I am a little surprised at Deputy Barry pressing so assiduously for the establishment of this committee when he as Minister, in a Government of which Deputy Spring was a member, refused to establish a foreign affairs committee.

He now comes into the House and says he does not agree that we need such a committee.  Is the Taoiseach <Col N="2368" /> indicating that he no longer intends to establish such a committee?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos.4, 6 and 13 together.  The statutory authority for the establishment of representative associations for members of the Defence Forces rests with the Minister for Defence under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>Recently I signed Defence Force regulations providing for the formal establishment of two associations, the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, for the members of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
      <P>The 1990 Act applies to both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force and provides that an association may represent its members in relation to remuneration and such matters as may be specified in Defence Force regulations but excluding matters such as operations, command, organisation and discipline.</P>
      <P>I am now examining the question of representative structures for the Reserve Defence Force.  I met members of the Reserve on 4 April 1991 and on 1 May 1991, a meeting was held between representatives &mdash; civil and military &mdash; of my Department and a delegation of members of that force.  The delegation outlined their views generally on the establishment of a representative association and it was agreed that these would be considered by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussions with the members of the Reserve Defence Force have taken place in an atmosphere of goodwill and <Col N="2377" /> co-operation and are designed to facilitate the full expression of their proposals.</P>
    <P>The question of approval for a constitution and rules will arise after the formal establishment, by Defence Force regulations, of an association.</P>
    <P>Following the signature by me of the regulations providing for associations in the PDF my Department wrote to the members of the Reserve Defence Force concerned and invited them to furnish their views in regard to the content of the regulations to provide for representative structures for the force.  These views are awaited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister has met only recently with the people concerned.  Were the aims and objectives of the association raised in the course of discussions?  Would the Minister be prepared to accept some of the aims and objectives outlined by the group?  In particular, what would his view be in relation to the group being able to communicate through the media with the general public on matters which concern the association?  Would he have any objection to that?  What would the Minister's attitude be to the acquisition of property, the leaseholding of property and their ability to raise and borrow money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated, I had a constructive meeting with the representatives of the organisation in my own constituency. We did not invite the media and fortunately they did not turn up. Following that meeting they had a further meeting with officials of my Department at which they discussed a number of issues which it would not be appropriate to discuss here.  The Department are more than willing to work out a format or regulations as they did with the other representative associations.  If the achievement we had there can be reflected in the new arrangements for the Reserve Defence Force then I think we will have a very satisfactory outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The constitution of the Reserve Defence Association was adopted by that association on 15 June. <Col N="2378" /> Furthermore, I first raised this issue last November.  What is required now is a specific commitment from the Minister that he is prepared to endorse this association and give statutory effect to it and that he will enable this body to be set up so that it can represent its members at an early date.  Will the Minister accept that there is grave concern that there will just be platitudes from the Department?  We want action.  We want to see this association up and running and we want a commitment from the Minister that this will happen at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the Deputy's interest in this area.  We had a useful and constructive meeting and are awaiting a response from the people we had discussions with.  The sooner we get that, the sooner we can go ahead.  I am willing and anxious to see this association established.  My Department will be forthcoming in their dealings with them in regard to putting these arrangements in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it then, that there will be no undue delay on the part of the Department when the necessary documentation is presented?  Can we hope that before the Dáil sits for the autumn session the regulations will be in force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not give any commitment about dates or times.  However, I can assure the Deputy that there will be no delay on our part.  I believe that subsequent to the meetings I mentioned further meetings have been held by the people proposing to establish the association. For my part there will be no undue delay.</P>

They have <i>An Deiseach</i> which is a harbour launch and is used for training in the Waterford area.  They have four other sailing vessels which are used for instruction and in other areas of training. There would be a wish that further vessels be acquired to supplement those but it is not accurate to say that there is just the one vessel: they have seven vessels.</P>

      <P>That is a separate matter, but we have looked at some other vessels which may be of assistance in training. Some which were looked at were found not suitable because of their age and the difficulty in finding spare parts.  However, in the light of the Deputy's representations I will look further at this.  I have already had some discussions with personnel from An Slua Muirí and we may be able to find some further facilities and vessels as resources permit.</P>

      <P>I seek clarification from the Minister in relation to his reply to the question in the name of Deputy Mitchell. I welcome the news that 146 extra recruits are now operating as able seamen, but could the Minister inform the House whether the extra recruitment enables all seven vessels to be at sea together?  I recall hearing Fianna Fáil Senators on the radio pleading at length with the Minister to put extra vessels to sea to protect the fishermen off the south-west coast. Surely the Minister must be aware that there is widespread concern in the fishing community at the lack of protection offered at this time by our navy?  Will he confirm whether it is now feasible and practical to have all seven naval vessels at sea together protecting our waters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is feasible, practical and realistic for all seven to be at sea together, but as everyone knows, for reasons of maintenance, crew changes and so on there will be times when the boats have to come ashore.  All the vessels are operational and fully crewed and capable of providing an excellent overall service.  A complaint was made recently when the service was called to intervene in a dispute between Spanish and Irish fishing boats.  That is a very difficult and complicated matter.  The Naval Service is there to provide fishery protection and surveillance.  The dispute between individual fishermen, whether they be local fishermen or Spanish and local fishermen, is a complicated issue.  We have certain responsibilities in that area and certain restrictions as well.</P>

Do the fishery protection vessels deal exclusively with salmon protection at this time of the year so that the seas around our coasts are left to the mercy of our competitors from other countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should have put down a separate question about that. There has been co-operation between the regional fishery boards and the Naval Service on salmon protection.  This is at times an inshore fishery as well as a sea fishery. There has been considerable co-operation between the personnel of the regional fishery boards and the Naval Service but there is no question of our other resources being left to the mercy of foreign boats.  The service is an overall service. We have excellent facilities.  We recently got the <i>Newcastle</i> which is fully equipped with highly sophisticated radar equipment and so on.  We have an excellent protection service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this here on a previous occasion and I am raising it again because doubts were expressed as to the capability of providing the service. I have been assured that it is possible to provide this service.  Everyone knows it is not always possible to have all boats out at once because of changes in crew, maintenance etc.  The Deputy is raising a matter about the Naval Service, which is a fishery protection service, being involved in sorting out disputes between individual fishermen.  That is a separate matter and the Deputy should put down a separate question.</P>

      <P>The active strength of Civil Defence volunteers is around 12,000.  My Department have undertaken a review of the roles and training of the Civil Defence organisation in recent times in the light of national requirements and the international outlook.</P>
      <P>While the perception of the risk of nuclear war is less than it has been for many years, the State must also be prepared to respond to the consequences of a peacetime industrial nuclear accident such as occurred in the Chernobyl disaster. The national response mechanism is set out in the peacetime industrial nuclear accident plan and Civil Defence have been assigned specific roles under that plan.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Civil Defence organisation have roles in the measures to be taken consequent on the occurrence of major accidents and disasters and to the provision of Community support generally.</P>

      <P>The Civil Defence organisation in each local authority area provide a back-up to recognised services such as health boards, the Garda and the fire service.  They provide first aid and ambulance cover at sports and community events and also provide assistance, when requested, to the health boards by the provision of ambulances. The Civil Defence also provide four wheel drive vehicles in blizzard and flooding conditions to enable medical personnel visit patients.  The Civil Defence have very wide responsibilities and I should like to avail of this opportunity to compliment them on their splendid work.  With regard to the question of resources, the Civil Defence have not had any difficulty in maintaining their activities, as they have done over the years.  As far as the Government are concerned, priority will always be given to ensuring that the Civil Defence are permitted to play their very important role.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 31 together.  Arrangements are in progress to acquire a site at Ringaskiddy, County Cork as a first step in the provision of a new training establishement for the Naval Service which will include training facilities for fisheries protection measures.  When the site is acquired planning will proceed in relation to the development of the proposed facilities as soon as the necessary financial resources are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but I should like to point out that I would not have put down the question if it were not for the fact that it is two years since it was decided to purchase the site at Haulbowline for a separate training unit.  May I ask the Minister why no progress has been made in that regard and when he expects separate training facilities will be made available at Haulbowline?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that attempts were made to find a suitable site but that we ran into some difficulties. A site was identified at Ringaskiddy but apparently there has been some resistance to the acquisition of it.  The Deputy must be aware of this problem.  In response to representations I received from Fianna Fáil Deputies in the Cork area some time ago, I indicated I was prepared to visit the area.  Alternative sites have been suggested and it is not clear which site will be decided on.  There has been considerable difficulty acquiring <Col N="2388" /> a site and objections were raised to the site originally proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has it taken so long to find an alternative site?  If his Department are so committed to providing this alternative site, why were steps not taken to acquire the site in spite of the objections raised?  Does the Minister not agree that this is a delaying tactic on the part of his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no delay in regard to the acquisition of a site since I took over responsibility for this matter. I visited Haulbowline shortly after my appointment as Minister for Defence and discussed the issue of their requirements with the personnel there.  I was aware at that time that there were objections to the site which had been identified as suitable. They were based on the belief that the site should be developed for industry. Representations were made to me about an alternative site in Passage West.  The best way to expedite the matter is to visit the area &mdash; the Deputy is welcome to come with me &mdash; and identify where the project should be located.  This would be a major step forward in putting the project in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that his Department have let down the Naval Service because of the delay in providing this training unit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry tabled this question because of the promise made in this House more than 18 months ago that the school would be in operation shortly. What was meant by the word &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;? Does the Minister not accept he has the power to acquire property by way of a compulsory purchase order?  Has he considered such an option in view of the objections to the proposed site and the difficulties involved in acquiring an alternative site?  Does he not agree that it would be in the national interest to have this school operational at an early date? Would he consider acquiring a site through the use of a compulsory purchase <Col N="2389" /> order?  As the Minister is aware, compulsory purchase orders are being used to acquire sites for less important uses?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important decision to be taken at this stage is where the new facility should be located so that we can start the planning process.  Lest there be any misunderstanding about this issue, as I said at the outset, this depends on the availability of resources.  Even if we decide on a site I cannot give a commitment that we can immediately put in place the type of modern up-to-date facility required.  I propose to visit the area shortly with a view to making a final decision on a site so that we can get on with the necessary planning and design process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As at 31 May 1991, a total shortfall of about £16.4 million in reimbursable entitlements from the United Nations had accumulated in respect of participation by personnel of the Permanent Defence Force in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon and Cyprus.  Of this amount, £15.7 million relates to involvement in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon since May 1978.  The remaining shortfall of £0.7 million arises out of participation in the United Nations Force in Cyprus which commenced in April 1964.</P>

In view of the need for each country to pay its share can the Minister tell us if this country has paid its share and which countries have not paid? <Col N="2391" /> I understand that both the United States and the USSR have not contributed their shares.

A sizeable proportion of the arrears due has been paid and some of the member states who are in arrears have given a commitment to bring their payments up-to-date.  As I said, the strongest possible representations have been made, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to the United Nations to ensure that whatever arrears are due will be paid.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Reserve Defence Forces, pay, gratuities and travel, £3.209 million; Permanent Defence Force, that is the permanent personnel attached to the FCA and who provide the training for them, travel and pay costs, £14 million.

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that there is a total imbalance in the allocation of resources and that out of the total allocation of approximately £18 million all that is spent on the voluntary element of the Defence Forces is £3.209 million and that £14.8 million is being paid to the Permanent Defence Force personnel attached to the FCA and would he not agree this is an unsatisfactory situation? Is the Minister aware also that a number of FCA recruits cannot attend summer camp because there are insufficient places in the summer camps?  Further, and this is in line with what Deputy Ferris has said, is he aware that a number of recruits are not in a position to go to summer camp because they do not have the necessary uniforms?  Indeed, some members have spent up to £80 of their own money on equipment required to go to summer camp.</P>

However, I gave the actual figures for the 1990 allocation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it was not relevant at that stage and I accepted the Chair's ruling, but it is very relevant now in light of the details the Minister has given to us about the financial allocation to the FCA. Has the strength of the force been cut back by 25 per cent, or when does this decision take effect?  Are there further plans to reduce the strength of the force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are approximately 750 members of the Permanent Defence Forces involved in training with the FCA.  At present this number is being reduced by 25 per cent in accordance with a Government decision which was taken last year.  In many cases personnel carry out duties in the Permanent Defence Forces as well as their training duties in the FCA, so it is very difficult to give a breakdown of the duties they carry out in their own positions and their duties involved in training FCA personnel. However, as I have said, a decision has been made to curtail that and it is presently being undertaken.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most central and important recommendations of the Gleeson report, highlighting the irritation on both sides caused by the fact that civil servants in the Department are watching administrators in the Defence Forces doing the same job.  It is not acceptable for the Minister to respond by saying that 60 per cent of the recommendations have been implemented.  The streamlining of the administration between the Department and the Defence Forces is one of the most important recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should respond.  We have dealt with these two amendments at great length, and I think <Col N="2431" /> the House will agree with that.  At the risk of being repetitive I want to say the subject matter of these amendments was discussed in detail in the Law Reform Commission's report on the matter &mdash; the relevant pages are 45-47.  The provisions in the Bill before us are modelled precisely on the commission's draft Bill at head 6 (2), page 58 of the report to which I referred earlier.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that if the Government had left out these provisions, as Deputy McCartan now proposes, there would be trenchant criticism for not following what the experts recommended.  Such criticism would be well founded because the plain fact is that the references in section 2 (2) (b) and 2 (3) (a) are in aid of the injured person or any other person, including the personal representative.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the Law Society's comments on this provision. The Law Society considered that under this section a person should be fixed with knowledge if his failure to obtain knowledge of the relevant fact was due to the negligence of the expert consulted by him.  The society felt in those circumstances that the action should be against the expert.  That is the recommendation of the society's litigation committee conveyed to my Department by letter dated 29 January last.  That approach is clearly unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The Government are of the view that the commission got it exactly right in this instance.  That is why the text of this provision was approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Barrett's question about an injured person who might be referred to a specialist but due to delays had not been examined and died before an examination takes place, I would think the provision at section 2 (2) (a) only would apply to the personal representative.  His date of knowledge would be fixed by reference to facts observable or ascertainable by him, for example, sight of medical documents or an appointment note with the specialist. The provision at section 2 (2) (b) would not be applicable and, of course, neither <Col N="2432" /> would section 2 (3) (a) apply in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am saying this in order to be helpful because obviously I cannot give legal advice.  It is clear, to me at any rate, that that is what should happen and the Bill does not operate in a way to defeat that objective.  I could say to the House and to the Deputies opposite that I will look at the matter between now and Report Stage, but I believe there is no point at this stage.  I am convinced the section as worded is both fair and reasonable, and where a plaintiff has taken all reasonable steps to obtain expert advice, the provision actually protects him from being fixed with constructive knowledge of a fact which expert advice does not reveal.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (3), line 35, to delete &ldquo;two&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;three&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purport of my amendment is to extend the period from two to three years where we are fixing periods specifically. The Bill as drafted, section 3 (3), provides that an action under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act should be brought within a period of two years of the date of knowledge.  In this amendment and in the related amendment I am pursuing a proposition that we should simply equalise the period of time within which an action should be taken and that where we are seeking to limit the period, it should be limited to three rather than two years.  I hope the Minister will accept this idea and principle at this stage.  It may well be that there are consequential amendments needed to the principal Act and elsewhere to accommodate the idea, but for the life of me I have never fully understood why the Legislature in times past ever differentiated between the right of action that would accrue under the general law of tort for personal injuries and the more specific right of action that would accrue under specific legislation would accrue under specific legislation such as the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980.  Again as a matter of general application, the same period should run and be available to the litigant <Col N="2434" /> from the time the action would accrue. For that reason I am proposing the substitution of &ldquo;three years&rdquo; for the two years stated in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Both amendments seek to increase from two to three years the limitation period which applies where a third party wishes to proceed against the seller of a motor vehicle for breach of the implied condition that the vehicle was not suffering from a dangerous defect.  The thinking underlying the two-year limitation period specified in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, in these cases was that the extension to third parties of this right to claim against the seller was a significant exception to the concept of privity of contract between seller and buyer.  To expose the members of the motor trade to the risk of claims from third parties for a full six years after a sale &mdash; an unknown and unquantifiable risk &mdash; could well put the cost of insurance beyond the reach of many in the trade. The limitation period of two years diminishes the likely insurance costs.</P>
      <P>The duration of this period appears somewhat anomalous, I agree, in the context of the usual period of six years for most torts and three years where personal injuries are involved.  However, the effect of the Deputy's amendment would be to compound the anomaly by providing that in cases under section 13 (7) of the 1980 Act, the limitation period should be three years as he now proposes where personal injuries were involved but two years where there were no personal injuries because this Bill does not affect other categories.</P>

      <P>I do not think that that could be justified.  I made it clear earlier that I am not here to apportion blame or to be negative to anybody.  The purpose of this Bill is to extend the period within which claims for personal injuries can be brought by the application of the test of discoverability and to effect the necessary <Col N="2435" /> changes in that regard.  It is not desired to make substantive changes in the law.</P>
      <P>If there is to be a change, then the appropriate place is in a general Limitations Bill, which this Bill is not, or else in a Bill to amend the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980.  Perhaps in the light of this situation Deputy McCartan would consider withdrawing his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly consider any reasonable proposition put to me by the Minister of State.  I am not entirely convinced with the arguments he has advanced.  I know I have interjected on this issue but I will pursue it now to get it off my chest, particularly when I am accused of being disingenuous on the basis that I am suggesting two formulae for the periods that might apply, simply by reason of the restrictive nature of the Bill before the House: the construction and creature of the Minister.  I would like to avoid anomaly and by all means we should have this Bill extended to deal with all personal injuries and other tortuous actions that may arise.  I pursued that issue earlier in the day without success. I am not prepared to abandon good and reasoned argument and amendment later on simply because the Minister did not see my way at the earlier stages.  I would ask the Minister not to seek to leave me hanging out there simply because the Bill is too narrow.</P>
      <P>The point is important because we are working from the point of view of the litigant &mdash; the ordinary person in the street.  This is a consumer protection provision and we are trying to protect the consumer in this instance because specifically the subsection deals with the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, in relation to the motor trade. We are trying to protect people who buy motor vehicles which are potentially defective.  I would have thought the approach of the Minister of State would be as generous as possible to the potential victims of what has and continues to be a cowboy area of business, not only in the city but throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2436" /> Only a couple of days ago I met a constituent who complained that as she was driving her motorcar out of a shopping centre in my constituency, the car failed to stop and there was a slight collision. She took the car to a garage for repair and when it was put up on the hoist it was discovered that it had been involved previously in a very serious collision and that a certain amount of work had been done to cover up the defects which were visible on the chassis and the basic substructure of the vehicle.  It was a potentially lethal vehicle and, fortunately, failed at a time when there was not a great deal of speed involved.</P>
    <P>Whenever one comes to deal with the issue of the sale and passing on of motor vehicles the whole conundrum of latency and the ingenuity of a section of that motor trade to cover up previous history, to interfere with speedometers and so on, looms large before us.  In addressing the right of action of litigants, once accidents occur, we should err on the side of generosity.  Three years was the minimum period in the 1957 legislation that applied to general personal injuries and I propose we adopt that period when dealing with restricted legislation dealing with personal injuries.  We should not deviate from that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given some explanation that if you were to extend two years to three years in the motor trade that suddenly the whole trade would collapse, that it would make it terribly difficult for people to consider selling motor cars &mdash; if I understand what he suggests &mdash; and the insurance industry would increase their premia out through the roof.  How often in this and other debates when dealing with the right of action of litigants will we hear, from whatever quarter, whatever angle or repository of the Minister's area of advice, about the insurance industry, the increased premia and pricing out of the market of any potential for people to take out insurance on their motor cars?  At some stage someone, somewhere in Government, has to address this issue and lay it to rest once and for all.  I am of the view that the only way to do it is to close down the private <Col N="2437" /> market in this area and establish what has on occasions been close to a national insurance service in terms of motor vehicles.  We came close to it with the collapse of the PMPA and the other insurance company involved.  It is time we stopped representing and presenting the inability of Government to control the pricing area of the insurance industry towards private motor vehicles as a reason for and a basis against doing anything constructive in this area.  Too often we have heard that argument and it is trotted out here again.</P>
    <P>In cases of personal injuries the time in which action can be taken under the provisions of the 1957 Act is generally three years and the same should apply in this case.  Breach of contract is, to some degree, central to this issue and it provides for a longer period in which actions can be taken.  I believe that two years is much too short and is too restrictive.  The extension I am suggesting, from two to three years, is not unreasonable.  I do not accept the Minister's suggestion that that will make the market in the insurance area impossible.  I have no doubt that it will not act as a disincentive to the motor trade to continue in existence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a copy of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act with me but surely the point made by Deputy McCartan is a fair one. What we are talking about here is personal injuries arising from negligence on the part of someone.  The liability is not absolute so far as one must prove there was negligence on the part of the person selling the car.  I maintain, that, no matter what business you are in, if through gross negligence somebody receives a personal injury and that can be proved in court, then we should err on the side of the person who suffered the injuries.  Motor vehicles are very dangerous items of equipment.  Part of the problem insurance companies have at present is that there is no compulsory testing after five years.  If we are so concerned about insurance premiums &mdash; and rightly so because of the cost of insurance in this country &mdash; we should be doing things <Col N="2438" /> of a practical nature that would prevent accidents occurring, prevent injuries happening by imposing restrictions such as compulsory testing of motor vehicles after five years to check whether they are roadworthy.  Where somebody engages in a business and through negligence causes personal injury to others, we have a responsibility to the people who suffer those injuries.  What we are really talking about here is negligence on the part of somebody engaged in the business of selling motor vehicles.  When an ordinary consumer walks into your garage and you assure that person the car is in good order, has not been involved in accidents, is in good mechanical order and is not dangerous, the ordinary person does not have the skill or the expertise to examine the vehicle and, thereore, the transaction involves trust.  Most people in the motor industry are honourable, do a job properly and are not unscrupulous in their day to day business activities but, if somebody deliberately misleads a member of the public as a result of which the consumer suffers personal injuries, liability should be borne by the person who caused the injuries.</P>
      <P>We should not be worried about the effect this would have on insurance costs; I started my working life in the insurance business &mdash; I am still in it &mdash; and I know an insurance company will always look at the moral as well as the actual risk.  The moral risk involves the kind of person to whom cover is being given and part of the process of deciding whether to accept the risk is to look at the person proposing the risk as well as the risk itself.  Insurance companies in those cases should be careful &mdash; indeed they are careful &mdash; not to give cover to people who behave in an unbecoming and unacceptable fashion in their day to day business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress that we should not give the impression in the House that all persons engaged in the motor industry are gangsters or cowboys, they are not.  However, if someone misleads the public by selling a vehicle which is unfit to be on the road and as a result another person suffers serious personal injuries, that person carries not only a heavy responsibility on <Col N="2439" /> their shoulders but also a tremendous liability for which he should answer.  It will make insurance companies more aware of the moral risk aspect of the case being presented to them as well as the risk itself.  Unless I am misreading the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, it is not a qustion of absolute liability, one must also prove negligence on the part of a person.</P>
    <P>We are talking about someone behaving in a negligent fashion.  If that is the case and personal injuries are caused to others, account must also be taken of the rights of the individual who suffered the injuries.  I do not see anything wrong with Deputy McCartan's proposals, indeed, I congratulate him for bringing it to our attention.  I am not concerned either about its effect on insurance premia because, as I said, it would refer to a limited number of people who, if they behave like that, should not be in business in the first place or given insurance cover.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clarify Deputy Barrett's remarks.  I certainly did not wish to give the impression that the whole trade had to be reined in.  I am concerned about people in the trade who, through misinformation, sleight-of-hand or deceit, perpetrate negligence and can be the cause of accidents to the person who buys the motor car.  I do not want to suggest that it is rampant or widespread but we should be erring on the side of generosity in regard to this matter.  I cannot accept that where negligence has been proved and where there is an accident causing personal injury to someone through the sale of a motor car that the market will be thrown out of kilter by the extension of the period from two to three years within which a litigant can bring an action.  Three years is the general period provided for under the 1957 Act for taking an action in regard to personal injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State advanced reasons earlier for including the clause of two years.  Under the 1980 Act it is the single shortest period in the limitation <Col N="2440" /> code of which I am aware for personal injury actions but a negligent motor trader should not be given that extra protection. I do not believe it will have major reverberations for the trade, generally speaking, and we should equalise the provisions in regard to personal injury actions.  I ask the Minister to accept the proposition that we increase the period from two to three years because it will not make a great difference.  It could, on occasions, provide relief for an injured litigant who did not move quickly enough or did not realise what he should have done.  I hope the Minister will accept the decision in the spirit in which it is advanced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartan made a very good case and has been ably supported by Deputy Barrett.  Subparagraph (3) states:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding section 11 (2) (d) (inserted by section 13 (8) of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980) of the Principal Act, an action for damages under section 13 (7) of the said Act of 1980 which consist of or include damages in respect of personal injuries to any person may be brought within two years of the date of knowledge of the person injured if that date is later than the date on which the cause of action accrued. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13 (6) of the 1980 Act extends the benefit of the implied condition enjoyed by the buyer of a vehicle under subsection (2) to any person lawfully using the motor vehicle, who suffers loss. The Society of the Irish Motor Industry and the Confederation of Irish Industry expressed strong reservations about the extension of the concept of privity of contract in this subsection at that time. The Houses of the Oireachtas in 1980 saw fit to impose a two year limitation period in these cases, that is, where a person using a car with the consent of the buyer suffers loss as a result of the implied condition in section 13 (2) of the 1980 Act, it maintains this differential as against the actual purchase of the car because of the legal doctrine of privity of <Col N="2441" /> contract.  An amendment was agreed at that time changing the situation originally proposed in the Bill from six years to two years.  We are again consistent in this Bill and the essence of good legislation must be consistency, particularly when it is modern and relevant.  The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, is only ten years old.  We must maintain our consistency and the House will probably accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have regard to that momentous change in circumstances and realise that it is now time to look at the specific provisions of the 1980 Act. We must realise that times and attitudes have changed.</P>
      <P>The Minister highlighted another inconsistency because the owner of a new or second-hand motor car suffers an injury as a result of a defective vehicle he or she will have right of action within a period of three years from the time of the accident whereas someone lawfully using the motor car, with the consent of the owner, will only have a period of two years.  Why should there be a difference? The Minister has advanced the reason that we were in some way invading the general terms of the privity of contract principles, but are we working this legislation from the point of view of protecting the consumer?  Could the lawful user not be described as a consumer in the same way as is the owner?  Should the seller or supplier of a motor vehicle not have the same duty to the owner as to all potential users of the motor vehicle?  Are we saying that just because somebody spends several thousand pounds on a motor car he or she at their peril pass it on or consider allowing other people the right to use it? There is as much inconsistency there as the Minister might argue there is consistency in the cause he is advancing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2442" /> The whole development in this area in the last ten years has been against the notion of a restrictive policy or doctrine of privity of contract.  We are now moving from a commercial society that has protected in the first instance, the manufacturer, supplier and distributor to a new philosophy that recognises that the consumer, the user and the buyer are of equal importance in the commercial and social life of our contract laws.  I do not believe that 11 years later the same arguments can exist that the privity of contract notion is so restrictive in its general application as to require us to be as restrictive as is being proposed here.  It is time to change, and if the 1980 Act requires amendment perhaps we should consider that at another time.  That was one of the first concessions I made when I moved this amendment.</P>
    <P>In this debate we should be working in the mood and philosophy subtending this legislation recognising the position from where we are coming in regard to the protection of the consumer and purchaser. Certainly there should be equality of rights of the lawful purchaser on the one hand and the lawful user with the purchaser's consent on the other hand.  I see no reason, based on the restrictive principle of privity of contract, for having a differentiation.  I urge the Minister to reconsider this matter before Report Stage or, alternatively, I ask the House to decide the issue.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to very briefly address this section which deals with limitations of actions.  Subsection (1) refers to &ldquo;personal injuries to a person caused by negligence, nuisance or beach of duty (whether the duty exists by virtue of a contract or of a provision made by or under a statute or independently of any contract or any such provision)&rdquo;.  I wish to join with the other Deputies in expressing my reservations about the narrow way in which the legislation has been drafted.  Deputy Barrett sought to deal with the issue of latent defects, I addressed the issue of tortuous actions and Deputy O'Shea dealt with the question of attempting to introduce the issue of ground rents into the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on this Bill has drawn to our attention a matter that needs more consideration by the Department of Justice, sooner one hopes rather than later. The Principal Act of 1957 is the grounding legislation in this area.  It is time we considered this matter again.  At a time <Col N="2444" /> when very good legislation in this regard has been enacted in our neighbouring jurisdiction this House should be asked, as I have said, sooner rather than later to address general issues in this area of the law.  The propositions contained in subsection (1) are very restrictive and perhaps, necessarily so because we are responding to a particular judgment of the Supreme Court.  It is welcome that the House can respond to that judgment. I know there are many lawyers and litigants who are looking forward to the passing of this legislation.  We hope the Minister will come back sooner rather than later with a broader amending Bill if not a new Bill dealing with the issue of limitations of actions generally.  We can then address those other urgent and important issues that Deputies Barrett and O'Shea mentioned earlier.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 21, after &ldquo;right&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;first&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some respects this is a drafting amendment. It was prompted by a submission of the Law Society who suggest that the section would be much tidier and more succinct if the word &ldquo;first&rdquo; was inserted immediately before the word &ldquo;accrued&rdquo;. I suggest that the word &ldquo;first&rdquo; be inserted after the word &ldquo;right&rdquo; on line 21.  This proposal is worthy of consideration.  I will quote from the submission of the Law Society of January 1991, and repeated in a submission of May 1991, to which the <Col N="2445" /> Minister referred.  I quote from paragraph 4:</P>
    <P>The Committee felt that the word &ldquo;first&rdquo; should be inserted in section 5 (1) immediately before the word &ldquo;accrued&rdquo; in line 21 of page 4 of the Bill.  Section 49 (1) (b) of the principal Act is similarly worded and it is thought that there should be a consistency in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister, today at least, is a very substantial proponent of the concept of consistency, so I am sure he will have no difficulty in accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartan, by tabling his amendment, provoked a further examination of section 5 of the Bill. He is indeed correct in saying that the word &ldquo;first&rdquo; is missing before the word &ldquo;accrued&rdquo;.  We only disagree &mdash; and it is hardly worth calling it a disagreement &mdash; on where the missing word should go in.</P>
      <P>To speak of the time when a right of action first accrued to a person, which would be the effect of the Deputy's amendment, is a redundant use of the word &ldquo;first&rdquo;.  This is because once a right of action accrues to a person, it stays accrued; that person cannot accrue the same right a second time.  The best way I can put this is that the accrual of the right of action can best be thought of as leaving an indelible mark or a sign which lasts forever.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the Government amendment uses the word &ldquo;first&rdquo; in a different context, this time to denote that a right of action accrued to one person before it accrued to another.  Sections 5 (1) and (2) are the equivalents in this Bill of sections 49 (1) (a) and (b) of the Statute of Limitations Act 1957.  The reference to the right of action first accruing occurs in paragraph (b) of the 1957 provision; it should accordingly also occur in section 5 (2) of the Bill.  The Government amendment provides for this.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy McCartan might withdraw his amendment No. 8 in favour of Government amendment No. 12.  What he wants to achieve could be achieved through that amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the provision in section 49 (1) (c) of the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957, is to prevent a potential defendant from the danger of legal action indefinitely into the future as a result of successive extensions of time by reason of disability.  It is a perfectly reasonable provision: it cannot be in the public interest that the potential for litigation arising out of a particular fact should survive indefinitely.  It is not a provision peculiar to Irish law.  As I am sure Deputy McCartan would agree, a similar provision exists in the law of at least one neighbouring jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not only reasonable, but necessary for the sake of consistency with existing law, that the provisions of section 49 (1) (c) apply to the new provision in this Bill applying the date of knowledge principle to the situation of potential litigants <Col N="2447" /> under legal disability.  I have already said that this Bill is not designed to break new ground in relation to the general law on the limitation of actions.  Consequently, I regret that I will be unable to accept Deputy McCartan's amendment.  I hope that he will understand and perhaps withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little disappointed at the Minister's response.  The reason I pursued the amendment in the first place is that legislation should work from the point of view of the litigant &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;. Legislation should be made in the first instance from the point of view of the man-in-the-street who is to be protected by that legislation.  When drafting provisions the House should always seek to err on the side of generosity.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why the House should seek to limit the rights of persons when injury and personal loss have accrued.  Section 49 (1) (c) of the Principal Act does not introduce a degree of limitation, but I am not so sure that it should be carried over into 1991 general legislation.  Section 49 (1) (c) of the Principal Act states:</P>
      <P>Where a right of action which has accrued to a person under a disability accrues, on the death of that person while still under a disability, to another person under a disability, no further extension of time shall be allowed by reason of the disability of the second person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this instance we are talking about people with mental disability.  I suppose that in some respects a physical disability could act to deny people the opportunity to accrue the knowledge that the Act required, although it is very hard to envisage circumstances in which that would ever come into play at all.  However, in the limited possibilities of two people in sequence suffering from a particular disability then we as legislators should be generous and work to try to accommodate all eventualities.  Disabilities and deficiencies are never willed or willingly brought upon any member of the community. That being so, legislators should <Col N="2448" /> never work in any way to create a disadvantage for those unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>To accept the general approach of a spirit of generosity and to accept the need to be fair is to allow the general proviso that exists in all such actions of a discretion of the court to decide whether or not in particular circumstances it would be fair or unfair to any litigant or any defendant party to have to answer a claim two generations or beyond of disability.</P>
    <P>For that reason I suggest that the restrictive words in section 5 should not be included.  Section 5 (1) should stand without reference back to section 49 (1) (c) of the Statute of Limitations Act. The amendment probably concerns the occasion of rarity and for that reason might seem not to be an issue of great moment.  It is certainly an issue on which I am not going to fall greatly out of favour with the Minister but, nonetheless, it was important to take the time to thrash out the reasons for borrowing from the principal Act such a restrictive attitude. People should not be penalised for disability and when no other injustice is created &mdash; and any court could rule on that &mdash; then the right of action should be allowed to run until someone with firmness of mind takes it up and presents it to the court.  At that stage the court should be allowed to decide whether any particular impediment or injustice exists. Even though I talk about a rare occasion, there could even be within that occasion a very short time involved.  It could pass from one person to another equally suffering a disability rendering them incapable of launching an action.  A matter of months, if not years could be involved.  For example, if one year or more outside the normal period, one was to be presented with the proposition that nothing has happened because people had been suffering under a disability, why then say to a person of sound mind and body who says there is a cause of action, that they are a year too late, a month too late or whatever, and that had they been fit and well the action could and should have been taken a short time previously?</P>
    <P>Perhaps we are taking too quickly and <Col N="2449" /> too easy an attitude.  I know this is something that might happen rarely, but rare occasions can be as oppressive for the person involved if that set of circumstances should visit their doorstep.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) of this section is, in effect, a replacement for section 49 (2) (a) of the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957.  Part of section 49 (2) (a) was found unconstitutional in the case of O'Brien <i>v.</i> Keogh in 1972 which is reported in Irish Law Reports 144.  That was the provision which removed the benefit of the suspension of time from a personal injuries victim under a disability if, at the time when the right of action accrued, he was in the custody of a parent.  The remaining provisions of section 49 (2) are superfluous in consequence of the constitutional decision. Subsection (4) of this section accordingly repeals the entirely of section 49 (2) of the 1957 Statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Part III of the Statute of Limitations, 1957, where a person is under a disability when a right of action accrues, the limitation period &mdash; three years in the case of actions involving personal injuries &mdash; does not start to run until the person ceases to be under a disability or dies, whichever is earlier.  &ldquo;A person under a disability&rdquo; in this case means either &mdash; (a) an infant, i.e. a person who has not reached the age of majority &mdash; majority is attained on reaching 18 years or on earlier marriage; (b) a person of unsound mind; or (c) a convict subject to the operation of the Forfeiture Act, 1870, where no administrator or curator has been appointed &mdash; this applies to those who are serving sentences of penal servitude; for the duration of sentence a convict is unable to bring a legal action, making a contract or dealing in property in his own right.  Such activities are done only through an administrator appointed by the State or by a curator appointed by the courts on application by an interested party.  This is the only difference of any significance that remains between a sentence of penal servitude and one of imprisonment; modern statutes creating <Col N="2450" /> offences now provide only for imprisonment, and there are proposals in course of development to abolish penal servitude as a separate class of punishment.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (1) of the Bill provides that where a person is under a disability either at the time when a right of action involving personal injuries or for wrongful death accrued to him or at the date of his knowledge of the injury, then the three year limitation period will not start to run until the person ceases to be under a disability or dies, whichever is earlier.</P>
    <P>Section 49 (1) (c) of the Statute of Limitations Act provides that, if a right of action accrues, on the death of a person under a disability, to another person who is also under a disability, no further extension of time will be allowed by reason of the second person's disability. No change is being made in this provision.</P>
    <P>That section is being maintained because to do otherwise would make a very important change in the law which is not justifiable.</P>

    <P>The general provisions of the subsection are acceptable to me.  However, I am concerned that, where a defendant is entitled to make a case that is provided for under the subsection, we should contrive a device that ensures that it is not an issue that is taken up on the date of the hearing thereby allowing a defendant to slip free of any action employing this subsection.  That is why I am putting forward this amendment.  What I have in mind is that all the parties would be joined for the substantive hearing, and issues of who is and who is not at fault would not be allowed to be taken up at the ultimate hour of the process when the action comes to hearing.  It is to avoid people evading responsibility by using a technical device that might not otherwise be available to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that Deputy McCartan's intention in proposing this amendment might be to simplify the working of the section.  I presume that it is also his intention that subsection (4) of the section which refers to the direction to be given by the court in the portion of subsection (3) to be deleted by his amendment is also, as a consequence, to be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in this case I do not think simpler means better as the Deputy's amendment will not achieve what I think we are all agreed should be the desired result.  That desired result can be expressed as follows: if in any fatal injuries claim there are any dependants of the deceased person whose claims would be ruled out by a defence of limitation under 6(1) of the Bill on its own, then each dependant's position should be looked at separately.  The court will not exclude a dependant from claiming in these circumstances if the provisions of section 5 <Col N="2452" /> would have the effect of allowing the claim proceed in spite of what section 6(1) says or &mdash; and these are important alternatives &mdash; if there has been an agreement between the parties not to raise the defence of limitation or any other way in which the court is satisfied that the limitation defence would be defeated.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's amendment runs the risk of eliminating from the Bill these two important provisions which are provided for expressly at section 6(4).  Thus, while the amendment would read more simply, it is clear that the result we all want is not quite as simple as it looks.  The provision in the Bill as it stands does achieve the desired result and there is doubt if the Deputy's amendment would do so.  In the circumstances I think it best that we stick with what we know will work even though it may not be as simply expressed as the House and Deputy McCartan would like.</P>

I do not accept the view of the Law Society that this will inevitably prove to be the tip of the iceberg.  It will address a small number of cases in which people left it too late to bring an action.  They will have an opportunity now to review their position in the light of this legislation. This will perhaps address the specifics of the case that led to the ruling of the Supreme Court and will allow the parties <Col N="2454" /> to that action to have the issues determined by a judge of the High Court in due course.</P>
      <P>All of us who have been close to the workings of the legal profession will have encountered hard luck, sad cases where people had not moved quickly enough because they did not realise in time that they had a cause of action to seek compensation for bad personal injuries and they lost out.

      </P>
      <P>This amendment deals with what is probably the most significant issue which can be raised in the context of criminal damage.  My amendment proposes that damage which accrues from the uninsured driving of a motor vehicle shall be considered as malicious damage for the purposes of this Bill.  I am trying to deal with the problem of the unauthorised taking of motor vehicles and the driving of unisured vehicles by their owners where such cars are involved in accidents which lead to damage and loss to innocent parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was prompted to put down this amendment after hearing about an accident in August last year involving an unfortunate constituent of mine from the Baldoyle area.  I do not believe I need to over-illustrate the scale of this problem.  Unfortunately I do not think there is any owner of a motor car who has not suffered some inconvenience, loss or damage arising out of interference with their car.  A large body of people in the community have suffered substantial loss as a result of the unauthorised taking <Col N="2456" /> of motor cars or the driving of motor cars without insurance.  If the perpetrator of the crime is apprehended he cannot be charged with malicious damage which often times gives the judge an opportunity of ordering the offender to pay compensation.  What happens is that the offender is charged with the unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle or driving without insurance and the issue of damage to another person's property is not raised as an issue because it is not the substance of the charge before the court.  It is very difficult to include damage caused by a motor car in the existing definition of malicious damage in this area.  Even when the malicious injury code was in operation the damage which resulted from the reckless driving of a motor car was never construed in any circumstances by a court as malicious, on the judicial thinking that no one could be construed as being malicious towards oneself.  Regardless of how recklessly a car was being driven it could never be construed as malicious driving as there was always the potential of personal injury being visited on the perpetrator.  In the legal mind, this represented a nonsense.</P>
    <P>In August of last year an unfortunate constituent of mine was driving along the road one evening when an old, battered Cortina being driven towards him which did not have any lights on and which had a Northern Ireland registration collided with him.  When the accused was apprehended it was established that he had no insurance or licence, the car was not taxed or registered in this country and he was driving while drunk.  The unfortunate victim of the accident ended up in hospital for seven days during which time glass which had been embedded in his throat was removed.  The defendant was duly brought to court and prosecuted for all offences and fined the sum total of £180.  In addition he was banned from driving for 10 years.  This was of little consolation to my constituent, a hard working person, whose car was written off.  The accused was not taken before the court and charged with causing malicious damage.  The question of compensating <Col N="2457" /> my constitutent for the cost of replacing his motor car did not arise in the course of the proceedings as it was not the substance of any of the charges.  This difficulty arises in virtually every case of this type, which unfortunately is very prevalent in our courts today.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes that in future a person who drives a motor car without a licence or insurance or takes the car without the consent of the owner or otherwise and drives it recklessly in circumstances similar to those I have just outlined should be answerable in a subsequent hearing for causing damage which amounts to a malicious act on their part.  It is time we addressed this major problem of people driving motor cars without insurance.  One of the effective ways of dealing with this problem is to constitute such driving as malicious in its intent when it causes damage or loss.  This would leave it open to a court to address the loss to an individual arising out of such an incident.  The person involved in the incident will not have the backing of an insurance company but it will give the judge hearing the case the opportunity of saying.  &ldquo;This is a substantive charge and relevant to it is the extent of the loss of the injured party.  I want to know what contribution the defendant or their family can make to compensate the injured party for the loss he has incurred&rdquo;.  I hope the Minister accepts that my amendment seeks to address a major problem which for one reason or another has not been dealt with in either the Criminal Court or in the malicious criminal code.  It is time we addressed this problem on behalf of the beleagured victims who for too long have been seeking redress before our courts but getting little or no hearing because of the lacuna which existed.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment. I was informed by way of a reply to a parliamentary question that the number of vehicles stolen in the greater Dublin area in 1990 was in the region of 7,000. This is the equivalent to 20 vehicles per day.  At present if somebody who is driving without insurance causes personal injury the Motor Insurers Bureau will <Col N="2458" /> pay some compensation to the injured person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately this means that the people who are paying their insurance premiums have to carry a portion of the cost of the payments made by the Motor Insurers Bureau.  A person who takes another person's vehicle without permission and who does not have insurance should also have to pay for any damage he causes to that vehicle.  If we adopt that attitude we will go some way towards discouraging them from taking other people's property.</P>
      <P>When I raised this matter during the course of the debate on the proposal that we renew certain sections of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, on Thursday last I said that it was quite obvious there were people in society who were willing to spend time in prison because crime paid. These people are prepared to break into 40 to 50 houses to take people's property for which they might get six months in prison.  However, because of over-crowding they will have to be released early when they will be able to fall back on their windfall which was taken from other people.  It is quite obvious that imprisonment is not a deterrent.  Apart from increasing the powers of the Garda Síochána and making improvements in the law the only deterrent is to show that crime does not pay and that if people take a car without permission and damage it or take other property they will have to pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 which deals with the payment of compensation to the victims of crime is very welcome and marks a new beginning. We should send out a message loud and clear that society is no longer prepared to tolerate people taking other people's property, living off the proceeds and spending a few months in prison at the taxpayers' expense, perhaps at a cost of £600 per week, while the poor unfortunate victim does not get his goods back. If we say that we will confiscate their assets, in addition to imposing a penalty, <Col N="2459" /> then we may have a deterrent and people might say it is not worth their while spending a few months in prison because when they come out they will have nothing to live on or there will be an attachment to their earnings to ensure the goods are paid for regardless of whether it takes five or ten years to do so.  As long as we are prepared to tolerate a situation where it is profitable to take or damage other people's property detention will not be a deterrent.</P>
    <P>I fail to see how someone should be allowed to get away with a fine, as Deputy McCartan said, of £80 having taken a vehicle, driven it without insurance cover and damaged other people's property. Have we gone mad?</P>

      <P>One does not need to be a genius to come to the conclusion that there are people who do not care because they will not be affected.  Having regard to the fact that they are used to going in and out of detention centres and prisons it is no longer a deterrent.  They also know that they will not serve their full sentence because of over-crowding and if they mind their own business they will be released early on good behaviour. They are turning this into a big business. Prison sentences do not deter them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are suggesting a further deterrent to discourage those who feel they can walk into a person's driveway at night to take a car, waste the time of the Garda who have to chase them, ram the car into a Garda car or a wall, jump over a wall and get away while the poor unfortunate person whose car was taken is left without their property which they may still be paying for by way of a bank or credit union loan.  What is worse is that if they have comprehensive insurance cover and they make a claim their premium will be increased the following year, that is if they can get cover.  People living in certain parts of Dublin are finding it impossible to obtain insurance cover because of the reputation their area has.  I am not <Col N="2460" /> referring here to motor vehicles solely but also to business premises.</P>
    <P>It is time we put a stop to this.  We should make a concerted effort to send a message loud and clear to those who feel they can do what they like with other people's property that those days are over.  In addition to giving the courts, the power to impose a prison sentence, we should give them the option of making a person pay for the property damaged, including damage caused to a vehicle unlawfully taken and crashed.  We should make it clear that those days are over and we are going to tackle this epidemic which is sweeping the country.  Detention is no longer a deterrent.  When we begin to hit these people in the pocket, take away their pickings and impose an obligation on them to repay the person whose property has been damaged then we may have a deterrent which will work.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy McCartan deals with the application of the Bill to damage to property by uninsured drivers &mdash; damage to other cars, walls, fences and so on. No one in this House would have any smypathy with those drivers.  The case outlined by Deputy McCartan is a sad and traumatic one and the defendant involved was convicted.  Deputy McCartan outlined the result.</P>
      <P>As section 2 stands, damage by an uninsured driver will be an offence if all the elements required by the section are present.  The first two elements will normally cause no difficulty.  These are that there must be no lawful excuse for the act and that the damaged property must belong to another person.  That leaves the third element &mdash; did the driver intend to cause the damage?  If he or she did, then an offence under the section has been committed or, and this will probably be the typical case, was the driver reckless &ldquo;as to whether any such property would be damaged,&rdquo; to quote section 2 (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To answer this question it is necessary to look at the definition of &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; in section 2 (6).  Under that provision the driver was reckless if he had foreseen that the kind of damage that was done might <Col N="2461" /> be done and had gone on to take the risk and thus created the damage and the offence.  I can envisage many cases where the actions of uninsured drivers would clearly be reckless in the sense in which the word is used in the Bill.  The same could apply to reckless drivers who are insured and cause damage but it would be wrong to impose a special rule of criminal liability on uninsured drivers where similar behaviour by insured drivers would not be an offence.  That would be contrary to what I think is a principle of the criminal law, that is whether an act is an offence should not depend on who the perpetrator is.  Of course, a person who drives a car while uninsured is already committing an offence for which heavy penalties may be imposed.  The problem as stated by the Deputies is that when the court is convicting a driver of the offence of uninsured driving, it has no power to order compensation for any damge to property which the driver has done while driving an uninsured vehicle.  What is really needed is a general provision giving criminal courts a general power to award compensation when convicting a person of any offence whether it is criminal damage to property, uninsured driving, theft or otherwise.  We should not make unintentional or purely accidental damage an offence merly to enable the convicting court to award compensation. That seems wrong in principle.  The types of cases mentioned by Deputies McCartan and Barrett would not be helped by the amendment.  The offenders in question would not be a mark for compensation because they would not have the resources from which compensation could be claimed.</P>

Certainly there would be more professional <Col N="2462" /> and regular gangsters who, as Deputy Barrett said, would make their living out of being constantly involved in robbery and other crimes.</P>
      <P>I have explained the position as we see it and I hope this will help Members to understand further the effect of the Bill. For these reasons I am afraid I will not be able to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice's concept of the new Irish society which he told us about this morning is slowly coming asunder in the hands of the Minister of State.  The Minister for Justice did not take the opportunity to elaborate on his ideas of what would constitute this new Irish society which he told us about in great &ldquo;capitals&rdquo; this morning. The establishment of the Committee on Crime has the serious intent of tackling the problem of crime and the way in which crime impinges so horribly on all our lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State's response to my amendment is disappointing in the extreme and this concerns me greatly.  He suggests that there is adequate provision under section 2 for the inclusion of dangerous driving, driving without insurance in the circumstances where there is no lawful excuse; that the property belongs to another; and intending to cause damage, and being reckless.  The problem is that time and time again in our courts the latter two criteria render driving dangerously, recklessly and otherwise, as being incapable of consideration as malicious in itself.  The view of the courts generally is that where the person driving the vehicle is potentially putting himself or herself in danger of personal injury it would be disingenuous to ask the courts to consider that the person was visiting a malicious situation not just on others but on themselves as well.  As the Minister of State said, circumstances amounting to accident or misadventure should not be tainted with criminality.  I utterly reject that approach.  In the single instance where such a so-called accident is coupled with the conscious decision of the driver not to have a valid policy of insurance when <Col N="2463" /> driving as required under the Road Traffic Acts, where a person whether through the unauthorised taking of a car of another, or their own conscious decision to drive a motor car on our public roads without insurance, we should have the courage to say in this House that that person or persons is or are being malicious towards the rest of the community or in particular towards the unfortunate person coming in the other direction who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.</P>
    <P>To come back to the case of my unfortunate constituent in Baldoyle, his car was written off to the extent of £1,500. He was a working class man of no great means and he was reducing to walking because he could not gather up the money to replace the car.  I am not making the point that had the defendant in that case been charged with malicious damage the issue could have been resolved in favour of my constituent so that his motor car could at least be replaced or that he would get the financial equivalent, but he singularly complained that this whole issue was not addressed.  The fact that his car was written off and rendered unsuitable was not an issue central to the proceedings at all because there was not before the court a substantive charge dealing with that aspect.  The charge was dangerous driving, driving without insurance, drunk driving and driving without a licence and without tax.  There was nothing that enabled the judge to rule that the charge in front of him which dealt with the loss to this party enabled him to ask the defendant to address that issue. That is what is wrong with the present <i>corpus</i> of law.  To put it another way, I believe that convicting a person of driving without insurance is inadequate in those circumstances because unfortunately our reaction to that kind of conviction does not stamp it with criminality. For some reason the view abroad is that driving without insurance does not amount to an act of criminality.</P>
    <P>It is time that we in this House gave a lead and tried to change that attitude. We have done it in the case of drink <Col N="2464" /> driving to some degree and we had a good example of this last Christmas with the drunk driving campaign.  For far too long we had a bravado attitude that driving while drunk or driving without insurance was fair game and that it was the great man or woman who was not caught.  Very recently I listened to an RTE programme &mdash; I often wonder if it was contrived but I would not suggest that of the programme in question &mdash; on which Mr. Pat Kenny interviewed a woman, a typical responsible housewife who, for all her driving life, drove without insurance.  She told of the buzz she got from driving late at night or to work during the day without insurance.  She had never had car insurance.  I remember the presenter becoming more incredulous as the interview went on and as he was drawing it out of her.  They then followed up this incredible phenomenon over the next few days, which led us to believe that this was more frequent than any one of us would dare to imagine.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett touched on the problem of unauthorised taking of a vehicle. There were 7,000 incidents in Dublin alone over the past year.  That is an area which we must have no doubt amounts to criminality.  However, I want to cast the net more widely and draw into it those who consciously step into a motor car and drive it without insurance.  They know that if an accident occurs they have nothing to offer because they have no insurance cover, as is the respectable thing.  It is time to say that if an accident occurs or if there is a case of misadventure in those circumstances, where a person consciously drives with no insurance cover, it is an act of criminality. It certainly is from the point of view of the poor unfortunate victim who is left with no prospect of compensation.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for Justice address the new Irish society and he stated his great determination to tackle crime in the city.  In fact very recently I heard him address very comprehensively the position of the victims of crime.  I acknowledge his great gesture &mdash; that he is going to increase the budget of the Irish Association for Victim Support for the <Col N="2465" /> princely sum of £8,000 to £12,000.  Is he serious about helping the victims of crime in society?  If the Minister is serious in this regard, this amendment represents an opportunity for him to take on board the reasonable and responsible proposition that a person who takes a car without the consent of the owner or drives his own car without insurance and causes damage is liable in those circumstances to be prosecuted at the suit of the Director of Public Prosecutions, or the election of the garda in charge, for the offence of malicious damage.  If a defendant can show that whilst he or she did not have insurance or the consent of the owner to drive the car there were other extraordinary circumstances that would not allow the charge of malicious damage to stand, let that be determined by the court.</P>
    <P>Let this House and the Minister be in no doubt that on this issue we have clearly in our sights the interests of the victim and of the beleagured owner of property. Later we will deal with the principles of compensation to the victims of crime.  In this specific instance we must look more closely at what is being suggested.  If the Minister is not prepared to adopt this proposition today, I would ask him to look at it again before Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be disrespectful to the Minister regarding his reply but after four years in office the Government are out of touch with the seething anger among the public about what is happening in our streets and in our courts.  If we do not put into our law a clear expression of what we feel about this type of activity, people will begin to take the law into their own hands.  They are fed up with what they see around them and our seeming inability to tackle the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not an excuse for rejecting this amendment that people would not have the money to pay.  That is for the court to decide.  A person who does not have the money today might have it next year and that liability should be carried until it is discharged.  If a person borrows money from a building society or a bank and <Col N="2466" /> subsequently becomes unemployed or runs into business problems, the lending agency will either repossess the house or put that person out of business.  A person who damages a car or other property may be put on probation or committed to Mountjoy for a month or two and that will be the end of it.  That will be no good to me as an individual who has lost property.  I may have taken out a loan to buy the car in the first place.  The bank will not express sympathy and write off the balance in view of the circumstances. They will insist that the money borrowed be repaid.  Nobody will ask where I am to get the money; I will simply have to find it.  In the case of an unpaid debt the bank may pursue a person who has given a personal guarantee in respect of the loan.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with including in this Bill the principle contained in the amendment.  Let the courts decide, depending on the circumstances.  We must shake off the shackles of the principles which were built up over the years. All these principles devolve from the last century when criminals were normally illiterate, uneducated people who were unable to defend themselves and who had no representation or legal aid available to them.  The onus was on the prosecution to prove that the person was guilty.  We are dealing today with people who are in business, people who do not care about other people's property once they get what they want for themselves.  If they want to rob a bank and see my car as being convenient for the job, they will take it.  Then they will carry out the robbery and set fire to the car.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>We must tackle these problems and express in our law the way we feel about people who behave in this fashion.  The fact that it will not be applied in every case does not matter.  If the powers are there under the law, the appropriate charge can be brought.  If not, the public become totally frustrated and ask if we as public representatives do not know what is happening.  If we cannot tell people who come to our clinics that we intend to do something about this, they <Col N="2467" /> will go down the road, in some cases to the Provos, and they will be offered a deal and the job will be done outside the law.  I know this has happened.  A person came to me who told me he had been approached in a pub by a man who had heard that his house was broken into. This man asked him if much had been taken and offered, for £50, to get the property back and inflict a broken arm. Anyone who does not believe me should spend some time on the streets and find out what is happening.  We are not giving those in authority the power to take these people in hand through the proper process of law.  If the public believe that our laws are not capable of dealing with realities of contemporary life, the numbers of those behaving outside the law will increase and we will have an even bigger problem.</P>
    <P>Let us shake off the shackles.  We do not often get an opportunity like this.  Let us show that we are serious about tackling crime and let us not have the nonsense we heard this morning.  The Minister's speech is a PR exercise.  Bunny Carr must be proud of him.  The Minister is telling the public that crime is on the decrease and that Garda numbers are reaching a record level.  This morning, however, we picked up our papers and read that the PRO for the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, who is not a disreputable person, said there were 11,400 gardaí in 1985 and that there are 10,500 in 1991.  Then the Minister comes in here this morning and tells us Garda numbers will be at a record level.  Who is he fooling? The Minister's party blame us for Eoin Harris and Twink.  Let them stop trying to fool the public.  They are not fooled.  Their houses are being broken into, their cars are being stolen or burned, many of them cannot park their cars in the middle of town and if they stop at traffic lights and there is a handbag on the back seat &mdash; whether it should be there is another question &mdash; it will be snatched.  They also fear for the safety of their sons and daughters who are out at night.  That is what the public feel.  Let the Minister not insult their intelligence <Col N="2468" /> with outdated statistics showing that in 1989 there was a percentage drop in this, that and the other.  That does not wash.</P>
    <P>I have been in Government and I know the difficulty facing the Minister of State. I have found him to be a reasonable person and on the ball in many instances, but coming into this Chamber is he given the authority by his Minister to accept positive arguments?  Can he, on his own initiative, say he will accept an amendment because he has listened to the argument?</P>
    <P>This is supposed to be a debating Chamber.  The Minister comes in and presents his proposals.  We table amendments and try to argue our case and if we are successful, he should be prepared to accept it.  The present trend is that he comes in with a script and keeps arguing the point even though we are hoping to prove there is a need for something else. I hope the Minister for Justice is giving his Minister of State authority to accept amendments if the arguments persuade him they are worth accepting.</P>

They are committed to ensuring we frame laws that are relevant, practical and operable and will have the effect of deterring crime.  That is what we want to achieve; that is why we are all here.  I had no preset ideas before I came in here.  I am as flexible as I can be.  I have been four years in this business now and I have tried to be as flexible as I can and will continue to do so. However, there are certain parameters within which we must all operate and which are relevant.  Be they legal, constitutional, or the result of very high powered court decisions, all these things have an effect on how laws are framed and how <Col N="2469" /> the legal process should evolve.  Against that background we have to proceed.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan talked about malice and said is is not at present addressed in uninsured driving because malice is inappropriate when the driver is himself at risk.  Under this Bill the test is whether the driver was reckless as defined, and there seems to be no reason that should be affected by the fact that the driver was also at risk.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what Deputy McCartan is saying but as far as this Bill is concerned it is enough for that person to be reckless.  I assure this House that I am not out of touch; the Government are not out of touch.  We know what is happening but this amendment is not the way to go about dealing with the problems that have been propounded in this debating Chamber by these excellent Deputies.  As I have said, what is needed is a general provision to give all criminal courts dealing with any offence a power to award compensation.  We must proceed against the background of the paramaters to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully in favour of that proposal and I will have it examined with a view to bringing forward the appropriate legislation as a result of the very strong, reinforced commitment and contributions that have been made here, but it is outside the scope of this Bill and we must all recognise that.  We should not <Col N="2470" /> be in a hurry to cast away the basic principles of criminal law.  That could run contrary to the Constitution.  Serious offences should not be capable of being committed if the person concerned does something accidentally.  I would be the first to be criticised if I were to abolish an important element in <i>mens rea</i> necessary to constitute a crime.  I think Deputy McCartan will appreciate that.  That there must be a deliberate conception to commit the crime is a basic premise of criminal law.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the general provision but I regret I cannot accept this amendment. I would love to be able to do so.  I acknowledge that the Deputies are sincere, factual and practical in their efforts to improve this criminal situation, to alleviate the sadness and trauma and reduce the opportunities for criminal activity but it is outside the scope of this Bill.  We cannot do it here.  We will look at it in our Department and perhaps we can come forward with legislation to ensure there are no loopholes for criminals to escape the law, and that they make adequate compensation to innocent victims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (6), line 30, after &ldquo;foreseen&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or should have foreseen&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Section 2 refers to damaging property. Subsection (6) states: &ldquo;For the purposes of this section a person is reckless if he has foreseen that the particular kind of damage that in fact was done might be done and yet has gone on to take the risk of it&rdquo;.  That places an onus on the prosecution to prove that a person foresaw the particular kind of damage which was done and yet went on to take the risk.  For that reason I suggest that we insert the words &ldquo;should have foreseen&rdquo; so that the onus is on the person who caused the damage.  It makes the section far more reasonable and lessens the risk of people getting off on technicalities.  It also shows a firmer intention to deal with the situation.  For that reason I recommend that we insert the word &ldquo;should&rdquo; in line 30.</P>

      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to introduce an objective concept of recklessness into the present law of malicious damage.  This would be a fundamental change.  The background to the present definition of &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; in section 2 (6) is that the Bill proposes, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, to drop the term &ldquo;maliciously&rdquo; which was used in the 1861 Act to describe one of the mental elements in criminal damage to property. That mental element is now expressed in the Bill as intention or recklessness.  This change is not one of substance because it is well established &mdash; I quote from Kenny's <i>Outline of the Criminal Law</i> published as long ago as 1902:</P>
      <P>In any statutory definition of a crime, malice must be taken not in the old vague sense of wickedness in general but as requiring either (1) an actual intention to do the particular kind of harm that was done; or (2) recklessness as to whether such harm should occur or not. </P>
      <P>In that work Kenny spelt out what &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; meant, i.e. that the accused had foreseen that the particular kind of harm might be done and yet had gone on to take the risk of it.  That interpretation has been accepted in this country ever since. It is a subjective interpretation.  The accused must have foreseen the risk of damage.  It is not enough that the risk would have been obvious to a reasonably prudent person who stopped to think. For example, a blind man would not be held to have recklessly damaged propery because he was unaware of a risk which would have been obvious to a sighted person.  To take a more extreme example, a person might strike a match being unaware, because of a heavy cold, that the premises were reeking with petrol fumes.  He would not be reckless in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; was not defined in the Bill there would be uncertainty as to how the courts would define it, i.e. whether subjectively or objectively.  In the United Kingdom, in a similar situation, the House of Lords decided that, in the <Col N="2475" /> absence of a statutory definition, &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; had to be given its ordinary meaning. It held that, if a person did any act which created an obvious risk &mdash; that is obvious to a reasonably prudent person &mdash; that property would be damaged, he would be reckless if he had not given any thought to the possibility of there being such risk or had recognised that there was some risk involved and had, nonetheless, gone on to do it.  In other words, it decided that &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; was to be interpreted objectively.  That is why the Bill defines &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; and defines it in the traditional subjective sense.  The result should be to avoid any possible uncertainty that might result from the change from the archaic and misleading term &ldquo;maliciously&rdquo; to &ldquo;intention or recklessness&rdquo; as constituting an ingredient of the offence of criminal damage.</P>

      <P>Let us get back to reality.  We spent a lot of time dealing with the question of driving without motor insurance, people taking other persons' cars, damaging them and so on. Deputy McCartan made various points in relation to how difficult it can be to prove something.  I do not care what was said in 1902.  At that time 9,000 houses per year were not being broken into in Dublin and 7,000 cars were not being taken from the streets every year, because people did not have cars.  Up to 1950 or 1960 people could leave keys in their doors, whether it be in the Liberties, Sheriff Street or Sean McDermott Street, while going shopping and when they went to bed at night.  If that was the case in the fifties and sixties it must have been much better in 1902.  The best of luck to the gentlemen who thought up these things then but we are legislating in 1991 and the circumstances now are totally different from the circumstances of 1902.  Everything we deal with refers to Acts from years ago.  Legislation dealing with fraud <Col N="2476" /> refers back to 1870 and 1916.  It is no wonder the Garda cannot deal with modern-day crime.  We should forget about what was said in 1902 and think about what is suitable for today.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill a person who without lawful excuse damages any property belonging to another or intending to damage any property or being reckless as to whether any such property would be damaged shall be guilty of an offence.  I do not want to tie the courts in knots. Subsection (6) to which my amendment refers states: &ldquo;For the purposes of this section a person is reckless if he has foreseen that the particular kind of damage that in fact was done might be done and yet has gone on to take the risk of it.&rdquo;  I do not want to get into legal argument about the definition of a person being reckless if he has foreseen something. The person must have foreseen and must be fairly positive about something.  It is common sense to foresee things.</P>
      <P>For example, a person should foresee that to light a match near a can of petrol with the lid open will cause a problem and should therefore light the match somewhere else.  We do not want to get into legal argument as to whether lighting a match over a can of petrol is a wise thing to do.  Basic common sense will tell you that you should not do things like that.  Basic common sense tells me that if someone takes my car without being insured they should foresee, given the number of accidents in the city, that there is a reasonable chance that they might drive into somebody.  If they exceed the speed limit, hit a wall and damage my car they should have foreseen that that was a possibility.  The fact that a person does something like this means they are taking a risk that they should not be taking in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With due respect to the gentleman who made the profound statement in 1902, we should try to legislate for the problems that the courts and the Garda have to deal with in 1991.  The hands of the Garda are tied enough at the moment, so let us not tie them any further.  People who behave in an unacceptable fashion should be answerable for their actions.  Let us <Col N="2477" /> think about the victims for a change and stop worrying too much about people who take other people's cars, damage other people's property or do stupid things like setting fire to cars parked outside houses.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of what happened in Ballybrack.  An 18 year old was brought before the court for setting fire to people's cars.  This happened outside the homes of ordinary working class people.  The cars were parked in the driveways of corporation houses.  These people do not have garages and therefore it cannot be said that they should put their cars in garages.  Some people would say they should not have cars &mdash; that is the sort of attitude that is taken.  These people have no option but to leave their cars outside their doors.  Some little hooligans &mdash; that is what they are &mdash; set fire to the cars in the early hours of the morning. It was due to the mercy of God that some of the cars did not explode and set fire to a whole row of houses.  People had to take their children out of bed and evacuate their homes because these people, for amusement, set fire to seven cars.  One man, a painting contractor, had his van containing his equipment burned out and therefore was put out of business.</P>
    <P>Are we going to start arguing in court about the word &ldquo;foreseen&rdquo;?  Anybody who sets fire to a car outside a house should foresee that there is every possibility that it could cause the deaths of ten or 20 people or that their houses could be burned down.  The people who set fire to the cars in Ballybrack should have foreseen that there was every possibility that they would cause major damage to houses and their contents, not to mention the loss of life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to Deputy Barrett's contribution and I appreciate it.  He is obviously frustrated with the law as it stands.  It does not follow from the fact that there is a subjective test of recklessness that an accused person can say that he did not foresee a risk and expect the court or the jury to believe him.  They simply will not <Col N="2478" /> believe him if he is of average intelligence and capacity and that is obvious to the court, the judge and the jury.  What would be wrong would be where a person who genuinely, because of limited intelligence or otherwise, did not foresee the risk, would be convicted.  The law does not allow for that.</P>
      <P>The fact that a principle has been accepted since 1902 does not make it less worthwhile now.  Our criminal law and procedures must be fair to both the victim and the accused.  If they are not, they are unconstitutional.  It is not fair to convict and sentence people who suffer disabilities. Basically what we are saying is that a court will interpret and adjudicate on a particular case on the evidence before it.  A defence by an individual that he did not foresee the after-effect of what he did when committing the offence would be a matter for the court to decide and therefore he would not get away in that type of case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If we put into law that &ldquo;for the purposes of this section a person is reckless if he has foreseen&rdquo;, the onus is on the prosecution to prove that the person foresaw that the damage that was done might be done but yet took the risk of doing it.  That point would have to be proved.  Of course we do not want to convict people who have mental disability. We do not suggest that such people should be put into prison or that we harm anybody who does not have his or her full senses.  The courts will take that into account.  That is what they are there for.  Why consistently put the onus on the prosecution?  At present people get off on technicalities.  One is reckless if one should have foreseen that certain actions would cause damage &mdash; that is basic common sense.  The prosecution should not have to prove that a person foresaw damage and was therefore guilty. <Col N="2479" /> There are certain things one should foresee. The person who sets fire to a car can foresee the likely damage to be caused. I do not see any principles of law being massively changed by modernising our legislation.  I hate to detain the House on this issue, but it makes me feel very frustrated, to be honest.</P>

      <P>I do not want to add to Deputy Barrett's frustration, but it is obvious that anybody of average intelligence who sets fire to a car outside a house and was physically able to get there must be able to foresee that a major offence is being committed.  No matter what defence such a person puts forward once it is proved that he or she committed the offence then the courts would find that person guilty, I am confident of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <P>There is an onus of proof in every case.  I am a layman but I know there is an onus of proof at all times.  However, someone could not go to court and put up the defence that resultant damage was not foreseen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course a person would do that.  In court he or she would say: &ldquo;I intended to burn the car, your Honour, but I did not mean to burn the house.&rdquo;  There would then be a big argument and the court would go into a long rigmarole about whether resultant action had been foreseen.  Senior counsel would be brought in, the case would be challenged right up the line and we would all <Col N="2480" /> sit back and wait for a decision.  That is the reality and we should not fool ourselves. If a person set fire to a car outside a house it would have to be proved by the prosecution that resulting damage to a row of houses, including a house that might be five doors away, was foreseen. A lawyer would argue in defence of an accused person that the person had intended to set fire to the car but did not foresee damage to the houses.  Next would come arguments about how much petrol had been in the tank of the car, and the accused would say that he or she did not know that the tank held any petrol or that it was likely that an explosion would result.</P>

      <P>For the burning of a car alone &mdash; if it is proved that a person did that &mdash; a person could be sentenced to life imprisonment under our laws. Concurrent sentences can be imposed if more damage is caused.  The laws are there and we have to operate them under the constitutional and legal parameters. A person could not claim that he or she did not foresee resultant damage just because of what is stated in the law. When it is obvious that a person could foresee that damage was likely to occur, no matter what defence is put up, so long as he or she is of average intelligence and it is proved conclusively that he or she committed the offence then that person is liable to conviction, and the courts will convict.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 3, to insert the following new section: </P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;Any offence charged under this Act shall not be a scheduled offence for the purposes of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, as amended.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2481" /> This is a succinct amendment that states that for the purposes of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, as amended, no offence under this Bill shall be scheduled. In other words, the amendment proposes to deschedulise offences of malicious damage as under this Bill from the workings of the 1939 Act.  That would mean that for the offence of malicious damage alone a person could not be detained under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, for a period of 48 hours or any part thereof.</P>
    <P>I should not have the slightest difficulty with the Minister of State on this amendment, considering the earlier debate on the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill.  During the debate on that Bill I moved two amendments to delete two subsections on the basis that the legislation would be better served without them.  The Minister very cogently argued against me and won the issue on the basis that he was simply doing what the Law Reform Commission recommended and in that respect this Bill followed the commission's recommendations.  What I am proposing here is what the Law Reform Commission recommended.  The Minister of State, being a great man for consistency, will, no doubt, accept my amendment.</P>
    <P>I am perhaps being a little tongue in cheek in saying that because, on the other hand, according to the speech to the House by the Minister for Justice some time ago when he moved the Bill's Second Stage reading he said he would not accept the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.  The reason given by the Minister for that has no substance whatever.  He said that the commission's recommendation to deschedulise was not relevant to the proposed Bill because the scheduling or descheduling of an offence was a matter to be effected by a Government order under section 36 of the 1939 Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister was saying that that was not the business of the Bill but the Law Reform Commission did not take that view.  They made a very strong recommendation on the grounds that the 1984 <Col N="2482" /> Act was in existence, providing for the detention of persons for six hours and for a further six hours.  In fact, it has been illustrated by many commentators that that detention can approximate up to 40 hours over two days, depending on the hour of the day on which a person was initially detained, the period of time that questioning was suspended in the interim and so on.</P>
    <P>Adequate provision exists in the normal corpus of our criminal law for powers of detention for members of An Garda Síochána for malicious damage offences and, indeed, for many other offences.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1984 is now the standard legislation in that regard.  On the other hand, the 1939 Act is extraordinary legislation brought in under the aegis of Article 38 of the Constitution at the time of the Second World War to deal with inordinate subversion within the State.  As the Act states in its preamble and Title, it is an Act to deal with offences against the State and the activities of unlawful organisations at large.  It was never designed to deal with the ordinary, everyday, common criminal occurrence.</P>
    <P>What has happened is that the Schedule to the Act has on several occasions &mdash; and I think I am correct in saying that the most recent occasion was in 1971 &mdash; been added to.  Malicious damage is one of the offences not originally scheduled but added in later times.  Unfortunately, that has led to an extension of the use of the 1939 Act being extraordinary in its concept and original design, beyond what it was originally designed to deal with, namely offences against the State and the activities of unlawful organisations.  It is now used almost daily by members of An Garda Síochána and was until 1984, as a device of necessity to deal with recurring, pernicious and difficult crime of interfering with people's property.  Take the case of a house break-in in which the method of entry was by the breaking of a window and the house was probably cleaned of all its valuables to the value of several thousand pounds.  Though the malicious damage element would be no <Col N="2483" /> more than the price of a pane of glass, a person could be, and was, detained for up to 48 hours under the Offences Against the State Act as the only device available to the Garda Síochána at the time to investigate the crime within the confines of the Garda station.</P>
    <P>That has now changed fundamentally and under the 1984 Act last week we made permanent in our law the power of detention generally.  The ridiculousness of this situation is illustrated in the extreme case of Timothy Bowes where the Garda had to try to operate using section 30 in circumstances for which it was not originally designed.  The suspect had been detained on suspicion that he had been the perpetrator of a very serious crime, the crime of murder.  He was detained under section 30 on the grounds that the kitchen knife used as the weapon of offence had been bent in the course of its being used in the attack against the unfortunate victim.</P>
    <P>Mr. Bowes sought recourse to the High Court.  The President of the High Court at the time had no difficulty criticising what the Garda had done.  They had sought around for powers that would enable them to investigate the most serious crime known and had used this device, that there had been malicious damage caused to the knife that had been found in the house of the victim and used in the course of the crime.  That was very serious and the Garda were severely criticised for that incident.</P>
    <P>It threw up the whole question of whether section 30 was ever designed for the purposes for which it was now being used by the Garda Síochána.  This led in time to a judgement of the Central Criminal Court delivered by Mr. Justice Barr in the mid-eighties when he ruled that section 30 was never designed for the purposes for which the Garda were using it.  He said that what the Garda were doing amounted to an extension of the Act way beyond what had ever been intended by the Legislature.  He, in turn, was criticised by the Supreme Court who said that the question of interpreting the extent of legislation was a matter for the <Col N="2484" /> Legislature and not the courts and that the judges of the criminal courts in our country had to apply the Offences Against the State Act in the way it was originally drafted, even though in practice it had been given a very wide and extensive use greater than was originally intended by the Legislature introducing the legislation and as reflected in the Title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The point is that there has been confusion and ambiguity in this area which led to the Law Reform Commission pointing up that there was unnecessary confusion, that all of this had now been addressed succinctly by the provisions of section 4 of the 1984 Act and that therefore, the confusion should end.  I have to say that there are still considerable misgivings among practitioners and commentators on the civil liberties side of things in our community against the use of section 30 for purposes for which it was never designed.</P>
    <P>Many of us, labouring under these concerns, welcomed the fact that an august body of commentators and experts in this area, the Law Reform Commission, had come to the conclusion that this confusion and extension of the original Act beyond the original intent should be ended and, therefore, welcomed the publication of the report and believed there would not be the slightest hesitation on the part of the Minister and the Government in accepting this recommendation.  I was, therefore, singularly disappointed that the Minister used a very spurious argument during Second Stage to avoid responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission also spoke about the issue of expense because of people being detained for longer periods than was necessary.  It does not seem to worry the Minister greatly although there is talk about saving on public expenditure in a lot of other areas.  The Minister does make the point that when we put this Act in place consideration will have to be given to rearranging the Schedule of the 1939 Act to accommodate the new provisions of this Act once it is passed into law.  If the Minister is not accepting the recommendation of the Law Reform <Col N="2485" /> Commission at this stage, if he is not taking on board the amendment I am proposing, he should at least indicate firmly and unequivocally that the Government accept in principle the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and when addressing the question of scheduling of the provisions of this Act under the 1939 Act will give consideration to taking out the offence of malicious damage generally from the working of the 1939 Act.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable proposal, an enlightened proposal, and the Law Reform Commission ought to be congratulated for recommending it.  I hope the Minister of State who is a great advocate of consistency will not abandon that aspect at this stage and disappoint me in my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be consistent with what the Minister for Justice said on Second Stage, and with the rights of the Government to schedule and deschedule offences at any time.  In the interests of law and order, in the interests of the protection of the State and to allow the necessary flexibility to Government in responding to a particularly serious situation, this discretion must remain with the Government.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the scheduling, or descheduling, of an offence under the 1939 Act is a matter to be effected by the Government under section 36 of that Act.  Section 36 provides that whenever the Government are satisfied that the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order can be secured through the medium of the ordinary courts in relation to offences of any particular class or kind or under any particular enactment, they may declare by order that those offences shall cease to be scheduled offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Justice said when this matter was raised on Second Stage, the need to continue scheduling particular offences is reviewed periodically, but he did not at this juncture propose to ask the Government to deschedule malicious damage offences.  However, the matter will come up for review again <Col N="2486" /> when this Bill becomes law in the context of making a consequential amendment of the scheduling order, which refers to offences under the 1861 Act.  In the course of the next review, the Government will be guided by the views of those responsible for the investigation and prosecution of these offences.  They will also take into account the views of the Law Reform Commission and, in particular, the views expressed in this House.</P>
    <P>Even if I agree with all the Deputy is saying &mdash; and I do not &mdash; I could not go along with his amendment.  I say that because he is proposing that in no circumstances would the Government &mdash; any Government &mdash; be able to schedule criminal damage offences in the future. That would be an unacceptable restriction on the freedom of a government to safeguard public peace and order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartan said the Minister for Justice said on Second Stage that descheduling of malicious damages offences was not relevant to the Bill whereas the Law Reform Commission have recommended that it should be in the Bill.  In fact, the Commission did not include a provision to this effect in the scheme of the Bill which they appended to their report.  Clearly they accepted that any descheduling would not be effected by the Bill but by an order of the Government under the Offences Against the State Act.  We must be consistent. This is a very important provision. It is an opportunity for Government to respond to particular situations and I am sure Deputy McCartan can accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that it is a very important issue.  It is one I will be pursuing to a vote unless I can persuade the Minister of State to change his mind, or if I cannot extract from him some clear indication that the Government accept the principle of what the Law Reform Commission argue and recommend in <Col N="2487" /> this area.  It is a very important issue touching on the balance between the powers of the Garda Síochána to investigate and pursue crime, and the interests of innocent people at large and the protection of liberties in our community.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also indicated that the Government would have regard primarily to the views of the Garda Síochána in respect of whether they should deschedule the offence of malicious damage at any stage.  I do not expect the Garda Síochána to easily give up those powers to which they have become accustomed. I made the point on the debate on the motion for the permanent inclusion of section 4 in our legislation, that there has not been a substantial falling off in the number of section 30 detentions irrespective of the existence of section 4 which has been in use since 1987.  The rules and regulations, and the application of the law as amended by the 1984 Act <i>vis-a-vis</i> section 4 detention is very cumbersome and it is often difficult for members of the Garda Síochána to operate under those rules and regulations.  I appreciate the point made by the Minister for Justice that those same rules should apply to section 30 detentions.  In practice section 30 is used as a far more informal and ready device than section 4.  Section 4 has been implemented carefully, slowly and methodically.  It is a whole new process being brought into the everyday work of the Garda Síochána since 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Practice has shown that section 30 is used with greater ease and more often than it was ever intended.  Section 30 is far more succinct legislation.  It requires the initial suspicion of the officer that a stated offence has been committed by the person concerned, and then the person is detained initially for 24 hours; there is no question of consultation with a superintendent of the Garda Síochána until 24 hours has almost expired, and the officer needs a further 24 hours.  That is one of the advantages for the officer investigating a crime under section 30.  He does not have to seek higher approval for what he is doing until 24 hours have almost expired.  Under the 1984 Act the <Col N="2488" /> officer is accountable to his superior officer within six hours and again at the conclusion.  Section 30 will continue to be widely availed of by members of the Garda Síochána irrespective of the desire of this House and the Legislature that the 1984 Act become the norm in all situations where it should apply.  That is why the Law Reform Commission make this strong recommendation and argue for an end to the unnecessary expense of the dual situation with regard to most crime and with regard to the unnecessary confusion that has existed heretofore.</P>
    <P>This is an important issue and while the Minister might believe that we should not legislate for it at this stage, I argue that it is an extremely important matter of civil liberty.  We should use this Bill to lay down a marker that malicious damage type offences were never envisaged under this section.  We should bring to mind the original concept of the 1939 Act which was introduced to deal with acts against the State, undermining the status and existence of the State.  In what way does malicious damage represent a vehicle through which unlawful organisations will attack the existence or stability of the State in our present context? I accept that unlawful organisations have cachés of armaments and explosives in hides and safe houses in the State and I do not condone that but one has to ask where is the evidence to suggest that they represent a threat to the existence of the State?  That question must be asked in the context of debating the use of section 30, providing for 48 hour detention in the context of malicious damage offences and recognising that detention under the Criminal Justice Act 1984 should be the norm.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that my amendment if accepted would mean that we would never again be in a position to allow a Government to schedule malicious damage for the purpose of the 1939 Act. There is nothing to stop the Minister, with co-operation from all sides of the House in an emergency, as the Government did in 1973 with regard to the same Act, from introducing emergency legislation. If the security of the State was <Col N="2489" /> threatened and we were convinced that malicious damage should be re-entered as a scheduled offence, the Minister could bring in amending legislation with the co-operation of all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The extension of malicious damage for the purpose of the 1939 Act represented the Government of the day taking a degree of licence that allowed the Garda Síochána to divert the use of the 1939 Act to a use which the Legislature of the day never intended.  The provisions of the 1984 Act give adequate opportunities to the Garda Síochána to investigate crimes in the police station, with a reasonable period for questioning and detention available to them.  If my amendment is not accepted for technical drafting reasons, the Minister should at least give an indication that the Government have a serious intent in this regard.  I will not press my amendment if the Minister does that but will wait for the moment when the Government decide, so as to bring matters into line with what the Law Reform Commission recommend in this area.</P>

      <P>This amendment is not <Col N="2490" /> appropriate to the Bill.  It is appropriate to a Government order under the 1939 Act.  When the Act comes into force all views will be taken into account&mdash;the views of the Law Reform Commission and the views of this House&mdash;and at the end of the day the Government will make the final decision.  I dot not want to sow seeds of destruction but we can all envisage situations where certain organs of the State or facilities of the State would be under threat.  We must ensure that the Government of the day have flexibility to be able to respond rapidly under the 1939 Act.  The review will take place and everything will be on the table.  Ultimately the Government, in the interests of law and order and in the interests of the country, will take a final decision.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business.   Financing of Local Authorities: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Gilmore on Tuesday, 18 June 1991:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, deplores the failure of the Government to honour commitments given by Fianna Fáil in 1985 to</P>
    <P> (1)  abolish local charges and to repeal the legislation under which they were introduced, namely the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (Amendment) Act, 1983,</P>
    <P>(2)  put local authority financing on a sound basis by the introduction of new legislation to provide that local authorities would receive a guaranteed statutory contribution each year; </P>
    <P>noting that the failure of central Government to provide adequate finances has led to a further erosion of local democracy and</P>
    <P> (a)  the virtual ending of local authority house building,</P>
    <P>(b)  the deterioration of existing housing stock,</P>
    <P>(c)  pot-holed roads,</P>
    <P>(d)  cutbacks in a whole range of local authority services, and</P>
    <P>(e)  a general deterioration in the environment; </P>
    <P>believing that service charges are unjust and represent a form of double taxation, calls for their immediate abolition; further calls on the Government to ensure the provision of a fixed proportion of central funds for local government to be allocated on a fair and equitable basis; and conscious of the appalling unemployment crisis now facing the country, believes that properly funded local authorities could play an important role in job creation through joint ventures with public, private and co-operative companies, using the skill and enterprise of local authority staff. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I mentioned that while out canvassing during the past few weeks I found people to be very cynical and that they tended not to believe what politicians have to say.  This is hardly surprising.  It is now six years since I first entered politics and since Fianna Fáil gave the electorate the run around.  On that occasion I had to face a barrage of criticism on the doorsteps which had been trumped up by the Fianna Fáil Party and those who canvassed on their behalf. They told the people of Ireland then that following the election they would abolish water and local service charges. However, when returned to power they did something else entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They managed to gain control, by winning an extra seat or two, of Monaghan Country Council and unbelieveably councillors who had been elected on that issue when discussing the Estimates decided quite casually that they would not abolish the charges.  That marked a new low in politics in Country Monaghan and, indeed, this country.  Is it any wonder therefore that politicians find people to be very cynical on the doorsteps?  I do <Col N="2494" /> not know whether that was U-turn No. 1. No. 69 or No. 84&mdash;I do not recall what the priorities of Fianna Fáil were at that time &mdash; but it was one of many and did nothing for democracy.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party deserve no credit for the approach they adopted while in Opposition during the period 1983-87. During that period they supported, incited and encouraged pressure groups, wherever they could find them, to rise up against the Government and create as much trouble as possible for them.  They made no attempt to have any regard for the underlying difficulties in the economy. This is in stark contrast with the position adopted by the Fine Gael Party following the 1987 general election.  The Fianna Fáil Party gained in the short term from that behaviour as it took time for the electorate to come to the conclusion that they were insincere and that their attitude amounted to no more than pure unadulterated politicking.  I presume this is the reason the Fianna Fáil Party failed to get a clear mandate from the electorate in both 1987 and 1989.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are strongly opposed to the Government amendment and join with other parties in condemning the failure of the Government to provide adequate funds for local authorities.  We also condemn Fianna Fáil for breaking their promises in this matter.  However, we would not support any measure that would force local authorities to abolish charges immediately without taking local circumstances into account.  This is clearly a matter that would lead to division at local level and Fine Gael have advised their candidates of this.</P>
    <P>The blanket abolition of these charges will lead to large-scale job losses at local authority level and this would be unacceptable given the present level of unemployment. Fine Gael do not want local government in Ireland to reach the point which has been reached in parts of Britain where thousands of employees of local authorities are being laid off this week nor do we believe that local people should be deprived of essential local services by such a precipitative step.</P>
    <P>We want to make it clear that we do <Col N="2495" /> not support any proposal that would lead to immediate redundancies and cutbacks in local services.  That is the Fine Gael position.  It is quite clear and implicit in the legislation that local authorities have an option in this matter.  Local authorities may levy local charges at whatever level they wish or they may choose not to do so.  This is real power at local authority level.  As that is the situation and local authorities have the right to levy charges or not, there is no advantage whatever in The Workers' Party proposal to repeal the legislation.  It is a matter for decision at local level and we think that is good for local authorities.  It is good that local people have the power to vote into positions of authority people who are willing to exercise that authority.  It is very important that local authorities should have that option and power.  That is our position.  When the bell rings for the vote tonight we will be opposing the Government position for all sorts of reasons.</P>
    <P>The Minister came in here last night and cobbled together a glowing statement of the achievements of his party in power with regard to the housing programme. He made some very complimentary comments on the new programme he put before the local authorities. He did not say that this programme was a cop out and that he was withdrawing from providing local authority houses.  Mind you, he was not going very far from the position he adopted last year when the number of houses provided by his Government was minimal, and was somewhere around one-sixth of the housing stock provided by the Coalition Government of 1983-87.  This goes nowhere to meeting the demand.  I do not have the exact figures but there are suggestions that the number on the housing waiting list is greater than ever.  The waiting list is huge.</P>
    <P>The Minister chose to try to justify his position last night and tried to cover over the cracks by presenting a set of proposals which would, in effect, remove the Government and the local authorities from any direct responsibility for providing houses.  The Minister is providing <Col N="2496" /> a couple of million pounds here and there.  He has made £2 million available so that private individuals can avail of £10,000 grants, maximum, to bring accommodation which is unfit for human habitation up to standard.  He has decided also that the allocation of an additional £10 million will bring about some sort of miracle.  That policy is a cop out and will be seen as such as the year progresses.</P>
    <P>There is hardly need for me to say anything about the state of our roads.  We are the laughing stock of Europe.  People are writing songs about the potholes in our roads.  The television cameras take pleasure in rolling down to parts of Cavan and Meath and other counties and taking pictures of our roads, as if there was any need to show the people that there were very bad potholes in certain parts of the country.  The situation is the same almost everywhere.  When the Minister took office in 1987 he issued a statement, which I remember very well, that potholes would go from our roads by 21 March.</P>

      <P>I have listened with interest to the contributions to this debate.  It is quite clear to me that the tabling of this motion before the local elections is a mere political ploy by The Workers' Party.  They are entitled to put down a motion for discussion, but this motion lacks substance.  I want to tell Members of The Workers' Party that there is a new sense of reality in the <Col N="2497" /> country, and people accept that we can only provide the level of services we can afford.</P>
      <P>When the Government took office in 1987 it was clear to everyone that action had to be taken to narrow and eventually close the gap between what we spent and what we could afford to spend.  The Government had the courage to take action in the interests of the country and the future of our people.  We were unable to borrow any more money.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy since 1987 has been successful.  The economy has grown each year.  Exports have grown and the balance of payments is in the black, our inflation rate is among the lowest in the EC and the trend in interest rates is downwards.  We have stable industrial relations.  These are the measures of the Government's performance over the past four years.  All of these improvements have come about because of the Government's willingness to tackle the thorny question of public spending. It is against this background that we must view the role that local authorities have played in correcting the public finances.</P>
      <P>Local authorities will spend almost £1,350 million in 1991 between current and capital spending.  By any standard that is big business.  It is big money but it is also public money, and it is important that it is spent in the most cost efficient way.</P>
      <P>The local authorities are far more efficient now in the way they spend money.  They are running a tighter ship. Let us compare the financial position of the local authorities in 1987 with their present position.  Up until 1987 they were spending more than they were collecting. What did the last Coalition Government do about it?  Nothing.  They allowed them to run up major overdrafts.  You know the position then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is then the responsibility of the banks.  We had to take action in 1987.  We told the councils to draw up their estimates before the start <Col N="2498" /> of the year and to stick to them.  We said we wanted to restore order to the public finances and that the local authorities must do the same.  We helped them by lowering interest rates and giving them grants for capital works instead of their having to raise loans.  The position now is that local authorities are far better organised and continue to provide all the essential services.  We take a lot of these services for granted because they have always been there.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party motion states that local authorities should play an important role in job creation through joint ventures between the public and private sectors. Local authorities have been successfully doing this but, as usual, The Workers' Party are busy calling for more and more spending.  Where is the money to come from?  There is no use coming into the House and looking for more spending without stating where the money is to be found.  I have heard many Opposition speakers calling for expenditure on the roads network, housing and other matters connected with the local authorities, but nobody has spelled out how this expenditure is to be funded. Is it to be taken from the health and education budgets?</P>
      <P>Since I have special responsibility for urban renewal, I am pleased to inform the House that the policies adopted by the Government have been a wonderful success and I have received the co-operation of many local authorities who have played a very important role.  Urban renewal projects worth millions of pounds are in progress throughout the country.  This is a joint venture programme involving the local authorities, the private sector and financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we came into office the local authorities owed approximately £80 million. That debt has been substantially reduced and they are in a position to run their affairs in a proper manner.  If the Opposition favour increased spending on roads, housing and so on, they will have to spell out to this House and to the people where the money is to be found. <Col N="2499" /> Only a clear explanation will be acceptable. Time constraints do not allow me to elaborate further but my colleagues will have more to say on other areas where the Government have been successful.</P>

      <P>A great deal of time is taken up in this House by Opposition Deputies who propose a host of measures without specifying how they are to be paid for.  Coming up to elections this can make for lovely headlines calculated to win the votes of people who have not time to examine closely what they mean. I suppose we should treat The Workers' Party as we would a mischievous child. They have never been, nor are they ever likely to be, in Government, unless the arithmetic of some disastrous future election results in their being invited into Cabinet by Fine Gael, who are prepared to do anything to get back into Government. They are free to indulge in all kinds of fantasy in an effort to gain a few more <Col N="2500" /> votes but they are grossly under-estimating the intelligence of the electorate.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party have recently been wooing the Labour Party in an effort to form an election package.  They regard them as their natural bed fellows.  Bearing this in mind, they should have consulted their would be partners before tabling this motion because it was the Labour Party with Fine Gael who introduced service charges in July 1983.  I opposed those charges from the Opposition benches and advised the then Tánaiste and Minister for the Environment, Deputy Spring, exactly what he was doing in taking the easy way out.  He replied that the charges were introduced &ldquo;for the moment&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cotter was not then a Member.  The country was bankrupt and we ended up being receivers in a rescue effort.  We opted for tax concessions.  Among many things we would have liked to do was to abolish service charges but the legacy we inherited from the previous Government made it impossible.  That legacy will never be forgotten by the people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>We were determined to halt the growth in taxation by turning our attention to wasteful expenditure. The imposition of service charges was a means of taxation.  The results of our policies are there for all to see.  The economy has been transformed while both income tax and VAT have been cut.  This process is continuing.  The argument has been made that taxation has increased. The reason is that many thousands of extra people are at work and thereby contributing to the tax take.  The key question is what percentage of gross pay is deducted in tax.  A single worker in 1987 had 42.5 per cent of his income deducted, this dropped to 35.3 per cent in 1991.  Likewise a married couple with one spouse working dropped from 28.1 per cent to 22.5 per cent.  Similar reductions will be noted throughout the tax system.  The examples I have quoted do not take into account mortage relief or other such allowances.</P>
      <P>This supports the Minister's argument that in effect the double taxation complained about in 1983 has now been removed.  Meanwhile the Minister has been proceeding apace with the task of bringing local authority financing into line with all others.  He has outlined a number of statutory demands on councils which have been eliminated, thereby reducing their financial burden he has already referred to, and I am confident that the study he has commissioned on equalisation will lead to a completely fair method of allocating funds in areas according to their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that the fact that charges are not paid in Dublin causes a problem in other parts of the country.  I am confident that we will achieve equalisation that will be acceptable to all the country.  The Workers' Party's motion states that the continuance of service charges has eroded local democracy.  This contradicts their argument we have heard so often that a vital component of local democracy is the power of councils to raise funds as they see fit.  No council are compelled by Government to impose <Col N="2502" /> charges.  This is purely a decision for local elected representatives.  It should be remembered also that if domestic rates had not been abolished people would be paying now on average eight to ten times more in rates on houses.  That is a fact and The Workers' Party can nod their heads as long as they like.</P>

      <P>The same can be said of the other Deputies' colleagues as well. Of course, the Minister has reminded us of Deputy Bruton's statement in 1989 calling for the system which would allow local authorities to raise a significant portion of their own resources.  Perhaps the Deputy will explain tonight how he was thinking one thing and his leader was saying something else.  A hefty property tax on homes and goodness knows what else is The Workers' Party's policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party has been much more specific though they are not spelling out their policy during the current election <Col N="2503" /> campaign.  Their method of financing councils would involve wealth tax, land tax on farmers and a property tax on homes.  As if these were not sufficient, they propose to abolish mortgage interest relief together with other measures.  That would drive everyone on middle incomes into the poverty trap.</P>

      <P>I have listened to The Workers' Party's hypocrisy particularly from one of their candidates in Cork the other night who said at a meeting that they opposed the charges at local level and at national level.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>We remember the track of Deputy Pat Rabbitte in Wicklow and the destruction of VEHA.  We remember the cowardice of a councillor of The Workers' Party who said one thing at closed meetings and another thing at public meetings.  The Workers' Party want better and more services and they just do not want to pay for them.  They argue that we need more local government, then they argue for less autonomous local government.  As the last Fine Gael speaker said, it is fundamental to local government that local representatives establish what services are to be provided and then establish how those purely local services should be funded.</P>
      <P>On RTE this morning the spokesperson from The Workers' Party on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; said the shortfall to the local authorities in terms of grants they receive from central Government was £250 million.  I think I have the figure correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>He said central Government should now hand over this £250 million to the local authorities.  That is a fairly hefty sum of money.  It represents about £250 per PAYE taxpayer.  Do The Workers' Party suggest we increase PAYE tax to the tune of £250 per taxpayer? Do The Workers' Party advocate we put our hands into the pockets of workers and take that additional amount out?  I do not think so&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but The Workers' Party never propose anything when it comes to raising the funds.  Do they suggest we should cut other public services, prime services like health, social welfare and education or economic services which aid the provision and creation of jobs?  Is that what The Workers' Party stand for?  We all know The Workers' Party would like to create the chaos that would achieve, because out of the chaos The Workers' Party try to achieve their electoral success.</P>
      <P>I come to the issue of job creation. We know The Workers' Party's record in that.  They put their hand on companies like Lett's in Wexford, for example, and we know what they did with O'Hanlon's. Everywhere The Workers' Party have had influence there has been destruction. That has never been the history of the trade union movement or the labour movement.  They have a proud, creative history.  That is more than can be said of The Workers' Party.  Everywhere they put their dirty hands there is destruction, and so it would be in public finance and local government finance if anybody were fool enough to follow their advice.  Would The Workers' Party like to borrow more money?  Would they like to put another £250 million debt around the necks of each and every taxpayer?  Would they like communities to be destroyed and the youth to have their futures mortgaged? Is that what The Workers' Party stand for?  Would they like to create an endless cycle of debt and debt repayment?  Is that what they stand for?  Do they wish to introduce some new additional tax?  We come closer to the truth when we look at this.  The Workers' Party propose a series of taxes, as Deputy Gilmore said in an aside tonight, on the wealthy, but he never defines where the wealthy start. Would the wealthy be people who have betrayed the ideology they espouse by buying their own homes?  Whom are they going to penalise with this £250 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Workers' Party have a secret agenda, which is to create the politics of envy and politics which are fundamentally destructive.  In spite of the veneer they have taken on in recent <Col N="2506" /> years, they fool nobody.  Their ideological basis emerges each and every time they espouse a move like this.  We would all like to abolish service charges and to introduce a system of local government where the local authorities could stand on their own, be independent and decide what has to be done.  However, those of us who know anything about local government and local government politics know The Workers' Party's history in this matter.  Not a council in any part of this country have had their estimates supported by The Workers' Party councillors in the last few years.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Gilmore mentioned Wicklow, I will mention a few things they reneged on.  Councillor McManus and her followers in Bray, for example, argued that we needed to create a community centre in Fassaroe, an area with which Deputy Gilmore is familiar.  When it came to providing support from the local services the Labour Party said it was a good idea and supported it, Fianna Fáil said it was a good idea and they supported it, the Progressive Democrats also supported it but The Workers' Party councillors made a phone call to head office and said they accepted that the idea was good but, as Deputy Kavanagh who has joined us knows full well, they reneged on it.  When it came to providing funds from local service charges &mdash; a small amount of money which nobody in Bray or in north Wicklow would deny &mdash; for land for recreational facilities, for facilities such as the Wolfe Tone Youth Club, they reneged also.  The reality is that they have never had anything positive to contribute in local government terms.  The legacy of The Workers' Party is fundamentally one of destruction, a hollow legacy indeed.</P>
    <P>While councillors from Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats can point to things that were done or while Deputies from these parties can point to things that were done while they held sway, The Workers' Party can point to nothing but destruction.  That is the reality of that party.  They have nothing to offer the electorate but short term solutions.  There is no substance to <Col N="2507" /> their policies.  The experience we have had of The Workers' Party and their policies, not only in Wicklow but in other parts of the country, is not unique.  People in eastern Europe lived for 40 years with the same kinds of policies and ideologies, with the concept of centralised democracy, but they have rejected them.</P>

      <P>To note the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, substituting bluster and wind for anything of substance, or for any action or any provision of service and to have it added to again tonight by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Connolly, and his supporting team, really defies belief.  The one fear I have in relation to the local elections next week is of apathy, that people are so sickened by political hypocrisy that they may well stay at home.</P>

      <P>They may well say, &ldquo;a <Col N="2510" /> plague on all your houses.&rdquo; Because of the performance we have seen tonight, coupled with an abysmal performance by the man charged in this House and before this State with responsibility for maintaining local democracy in this country, I will not be surprised if there is apathy and a rejection of the democratic process by a great segment of our population. We tried in recent times to restore some semblance of order by putting an Ethics in Government Bill before this House.  I did not expect the main party in Government to follow that but I thought the minor party might have twisted the arm of Fianna Fail on this issue as they did on others but that was not to come to pass.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but what he is responsible for.  I will deal only with the criteria for achievement put forward to this House last night by the Minister.  He puts before us a nice list of achievements, local government reform being the first of which we are supposed to applaud.  He dealt with that at some length but what he has achieved is the subversion of national democracy by guillotining through this House a Bill that was parachuted in a matter of days before.  A copy was supplied to the Whips a matter of days before it was pushed through by way of guillotine. That was a measure designed to centralise power in the hands of the Minister and his Department.  It flies in the face of any attempt at devolving powers to local communities.  We dealt with that issue as best we could despite the guillotine action of this Minister and this <Col N="2511" /> Government.  The notion of local government reform or any semblance of it is a farce and a nonsense and the Minister for the Environment knows that full well.</P>
      <P>The next achievement on the Minister's list as presented to the House last night was local authority finance.  He said:</P>
      <P>when I took office as Minister for the Environment in March 1987, I was appalled at the state of local finances. </P>
      <P>The reality was that the local authorities who were overspending then were all dominated by his own party.  They forced moneys through and spent willy-nilly. Their actions at local level were matched by the Minister &mdash; who was then the Opposition spokesman &mdash; demanding that more should be spent on health boards, councils and corporations all round the country.  No matter what they spent it was not enough for Minister Flynn and his colleagues who were in Opposition at the time.  He has a brass neck to put before us the sort of tripe and drivel to which we must listen.  The Minister, Deputy Flynn, and his colleagues have made more U-turns in regard to this issue than a hula-hoop. His main achievement in relation to local authority finances has been to impoverish all local authorities.  If he wants to clap himself on the back for that he is welcome to do so but no local councillor of any hue would applaud him for his actions.  He was described by an independent councillor in Wexford as the worst Minister for the Environment in the history of the State.  I mentioned that because an independent said that, someone well known to Deputy Browne, sitting behind the Minister, and who would normally be a supporter of your party.</P>

      <P>The next issue in the Minister's speech, which we were supposed to applaud, was his achievement in relation to capital grants.  He had the audacity to specifically mention housing in which his record is nothing short of scandalous.  I tried to find out the number of people on the housing list by way of parliamentary question but the Minister's response was that the information was being gathered and that I would get it in due course.  I have no doubt that I will get it after 27 June.  Somewhere between 25,000 and 30,000 families and individuals are on the housing list.  Because the Minister did not seem to hear me when I made this point in the past I produced a graph for him dealing with the record of his Government, not only this year but over the last 25 years.</P>
      <P>Last year the Minister built 768 houses, that number was not just the worst in history but the pattern of Fianna Fáil in Government, who are consistently at the bottom of the heap in relation to building local authority houses.  When my colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, was Minister for the Environment he built 8,794 houses in one year.  The Minister may bluster as much as he likes but he should face the facts in this regard.  His gratuitous twisting of reality is an insult to the 30,000 people waiting for houses.</P>
      <P>It has been said that the Minister has done a great job in fixing potholes.  The Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, specifically mentioned that he was happy with the Minister's record, but I am not. The highest county road grants per kilometre is in the Minister of State's county and the lowest is in mine and in Deputy Browne's.  It may well satisfy the Minister of State's constituency but he is responsible and accountable to the electorate of Wexford as well as to his own constituency.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage of the Local Government Act I sought to repeal the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983.  The then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Spring, brought in those charges immediately following the GUBU years of Fianna Fáil Ministers falsifying projections, bugging one another and Ministers being dismissed.  The proposal for charges was contained in <i>The Way Forward</i>, a Fianna Fáil document.  The Bill was put forward as a temporary measure because of the deficit which had to be met.  I do not applaud the fact that that was done but the reality is that Fianna Fáil fought the 1985 local government elections on a clear pledge of abolishing those charges.  The document is signed by Deputy Charles Haughey, now Taoiseach, and by Deputy Robert Molloy, then spokesperson for the Environment, who is now a Progressive Democrat Minister. I will not quote from it because I am sure the Minister is embarrassed enough but it included a pledge to abolish that legislation.  However, they did not learn in 1985.  In 1987 &mdash; on Fianna Fáil headed notepaper &mdash; the director of elections, Paddy Lalor, MEP, very clearly said that Fianna Fáil were committed to the revocation of the 1983 legislation <Col N="2514" /> which gave power to levy charges.  It is there in black and white on two occasions signed by senior Fianna Fáil politicians who said they would do away with these charges.  They have reneged on their promises which should embarrass any party or politician capable of being embarrassed.</P>
      <P>The position of the Labour Party is quite clear.  We want these charges to be abolished.  I want to make it quite clear for the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, who obviously has not read it but I will give it to him later as I do not want to quote from it now.  The Labour Party have produced a very comprehensive document, not only in relation to local authorities, but on local authority funding. It is called <i>All Things are Connected</i> and I will give the Minister a copy to study at his leisure.  We are consistent, clear and straight in regard to where we stand on this issue.  I urge the Minister, for once, to try to live up to the clear and firm commitment which his party and Ministers gave to the public.</P>

      <P>The document, <i>The Way Forward</i>, undertook to introduce charges. Every Fianna Fáil Deputy who was elected in November 1982 was committed to <i>The Way Forward</i> and to charges. Therefore the idea of charges <i>per se</i> was not new.  In the preparation for the budget of that year which was put together on the basis of fraudulent Estimates that had to be corrected when the gaps suddenly emerged, the question of introducing charges was reluctantly agreed to by us on the basis that it would constitute a temporary measure.  The record of the House will show that in moving the legislation to give effect to those charges I said it was a temporary measure pending the reorganisation of local authority finances, which, as every Member of the House who has been a member of a local authority will agree, are in dire need of reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We introduced the land tax which was an integral part of reform of local authority finances because local authorities would get the benefit of the land taxes, but one of the first things this minority Fianna Fáil Government did when they returned to power in 1987 was to abolish that tax.  Service charges were introduced.  In the first instance the proposal came from Fianna Fáil and the charges were introduced by us as a temporary measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1985 the Fianna Fáil Party, after three years in the cold isolation of Opposition, away from the possibility of rezoning the odd piece of land here and there, found themselves rather desperate to get back into power.  They would promise anything or undertake anything provided it got them back into power, and, lo and behold, they promised to abolish service charges.  This promise was made by Deputy Molloy who I assume was as honest when he was in Fianna Fáil as <Col N="2517" /> he is now in the Progressive Democrats. I presume the same degree of integrity to which the Progressive Democrats lay exclusive claim in this House besieged the mind of Deputy Molloy when he was writing the Fianna Fáil manifesto, and a man of such integrity would not willingly give such a pledge to abolish service charges. He did not say they would reduce service charges, soften their impact or review the matter upon coming back to Government; it was nothing as wise as that to which the Fianna Fáil Party could lay claim, but a straightforward, unadulterated, uncomplicated claim to abolish the charges.</P>
    <P>Either the Fianna Fáil Party who campaigned on that manifesto under the signature of the very honest and upright Deputy Molloy, who subsequently left them to join the Progressive Democrats, knew that promise was tantamount to a political lie or they were extremely reckless.  Fianna Fáil have consistently refused to live up to that promise.  The Workers' Party were correct in putting down this motion and Fianna Fáil have been caught by their own political lie. They should either live up to their promise or retract it, and they are not prepared to retract it.  The kind of gobbledegook we heard from Deputy Wallace trying to justify that promise is quite extraordinary.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows there are enormous difficulties in local authorities because of their relationship with the Department of the Environment.  The Taoiseach comes from Donegal, Derry, Dublin and Kerry but the Minister for the Environment only comes from Mayo and therefore does not have the same extensive experience of peripheral parts of Ireland as the Taoiseach, but he sits at the Cabinet table with him.  No doubt if he had the same degree of multi-locational birth places as the Taoiseach he would be as committed in private to the devolution of power as he proclaims in public.  Since the Minister has come into this Department he has centralised more power into his own hands then he has given away.</P>
    <P>As everybody else is being parochial I will give a marvellous example of how <Col N="2518" /> wise this Minister is and how knowledgeable he is of every corner of this island, this Minister who takes it upon himself to make decisions, not necessarily in relation to money but also in relation to layout and design.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the reply the Minister gave me:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The space on which the corporation proposed to provide these two houses is an integral part of the design concept for a scheme of 104 houses constructed by Dublin Corporation about ten years ago.  My Department took the view that the provision of the two houses would not be in keeping with the over-all design concept for the scheme.  I am asking the corporation to reconsider <Col N="2519" /> their proposal in this light and to consider whether alternative measures could be devised and implemented to combat anti-social activities in the area in question.  Dublin Corporation have been authorised to commence/acquire 150 houses in 1991 and, in response, the corporation have submitted to my Department a revised programme covering the full number of houses authorised; this programme does not include the houses at Weaver Street. </P>
    <P>Money does not even enter into this question. How can the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State with responsibility of urban renewal, who is also responsible for this matter, have the temerity to claim that there has been some form of local government reform when they produce this kind of rubbish about an area they do not even know, relating to problems they do not have to live with, while ignoring the requests of the residents, the corporation, the inner city committee and the Garda?

I want the Minister to say one week before the local elections that they got it wrong.  That would be fair.  The people of Blanchardstown should know that some of the councillors were elected on a political lie which, in retrospect, was unwise, to say the least.  Perhaps, because of that lack of wisdom, they have been consistently unwise in the rezoning of Dublin county ever since.  The people of Mulhuddart are entitled to hear that kind of confession.  If the Minister has the courage he lays claim to he should be able to say that.  He was able to do a U-turn on extradition, and that hurt; he was able to do a U-turn on the Single European Act, and that hurt a little bit; he was able to do a U-turn on the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and that hurt quite a bit; and he was able to do a big U-turn&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister, whose head is above the political smoke surrounding this debate, should have the courage to tell the public that despite all the experience of Fianna Fáil they made an absolute mess of their 1985 manifesto, they told a lie and promised something they knew they could not deliver.  Three years previously in <i>The Way Forward</i> Fianna Fáil had prepared the documents from which service charges were brought in.  The Minister should be able to say that not only did Fianna Fáil tell a lie in 1985, but they proceeded to compound it when they came back into Government in 1987 by abolishing an <Col N="2522" /> integral part of the partial tax reforms at local authority level, the land tax.  If the Minister did that he would go down in history; he might even become more favoured to succeed the Taoiseach than Minister Ahern.</P>

      <P>I shall finish quietly and sadly.  In 1985 the country was offered a political lie which, tragically, it bought. It has lived with the consequences of that lie, in some cases with disastrous effect. Fianna Fáil have corruptly abused their powers of majority control, certainly on Dublin County Council.  That lie must now be confronted or else stood over by Fianna Fáil and the Minister for the Environment.  The Minister should have the courage to either say that Fianna Fáil got it wrong in 1985 and should not have promised to abolish local service charges or to accept the motion of The Workers' Party and proceed to find some new way of financing local authorities.  That is the point.</P>

      <P>I have only a few brief points to make.  First, I was very interested to hear Deputy Quinn refer to the famous &ldquo;lie&rdquo; of 1985.  Frankly, I am surprised to see Labour Party Deputies present in the Chamber at all because after the abolition of rates the Government who introduced the concept of service charges consisted of the Labour and Fine Gael parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the concept.  I am not going to get into a semantics argument with Deputy Quinn.  I am in possession.  The Government who introduced the concept of service charges for specific services were the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition of 1983-87.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn referred to the idea of a temporary measure. I could find no reference to a temporary measure on the record of the House in the introduction of Deputy Spring, then Minister for the Environment. To my knowledge, the idea of a temporary measure never arose, and I was in the House for that debate.  We should nail that lie for a start.</P>
      <P>I consider the debate to be a smoke-screen for the failure of The Workers' Party, on the one hand, to make inroads into the Dublin vote in particular.  I listened to Deputy Gilmore giving a radio interview this morning.  He made the outrageous statement that there is now substantial evidence to suggest that Fianna Fáil would reintroduce service charges in Dublin after the local elections.</P>

      <P>I want to nail that lie this evening.  There is no such evidence.  If Deputy Gilmore does have that evidence then he should put it on the record of the House or go public with it.  This morning on the radio I heard the greatest load of codswallop ever.  The Deputy said that because the Government would not accept a motion in his name &mdash; a motion that is so flawed as to be incredible, and I shall refer to a number of flawed elements in it &mdash; they would by some circuitous route reintroduce those charges. Fianna Fáil in Dublin city will not reintroduce service charges.  Fianna Fáil are completely opposed to service charges and will continue to be opposed to them.  I state further that when we as a Fianna Fáil group on Dublin Corporation <Col N="2525" /> vehemently opposed service charges from 1985 onwards we got very little support from The Workers' Party; we had to do it alone.  In fact, we had to sit down as a group and work out the way and means by which the city could be run efficiently and effectively without service charges.  I compliment you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the contribution you made.  I compliment Councillor Donnelly, our present Lord Mayor; Deputy Ahern, the Minister for Labour; and many others of the Fianna Fáil group who sat down for long hours to work out the ways and means by which we could run our city and provide an adequate level of services but without service charges.  That was done, and much waste was eliminated in the process.</P>

      <P>The motion asserts that in some way the Government of the past four years seriously ran down the delivery of local services.  It asserts that housing and other services have been run into the ground.  There is the matter of the efficiency of the services and I have commented on that.  In Dublin we have a very proud record over the past four years.  We are not satisfied with everything. We wanted more resources made available for housing and housing construction. I would like more housing in the north eastern side of Dublin city but nevertheless, I have to face reality.  With very limited resources we have achieved a considerable amount.</P>
      <P>There is an assertion that the Government have not put the local authorities on a self-financing basis.  In the Dublin context, while we would welcome the greater allocation of resources from the central funds, we can take examples. Since 1987 the Government have allocated just under £50 million in road grants to Dublin Corporation.  The annual average over the period is £10 million compared to £7 million during Deputy Quinn's reign in office.  The tenant purchase scheme is another example of phenomenal success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion refers to the deterioration <Col N="2526" /> of existing housing stock.  We have an extremely proud record in terms of refurbishment over the last three years.  The figures are so staggering that I will not even embarrass the Opposition by referring to them.  The remedial programme both in terms of refurbishment and in terms of bathroom facilities, etc. has been a success.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party have not the courage of their convictions to face up to the fact that with £150 million allocated to maintenance over five years &mdash; and remedial works are no substitution for maintenance &mdash; in Dublin we have not got value for money.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he does himself a disservice engaging in the kind of groundless charges that he makes in this House.  He is capable of far better contributions and if he ever hopes to achieve his ambition to get into even the junior ministerial rank, he should really examine the contributions he makes in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment failed totally to respond to the substance of The Workers' Party motion and engaged in the sort of &ldquo;Flynnspeak&rdquo; which has become the hallmark of the man.  He could offer no credible explanation for his party's betrayal of specific commitments given to the electorate in 1985 and again in 1987 that Fianna Fáil would abolish service charges, introduce legislation to ensure that local authorities would receive a guaranteed statutory contribution each year and would also remove the legislation on service charges from our law.  All the Minister, Deputy Flynn, could do was to try to hide behind <Col N="2527" /> the classic excuse used by Governments which are politically bankrupt: &ldquo;we did not know that the financial situation was so bad&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Of course the commitments given by Fianna Fáil in 1985, and again in 1987, were specific and unconditional.  There was no question of Fianna Fáil saying that when they got into power they would have a look at the books and, if they could, would ensure that local authorities got a statutory contribution each year. There was no question of them saying that they would abolish water charges when finances permitted.  The promise was complete and the betrayal was complete.</P>
    <P>It was not just in 1985 that these promises were made.  They were repeated by the Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Haughey, right up to the 1987 general election campaign.  The fact is that Fianna Fáil have brought the art of political duplicity to a new high, or perhaps I should say a new low.</P>
    <P>The question the electorate must now ask themselves is, in view of the experience of 1985 and 1987, what reliability can be placed on the commitments being dished out by Fianna Fáil in the course of the current local government campaign? Common sense dictates that these promises can be given no credibility at all.  The way in which Fianna Fáil on so many issues said one thing in Opposition and did the direct opposite in Government has contributed to the sense of political cynicism and disillusionment which so many people feel about the political processes of this country.  It has inflicted enormous damage on the political process.</P>
    <P>It is not just broken promises and local government financing, the list of broken promises is virtually endless.  They include the health cuts, job creation, housing, Irish Shipping, etc.  The list goes on, but the wonderful flawless picture of local government and the environment painted by the Minister for the Environment last night suggests that he is as much out of touch with his area of responsibility as the Taoiseach was in <Col N="2528" /> 1989 when he was forced to admit that he did not realise the extent of the health crisis.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister not aware of the thousands of families on the local authority housing list?  Is he not aware of the deterioration of so much local authority housing stock because of the lack of maintenance?  Is he not aware of the environmental damage in inner city areas and suburban housing estates because so many country councils have been forced to shed staff?  Is he not aware of the cutbacks in the library services which have led to the lengthy closures of many libraries?  Is he not aware of the potholed and broken down condition of so many of our non-national roads?</P>

      <P>I want to turn at this point to the attitude of the largest Opposition party, Fine Gael.  Ten days ago when launching his local government election campaign, Deputy Bruton told the country how under his leadership Fine Gael had seized the initiative and was dominating Dáil proceedings.  This party that believes it is dominating Dáil proceedings cannot even make up their minds on how they are voting on this motion.  Their spokesperson on the environment, Deputy Jim Mitchell, told the Dáil last night that Fine Gael would be abstaining on the motion, while down in Cork, Deputy Bernard Allen was assuring the electorate that his party would be solidly supporting our motion.  Fine Gael cannot make up their minds.  They cannot make up their minds, whether they are <Col N="2529" /> in favour of service charges or against them.  They cannot make up their minds whether they are in favour of the allocation of a fixed proportion of central funds for local government or against it. Despite all their talk about unemployment Fine Gael cannot make up their minds whether they are in favour of a job creation role for local authorities or against it.  So one presumes &mdash; we do not know yet &mdash; that Fine Gael will perhaps, or perhaps not, abstain tonight.</P>
      <P>How can anyone take seriously a party that cannot make up their minds on these crucial issues?  How could anyone take seriously a party that do not even have the ability to draft an amendment of their own to our motion if they are dissatisfied with it?  Far from flying on two wings, as Deputy John Bruton claimed at his recent Ard Fheis, Fine Gael are limping along on one badly battered wing and are set for a painful crash landing on 27 June.</P>
      <P>Where were the Progressive Democrats during this debate?  Where are the party which are claiming that they will clean up local government?  I am not surprised that Deputy Molloy failed to appear.  I am not surprised that he would not want to be reminded of his role in Fianna Fáil's record of broken promises; but where was the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Harney?  Why did not Deputy Harney, who was always very vocal whenever there was something new to be announced, participate in this debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats want to be <i>a la carte</i> members of Government.  They want to pick and choose what they will be associated with.  They want to bask in the glory of whatever few positive things this Government can do, and they want to run a mile from the majority of Government disasters.  However, the Progressive Democrats are full members of this Government.  Their two Ministers sit around the Cabinet table while the decisions are being made and they bear just as much responsbility for the disastrous record of this Government as Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Harney bears just as much responsibility for the collapse of <Col N="2530" /> local government as her senior colleague, the Minister, Deputy Flynn.</P>

      <P>The key to revitalising local government is an infusion of new blood at the elections on 27 June and the placing of local government financing on a sound footing.  We are proud of our opposition to service charges.  We are the only party in this Dáil who have a consistent record of opposition to these charges since they were first introduced by the Coalition in 1983.  When they were introduced we pointed out that they constituted a form of double taxation and that they would be paid largely by PAYE workers who were already paying heavily for these services, and whose taxes had been substantially increased in the late seventies and early eighties to make up for the revenue lost through the abolition of domestic rates.</P>

Far from returning £1,000 million to the PAYE sector which the Minister claimed last night, the figures show that since 1987 the PAYE sector has paid an additional £2 billion in taxes. The Minister should not try to mislead the public by misquoting the official figures which are on record.</P>

      <P>Our objections go deeper.  We have never believed that service charges were a suitable or acceptable method of funding local government. Unless financing is put on a sound footing local government cannot serve the needs of the people.  The only acceptable way of financing local government is for a specific proportion of national taxation to be allocated by law to local authorities. Such funding could be allocated on the basis of the size of an area, the population, the age structure, the infrastructural conditions and a range of other factors which should be taken into account.  There is no other practical way of doing it in view of the size and population of this State and the way we are already over-burdened by a bureaucratic system of Government.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Government do not have any intention of abolishing water charges or service charges at any time, despite what Deputy Fitzgerald said tonight, that they have no intention of returning them.  The Minister in his speech last night said that given a choice between abolishing service charges or major reductions in income tax and VAT, there was no doubt in his mind which was the priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already dealt with the question of whether the Minister or the Government have returned money to the PAYE sector.  It is clear on the basis of official <Col N="2532" /> figures that the reverse is the case, that they have taken £2 billion extra from the PAYE sector.  There is a fundamental point in what the Minister said last night. What he is proposing is clearly a Thatcherite approach to the provision of services here.</P>
    <P>The Minister is talking about reducing VAT and income tax and replacing the loss of that revenue with charges for services. How far does this commitment go to ensuring that people actually pay for services on the basis of whether they require them?  This is a fundamental question.  Is there not a case for ensuring that services of a social nature be provided through general taxation and through a fair equitable taxation system? What the Minister said last night is that he is in favour of virtually abolishing income tax and VAT and going for a system where services will be paid for by the person who uses them.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Damage Bill, 1990: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;(1)  In any case under this Act, where the extent of the damage alleged exceeds £100, the accused person shall have the right, as shall the Director of Public Prosecutions, to elect for trial on indictment.</P>
      <P>(2)  In all other cases the matter shall be tried summarily in the District Court.</P>
      <P>(3)  The maximum penalty to be imposed on summary conviction shall be six months imprisonment, or a fine of £1,000, or both.&rdquo;.  </P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to address the right of a person to elect for trial by jury when charged with an offence under the Act.  I have to concede however, that I am not going the distance that the Law Reform Commission seek to go in their recommendations in this respect.  In my amendment I propose that all persons charged with an offence that exceeds £100 or more should have the right, if so accused, to elect for trial by jury and that the Director of Public Prosecutions should also have the right to elect for such a trial.  In subsection (2) I propose that in all other cases, that is where the amount of damage does not reach £100, the matter shall be tried summarily and that the maximum penalty to be provided for on summary conviction shall be six months imprisonment or a fine of £1,000, or both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission propose that the right to elect for trial by jury should repose solely with the Director of <Col N="2539" /> Public Prosecutions and that is the way the Bill is drafted in this regard.  There is a rule of construction, as I understand it, handed down by the present Chief Justice when he was President of the High Court that where an Act is silent as to the right to elect for trial by jury and where alternative penalties are provided &mdash; as under sections 3 and 4 of this Bill &mdash; the net effect of such a method of construction is that the right to elect for trial by jury reposes solely with the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is very important that we underline the significance of trial by jury, that we do not undermine it in any way and that we underline the importance we attribute to the right of an accused to be tried.</P>
    <P>It can be said that trial by jury is a too greatly involved luxury to afford to persons awaiting trial.  I recall some years ago being in the Supreme Court when a Supreme Court judge, who shall remain nameless, quizzed counsel for the prosecution whether it was true that a person charged with the larceny of any item regardless of its value had the right to elect for trial by jury in our jurisdiction. That was five or six years ago.  To his amazement he was advised that, yes, indeed, a person has a right to trial by jury in respect of any item alleged to have been stolen by him or her, irrespective of its value.  The point has to be made that it is often the case that where the item is of minute value it can have greater repercussions on the career, status or future of the individual charged, so that one cannot really measure these matters on a scale of value.  Equally, when it comes to allegations in relation to malicious damage it is very difficult to say to someone whose career or future might hinge upon the conviction that he should not have the right to elect for trial by jury because the value of what was alleged to be involved was small compared to something far more serious, as the consequences need not necessarily have regard to the extent of the damage alleged to have been caused.  Therefore, it is important that as far as possible we would <Col N="2540" /> ensure that accused persons have the right to trial by jury.</P>
    <P>In the existing law a person who is charged with damage in excess of £50 has, until today, a right to elect for trial by jury.  I propose that we acknowledge that there is the matter of inflation although it is invidious to trespass into this area but I suggest that a reasonable figure for the Oireachtas to agree on where we would cut off the right to trial by jury for an accused is at £100, and anything under that should be dealt with summarily in the District Court and all other matters should be tried on indictment at the election of either the accused person or the Director of Public Prosecutions. There are instances where a person charged with an offence involving over £100 might wish to have the matter dealt with summarily but the Director of Public Prosecutions having regard to the wider issues or the greater problems attached might well decide that the trial should be dealt with in a higher court where wider attention might be given to it, broader and more important issues of law might be decided or a more serious penalty might accrue should conviction follow.</P>
    <P>For those reasons it is important that we address these issues fully.  The Oireachtas should ensure as far as is practicable and reasonable in drafting legislation that a person be entitled to trial by jury for all offences.  The formula of a cut-off figure of £100 is reasonable and I hope it is acceptable to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked the Minister on Second Stage &ldquo;to consider bringing forward a formula which would ensure that offences of a minor nature would be necessarily summary and after that the right to a trial by a jury would be a choice and right of the accused&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to think that the provision in the Bill is not too far different from what the Deputy was seeking on that occasion or indeed from what he proposes in his amendment.  At most, so far as the Director of Public Prosecutions is <Col N="2541" /> concerned, it is a difference of degree, not of principle.  The fact is that an offence which is not a minor offence cannot constitutionally be tried in the District Court.  The district justice is there to ensure that any contested cases before him or her that are not minor are sent forward for trial by jury.  It appears from a decision of the Supreme Court in a 1981 case &mdash; The State (McEvitty) <i>v.</i> Delap (1981) IR 125 &mdash; that the defendant does not even have to raise the issue that the offence is not a minor one.  Judge Henchy in his judgment said:</P>
    <P>If, as the hearing proceeded, it appeared that the offence was not a minor one, the district justice would have to desist from the summary hearing and, instead, take the necessary steps to allow a conversion of the case into the procedures laid down by the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, for the preliminary examination of an indictablel offence. </P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is no right to a trial by jury for a minor offence.  That was also decided by the Supreme Court in the case just referred to.  The offence in that case was, like the offences under the Bill, triable summarily or on indictment. Judge Henchy said:</P>
    <P>It is only when it is duly determined by the district justice that an offence is not a minor offence that the accused has a right to trial by jury ...... Therefore, the decision as to the mode of trial lies with the district justice on the due exercise of his judicial appraisal of the relevant factors. </P>
    <P>The accused's right to be tried by jury on a criminal damage offence that is not a minor offence is not being curtailed by giving the Director of Public Prosecutions the right to elect to proceed summarily.  It is the responsibility of the district justice, whether the point is made by the defendant, to ensure that a non-minor offence is not tried summarily.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2542" /> In any case, it would seem to be better to use a yardstick such as &ldquo;minor offence&rdquo;, which is sanctioned by the Constitution rather than rely entirely on a monetary value which is liable to alter and does not perhaps fully reflect the seriousness of a particular offence.  In particular circumstances an offence involving damage of less than £100 could be a most serious offence so far as the alleged offender is concerned.  For example, a conviction might mean the loss of the offender's job or pension rights.  In such a case the person could ask the District Court to rule that it was not a minor offence and that it should be tried by a jury.  The Deputy's amendment would not reflect that possibility.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I would not think it would be desirable to give an unrestricted right to offenders alleged to have caused damage exceeding £100 to be tried by jury.  Damage of £100 could only be classed as minor by present day monetary values, unless there were circumstances making it non-minor in a particular case.</P>
    <P>Finally, the legislative practice of giving the Director of Public Prosecutions discretion to proceed summarily or on indictment has been in existence for a long period and is subject to the safeguards I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The amendment also proposes to reduce the maximum period of imprisonment in summary cases to six months. The 12 months maximum in the Bill is the maximum period of imprisonment allowed to be imposed by the District Court and seems to be appropriate for the most serious of the minor criminal damage offences.  &ldquo;Minor&rdquo; is not the same as &ldquo;trivial&rdquo; and in many statutes the District Court, though only competent to try minor offences, has been given power to impose a 12 month sentence.  For example, &ldquo;joy riding&rdquo; in cars &mdash; taking them without authority &mdash; is triable under the 1984 Road Traffic Act either summarily or on indictment and, when tried summarily, carries a maximum 12 month prison sentence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2543" /> In the light of all that information Deputy McCartan might consider the position.  I regret that I cannot accept the amendment and I suggest that he may wish to withdraw it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to withdraw the amendment for the moment. I am glad the Minister referred to the seminal case of The State (McEvitt) <i>v.</i> Delap.  I was the solicitor who acted for Mr. McEvitt and two others in that case. They were charged with the invidious offence of forcible entry and occupation of the Liffey Dockyard in pursuit of a campaign to preserve their jobs there. They wanted to be tried on indictment for that offence but the prosecution insisted that it was a summary matter and wanted it dealt with in the District Court.  It went to the High and Supreme Courts to have the issue determined because the Act was silent on the accused's right.  The Supreme Court adopted the principle which had been laid down in an earlier case, the State (Reilly) in which the current Chief Justice and then President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Finlay, had ruled on the same matter in regard to common assault offences.  Now that the Minister has elevated the McEvitt case, in which I was involved, to the higher ground as being the authority, I am very happy to work with it.</P>
      <P>I am working from the positive position of the accused and his or her rights before the court.  I am afraid that the Minister of State has taken the legal advice of the Attorney General's Office or a section within the Department which reflects a very fundamental change of direction in regard to the position of an accused and his or her right to elect for trial by jury. It was always understood that in criminal trials the right to trial by jury would exist where practicable and in as many circumstances as possible.  It was the accused's right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In more recent statutory provisions the right to elect is slowly being taken away from the accused and is being passed <Col N="2544" /> into the hands of the DPP.  That trend is reflected in this legislation because there is no reference to the accused's right, it does not fit into the formula of the 1967 Act and the only right to elect rests with the DPP.  The law states that where an Act is silent with regard to the accused's right to elect and where there are alternative penalties laid down, the right to elect rests with the DPP alone.  That is the trend and drift.  We are moving away from recognising and respecting the right of the accused, who is the person innocently standing in the dock.  As the Minister says, the accused can be left in a very invidious position and can suffer profound consequences in the event of conviction.  That is why I put down my amendment, which provides that the right to elect shall be with the accused and with the Director of Public Prosecutions. The accused should not be written out of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I respect and understand fully the function of a district justice.  Where he or she, irrespective of the position of the accused or the director, feels that the offence is not a minor one, he or she has the duty to stop the proceedings at any point, even after the hearing has opened, and state that he or she is no longer of the view that this constitutes a minor offence and direct that it be sent to the Circuit Court for determination on indictment.  That is an unassailable right and duty of a judge of the District Court in dealing with matters on a preliminary basis or on the basis of the facts as they emerge in the hearing of the case.  That is aside entirely from what I am trying to address.  I am trying to focus this House's attention on a trend that has developed in the drafting of criminal legislation over the last decade, if not longer, where this formula of the alternative penalty is used and no reference whatever is made to the accused's position.  What is that position <i>vis-à-vis</i> this general right?  If the Minister is not accepting my amendment I should like to tease it out a little further.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the ruling of the district <Col N="2545" /> justice that this is not a minor offence and is being sent forward and leaving aside the position of the Director of Public Prosecutions, where does the right of the accused arise?  Under this legislation has he or she the right to elect for trial by jury in any circumstances?</P>

To ensure there is proper management of our courts, good and expeditious decisions, we must ensure that there is a summary trial for minor offences and that there is no such thing as a queue of people waiting to have trial by jury in such cases.  Although the accused has no specific right to elect for trial by jury, he has the right to apply to the district justice to decide the offence is not a minor one.</P>

A person must be proven guilty conclusively before he can be convicted. We have held a very strong position on that over the years.  We must ensure that as far as possible minor offences are dealt with speedily and clear decisions are given.  There must be proper management and implementation of the law.

I want to get one point out of the way: it is a fact that a person accused of stealing a half-penny worth of sweets from the corner shop is entitled to trial by jury of right.  An accused standing in the dock can say he or she wants trial on indictment and no one, judge, prosecutor or Director of Public Prosecutions, can say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I want to put the matter back into context.  In major areas of the law, because the Minister has not amended this yet, an accused has this right to trial by jury, and long may it be so.  Even in the most minor of instances of larceny an accused has the right to trial by jury.  We may talk about monetary limits and say it is unreasonable on a petty, pilfering shop-lifting case involving goods under a certain value to engage in a jury trial but that debate is for another day.  The Minister is suggesting that we cannot provide for trial by jury in every case.  If it is provided for in one area of the criminal law such as larceny, why not in cases of malicious damage?</P>
      <P>I accept the formula employed up to now has worked.  Heretofore if the damage was under £50 the case had to be dealt with in the District Court; it could not be dealt with on indictment.  That worked reasonably well.  The amount was £5 and the Legislature increased it to £50. That cut-off point worked reasonably well.  None of us out there defending people or concerned with the liberty or rights of an accused would have argued with that crude formula.  In this Bill the right of automatic choice of an accused person is to go, irrespective of the scale of the charge or the amount of damage involved.  Unbelievable consequences may follow for an accused person and that is unacceptable.  I beg the Minister for Justice to reflect for a moment on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two people who have a say in whether a jury trial should take place are the judge and the prosecuting authority, <Col N="2547" /> though regarding the judge I know from practice that that need not always be the case, the judge must always be independent and remain aloof.  There is pressure in the community to deal with unwarranted interference with motor cars in, say, Ballybrack and with the offensive behaviour of people who interfere wantonly with motor cars parked outside owners' homes, as illustrated by Deputy Barrett.  The gardaí may have a case that will not go the full distance if opened up before a jury.  A district justice may have experienced interference with his motor car, or indicated he or she adopts a severe stance against people who commit such offences or seem to the prosecution to have a predisposition to accept without question the evidence of police about their interrogation procedure and questioning of an accused in a police station. The Minister is suggesting that in those circumstances the obvious inclination of the prosecution would be to tell the judge that although the offence might seem a bad one on the face of it, taking everything into account the district justice should try it.  The prosecution may, so to speak, plead with a district justice not to refuse the hearing of the case thereby denying the accused the right to trial by jury.  I am almost afraid to say that will open up a debate on the fundamental right of the person it is proposed to protect, the accused.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has been forthright in confirming my interpretation of the provisions, that there is no specific right of the accused under this area of the law to elect for trial by jury.  It reposes exclusively on a district justice deciding an offence is non-minor and refusing jurisdiction and, on the other, the right of election reposes only on the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Director of Public Prosecutions might not be ready to go full speed ahead with a prosecution. He might feel that witnesses would not swear up or that they might not be properly prepared if the matter was deferred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2548" /> There are a whole range of administrative reasons and considerations that may be brought to bear on the director to opt one way or the other.  That is not necessarily in the interests of justice.  I am not suggesting for one moment that the director would do anything other than preserve the hearing of the case for the best forum for his case on the one hand, or select a date which would serve him best for the presentation of his case.</P>
    <P>These are factors that come to bear on the decision of the director in the pursuit of his duties that should have no bearing on a decision as to where and in what forum and under what circumstances an accused should stand trial.  The Director of Public Prosecutions is being allowed not only to prosecute but also to have a fundamental say before what tribunal and in what circumstances the trial should be heard.  That is not a good principle in law.  Although I have no authority to be definitive on this aspect there may well be constitutional considerations attaching to the drafting of legislation, dealing with the most minor and the most serious offences, a proposition that reposes no specific right on election to an accused person.  I would urge that this matter be looked at again by the Minister before Report Stage.  I am not saying that by conceding this I am right or that the Minister is wrong, but I would ask for the opportunity to look afresh at this matter on Report Stage because it deserves much more careful consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to what Deputy McCartan has said.  His inferences do not reassure me. I want to ensure that we clarify this situation beyond any doubt.  I agree that for all indictable offences the accused has an absolute right to trial by jury no matter how trival the offence.  The offence may be tried either summarily or on indictment and there are numerous examples of this over the past 30 or 40 years.  There is no right to a trial by jury.  The Deputy is right in saying that this is now the trend <Col N="2549" /> and the proposal in the Bill follows the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  The commission and the Government considered that this proposal was acceptable, bearing in mind that the accused could insist on a trial by jury, if the offence was not a minor one. I would like to quote from page 32 of the Law Reform Commission's report on malicious damage:</P>
      <P>In our reports on Receiving Stolen Property and on Rape, we recommended that the new offences of handling and sexual assault should be triable summarily or on indictment at the election of the D.P.P. and that the accused should not have an absolute right to trial by jury for minor offences in these categories.  The District Justice may conclude that, having regard to the circumstances of a particular case, the offence charged is not a minor one in which case it can only proceed, if at all, on indictment, thus preserving the constitutional right of the accused to a trial by jury in such circumstances.  We recommend the same approach in the present context. </P>
      <P>They are very consistent.  It confirms what Deputy McCartan has already said. I do not have any difficulty with it from a humane and justice point of view.  I am happy that it should operate and proceed on that basis.  As an experienced and professional lawyer I am sure Deputy McCartan can allay both his fears and mine on this score.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot allay those fears.  Though there is a recommendation to that effect in the Law Reform Commission report, it does not satisfy me and I say this in all seriousness as a practitioner who has worked in this area for almost 15 years.  I am not in a position to allay the fears of the House if I have created any in what I have said. Perhaps I will pursue this matter a little further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has to be made again that <Col N="2550" /> there are many administrative reasons which have nothing to do with justice in the first instance whereby a prosecuting garda or the director may wish to opt for one jurisdiction but more particularly for summary jurisdiction in the prosecution of a case.  To say that an accused person has no function or no right to elect on this issue is extremely worrying.  To say that it cannot exist in any circumstances other than if a judge of a District Court so decides, it is worrying.  The Minister contends that the only occasion on which an accused will be tried on indictment is after argument with the district justice and having convinced him that he is facing a trial for an offence that is not a minor offence and that therefore it should be sent up.</P>
    <P>There are well established judgments at law with regard to what can constitute a minor offence.  One of the most celebrated cases in the area has to do with offences against Customs Consolidation Acts going back to 1882 where an accused &mdash; if my memory serves me right &mdash; was charged with pig stealing.  The consequences under the provisions of the Customs Consolidation Acts, was that not only would you be fined but all goods would be confiscated and other penalties such as the confiscation of the vehicle would apply.  In the particular case the accused sought to go for trial by jury pointing out all the consequential penalties that would accrue.  In its review of the position the Supreme Court laid down very clear guidelines as to what could constitute considerations for a minor offence.  It ruled that all consequential orders, such as the confiscation of the pigs, the vehicle used for the purpose of the smuggling and any other related matters could not and would not have a bearing and could not be considered within the ambit and remit of what was minor.  Therefore, that particular offence did not warrant a trial by jury; in other words, the District Court was correct to have proceeded to deal with the hearing and convict.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2551" /> An accused person is charged with a malicious damage offence.  He comes in to the District Court and says: &ldquo;Judge, I know the offence involves damage amounting to £100, that it was only the driver's window of a motor car, that the facts are straightforward, that it is one offence and one isolated incident. However, if I stand convicted on this offence, and I strenuously deny the charge and I am innocent of it, I run the risk of losing my employment which is in the area of security, or in an area of high trust with my employer, and I will lose my pension and all the other ancillary benefits&rdquo;.  The judge is bound by the stated law of the land, as interpreted and handed down by the Supreme Court, to have regard simply to the facts of the incident and must, as a matter of law, disregard all the ancillary, inevitable consequences of a conviction in deciding whether a matter is minor or not.  What may flow from that has no bearing whatsoever on what is minor and what is not. The Minister is saying that irrespective of all the important consequential implications of a conviction, an accused can never have a right to rely on a right to trial by jury irrespective of all the other facts and circumstances.  That is a bad day for the rights of accused persons, for those who will be tried before the court. That is the reason I say that trend has to be arrested.</P>
    <P>The report of the Law Reform Commission deals with what should be tried summarily in their reports on receiving stolen property and on rape.  It is in respect of one of the more minor categories of sexual offence &mdash; that of sexual assault &mdash; that the report restricted the right and made the recommendation, and the Bill was drafted on that basis.</P>
    <P>Where the more serious charges were being dealt with, there was an absolute right of election left to the accused person.  The problem with this Bill is that, irrespective of the circumstances or the extent of the crime, the accused never <Col N="2552" /> has the right to walk into the court and say that he elects for trial by jury for reasons best known to himself and which he does not wish to enumerate.  We are now reducing trial by jury in these cases to an argument between the countervailing interests of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the prosecution on one hand and the interest of the accused on the other.  It will depend on which is more convincing.</P>
    <P>One point which must be made is that either side may be reluctant time and again to show their full hand at a preliminary argument.  It may well be that the prosecution know certain facts which they may wish to hold as a surprise for the hearing.  They may be in certain difficulties at that stage in relation to the presentation of their case and do not wish to alert the defence to them.  On the other hand the defendant may have many arguments, reasons and issues in his armoury which, as a matter of law, he is entitled to hold close to his chest and not to reveal until he is obliged to do so during the course of the hearing.  People who have a right to be heard arguing these issues might not, for certain reasons, be prepared to disclose them in full.</P>
    <P>A person may well come before a judge who has a certain view of a particular offence who might well say that he wanted to deal firmly, quickly and effectively with those kind of offences in his court and will not let the accused stand trial on indictment and put forward a full defence before fancy lawyers and a jury. I remember a particular district justice &mdash; I will not name him &mdash; who had a fierce view in regard to interfering with pedal cyclists.  He was a pedal cyclist himself and a great believer in the bicycle as a mode of travelling round the city.  If a person was convicted of stealing a bicycle or interfering with a bicycle which was not his property, in all probability he received a custodial sentence because of his view of that offence.</P>
    <P>Judges in certain courts hold on to <Col N="2553" /> those cases because they want to deal with them in their own way and will not allow defendants to be tried by a higher court.  In some respects I am trespassing on the territory of the judge but, as I hope the Minister will accept, I am speaking from experience having spent many years in the courts.  I recognise that there is a vast range of varying, disparate considerations for people adopting different attitudes and positions.  It is very important, therefore, that the accused must have the absolute right in some circumstances to say that he has a right to trial by jury.</P>
    <P>I used a crude formula here of the £100 limit because it has been the one which worked well heretofore.  However, I am prepared to abandon it &mdash; I do not have a commitment to it &mdash; if there is some other formula or device available to us. Having made my point at length and with great conviction, I hope the Minister appreciates it.  I may not be getting through to him but I feel very strongly about this issue.  Will he agree to look at this matter again before Report Stage to see if there is a stage in the proceedings or in the gradation of the seriousness of the offences where an accused would have the right to say that his best interests were served elsewhere and that he wanted to stand trial on indictment?  That is the case in relation to many other people who go before the courts.</P>
    <P>It seems utterly ridiculous that an accused charged with an offence in the area of malicious damage can never say that it is his right to stand trial by jury whereas a person charged with pilfering a packet of sweets from the corner shop has that right.  There must be some way of approaching that massive disparity in the law.  Let us look at this matter from the point of view of the accused and his position in the context of this debate.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy McCartan.  While he may not be getting through I am certainly receiving him.  The law, as laid down by the <Col N="2554" /> Supreme Court, is that no one can be tried on a non-minor offence except by a jury.  The accused can insist on a trial by jury in such a case by applying to the district justice.  Even if he does not, the district justice is obliged to refuse to deal summarily with the non-minor offence.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment would give a right to trial by jury for many minor offences of £100 and above.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 1, after &ldquo;has&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or has had&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This section deals with possession of anything with intent to damage property.  It starts by saying &ldquo;a person (in this section referred to as the possessor) who has anything in his custody or under his control intending without lawful excuse to use it or cause or permit another to use it....&rdquo;  I wish in line 1 after &ldquo;has&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or has had&rdquo;.  The reason I tabled this amendment is that I do not agree with the way the section is worded at present.  Unless a person is caught with something in their possession, this section could be interpreted as not applying.  If a person throws away a gun, a stick or whatever, it may be known that the person had that item but he does not have it when apprehended.  Surely there is a flaw there and for that reason I am proposing that we insert the words &ldquo;or has had&rdquo;.  That would strengthen the section. It would in no way damage the extent of the section but would remove any anomaly that could arise at a later stage when perhaps the case would be challenged in court.</P>

      <P>The advice I have is that the form of words used in the section is adequate to cover the possession of articles or substances with intent to cause damage, irrespective of when the possession took place, and that it is normal practice to use the present tense when creating an offence.  However, I have <Col N="2556" /> listened with interest to what Deputy Barrett said and in view of that I am prepared to refer the matter to the parliamentary draftsman for further consideration. If we feel we can approve his proposal we most certainly will do so on Report Stage.  On that basis, perhaps the Deputy will withdraw his amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6a:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), line 2, after &ldquo;instead of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;imposing a term of imprisonment or detention,&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This is a very important section containing the general provision dealing with compensation and the power of courts to make orders to compensate injured parties for loss suffered by criminal acts and other related offences.  It is a particularly important provision and one that is welcomed in general terms.  However, I have some reservations about the workability of the legislation on the one hand and the appropriateness of it on the other hand, but we will deal with that as we go along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposes that if we are to visit the full extent of a compensation order on an accused person it should be alternative to a term of imprisonment. It is a very desirable objective in the whole area of crime generally that if a person suffers loss as a result of the criminal acts of another, we should work as far as possible to have the injured party compensated.  That is important.  If it becomes a regular and determined goal of our criminal justice system it would go a good deal of the way towards assuaging a lot of the hurt, ill-feeling and damage <Col N="2557" /> done in the community by the acts of criminals and thugs who, as the Minister for Justice pointed out, will always be a feature of our community.</P>
    <P>While we often talk about the war against crime and the need to stamp out crime, we are now beginning to realise that we are talking about a movement to curtail or contain crime to manageable proportions.  Unfortunately, we will never be rid of it and recognising that, one of the objectives we should work towards in the long term is to ensure as far as possible that when the criminal is being dealt with the victim is never forgotten, and that the victim is compensated. As I have said, that would help to assuage some of the hurt caused to that person.  It would also help to bring home to the accused, having been convicted of the crime, that there is a victim. The loss of money from the pocket of the accused who transfers it to the victim would bring home to him that the damage he has caused is real, tangible and has caused hardship to the victim of the crime.  That would help to educate the thug or the criminal as to the extent of damage he has caused and the hurt he has visited on his victim.</P>
    <P>There is little practical hope of combining a system of compensation for victims with a system of automatically locking up the convicted person in prison. I cannot recall a case where a person was both imprisoned and ordered to pay compensation.  That would not work.  I never remember a person being sent to prison and at the same time offering to compensate the victim.  That just does not happen.  It is important that we be realistic about what we are attempting to do in this legislation.  I am prosposing that we insert in section 9 (1) that on conviction of a person for an offence under the Act, instead of ordering a term of imprisonment the court should make an order with regard to compensation. We must be clear about that.</P>
    <P>Such an amendment is also desirable <Col N="2558" /> from the point of view of our prison population. We have an immense prison population, we have a prison system that is creaking at the seams, it is grossly overcrowded and requires us to reserve our places of detention and imprisonment for the most serious and deserving of cases. I am not arguing that we should not lock people up.  There are people who must be put away for long periods because they represent a serious threat and danger to the person and the community, but there are huge numbers of people in our prisons who should not be there at all.  They are there because the courts have ordered it in exasperation because there are no serious alternatives.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes a potential alternative.  It would require that the accused pay compensation directly to the victim, whether it be out of their wages, welfare money, savings or ill-gotten gains.  That would prove to be a far more effective alternative for all the reasons I have explained.  Rather than locking up these people at a cost to the taxpayer of £600 or more per week &mdash; almost £30,000 a year &mdash; they could be working and transferring to the victim compensation for their loss and injury.  That would be a far more effective system than the present one.  It would be as punitive in its effect as locking up people in the luxury of a prison for a shorter period after which they are back on the streets again with their resources and their ill-gotten gains intact.  I have no sympathy for the criminal elements in our community but at some stage we have to ask whether simply locking people up is working, whether it is cost effective and if the taxpayer and the community are getting an effective return for their money.</P>
    <P>I notice tonight's evening papers' reports about the revolving door prison system.  Courts are ordering people to go to prison, but because there is no room for them the door revolves; they are in prison one evening and out the next. Would it not be better to abandon that farcical system and, instead of putting <Col N="2559" /> those people through a revolving door, hold them under order of the court strictly to make recompense in so far as possible to the injured party?  Progress could then be reviewed.  The idea of compensation could work well with supervision by the probation service or in conjunction with community service.</P>
    <P>My argument is that we cannot have a comprehensive compensation programme in place while at the same time purporting to lock people up.  I accept that there is in that an element of those with resources to some degree being able to buy their way out, but I have come to the conclusion that the system is very much overloaded.  When one analyses the figures, one finds that 60 per cent to 70 per cent of those who are locked up are locked up for extraordinary short periods of six months or less.  Offenders will gain no real impact of the concept of imprisonment and being taken out of the community for such a short period.  When remission provisions and other factors are taken into account, offenders are released sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Those who are in prison for only a very short time have no opportunity to be subjected to rehabilitation, retraining or educational programmes within the prison system.  This debate provides the opportunity to ask whether it is desirable to lock up many people for such short periods.  Would we not be better to reserve places in prisons for those who deserve to be put in prison for a long period so that they may serve their full sentence and during that time be subjected to some degree of rehabilitative training programme that might help them become better people when they come out of the system?</P>
    <P>I am not arguing that this idea should be applied throughout.  District justices will, no doubt, recognise that where an offender is so far off the rails and is a threat to the community he or she must be incarcerated, then the idea of compensation would not enter the formula. <Col N="2560" /> When a court has considered all of the facts, has recognised that a term of imprisonment might be visited but that that would not be for a full 12 months or an additional two years, and has decided that it is possible to put matters right for the victim, then I say the system of compensation should be worked as an alternative to imprisonment as opposed to a system working alongside imprisonment &mdash; it just will not work that way.</P>
    <P>If this idea were given a chance it would work as a real alternative to the ridiculous occurrences that we read about daily, that we have read about in newspapers as recently as this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this section of the Bill.  It is a move in the right direction.  It is a concept I have been promoting for a long time.  The courts should be given more options.  We should certainly ensure that people who commit offences, such as criminal malicious damage, or, as I referred to earlier, people who collect large sums of money from activities such as house break-ins, should face the confiscation of assets derived from crime.  It should be made clear that crime will not pay.</P>
      <P>I do not support Deputy McCartan's amendment, however, because I do not think that the hands of the courts should be tied.  It is wise to leave the section as in the Bill at the moment.  I have been saying for a long time that options to custody should be used much more than they are at present.</P>
      <P>Some of those people being put in prison do not benefit from it.  In fact, they are coming out more proficient criminals than they were before they went in.  That is not to say that there could not be circumstances in which, because of the particular offence committed, the courts may feel that in addition to a person being forced to pay compensation they should also be punished by serving a period in prison.  It should be left to the courts to decide whether that penalty should be imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2561" /> It should not be the case that because there is provision for the payment of compensation an offender is relieved of the punishment of possible imprisonment. There is a danger that it could boil down to the situation that if an offender had resources then he or she would be asked to pay compensation but if he did not, then he would spend a period in prison. That would be a dangerous outcome, but it is what could happen.  Offenders might not have resources at the time of conviction but might gain them in the future.</P>
    <P>Compensation orders should also provide for attachment to earnings or benefits. That is why in later discussion on the section I shall disagree with the Bill's restriction on payment by instalment to a period of 12 months.  There is no logic in that.  The fact that a person might not have resources at the time of conviction, although possibly having an income 12 months in the future, should not relieve him or her of responsibility under an attachment order made against earnings or any other source of income.</P>
    <P>As I said, the section is a very positive part of the Bill.  However, I wish to make several amendments to it.  I support and will always support options to custody when used wisely.  Community service orders are not being used enough.  Part and parcel of that problem is lack of resources.</P>
    <P>I listened to what the Minister for Finance has to say about some of the proposals put forward by Fine Gael and other Opposition parties during the local elections campaign.  To me, part and parcel of the Government's problem was shown up in the Minister's statement &mdash; the failure to understand that proposals put forward by Opposition parties that may appear to cost money today will result in savings.  Savings could result from taking positive actions today &mdash; savings in health bills, social welfare payments and in the Vote for the Department of Justice.  It costs more than £30,000 a year to keep someone in prison, and that is certainly not a payment that <Col N="2562" /> the taxpayer would wish to make.  Those who commit certain kinds of offences should contribute something to society instead of taking more out of society by serving time in prison and costing the taxpayer money.</P>
    <P>Back-up services and more resources are needed to impose more community service orders.  The cost of that back-up is balanced against the cost of keeping someone in prison.  Also in the balance is the recognition that some people go into prison and do not achieve anything good during their term of imprisonment other than learning how to be better criminals and how to commit more sophisticated crime.</P>
    <P>I do not know the exact cost of building Wheatfield &mdash; perhaps the Minister could tell me &mdash; but if I remember correctly, the cost of the wall alone was £2 million and I think the total cost would be more than £30 million.  Did it cost £40 million to build that prison, added to a cost of at least £30,000 a year for each inmate? There could be a fair number of community service orders and a fair few people employed productively in the community keeping an eye on those serving out community service orders for £40 million, or for £30,000 for that matter. That might put a stop to what is happening in our society.</P>
    <P>We welcome the provision for the payment of compensation.  While sharing many of the views Deputy McCartan put forward and saying that those views were held by me when I was spokesman on Justice in 1987, I do not see the wisdom of tying the hands of the court by saying that once they impose a compensation order they cannot then also impose a prison sentence because the seriousness of a case, that we do not anticipate at the present time, may warrant both.  I think, therefore, that it would be wise to leave the section as it is in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that the amendment would exclude the possibility <Col N="2563" /> of a court imposing a sentence of imprisonment and requiring the payment of compensation.  I believe that would be unduly restrictive to the power of the court to do justice in many cases of criminal damage where the circumstances would be such that the convicted person should be sent to prison and where that person could afford to pay compensation. We cannot allow a rich offender to buy his way out of prison or away from prison. I do not see much difference in principle between that and ordering a convicted person to pay a fine and also compensation which the section clearly contemplates. I would have to agree with Deputy Barrett's interpretation.  We must have a dual system with compensation or imprisonment or both at the discretion of the court.</P>
      <P>I accept Deputy McCartan's point that a person sentenced to imprisonment would not normally be in a position to pay compensation.  However, there may be some cases where he could.  In such cases, why should we oblige the court not to pass a sentence of imprisonment when it orders compensation?  The court should be trusted to use its discretion and realise that in most cases compensation plus imprisonment will not work but that in some cases it would be appropriate.</P>
      <P>Consequently I regret that I will not be able to accept the amendment.  I am sure Deputy McCartan will understand that it is important that we have this dual option available to the court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to respond briefly to some of the points that have been made both by Deputy Barrett and the Minister.  They do not necessarily take me by surprise.  At some stage we will have to bite the bullet on this issue and figure out whether locking up people is productive in terms of the amount of investment and the amount of money that we as a community have to pay through tax.  As Deputy Barrett has illustrated. the building of Wheatfield is an incredible <Col N="2564" /> commitment and expense and there is also the cost of maintaining and running it.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether we will ever have the courage to take on board some of the projects that have been started in Britain. One was a project that ran very well in the inner London area for many years in conjunction with the Prisoners' Rights Organisation in London.  The project was a very simple one.  In the local magistrate's court in a district in London, the name of which I cannot remember at the moment, there was a programme where, when a person was convicted, whatever the offence, the first objective would be to try to find a solution to the problem without locking the person up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not Islington although it was not far from it.  It may well be that the pilot scheme was subsequently extended to include Islington.  I think Newham is the name of the district I am trying to think of.  I do not see a Minister here having the courage to take the same initiative.</P>
      <P>I accept this would be difficult in a climate where yesterday I complained bitterly that my own area of Raheny, the back door of the Minister for Social Welfare, was pointed out as the area with the single biggest increase in crime in the last year in the country, an increase of almost 30 per cent.  That is a shocking statistic for a very good residential area of the city that does not deserve that type of image because one would not expect it there.  At a meeting yesterday when I spoke with the residents they pleaded with me to point out that although the crimes are being committed in Raheny, they are not committed by Raheny people.  Needless to say, that is obviously so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The response is usually that we should have more police on the beat, that we should get the offenders and lock them up.  Indeed, Fine Gael in trying to <Col N="2565" /> respond to another problem of persistent reoffending in the area of bail, again spoke about locking them up but the question is where and at what cost?  Will it ultimately be effective?  Those are the issues.</P>
    <P>The section offers us an opportunity to take on board the idea I am advancing here.  Before we lock someone up we should look to see if we can have a more productive regime of putting the offender out there under licence from the court with a strict obligation to put something back into the pocket of, and trying, in a monetary way, to make amends to the injured party.  I have no doubt, from talking to the victims of crime around this city and country that, it would help them greatly to believe that society will make the offender pay and in so doing make the victims feel that little bit better.</P>
    <P>Far too often offenders are taken out of the community against which they have committed their crime, brought before the courts and sentenced without the victim ever knowing that an offender was caught, tried and convicted.  The victims of crime often go about in bewilderment wondering what ever happened to the complaint they lodged at the local Garda station.  The scheme that is being prompted by the section is an excellent one and gives us a real opportunity to start that type of approach, to see if we can come up with a more constructive and meaningful remedy than simply locking people up.</P>
    <P>The first objection to my idea was that it would be too restrictive and would tie the hands of the court.  There is a clear precedent in our law for this type of formula and it is contained in the legislation providing for community service orders. There the legislation says that where a district justice or a judge has convicted a person and is of the mind to impose a custodial penalty, there is a duty in the law for the district justice, before imposing a sentence of imprisonment, to investigate the circumstances of the accused to see whether it would be proper <Col N="2566" /> to put that person under a community service order.  It has not worked out like that in practice, unfortunately; but the idea of community service orders was designed exclusively as an alternative to imprisonment.</P>
    <P>When a person was convicted and the judge was of a mind to impose imprisonment he was then obliged, because of the terms of the Act, not to impose imprisonment for the moment but to investigate the possibility of a community service order.  If the Minister will consult his officials or reflect on this before Report Stage he will see that that is the formula that was devised by the Legislature in 1984.  It has not necessarily worked like that but that is the way the legislation is worked.  Unfortunately, community service orders are much too often used by judges in lieu of a fine or of a suspended sentence and they were never designed to be used so.  They were specifically designed to tie the hands of the court and as an alternative to imprisonment. The precedent is there for this type of stricture.  My amendment does not prevent the judge in the particularly nasty case from committing a person to prison and not allowing the element of compensation to come into it.  The Minister has said that we should keep that option open because there might be compensation there.  In my experience there has never been such a case.  If there was, it would be an extremely rare event, so why legislate for that extreme event when the alternative presented by my amendment might prove to be far more exciting, innovative and effective in the long term in achieving a sense of justice between penalising the accused on the one hand and seeing some good element of compensation for the victim, on the other?</P>
    <P>The Minister should put this in and let us see how it works.  If it does not work the Minister can in time amend the legislation and do something else.  We should bite the bullet, have a go and see if it will work to try to achieve some other way of hitting the criminal for his criminal acts, <Col N="2567" /> compensating the victim and saving those places in our prisons for those who far more richly deserve them and so that we can ensure that such people will never have the opportunity for reasons of over-crowding to slip out through the revolving door.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (2), line 13, after &ldquo;property&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any person beneficially entitled to occupy or use or likely to be held responsible for repairs to the property&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This refers to section 9 (2):</P>
      <P>(2) The compensation payable under a compensation order shall be of such amount (not exceeding £2,500 in the case of such an order made by the District Court) as the court considers appropriate, having regard to any evidence and to any representations that are made by or on behalf of the convicted person or the prosecutor, and shall not exceed the amount of the damages that, in the opinion of the Court, the owner of the property concerned would be entitled to recover. </P>
      <P>I am just trying to cover any possible angles or any possible loophole, in the case of a dispute in court to the effect that only the owner of the property would be entitled to compensation.  Those who are not the owners but who have some beneficial interest in the property or are responsible for repairs to the property should be able to have compensation paid to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The justification for providing for compensation to be awarded by a criminal court after convicting an offender of damaging property is that it would give the owner of the property concerned a speedy remedy and also bring home to the offender the need to make restitution.  However, a criminal court is not the right forum for deciding on the correct amount of compensation or, indeed, if there is a dispute about the <Col N="2569" /> ownership of the damaged property, and it would not be appropriate for it to decide whether the compensation should be paid to the owner or, as proposed by the amendment, the occupier or the person likely to be held responsible for repairs to the property.  All that could only be sorted out properly later on in civil proceedings.  Very often civil proceedings would not be worth while as the damage would exceed what the offender could pay.</P>
      <P>The section has adopted a practical approach.  It limits the making of compensation orders by the convicting court to cases where the amount of damage and the owner of the property can be readily ascertained, and it requires the court to have regard to the convicted person's means.  These are sensible limitations. I accept that the reference to the owner of the property could create a difficulty for the court in some cases.  I will see if it is possible to get over this difficulty between now and Report Stage and find a formula which will do this, while avoiding a situation in which the Criminal Court would find itself involved in disputes about the person to whom compensation should be paid.  Based on this commitment, perhaps Deputy Barrett would withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to delete subsection (3) which reads:</P>
      <P>A compensation order shall not be made unless both the owner of the property concerned and the approximate cost of making good the damage to it (or, where appropriate, of replacing it) are readily ascertainable. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2570" /> The subsection is far too restrictive.  I do not see the sense of putting this proviso into this worthwhile section.  Why should the owner of the property concerned have to give an approximate cost of making good the damage and why must the costs be readily ascertainable?  In a lot of cases compensation will not be sufficient to cover the damage or cover the upset caused to a person who perhaps has had property damaged by some young thug. I do not see why this restriction should be imposed in relation to the person who has suffered the loss.  Why is this subsection there in the first place?</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to delete subsection (3).  It will allow the Criminal Court to make a compensation order even though the owner of the damaged property, or the cost of making good the damage was not readily ascertainable.  That envisages a detailed consideration by the Criminal Court of both those matters where there is a dispute or where adequate information about them is not available at the hearing of the criminal charge.  As I mentioned on a previous amendment, the kind of detailed examination that would be necessary in such cases belongs more properly to the area of civil proceedings. I undertook on the other amendment to look again at the adequacy of the reference to owner in subsection (1).  That has implications for this subsection and may involve a consequential amendment on Report Stage.  In the light of this, perhaps Deputy Barrett might withdraw his amendment.</P>

If they take a civil action they will have to pay the costs out of their award with the result that they will have nothing left.  Therefore, they will not take a civil action.  Perhaps the <Col N="2571" /> only way a person can get compensation is through the criminal law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment.  It relates to a school which has been made ready, through considerable voluntary efforts, for accepting autistic people.  However, the doors of the school remain closed because of a lack of funding from the Southern Health Board and the Department of Health. The Cork Association for Autistic Children was founded in 1978 by the parents and friends of autistic suffers in response to a lack of local specialised care.  Since then a great deal has been achieved on behalf of autistic sufferers such as the provision of junior and senior schools.  Much credit for this must go to the Cork Association for Autistic Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The association's most recent and ambitious development was the renovation, refurbishment and equipping of Greenville House in Carrigtwohill, County Cork, as a residential school for autistic people.  This school was officially opened on 25 April 1991 by President Robinson as a home for life for autistic people in the Southern Health Board region.  Greenville House is ready to receive its first residents but sadly it <Col N="2572" /> remains empty, despite a sum of £220,000 having been spent on renovating it.  The bulk of this £220,000 was raised by the local community.  To date, neither the Department of Health nor the Southern Health Board have provided any funding for Greenville House.  The Cork Association for Autistic Children have been informed that they are to be included in a five year plan for the delivery of services in the Southern Health Board region. However, this plan has not yet been submitted to the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Another alarming development is the proposal by the Southern Health Board to consider Greenville House in the context of the board's plan for services for the mentally handicapped which is currently being completed.  This is not good enough from the point of view of the Cork Association for Autistic Children and autistic sufferers.  It is contended that the integration of autistic sufferers with the general handicapped would be destructive to both groups.  It is a shame that such a fine facility as Greenville House should remain idle after all the efforts made to refurbish and equip it and that autistic sufferers are denied its use. Even though many elsewhere in the region seeking access to the school are in receipt of capitation grants, this school remains closed because of a lack of basic capitation grants.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Health and, through him, the Southern Health Board to bring this problem which has existed for far too long to an end.  This issue should be taken off the long bureaucratic finger and action taken to open this faculity as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">

      <P>The Cork Association for Autistic Children have developed a residential centre for adolescent and adult autistics in Greenville House, Carrigtwohill, County Cork.  I understand that the association have had discussions with the Southern Health <Col N="2573" /> Board regarding the operation of this facility.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for the phased development of community-based and associated services in the health area.  My Department have had discussions with each of the health boards regarding the implementation of the plans for the health services outlined in the programme. Arising from these discussions, health boards are now in the process of preparing detailed strategic plans which will facilitate the phased development of community health services over the next seven years.</P>
      <P>I am particularly aware of the significant contribution made by voluntary organisations such as the Cork Association for Autistic Children.  I envisage that the health board strategic plans to which I have referred will seek to foster the role of these excellent groups.  I understand that the Southern Health Board are considering the provision of support for the Greenville House project as part of the strategic plan which they are drawing up.  This plan will be discussed and agreed with my Department when it is presented.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the Southern Health Board, as the statutory authority, must ensure that the health services in their functional area are delivered in a co-ordinated manner to be considered as part of the board's overall plan for the improvement of community health services in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to services for autistics generally, I should explain to Deputies that the Irish Society for Autistic Children receive considerable financial support from my Department and health boards towards the running costs of their services. My Department are also providing the necessary capital resources to enable new residential and workshop facilities for adolescent and adult autistics to be provided at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview, which will come on stream next <Col N="2574" /> year.  The Irish Society for Autistic Children have been involved with the Eastern Health Board in the planning of this project. The provision of this level of support is a clear indication of our commitment to supporting development services for autistics.  When my Department receive this report from the Southern Health Board, which should also include reference to Greenville House, it will be dealt with as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>This matter relates to the appalling situation in regard to the north Sligo regional water supply scheme which cannot meet the existing demands of the area.  In 1986 Sligo County Council submitted plans to the Department of the Environment for a new source, a new reservoir and balancing tanks as part of the water supply augmentation scheme. However, they are still waiting for funding so that they can provide this much needed water supply to the people of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must take into consideration the potential of the north Sligo area from a tourism point of view.  W. B. Yeats is buried there and many tourists visit his grave.  On bank holiday weekends there is a large influx of visitors to the area and bed and breakfast establishments and guest-houses do not have an adequate supply of water for their guests.  In addition, domestic houses do not have an adequate water supply. This is inhibiting the development of <Col N="2575" /> the area.  On numerous occasions Sligo County Council have had to refuse planning permission for various projects due to the inadequate water supply in the area.  This cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that the cost of the new scheme would be about £1.3 million.  I ask the Minister to ensure that his Department give urgent priority to this scheme and provide funding immediately to Sligo County Council so that this appalling problem can be brought to an end.</P>

Under &ldquo;bare Benbulben's head&rdquo; is the village of Drumcliff where William Butler Yeats is buried.  This is an area that is growing in tourism and where there are now a large number of bed and breakfast establishments.  Unfortunately, there was a water shortage in that area during the recent bank holiday weekend.  It is my hope that the Minister of State will have some good news for us tonight and that money will be made available for the north Sligo regional water supply augmentation scheme.</P>
      <P>Last year Sligo County Council spent £60,000 under the small schemes programme on this project but that was not enough.  The pipe to the reservoir is not adequate.  What we need is a new reservoir at Cashelgarran.  As Deputy Reynolds has said, the scheme is costing well over £1 million.</P>

      <P>Considerable progress has been made in recent years in providing new and improved sanitary services throughout the country.  Since 1980 over £700 million has been invested in the sanitary services programme.  County Sligo has received its fair share of this significant investment, £15 million having been spent in providing new and improved schemes. The investment programme is continuing with over £65 million allocated nationally and £875,000 to Sligo in 1991 for schemes under construction.</P>
      <P>Water supply schemes have been completed at Lough Talt and Collooney while the Lough Easky water supply scheme, stage two, is nearing completion.  It will provide an adequate supply of water and will serve over 62 square miles of the south-east region of County Sligo.  In addition, a number of major schemes are in planning, for instance, Cumeen sewerage scheme, Strandhill sewerage scheme and Sligo main drainage scheme. While I am sure the House will agree that progress is being made on the sanitary services programme in County Sligo and throughout the country generally, regard must be had to the very difficult economic climate and competing demands for limited funds not only on the Exchequer but also within the sanitary services programme.</P>

    <P>The position in relation to north Sligo regional water supply augmentation scheme is that the existing treatment works were refurbished under the 1990 small schemes programme which resulted in the quality of the finished water being brought up to acceptable standards. Nevertheless, I am aware of the fact that there are difficulties with the current supply in the north Sligo area.  Further works, as proposed in the augmentation scheme, are required.  However, having <Col N="2577" /> regard to the level of commitments and the other high priority schemes competing for the limited capital funds available, it is not possible to anticipate when the scheme might be approved to go to tender and construction.  When funds become available I will see what can be done in an effort to rectify the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>About 1,000 pupils leave Ashbourne, County Meath, each morning to go to school elsewhere, mainly in Dublin city.  In 1982, the then Minister for Education, former Deputy John Boland, approved in principle the provision of a secondary school in Ashbourne. One of his successors, former Deputy Gemma Hussey, acquired a site for the school and planning commenced. While one must acknowledge that some progress has been made since 1987, when there was a change of Government, the rate has been very slow.  It is important to recognise that early next year it will be ten years since a decision was made in principle that there should be a secondary school in Ashbourne but not one sod has yet been turned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The up-to-date position is that the bills of quantities have been commissioned by the Department of Education from a private architect.  Normally it takes six to eight weeks to complete these documents for a school but in this case, even though they were requested from the architect at the beginning of the year, they have not yet been provided.  As a result it has not been possible for the Department of Education to advertise for tenders.  There were some suspicions in Ashbourne that <Col N="2578" /> the architect had been asked to go slow in providing the bills of quantities while others suspected that the architect found he had more attractive work to do and simply put the request in the bottom drawer of his desk and did not do the work.  The people of Ashbourne are not satisfied with the position that work which normally takes six to eight weeks to complete has not yet been completed.</P>
    <P>This matter was raised with the Minister for Education in the Dáil on 13 June and, surprisingly, she said in reply that the planning of the proposed new community school in Ashbourne was &ldquo;proceeding satisfactorily&rdquo;.  I do not believe that any Member of the House would be satisfied that it is taking up to six months to prepare the bills of quantities.  Indeed, the Ashbourne second level school committee were extremely disappointed that the Minister expressed herself as satisfied with the progress being made in response to questions put to her on 13 June by a number of Deputies, including myself.</P>
    <P>The people of Ashbourne and I would like to know, before they make certain decisions on 27 June, whether the Minister is prepared to give a cast iron assurance that work will commence on the school this year, that the bills of quantities will be prepared within the next few weeks and that she will advertise for tenders before the end of July.  We believe that this objective is entirely feasible. It is extremely important that work should commence during the summer so that the school can be opened in time for the 1992-93 academic year.  Unless the Minister can give a satisfactory and definite answer to these questions the people of Ashbourne will believe that the school is being put on the long finger yet again.</P>

      <P>On the Minister's behalf I would like to thank Deputy Bruton for giving us an opportunity of outlining the position in the case of Ashbourne community school and allowing me to emphasise the Minister's commitment to seeing that this project proceeds to construction as quickly as possible.  It is important that I would briefly review developments to date as this will illustrate that while progress may appear to be slow to the concerned parent, teacher or local representative, it is actually a case of very careful planning to ensure that what is to be constructed will best meet the needs of the locality and conform to the overall post-primary needs of the general area.</P>
      <P>Originally, a school for 800 pupils was proposed for Ashbourne.  We encountered some initial delay at the architectural planning stage due to difficulties in acquiring a suitable site and the need to clarify the position regarding proposals for roads development.  When the site was finally obtained, a review of enrolments and projections for the area resulted in the plans for Ashbourne being revised to provide for a school for 650 pupils.</P>
      <P>Following this the planning process got under way with a briefing session for the design team in the Department of Education and since then has been proceeding normally.  As is the case with all such projects the design of the building involves a good deal of complex planning by the design team, and detailed examination in the Department of each stage of the project is required to ensure that the best possible building is provided for the people of Ashbourne.  During the process the Minister has continued to monitor progress and she has constantly kept in contact with local interests to keep them informed of developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate Deputy Bruton's sincere interest in this project but I must also <Col N="2580" /> acknowledge that his constituency colleague, Deputy Wallace, is also in continuous contact with the Minister about this project.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton may be aware that only last December in response to a question on the Adjournment the Minister was able to announce that a technical examination of the detailed design stage had just been completed and the Minister instructed her Department to request the design team to prepare the next stage, Stage 5, the bill of quantities.  Currently, the design team are completing their preparation of the bill of quantities and this is expected in the Department shortly.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a brief reference to the background of this project. Approval was given for a new school in 1982 and one has to ask what happened between 1982-87.  I must say on the Minister's behalf that more progress has been made between 1987-91 than in the previous five years.  I do not wish to suggest at this hour of the night which Members might have been in Government during the period 1982-87.  I am surprised that Deputy Bruton should listen to rumours circulating in the area that the architects were told to go slow and that they had more attractive work to do.  Deputy Bruton knows well the commitment to education of the Minister for Education. I do not have time to list the number of schools the Minister has been responsible for, from Malin Head, down the west coast, up the east coast and in the midlands. I am surprised that Deputy Bruton would suggest that somebody would ask the architects to go slow.  The Minister has a proven track record since 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is well aware of the system.  When the bill of quantities is received it will have to be carefully examined in the Department, and that is absolutely necessary, and if it is found to be in <Col N="2581" /> order the next stage, which is the invitation of tenders, will go ahead.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I wish to thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise these very important points relating to the agricultural community. I wish to ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food the reason the number of dairy cows eligible to qualify for headage payments is confined to ten while all other EC countries pay headage payments on 20 dairy cows per herd.</P>
      <P>For some unknown reason a very low number per herd qualify for headage payments. Indeed, I need not remind my constituency colleague, Deputy Walsh, Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, that in our constituency of South-West Cork farmers are completely dismayed at the Government's lack of attention to this very important matter.  I fail to see how the Minister cannot agree here tonight to increase the number of dairy cows eligible to qualify for headage payments from ten to 20 per head and I appeal to him to do so, in view of the crisis in agriculture at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large disadvantaged areas grants in Ireland are paid as an income supplement to farmers particularly in the poorer areas.  Dairy farmers happen to be one of the most well off sections of the agricultural community and it was decided some years ago by our predecessors in the Department of Agriculture and Food that given the prosperity of dairy farmers and the scarcity of financial resources, payment on up to ten dairy cows represented a fair degree of compensation to dairy farmers particularly when one remembers that cattle other than dairy cows &mdash; in fact quadrupeds of every kind, sheep, goats, equines &mdash; are also eligible for grant aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Connemara ponies are also eligible.  The present rate of suckler cow payment is set at £52.43 by the European Community and it is not my prerogative to increase that premium rate.  I might mention, indeed, that this special high rate of premium applies only in Ireland and Greece because of the special circumstances in our two agricultural economies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like also to ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to consider increasing the present rate of suckler cow payments.  It is well known that if the suckler cow payment was increased from £70 to £88 for the first 30 such cows in each herd it would have a tremendous effect on the farmer's income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a tremendous variation in the rate of headage payments throughout the EC.  Ireland enjoys the highest rate of refund of headage payments, at 65 per cent while other countries get a refund payment of as low as 25 per cent. In other words, for every pound paid by the Irish Government in headage payments, 65p is recouped from Brussels. <Col N="2583" /> I cannot see why the Minister cannot consider increasing the suckler cow grant from the miserable amount of £70 to at least £88, particularly in view of the depressed prices in the cattle marts today.  The Minister knows there is growing need for this increase to be paid immediately to suckler cow farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as concerned about this matter as my constituency colleague but I am precluded, because it is an EC scheme, from altering the rate of payment. I will take into account the Deputy's strong representations and take up the matter with the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister to consider increasing the sheep headage payment from £9.50 to £15 per ewe, at a maximum of 200 ewes, to compensate sheep farmers for the collapse of sheep and lamb prices.  It is widely rumoured that the Minister proposes to increase sheep headage grants by a miserable 50p per ewe for the first 150 ewes. What a miserable offer to sheep farmers whose backs are completely to the wall because of the collapse of lamb prices.  It is extremely serious that the Minister is considering such a meagre increase.  The rate which should be paid is £15 per ewe on the first 200 ewes.</P>
      <P>It is also rumoured that the Department are to pay an increase of £3.50 for the next 50 ewes in excess of 150.  In other words, the man who can keep 200 ewes will get an increase of £250 for his flock, while the farmer who can keep only 150 ewes will get a miserable increase of £75. That is not the correct way to keep our sheep industry going.  The small man must be protected as well as the large sheep rancher.  This Government have failed to give anything towards reviving the incomes of the most needy group of Irish farmers.  The small farmer is completely penalised and I would ask the Minister to give an undertaking to pay a decent increase in sheep headage by giving £15 per ewe for the first 200 ewes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The EC ewe premium scheme is designed to compensate for lower sheep meat prices in Ireland. Therefore the lower the price goes the higher the premium will become.  Payment rates under the disadvantaged areas scheme will increase this year and I shall bear Deputy Sheehan's representations in mind, as well as the overall economic position in agriculture particularly.  When deciding on the increase I will have particular regard to the income position of sheep farmers.  However, there is a difficulty in that it would be unrealistic to give an unbalanced increase to sheep farmers since mixed farmers and others keeping cattle, equines, goats and various other recipients of headage payments will also get some increase.</P>
      <P>There is an overall increase of £12 million, a considerable amount.  If I were to take up Deputy Sheehan's suggestion that would use up £11.7 million, leaving only £300,000 for all the other categories of farmers.  I do not believe farmers would agree with that type of one-sided approach.  There will be a very substantial increase overall in headage payments. That should satisfy Deputy Sheehan who is representing a fair cross-section of farmers.</P>

      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise with the Minister for Agriculture and Food the question of the appeals system in respect of the disadvantaged areas scheme.  There is great frustration regarding the anomalies in the earlier submission made by the Government to the EC in respect of the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Undoubtedly the survey introduced by the Minister and carried out over the last couple of years has been a considerable sham and a great disappointment to the vast majority of farmers. It is nothing short of disgraceful and <Col N="2585" /> unfair in the extreme.  I call on the Minister to outline the full details of the appeals mechanism.  Advertisements have been placed in the media in recent days to highlight how farmers can avail of the appeals mechanism.  I insist that every farm must be surveyed properly for the appeal and fairness must be restored to the scheme.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believe that because of our peripheral location it is in the interests of agriculture that the entire country should be declared disadvantaged.  We are getting 65 per cent of the finances entailed in this scheme from the EC.  It is appropriate that the appeals mechanism should take account of the CAP and GATT negotiations and we should insist on a greater allocation of agricultural land to the scheme.  There is a precedent in Luxembourg which has higher quality land, yet 100 per cent of that country is disadvantaged. I see no reason why similar concessions could not be given in respect of a vital national interest like agriculture in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been much comment about disadvantaged areas and the increase effected recently.  A total of two million acres were designated as disadvantaged in the increased areas.  That compares very favourably with the increase of 400,000 acres following the 1985 review.  In addition there is the appeals panel.  I recognise that there are some anomalies which must be addressed and sorted out in a positive way following this objective and independent review by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appeals panel is under the chairmanship of Professor Sheehy of UCD and they had their first meeting on 10 June.  They agreed detailed arrangements for the lodgment of formal appeals in relation to areas not included in the list of new areas covered by the proposed extension of the disadvantaged areas. Groups of farmers are requested to fill in application forms which have already been sent to the farming organisations <Col N="2586" /> and to Teagasc.  This followed an advertisement which appeared in the national newspapers on 18 June and which will appear in the local newspapers and the farming publications in the next few days.</P>
    <P>Those forms should then be completed with the assistance of the Teagasc personnel in the various areas if that is required, and returned by registered post, in case there is any dispute, to the Secretary, Disadvantaged Areas Appeals Panel, Department of Agriculture and Food, Kildare Street, Dublin 2.  The forms should be submitted by the secretary of groups or some spokesperson for groups in a particular area.  They should be completed, and there will be no requirement for any additional or supporting documentation.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy Hogan that there will be a 100 per cent survey of the areas.  Perhaps one of the reasons for some anomalies was the fact that only a spot check or hit and miss type of survey was carried out because of the large area that had to be surveyed in the previous review.  Marginal areas will get the full benefit of an independent objective appeals commission with a 100 per cent survey, and it will be in the interest of farmers in those marginal areas who are aggrieved to set up groups, appoint spokespersons and get the full benefit of this review.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to raise this important matter with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The 1927 Act empowers the ESB to trade in hire purchase electrical goods retailing, and ever since the development of the independent sector the ESB's participation in appliance retailing has been seen as unfair.  The <Col N="2587" /> trades association themselves on a number of occasions have been in contact with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and have met him on a number of occasions to highlight this matter.</P>
      <P>It is worth reminding ourselves that there has been an enormous increase in the retailing that has taken place through ESB shops in recent years.  This has been largely assisted by the fact that much of the retailing that takes place normally through private business is now being done through ESB retailing in view of the facility to allow payments for these commodities through the billing system. In my opinion and in the opinion of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade this is seen to be unfair.</P>
      <P>On 8 May 1990 the director accepted a delegation and submission from the trades association and came to the conclusion that the question of whether a statutory monopoly should be allowed trade in areas outside the area of its statutory monopoly is a matter of public policy.  In effect the Government permit the ESB to use the electricity billing system as a basis for marketing their retailing business.  In my opinion the Government should withdraw this permission from the ESB.</P>

      <P>This same concern was <Col N="2588" /> raised by a number of Deputies during the course of the Committee Stage debate on the Competition Bill on 12 June last.</P>
      <P>The matter was raised under section 5 of the Competition Bill which prohibits the abuse of a dominant position in the market.  The issue was relevant because, as Deputy Hogan rightly points out, the ESB are a monopoly supplier of electricity. The concept of monopoly as we know it is being replaced, in the new legislation, by the concept of a dominant position which should bring not only existing monopolies but also enterprises with strong positions in the market under the prohibition outlined in section 5 of that Bill.</P>
      <P>I told the House last week that I have had discussions with the Minister for Energy who has responsibility for the ESB and for their policy and that he shares many of the concerns which I feel and the concerns which were raised here on 12 June and again tonight by Deputy Hogan.  I hope that as a result he can discuss the future of the ESB's trading policy at retail level with them and see if some arrangement can be come to which is less unfair than the present system is, in my view at least.</P>

      <P>I have no role in relation to the yield to individual policy holders from individual life assurance policies.  A policy holder is, of course, entitled to receive from the insurer a copy of the terms of such policy, which document contains the terms of contract drawn up between the insurer and the insured.  It is a matter for the policy holder to acquaint himself with the terms of the policy and to seek clarification from the insurer where required.</P>
      <P>As the insurance supervisory authority my statutory role in relation to life assurers is to ensure that such assurers meet their statutory solvency and reserve requirements.  The objective of this role is to ensure that when life assurance policies mature there is money available to meet the obligations undertaken.</P>
      <P>Part IV of the Insurance Act, 1989, which came into force on 1 October 1989, provides for regulation of insurance intermediaries. Under the 1989 Act, insurance intermediaries are required, among other things, to issue receipts to their clients, maintain separate bank accounts for clients' moneys and, in certain circumstances, to be bonded in respect of such moneys.  In the context of this regulation the insurance industry themselves have adopted a code of conduct to which all insurance intermediaries are required to adhere in their dealings with insurance proposers and which requires them to identify their status as agent, tied agent or broker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, it is open to proposers of life insurance to make inquiries as to the status of any insurance intermediary from the representative body of insurance brokers recognised under the Act, i.e. <Col N="2415" /> the Irish Brokers Association, or by means of an inspection of a register of insurance intermediaries which all insurers are required to maintain, in respect of intermediaries to whom they have granted agency appointments and to make available for public inspection at their offices under section 50 of the 1989 Insurance Act.</P>
    <P>I would add that the Irish Insurance Federation have adopted a code on advertising and illustrations of yields on life assurance policies.  Complaints regarding breaches of this code may be addressed to the Federation at Russell House, Russell Court, St. Stephen's Green, Dublin 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE group wages staff are members of the CIE wages grade pension scheme.  Membership of the scheme is compulsory on appointment for all regular wages staff aged between 20 and 50.</P>
      <P>The appropriate pension payable is based on members basic pay on retirement and is not service related.  Therefore wages staff with as little as 15 years service can receive a full CIE pension at age 65.  Pension rates are adjusted periodically and since 1985 there have been three such adjustments, the latest with effect from 1 February 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pension of £24.50 per week mentioned in the Deputy's question is the amount that would be appropriate to a person retiring on a basic wage between £120 and £125 per week.  There is no category of rail staff who would fall within this wage band.  However, there are a small number of staff designated as cleaning operatives on a basic pay rate of £128.92 per week and the appropriate pension in such cases would be £25.50 per week.  As the scheme allows a member to commute up to 25 per cent of his <Col N="2428" /> retirement pension, it is possible that the £24.50 quoted is a pension figure net of commutation.</P>
    <P>The current basic rates of pay of rail operative staff range from £152.74 up to £217.49 per week (craftworkers) and pensions payable under the scheme can range from £30.50 per week up to the present maximum of £40.50 per week, depending on a person's basic pay at date of retirement.</P>
    <P>CIE wages grade staff, including rail staff, pay a Class A PRSI contribution rate and are therefore normally entitled to a State contributory retirement pension at age 65.  The CIE wage grade scheme is not social welfare co-ordinated and pension payments from that scheme are additional to any State contributory retirement pension which may be payable.</P>
    <P>Since December 1990 the facility exists whereby CIE group staff wishing to top up their retirement benefits may do so by contributing to an additional voluntary contributions scheme which has been established between CIE and Irish Life plc.</P>
