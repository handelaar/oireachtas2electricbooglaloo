      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy John Bruton and Deputy Dick Spring.  I observe that the notices relate to somewhat similar subject matters and I propose to call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their questions to my office.  I now call on Deputy Dick Spring to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, I did give notice to your office this morning that under Standing Order 30 I intended to raise what I believe to be a specific and important matter of <Col N="2" /> public interest requiring the urgent consideration of this House.  The matter I set out is as follows: that Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Taoiseach to answer an extensive range of questions relating to his personal involvement in recent events, that Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to publish its agreed review of the <i>Programme for Government,</i> and, accordingly, that Dáil Éireann hereby decides that the confidence debate scheduled to begin today shall be postponed until tomorrow to enable proper consideration to be given by every Member of the House to the revised <i>Programme for Government.</i> I reiterate, Sir, that as I stated in this House, to the best of my knowledge, there is still disagreement between the Government parties on matters of taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, this is not in accordance with the notice you gave me.  I now call on Deputy John Bruton to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.  Deputies should confine their statements to the notice submitted to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say, Sir, that this is not a similar matter to that raised by Deputy Spring.  I hereby request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil in accordance with Standing Order 30 for the purpose of discussing the fact that the Taoiseach has refused to answer questions lawfully tabled to him in respect of the following matters: the involvement he had in the sale to University College, Dublin, of Carysfort College; details of any communications he has had with Dr. Michael Smurfit or with Mr. Dermot Desmond on the proposed Telecom Éireann site at Ballsbridge; dealings with the Minister for the Environment concerning the Feltrim/Kinsealy drainage scheme; if he intends to require open tendering for all contracts placed by semi-State bodies for consultancy services and transmission of information relating to Irish Helicopters from Irish Helicopters to a rival firm, Celtic Helicopters.  These are matters of public interest requiring urgent consideration as envisaged by the Standing Order and on which the Taoiseach has refused to answer questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matters fully, I do not consider them to be contemplated by Standing Order 30.  Therefore, I cannot grant leave to move the motion in either case.  I should state that the matters to which Deputies Bruton and Spring refer can be discussed throughout the course of the confidence motion to come before this House.</P>

      <P>In normal circumstances, Sir, I would object to the proposal in these arrangements that the Leader of the Opposition, and other Opposition party Leaders, are to be given less time than the Taoiseach in this debate but I am not objecting to it because, unlike Deputy Spring, I believe we should take this debate of no confidence in the Government today and not tomorrow.  The matter should not be postponed.  Any party in this House that does not know enough about this Government's record to decide today whether they should stay in office is not really serious about politics.</P>

      <P>In relation to item No. 4, a Cheann Comhairle, during the <Col N="9" /> course of the week Deputy McCartan, our party Whip, wrote to you requesting an early meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to decide on the question of the possibility of a <i>sub judice</i> ruling in relation to the no confidence debate to be held over the next three days.

As I explained I had, through our party Whip, Deputy McCartan, sought a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges before this debate today so that this issue could be discussed and thrashed out.  Over a number of years this House has been gagged in relation to expressing its views on various issues and in all cases the unwritten rule <i>sub judice</i> has been used by the Chair to restrict debate.

      <P>At the outset of this debate I would like to refer to the <Col N="15" /> application of the <i>sub judice</i> rule to matters that may arise in this important debate.  In regard to the <i>sub judice</i> rule itself, by convention for almost 70 years the Dáil has imposed upon itself the voluntary restraint of the <i>sub judice</i> rule in the general desire to avoid the risk of prejudicing judicial proceedings.  The risk of prejudice occurs when comment in the Dáil under absolute privilege might influence a jury or prejudice the position of parties or witnesses to proceedings. The <i>sub judice</i> rule has been applied by successive Cinn Comhairle in accordance with the longstanding convention.  Of course, this House is master of its own procedures, and it may by order modify or suspend the application of the <i>sub judice</i> rule as in fact it has done in the past.</P>
      <P>As Members may be aware, guidelines for the application of the rule are also currently under review by the Dáil's Committee on Procedures and Privileges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The revised guidelines are at an advanced stage of preparation, I understand, but as the proceedings of the committee are strictly confidentaial I cannot expand further on any proposed modification in the application of the <i>sub judice</i> rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the Chair is as follows as to the application of the rule: the <i>sub judice</i> rule will apply to the tribunal of inquiry into the meat industry and, needless to mention, to the constitutional challenge in the High Court as to the scope of the inquiry.  There are three concurrent investigations being undertaken under the new provisions of the Companies Act, 1990.  In one of these investigations relating to the affairs of Siúicre Éireann Teoranta the inspectorate are appointed and report to the High Court under section 8 of the Act and that is the only one of concern to the application of the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  There are judicial aspects of the investigation by the High Court inspectorate which <Col N="16" /> potentially could encroach upon the conventional application of the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  However, the <i>sub judice</i> rule could not be applied, in my view, at this point to the investigation by the High Court of appointed inspectorate into Siúicre Éireann Teoranta because, first, the inspectorate at this stage are undertaking their investigation and no matter in that regard as of now has been seized by the court or awaits adjudication by the court; and, secondly, in view of the primacy attached to a debate on a motion of no confidence &mdash; whereby the ordinary rules of procedure as to the taking of the motions are in practice not applied, such as the six month repeat rule &mdash; to apply the <i>sub judice</i> rule to this investigation would in my view represent an unfair imbalance between, on the one hand, the inherent right of the Oireachtas to debate matters of public importance and on the other the necessity to ensure that such debate would not prejudice judicial proceedings either in a statutory tribunal of inquiry or the courts themselves.  The issues of principle that may be involved in the affairs of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann can be debated as of now but reference to specifics such as the individuals concerned with the beneficial ownership of shares in Gladebrook Company Limited and related matters such as Talmino Limited should be avoided in view of a legal action&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Please hear me out.  Reference to these matters should be avoided in view of a legal action being taken concurrently by one of the individuals concerned.  It should be noted at this later stage that if it becomes apparent that the inspectors' reports under section 8 of the Act are likely to be the subject of High Court proceedings and that debate of such matters would, in my opinion, constitute a real and substantial danger of prejudice to the proceedings, then I will have no hesitation in applying <Col N="17" /> the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  I trust my remarks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let me remind everyone in this House &mdash; and there are many on those benches over there who want to forget it &mdash; of the perilous state of the economy and the public finances at the <Col N="23" /> end of 1986.  The national economy was in decline with negative growth in the previous four years, the public finances had deteriorated to the extent that the current budget deficit was the highest ever recorded at 8.3 per cent of GNP, the national debt had been virtually doubled in four years.</P>

      <P>The enormous burden of taxation had become intolerable. Taxes had been increased in real terms by nearly £600 million between 1982 and 1986.  Confidence in the economy at the end of 1986 had vanished and real interest rates were at an exorbitant level.  Industrial investment had collapsed.  There was a chronic balance of payments deficit. Our external reserves, at the end of 1986, had fallen to a dangerous level.</P>
      <P>The effect of this massive deterioration in our economy, its stability and competitiveness, was most clearly marked in an enormous loss of employment. Between 1982 and 1986, total employment fell by 66,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy John Bruton as Minister for Finance ended up with the highest current budget deficit on record in this country.  He unilaterally devalued our currency in 1986 only three months afer an EMS realignment.  Deputy Bruton as Minister for Finance brought us as near to third-world status as we have ever been.  The situation was so bad in 1986 that many believed it was beyond redemption.</P>

      <P>The Deputies opposite have some audacity after the way they devastated the Irish economy and our public finances even to participate in this debate.</P>
      <P>It was a depressing, intimidating and almost hopeless scene that confronted us in 1987.  But we took firm control of the situation.  We set about the tough task of putting the public finances in order and generating economic growth.</P>
      <P>The extent to which we succeeded can be judged from the fact that by 1990 the economy had been transformed.  Our achievements since 1987 have received wide praise from objective external commentators and are regarded as something of a model of non-inflationary growth, which others could well imitate.  No other Community country achieved the same degree of improvement in the fundamentals of its economy as we did in the period since 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most fundamental of all, growth was restored to the economy.  We have had, since 1986, a sustained period of growth <Col N="25" /> averaging 4.5 per cent a year, as confidence was restored and investment and production increased.  By 1990 the public finances were fundamentally transformed. The Exchequer borrowing requirement fell from 12.8 per cent to 2 per cent of GNP in 1990.  The current budget deficit was brought down from the record 8.3 per cent of GNP to 0.7 per cent.  Total Government expenditure was reduced from 55 per cent of GNP in 1986 to 41 per cent in 1990.  Revenue was reduced from 40 per cent of GNP in 1984-86 to 36.6 per cent in 1990.</P>
    <P>These dramatic improvements in the fundamental structure of the Exchequer finances were brought about by firm, skilled and courageous management of the public finances.  Many difficult and unpopular decisions had to be made.  We made them.  Many sacrifices had to be demanded from various sections of our community.  They responded generously in the national interest.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to remind Deputies opposite that this economy was hauled back by Fianna Fáil from the brink of the bankruptcy to which it had been brought in December 1986 by Deputy Bruton of Fine Gael and Deputy Spring of Labour. Under this Government, and their predecessors, the turn-around was dramatic. We have now had a current balance of payments surplus since 1987, giving unprecedented stability to our exchange rate.  Our competitive position has vastly improved.  Irish firms throughout the country can now compete in a way they never knew before.</P>
    <P>The effect of the improvement in the economy was a rise in employment of 40,000 between 1987 and 1990, and we have every reason to believe that those additional jobs are being maintained even in today's most difficult circumstances. Yet Deputies Bruton, Barry, Deasy, Noonan and Spring want this House to express no confidence in a Government who have transformed the Irish economy from the near-bankrupt state in which they left it.</P>
    <P>The practical results of our good management of the public finances are, one of the lowest inflation rates now in the <Col N="26" /> Community; a real relief to household budgets; lower interest and mortgage rates; a reduction in the standard rate of income tax from 35 per cent to 29 per cent and in the top rate of tax from 58 per cent to 52 per cent with many improvements in income tax allowances and exemptions, especially for the low-paid with families.</P>
    <P>The achievements and progress made in all aspects of the economy and the public finances since 1987 must convince any impartial observer that the affairs of the State are best left in the hands of those who achieved these dramatic improvements I have outlined.  What cannot be contemplated is the return of the economy and our public finances to the irresponsible and incompetent care of those who from 1982 to 1986 created economic and social havoc here.</P>
    <P>The great departure in Irish affairs made by this Government and their predecessors has been in the radical new way of managing our economic and social affairs that we have established.  When we came into office in 1987, we invited the trade unions, the employers, and the farmers to join us in formulating the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> We were determined to replace confrontation by consensus.  A small society, like ours, living on a peripheral island and dependent, for our living standards, on international markets, can succeed only if all major economic and social interests are prepared to combine with the Government in an agreed programme of economic and social development.  That is a self-evident truth which, I hope, now that it has been established will never again be forgotten or ignored.</P>
    <P>The approach we have adopted is now the envy of the social partners in other Community countries, particularly when they see the results it has achieved in transforming the economy here since 1986.  It has made us into a low inflation country, and brought a truly remarkable period of industrial peace.</P>
    <P>These achievements have only been possible because of the willingness of the social partners, in the national interest, to combine together with the Government <Col N="27" /> and accept the sacrifices and disciplines that were necessary to bring about the changes that were made.</P>
    <P>This year has brought major difficulties. For the first time since 1987 the international economy has suffered a setback and entered a period of difficulty and recession.  Two of our most important trading partners, the US and the UK went into outright recession with output and employment falling.  This had a serious effect on our economic performance and prospects, though not to the same extent as others have suffered.  In our own case, we had, in common with other Community countries, based our budget on a higher growth rate than can now be achieved.  The growth forecast of 2.25 per cent on which the budget was based, was in line with forecasts for Ireland by the EC Commission last December.  Other published forecasts were broadly in line.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall however that both I and the Minister for Finance stressed at budget-time the difficult and uncertain international background against which this year's economic and budgetary policies had to be framed.  Since January virtually all the major forecasters have scaled back their forecasts for growth. The OECD scaled back its forecast for world growth in 1991 from 2 per cent to 1 per cent; the Commission scaled back its forecast of growth in the Community from 2.2 per cent to 1.4 per cent.  Everyone should understand that we are not alone in having to take action to adapt to circumstances which have changed for the worse.  All the Community countries are having to do the same.  That our hopes and projections of last January will not be realised cannot be grounds for blame. What we could be blamed for would be if we did not quickly identify our problems and take strong corrective action.  That is exactly what we are doing.</P>
    <P>Let me give an outline of what has been happening and what we are doing about it.  Growth in our economy fell away bringing a corresponding decline in Government revenues.  Because of conditions in the US and the UK emigration <Col N="28" /> ceased and many of our emigrants returned. Their welcome return increased greatly the number of unemployed on the Live Register giving rise to a major increase in expenditure for social welfare.</P>
    <P>As early as last July we took action to curb the deterioration in the public finances by cutting Government expenditure by £100 million this year.  Even though we did so, the Government's borrowing this year will rise to 2.5 per cent of GNP instead of the 1.9 per cent we had hoped for.</P>
    <P>While this is disappointing, it is not disastrous.  In no way does it reflect on the authenticity of this year's budget, and any suggestions to that effect are simply not valid.  The combination of factors that caused the deterioration in this year's finances have been clearly identified for all to see and understand.  They are the result of the realities we have to face.</P>
    <P>Despite this deterioration this year, we still have one of the lowest Exchequer deficits in the Community, and our national debt/GNP ratio will decline again this year.  Let me remind Deputies Bruton, Deasy, Barry, Noonan and Spring that the national debt/GNP ratio, when they were in office, rose from 94 per cent to 129 per cent.  For them to attempt to lecture anyone on the management of the public finances is like listening to a lecture by the Emperor Nero to the ancient Romans on fire-fighting.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Fortunately, despite lower growth this year all the indications and estimates from commentators are that employment has remained stable this year.  This is a clear indicator of the basically sound underlying state our economy has now achieved.  Due to this firm foundation our inflation rate, our interest rates and our balance of payments have all been kept under control, and we are <Col N="29" /> ready to benefit from the growth in international trade now forecast generally to occur next year.  Our present assessment is, however, that growth next year will be less than we had been looking forward to.  For the immediate future, we must accept that economic growth is likely to be modest rather than spectacular.  International agencies now predict that growth will return slowly but steadily in the UK and the US in the second half of 1991 and will accelerate in 1992.  On balance, international developments should assist some pick-up in our economy in the months ahead.  We can therefore hope for a more satisfactory growth rate next year, particularly for consumer spending.</P>
      <P>This has special implications for the Exchequer finances.  The lower than expected growth next year coming on top of lower than expected growth this year will mean less Exchequer revenue next year than was planned when the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was agreed.  That programme was based on official estimates of average growth of 3 per cent over the years 1991-1994 which were presented to all involved in the negotiations.  Those rates unfortunately will not now be achieved.</P>
      <P>We discussed last week with our partners in the programme the difficulties the Exchequer faces.  We agreed as partners to discuss over the coming weeks the problems we face and seek to solve them. All sectors will have to contribute to this solution, and I have every confidence that, given the genuine commitment to the national interest that brought us together in the first place, we will resolve the immediate and essentially short-term problems we now face.</P>
      <P>What would be an historic tragedy and what the economy cannot afford is that we should relapse into the old confrontational approach to the management of the economy, in which each sector fights for its own sectional interest regardless of the national interest, and where vital issues are settled on the picket lines or in other equally confrontational ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> The Exchequer Borrowing Requirement for 1992 that is emerging would be greater than the already disappointing outturn for 1991.  That is not consistent with our stated policy objective and cannot be contemplated.</P>
    <P>That situation must and will be addressed. We have made too much progress since 1987 to start sliding backward now. We must continue to improve the Exchequer finances in line with the objectives set in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> These objectives include reducing the debt/GNP ratio to about 100 per cent and achieving broad balance in the current budget by 1993. These must be reached for our own domestic reasons, but also to enable us to meet the new disciplines that will be imposed in the second stage of Economic and Monetary Union.  This will require us to look at all the options open to us in both the expenditure and the revenue areas of the public finances.  As part of that process, we are now entering into bilateral discussions with the social partners. The Government are also engaged in a detailed examination of all areas of Exchequer expenditure.  These efforts are still at an early stage.  However, the Government are determined that the necessary steps will be taken to protect the public finances.</P>
    <P>I can therefore assure the House that the fiscal discipline which has characterised this Government's dealing with the public finances will be maintained. We have all learned from the mistakes that were made in the past, and for which we are still paying today, when servicing the public debt takes more than three-quarters of the entire income tax yield. Having gained so much ground over the past few years, we do not now propose to throw those gains away, which have been hard earned.</P>
    <P>Provided we do what is needed now, however, there is great hope for the future.  Given the improvement in our economy in recent years, we are now in a good position to take advantage of the world upswing in economic activity, when it gets under way.  In the context of the Single European Market after 1992 <Col N="31" /> and the opening up of markets in Eastern Europe, which should promote a substantial increase in European trade, we can benefit significantly.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, we have been developing the potential of the economy as rapidly as possible and in every area, neglecting no opportunity for growth. There is a new financial services industry; many provincial towns now have international data-processing industries. Many new industrial projects are coming before the Government or the IDA for grant approval.  We have had dynamic growth in our tourist industry, with a doubling of tourist numbers since 1986. There has been an unprecedented level of investment in new tourist amenities and facilities.  The establishment of Coillte and the more than doubling of the level of forestry planting since 1986 have been a resounding success.  Our marine industries are also expanding.  We have given a new impetus to science and technology in the service of development.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan there has been sustained investment in our infrastructure, especially roads, ports and airports, with corresponding benefit to activity in the construction industry. Every area of this worthwhile, developmental work will be continued, intensified and expanded, all with the overall guiding objective of providing the jobs we desperately need.</P>
    <P>The last few years have also been a period of significant social advice.  Economic growth has made it possible for us to do far more than was feasible in the stagnation of the mid-1980s.  Major improvements have been made in the level of welfare payments, especially to the long-term unemployed with families. Education has been given special priority, with an increase in the provision of third level places, including the new Business School at Carysfort.  We have established a new Commission on the Status of Women, and taken action on their initial recommendations.  We are also implementing a major programme of legal reform, which includes many enlightened social measures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="32" /> We have been effective in bringing about social change, social reform and social improvement.  Putting forward popular, high-sounding policies is easy. What counts however is the ability to implement; to take the hard practical decisions, to decide difficult priorities. That is where this Government show their mettle.</P>
    <P>The cultural life of our nation is flourishing, contributing to a new vibrant sense of national identity.  Our environment policies are working well and there is a completely new national profile and public awareness in this important field.  We are sensitive in our approach to issues, small in themselves, but nonetheless of great symbolic significance for our self-esteem as a nation.  Our cities, towns and our countryside show many notable signs of an improved appearance.</P>
    <P>At EC level, we have been effective in the protection and promotion of Irish interest while contributing fully to the further integration of the Community. We believe that our full membership of an increasingly integrated and developing Community will enable us to exploit to the full our potential as a nation.</P>
    <P>The past years have been ones of fundamental change in European politics and present great challenges for the European Community and its member states.  Rarely in the recent history of our continent has there been such an opportunity to overcome the legacy of the past and build a stable, secure and prosperous Europe.</P>
    <P>The European Community is at the centre of these efforts.  It is faced with the tasks of strengthening its own internal cohesion, building new relations with its neighbours, and promoting a more secure European order.  Issues are now coming up for decision which are of enormous significance for Europe, for the European Community, and for this country. Developments since we joined have shown conclusively how closely Ireland's political and economic interests are intertwined with those of our European partners. We share common interests and must build a common future.  That is why the Government are now involved in a <Col N="33" /> series of complex and far-reaching negotiations &mdash; the most complex and far-reaching since we joined the Community &mdash; the outcome of which will certainly have profound effects on the future of our people and the welfare of future generations.</P>
    <P>The two Intergovernmental Conferences on Political Union and on Economic and Monetary Union are at the heart of the Community's efforts to move forward on the path to closer integration. Their general scope and objectives were settled during the Irish Presidency last year, and negotiations have been proceeding since then.  I have kept the House fully informed of those developments throughout the negotiations, and I gave a comprehensive account of all the issues involved, and of Ireland's position on them, in July, after the Luxembourg Summit.</P>
    <P>The Treaty on Political Union will establish new forms of co-operation on foreign and security policy and on home and judicial affairs.  Progress has been made, but the most difficult part of the negotiations still lie ahead on such essential matters as foreign policy and security, voting, the role of the European Parliament, and in particular and of very great interest to us, economic and social cohesion.  Ireland's position on several of these issues has been recognised at successive European Councils and incorporated in their conclusions.  There is agreement that the definition of a defence policy is something for the future, and the recognition that any defence identity for the union must take account of our traditional position.  The task now will be to translate these political agreements into concrete measures in the negotiations ahead.</P>
    <P>Recently, we successfully opposed attempts to create a two tier approach with regard to the move of the final stage of EMU.  This is a matter of fundamental importance for the Community and for Ireland.  The strength of the Community lies in its ideals of unity and coherence; a two tier approach to either Economic and Monetary Union or to Political Union would be the antithesis of everything <Col N="34" /> the Community stands for and is simply unacceptable.</P>
    <P>All these negotiations will reach their crucial stages in the coming months.  They will require the most careful and expert handling if we are to achieve our dual aims of advancing the process of European integration and protecting and promoting Ireland's best interests in all areas.  This Government have the political skills, experience, the confidence based on past successes and the respect of our partners, to enable us to handle these crucially important negotiations in the period immediately ahead in Ireland's very best long-term interests.</P>

      <P>Irish political life is going through a traumatic period with many disturbing features.  The fall-out from what has been happening can only be damaging to the best interests of our country.  First, we had the disclosure of the reprehensible behaviour of a small number of individuals in the business and financial sector.  That by itself was deeply disturbing and seriously detrimental to the good name of this country, but it was added to, hyped up and exaggerated by <Col N="35" /> a massive campaign of vilification and character assassination of unprecedented intensity without regard to evidence, proof of justification.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A totally unjustified attempt was made to put the blame for business scandals on to the Government when clearly there was no ministerial involvement of any kind.  The business and financial scandals in the semi-State sector in which the Government were in no way involved were seized upon, embellished and twisted in a totally dishonest manner to smear those who had no connection of any kind with them. Normal legitimate political debate was discarded and in its place we have had a campaign of personalised attacks by way of unfounded allegations, innuendo, accusations of guilt by association and all the other traditional, despicable weapons of such a campaign.</P>

      <P>I now wish firmly to reiterate that statement.  Nothing has emerged or been revealed since to affect in any way the truth of that statement.</P>
      <P>I warmly welcome this debate and the opportunity it gives me to state categorically that neither I nor any of the Ministers of this Government had any connection of even the remotest kind with any of the events and transactions now being investigated in regard to Irish Sugar and Telecom Éireann.  I and my colleagues eagerly await the outcome of all the investigations now under way so that the truth can be fully established and revealed and our position vindicated.  It will then be shown that neither I nor any Minister of this Government was in any way involved in or connected with these events or transactions.</P>
      <P>The House is well used to false allegations by a number of Deputies from what is called the Left, but on this occasion the new peddler of this kind of stuff, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy John Bruton, decided apparently to take his ignoble part.  He threw himself into the disreputable campaign with a kind of erratic frenzy, popping up all over the place, making unfounded allegations and demanding contradictory courses of action.  Perhaps this is not as surprising as it might seem when we recall that it was the new Leader of Fine Gael who devoted the main thrust of his vaudeville Ard Fheis to a vulgar coarse attack on one single Fianna Fáil Deputy.</P>

      <P>The present campaign has brought business and professional life to a state of hysteria.  There now exists an unhealthy aura of suspicion and distrust bordering on paranoia.</P>
      <P>Because it was clear beyond doubt that I was not in even the remotest way personally involved in any of the events or transactions under investigation, nor connected with them in any way, the tactic was resorted to of attempting to attribute to me some kind of guilt by association.  I would like to remind this House and all those involved in this attempt that civilized societies have always rejected the concept of guilt by association.  The McCarthy era in the US should be a clear and salutary warning to them that society ultimately rejects those who engage in this ignominious trade.</P>
      <P>I would, nevertheless, like to deal with the attempts which have been made in this area.</P>
      <P>With regard to Dr. Michael Smurfit and Bernard Cahill, Chairman of Greencore, my relationship with them was almost exclusively of an official nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

With regard to Mr. Comerford, Mr. Tully, Mr. Garavan, Mr. Keleghan and Mr. Lyons, I had no association of any kind with them.  The political allegiances of the first two in particular are far removed from mine.</P>
      <P>I have known Dermot Desmond personally for a number of years.  I first came in contact with him when he put forward the idea of the establishment of an international financial services centre in Dublin.  Fianna Fáil were in Opposition at that time; we adopted the idea and on return to Government set about establishing it.</P>

      <P>It has since been developed successfully to the point where <Col N="41" /> 180 projects are setting up there with employment already in excess of 2,800. Later I was in contact with Mr. Desmond about the &ldquo;Sail Ireland&rdquo; project which involved entering an Irish boat for the Whitbread Round the World Yacht race. That brave venture which involved building a yacht of international status in Ballyfermot had widespread support throughout the business community and among the general public.  I make no apologies for fully supporting it.  It was a great national enterprise involving thousands of fine people and was up-front, open and above board.  I had no relationship or association with Dermot Desmond in regard to any other matter in either the area of public administration or the private sector.</P>
      <P>In the last few days, we have much play being made of what was on the face of it an extraordinary letter written by Mr. Desmond to the Chairman of Pernod-Ricard.  The claims it seemed to make were patently absurd.  The Government were careful to remain totally objective and maintain complete neutrality in the rival bidding for control of Irish Distillers.  The whole take-over transaction and its implications, has already been fully dealt with and examined by the courts.  There was no impropriety or irregularity.  If there had been, this would have become evident in the court proceedings.  The Revenue Commissioners simply made a statement, helpful to all the parties, clarifying the tax implications in question, provided &mdash; and only provided &mdash; the statutory requirements were observed.  Such a statement is normal practice in taxation matters when it is desired to clarify tax liabilities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already made clear, and I repeat here again categorically, that no person or company ever received any favourable <Col N="43" /> treatment or consideration in their dealings with Government because of personal friendships or associations.  In fact, they could not.  The position with regard to the awarding of Government contracts for consultancies and services of that nature has already been clearly outlined. In the Civil Service the principle of competitive tendering and of seeking a minimum of three tenders is required under current Government contract procedures, contained in a code of practice laid down by the Department of Finance. Firm procedures will be put in place to ensure that the same principle applies in State companies.</P>
    <P>This is a Government of absolute integrity. I reject totally any allegations to the contrary, and, when all the investigations have been completed, it will be established that there was no Government or ministerial involvement of any kind in any of the transactions or events being investigated.  Those who have engaged in this disreputable campaign of rumours, allegations and innuendoes have done a grievous disservice to our parliamentary democracy.  They should be thoroughly ashamed of their efforts because despite what has happened, taking it all fully into account I assert that the standards of Government and public administration in this country are as high as those prevailing anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I think it is equally important that I should at this stage make clear my belief that while these totally unacceptable events have undoubtedly occurred their extent has been hyped up and exaggerated out of all proportion, because it is my belief that the overwhelming majority of business and professional people in this country are people of integrity whose standards of conduct are above reproach.</P>
    <P>I have now been under personal character attack for 12 years, from the very day I first became Taoiseach.  I have endured these personal attacks in the knowledge that I had nothing to fear or conceal.  In all those 12 years, my detractors have failed to substantiate one single accusation against me, but this has <Col N="44" /> not deterred them.  These attacks on me personally have had the basic objective also of damaging the Fianna Fáil Party. But they have failed in their principal aim, to deter me from applying myself to the best of my ability to the better welfare of my fellow citizens, which should be the aim of everyone in political life.</P>
    <P>My party and I are proud of what we have contributed to the well-being of this country.  We have not succeeded in all we would like to do but all over Ireland, there are people who have benefited from ideas and policies of ours whether they be the old and infirm; those on social welfare; the lower-paid, those in need of better health services; small farmers; those in need of housing, and many others.</P>
    <P>In this Government and in Fianna Fáil we have no concern, we hold no brief, for that comparatively small group of persons in our society who behave dishonourably, who break the rules, who abuse the trust and confidence placed in them by the rest of us.  Any illegalities, malpractice or unprofessional behaviour will be uncovered and disclosed, and all appropriate action will be taken.  Nobody will be protected from the consequences of their actions.  It is only in this way that public trust and confidence in our financial and business systems can be fully restored.</P>
    <P>This Government and Fianna Fáil's concern is not for the dishonest few but for the decent majority.  It is our responsibility to protect the interests of the taxpayers, the poorer, weaker sections of our community, the good name of our Irish business financial and professional sectors, to work constantly with legitimate business interests for economic progress and to promote projects which will provide jobs, to establish and maintain standards and safeguards in Government administration in the semi-State sector and in business and financial affairs.  We will discharge that responsibility, and we will not be deterred by this current massive, unscrupulous campaign of vilification.</P>
    <P>It is very detrimental to the legitimate work and purpose of Government that <Col N="45" /> either politicians or the media should seek without any justification whatever to misconstrue and misrepresent the normal activities of Government Ministers in a way that has been attempted in recent weeks.  It is both legitimate and necessary for industrialists and commercial leaders to have access to Ministers in matters of common concern in economic and social policy areas.</P>
    <P>Ministers must not disregard any opportunity to secure investment and advance valuable economic projects. Similarly, leaders of professional bodies and trade unions, community leaders and representatives of all kinds of organisations frequently meet with Ministers on matters of concern to them.  To suggest, as has now become the practice with a number of Deputies in this House, that there is something wrong with such contacts or something improper about them is completely irresponsible.  It is an entirely new malicious practice in our political life largely orchestrated by The Workers' Party for their own sinister reasons, which seeks by innuendo to cast some sort of suspicion over meetings which are in themselves entirely appropriate and legitimate.  For the first time also members of the Government have been personally attacked as being responsible for decisions and events within semi-State bodies.</P>

      <P>There is one matter of public policy, which I would like to place on record. The normal practice, as regards the relations between a commercial State-sponsored body and the relevant Minister is that the Government appoint boards of directors, who are then given a large measure of commercial freedom in the management of the company.  The level of autonomy enjoyed has been consistent with the legislation and considered appropriate for the job to be done.  This practice has been followed by successive Governments in relation to the commercial affairs of State companies.  State-sponsored bodies, therefore, would not normally consult with or obtain the approval of Government Departments for individual commercial decisions, unless there were specific Exchequer or major strategic implications.</P>
      <P>I wish to make it clear to this House and to the country that the current attempts to destabilise and undermine this Government have not succeeded and will not succeed.  This Government are fully in charge of the nation's affairs.  We are clear about the nature and extent of the problems which confront the Government and the country.  We are equally clear about what must be done to see the country safely through these difficulties and resume the pattern of progress which this Government and their Fianna Fáil predecessor have so firmly established.  I assure this House and the country that we have the capacity and determination to guide this nation safely through this difficult period as we have done on so many occasions in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition parties may think that policies do not matter any more, that they are better employed searching for new scandals or attending tribunals, but this Government intend to concentrate on the real problems facing the country. This Government have formulated and are implementing a comprehensive complement of policies covering every area of administration.  Our contribution <Col N="48" /> to the debate in the European Community on political, economic and monetary union is strong and coherent and in the best interests of the Community and of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the National Development Plan, using £3 billion of Structural Funds aid, is steadily improving the national infrastructure, roads, harbours, airports and transport.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has both created the climate for progress and outlined a major programme of specific measures for economic and social advance.  In my Ard-Fheis speech this year I outlined a major programme of social reform and advance.  Our careful control of the public finances and our clear intention of pursuing the objectives set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> of reductions in borrowing and achieving a broad balance on current account, are an essential part of our strategy for good Government.</P>
    <P>The newly revised programme for government between the two Government parties will update our range of policies and take our plans forward a further stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having this confidence debate because the Government have undermined confidence in the political system and confidence in our institutions. They have undermined the confidence of the Irish people in themselves. The Government, by producing a fraudulent budget in 1991, laid the foundation for the undermining of the national finances.  This Government in the way they negotiated the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> knowingly made commitments that the State could not afford.  They deceived people. They undermined the trust on which good industrial relations is based.  This Government, by forcing spending Estimates through without examination and all in one vote last July, undermined the constitutional role of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government, sleepwalking through a world-wide economic recession, have presided over the highest level of unemployment and emigration in the history of the State.  This Government, in their culture of clever deals and clientelist politics, have lowered standards and contaminated other parts of our society.  This Government have abandoned the agricultural community to their fate in Europe, without tabling any alternative to the MacSharry proposals. This Government have allowed the housing problem to grow to the point that we now have 30,000 families in bad housing <Col N="50" /> conditions waiting to be housed.  That is the legacy after their four years in office.</P>
    <P>This Government have become profoundly unpopular, not because of recent scandals but because those scandals have awakened people to the fact that their Government react to events rather than seek to shape them.  The Government reacted to the scandals with a spate of partial investigations but they did not prevent the scandals in the first place through proper ministerial supervision of Government bodies.  They reacted with surprise and bafflement to the dramatic growth in unemployment this year, with a spate of task forces but never had and do not now have any coherent employment strategy for next year, the year after or the rest of the century.</P>
    <P>They reacted with a series of ill-considered radio interviews to the fact that their 1991 budget, predictably, went off the rails.  They followed this instant reaction with inconclusive discussions with the social partners.  It is clear now, despite all we have heard, that the Government's entire budgetary strategy has collapsed and they have nothing to put in its place.  The 1992 budget is looming, bills must be met but the Government have not begun to consider how they will be met.  That is a measure of the Government's loss of a sense of coherence and direction.</P>
    <P>As Northern Ireland moves deeper and deeper into sectarian conflict with one murder following another, the Irish Government just sit and occasionally react to the latest move by the British Secretary of State, but they have no policy of their own, and have not had one for the past four years.  Neither do they appear to care very much one way or another.</P>
    <P>And, probably worst of all in its long-term seriousness, this Government again react helplessly to the latest proposals from others on the shape of the new Europe, on the Common Agricultural Policy, and on the latest proposal on European defence.  Again, they have no policy of their own on any of these matters. They have not produced an Irish <Col N="51" /> White Paper on how the new federal Europe should be structured.  They are drifting into European defence commitments, with no concept of why they are doing so, apart from a vague and pathetic wish not to be seen to be left out of the club.  That is about the depth of the Government's consideration of European issues.</P>
    <P>In the real sense of the word, Ireland does not now have a Government.  We have Ministers, we have an impressive Government office, much more impressive than four years ago, we have black cars going to official openings, but we do not have anybody planning the nation's future, or at least for more than 48 hours ahead.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most expressive photograph in 1991 of &ldquo;Mr. Haughey's Ireland,&rdquo; to use the title of a television programme, is that of people, middleaged as well as young, queuing up in Dublin's historic GPO to post off applications for Morrison visas, to get out of here as quickly as possible to the recession-ridden United States.  That is the extent of their confidence in &ldquo;Mr. Haughey's Ireland&rdquo; after four years of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Even the much touted successes of the earlier years are now seen to have been superficial.  The large growth rate of the 1987-88 period is now revealed by students of economics to have been little more than the release of pent-up consumer savings.  A large part of the budgetary economies of 1987-89 came from simply postponing pay commitments to the then distant &ldquo;future&rdquo;.  That future has now arrived, the bills must now be paid, and the so-called achievements of earlier years are seen in their true context, postponements, of problems.  A large part of the other budgetary economies of that time were also achieved through postponements, postponements of hospital buildings, postponements of school buildings and postponements of house building.  All will have to be built eventually but most assuredly by a different Government.</P>
    <P>Indeed the most notable feature of the <Col N="52" /> 1987-89 period was the Tallaght Strategy wherein, for the first time in the nation's history, the main Opposition party offered constructive co-operation to a minority Government in the national interest.  It says much about the core values of Fianna Fáil that they rejected this new approach in a petulant fashion at the earliest possible opportunity.  It also says a great deal about the core values of the Progressive Democrats now absent from the House that they spent those two years doing their very best to sabotage the Tallaght Strategy.</P>
    <P>At least the two parties now in Government have that much in common.  Neither party in the period 1987 to 1989 had any appreciation of the national interest. Indeed, both parties deservedly lost seats in the subsequent general election.  Neither of them have any real regard for the national interest at the present time, otherwise they would not be carrying on the destabilising charade that we have witnessed during the past 13 weeks.</P>
    <P>Throughout the past four years there has been virtually no structural reform of the economy, of our institutions or of public spending.  Despite promises, there has been no local government reform. Our system is still centralised and our elected councillors have been reduced to being little more then temporary unpaid public relations officers for permanent officialdom.</P>
    <P>There has been no reform of the public service.  There has been no public service reform Bill, as the Government led by Deputy FitzGerald had planned.  There is no reward for exceptional services performed by permanent officials.  There is no delegation of formal responsibility to named officials.  There is just the continuance of the old system under which all power theoretically resides in the Minister's office, and nothing gets done.</P>
    <P>Nor has there been any overall reform of the health service in the past four years.  It is still an illness service.  It is still hospital centred.  It is still over-administered and under-managed.  The present Taoiseach still does not hear the message that so much took him by surprise in the <Col N="53" /> middle of the 1989 general election.  He could see no crisis in the health service then, just as he could see no jobs crisis earlier this year.</P>
    <P>There has been no fundamental educational reform.  After four years the Minister for Education is still talking about producing discussion documents. We have had no Education Act, no educational accountability, no educational targets, no comparisons with other countries and no statutory body set up to set and examine the curriculum.  After four years the system is still driven by written exams alone.  Children are still dropping out of school too early.  Access to third level education is still grossly unfair &mdash; unfair to those of limited means, and unfair in particular to those whose parents are in the PAYE sector.  There is no money to put this right, we are told, but there is money &mdash; nearly £10 million &mdash; to take Carysfort College off the hands of a friend.</P>
    <P>There has been talk of tax reform &mdash; enough talk to make people unsure about the future, unsure, in particular, about the future of mortgage interest relief, and thus reluctant, perhaps, to invest in a home.  But there has not been much actual tax reform.  In a country with a huge shortage of work we tax work in such a way as to make sure that we have even less of it than we had previously. Ireland's tax system, in a country with record levels of unemployment is, quite simply, perverse.</P>
    <P>The entire structure of our rural life is about to be devastated.  Thousands of PAYE jobs in the food industry are to be destroyed by the MacSharry proposals, without any mention from Commissioner MacSharry of compensation for those PAYE people who lose their jobs. However, this Irish Government have no policy or plan for the future of Irish agriculture, no more than they have tabled any alternative proposals to those put forward by Commissioner MacSharry. They are willing to sit and agree meekly with those proposals, apart from making a few public relations gestures for domestic consumption.  Indeed, as all of that happens the same Government <Col N="54" /> are allowing our food industry's remaining good name to be destroyed by intervention scandals, by angel dust and by the failure to eradicate bovine TB.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, however, in Government Buildings it is party politics as usual &mdash; Chinese politics, it seems.  The Progressive Democrats are like Mao Tse-Tung. He believed in perpetual revolution. They believe in perpetual renegotiation.  They cannot make up their minds whether they are part of the Government.  They have two voices &mdash; one for the Cabinet Room and another for the public gallery.  As for the Taoiseach, he sees himself as some sort of ancient Chinese leader who goes on and on and on and on &mdash; a depressing self-obsession.</P>
    <P>I shall not refer to the content of the Taoiseach's rather foolish speech made in the House today, beyond saying that he made many references to and innuendoes about people who could not defend themselves and then made a reference to a person who is not here in the House, did not elaborate the charge he was making and did not have the grace to withdraw the charge when he was challenged. That says a lot about the extent to which the Taoiseach has thought through what he is doing in this House.  I suppose the most charitable thing that could be said about the Taoiseach's speech is that it was in its content and its delivery indicative of the desperate position in which he finds himself.</P>
    <P>But let me turn to more fundamental issues.  The recent spate of scandals arose precisely because we do not have a proper system of accountable parliamentary democracy in Dáil Éireann. If the Dáil had proper powers of scrutiny, and if the Government and State bodies had felt themselves to be genuinely accountable to the House on an ongoing basis in the past four years, then none of those scandals would ever have happened. It is because the Dáil has not been reformed, because the Dáil does not have the means to call Ministers and State bodies to account before decisions are taken that there has been this depressing and damaging succession of scandals. <Col N="55" /> The source of the problem lies ultimately in the unreformed nature of this House.</P>
    <P>Last July £6 billion of taxpayers' money was approved here, at the Government's request and with the agreement of other parties, in a single Vote, without a single item of spending being scrutinised.  That done, this Government then sent the entire House off on holidays for three months.  If that is the way this House treats the approval of the spending of £6 billion, is it any wonder that State companies have acquired a rather light-hearted way of dealing with the expenditure of a mere £1 million or £2 million?  The problem starts here in this House.  Neither Ministers nor permanent officials are ever asked to come before a committee of this House to explain before they spend taxpayers' money why they propose to spend it in a particular way.  There is no parliament in Europe where that would be the case except this one.  As elected representatives we are uniquely irresponsible. That is why we continue to have scandals.  That is why this party are determined to take office in this country in order to reform Dáil Éireann and our political system.  Until that happens we will have the risk continuing of a recurrence of the sort of situation that has done so much damage in this country over the last two months.  Of course in this House we are great, and indeed this Government are particularly good, at ordering inquiries and looking for papers after the harm has been done, when the money is already misspent.  That would not be necessary if the Dáil had been allowed do its job properly in the first place.  Again, because Ministers themselves are not held accountable here in this House, in turn they do not feel any need to hold State boards responsible for accounting to them until it is too late. That is the price we pay for not having a proper working committee system here in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Facing an exploding jobs crisis earlier this year Fine Gael, a party of 55 Deputies, formally proposed the establishment of an all-party forum on jobs, <Col N="56" /> indeed a call that was supported by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is a measure of the contempt in which this Taoiseach holds the Dáil and its Members that he did not even have the manners to reply to that offer from the second largest party in the House in the face of a jobs crisis of historic proportions.</P>
    <P>Next year the Irish people will vote in a referendum to approve a fundamental change in the constitution of the European Community.  That is what it is behind all the gobbledegook about Inter-Governmental Conferences; it is a new constitution for a new Europe.  Much of this has been agreed already behind closed doors.  Yet no one in this House, this sovereign Assembly, has been allowed to examine, let alone debate, any of the many drafts of this new European Treaty.  This House has not been allowed &mdash; and will not be allowed as long as this Government remain in office &mdash; to make any contribution towards getting the best deal possible for Ireland.  Yet the final treaty is to be settled in Maastricht &mdash; again behind closed doors &mdash; no more than seven weeks from now.  The pattern is the same as with all the other issues to which I have just referred.  Because this House is not holding the Government to account over their policy on Europe, the Government do not actually need to have a policy and this Government do not have any policy as far as this new development in Europe is concerned.  As a result &mdash; I say this carefully in the hope that all in this House will listen &mdash; we may well be heading for a national disaster in the referendum on the new European Constitution next year.  If that happens it will be because Dáil Éireann was not involved in the process and public opinion was not prepared for what the public will be asked to agree next year.</P>
    <P>Of course, this lack of accountability suits the Taoiseach's very personal style of government &mdash; nothing on paper; no Cabinet minutes; just a quite telephone call, radio interview or, more often, the knowing glare and the job is done; no trace left behind.  The muck sticks to other people, disposable people.  And the people around him, the 77 Fianna Fáil <Col N="57" /> Deputies, are prepared to go on putting up with this.  Well, the Irish people are not prepared to put up with it any longer. That is the message from this House and from my party in this debate; it is time to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did NCB get all those consultancies without open tender, including one from the Department of Energy?  Why was UCD asked to buy Carysfort, not when it was available at a low price, but later on when it was almost £2 million dearer and when nobody else wanted to buy it?  Why did that happen? Why can State board chairmen be sacked on radio without a Cabinet meeting to discuss whether that should happen?  The answer to all three questions is quite simple.  Under the present Taoiseach Ireland does not have accountable Cabinet Government.  We have personal Government.  In the final analysis it will be the fault of every one of us here in Dáil Éireann, including the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil backbenches, if that continues for much longer.  Indeed, in every sense, public life is now dominated by what I would describe as the culture of the deal &mdash; a quiet deal to take the Johnston Mooney and O'Brien site off Mr. Desmond's hands; a quiet deal to ensure that Mr. Desmond's &ldquo;Sail Ireland&rdquo; got a large amount of public sponsorship from Government companies already deeply in debt, a quiet deal with the social partners about matters that are the proper responsibility of elected representatives in this House.  And now, it is hoped, a quiet deal, or perhaps not such a quiet deal, with Deputy Desmond O'Malley, Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me now that it is not just the detail that is wrong as far as this Government are concerned; it is the whole culture.  As Eastern Europe opens up long-shut cupboards to the rigours of parliamentary democracy and to open market competition we here, at the very western extreme of Europe, are setting out in the opposite direction to keep our <Col N="58" /> elected Parliament in the dark about all-important matters, to take business decisions, not on the basis of competitive efficiency but rather on the basis &mdash; to use the famous phrase in the recently published letter &mdash; of &ldquo;political contacts&rdquo;. We are going in precisely the opposite direction, in so far as opening up our society, to that which the newly democratised countries of Eastern Europe are travelling.</P>
    <P>Of course in this debate we will be told there are investigations under way and that we should not prejudge them.  I prejudge nothing.  I speak simply on the basis of the facts that are already known and uncontested.  On the basis of those facts I assert that this Government are rotten to the core and should go.  In any event, the investigations they now propose are only partial and inadequate investigations of some, but not all, of the allegations. For example, the Telecom inquiry does not specifically include the Findlater House building or the Merrion Road building.  The Telecom inspector does not have the power of access to bank accounts.  Without access to bank accounts, to the &ldquo;money trail&rdquo;, so to speak, one cannot actually find out, in modern commercial arrangements, who is really benefiting from any particular deal.  In this surreal world of Cypriot companies, of mysterious shareholders and interlocking transactions the truth is whatever the man who is paying one's bill says it is.  The inspectors appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce have not been given the power to go behind that and follow bank accounts as they must if they are to get to the truth.</P>
    <P>Of course &mdash; and the Taoiseach made a few references to me during this debate about an allegation I made &mdash; the allegation I made, one which has been entirely substantiated by Aer Lingus, in respect of the leak of Aer Lingus information to Celtic Helicopters, is not being investigated either.  There is no need to investigate it; the case is proven.  Neither is there an investigation into the amazing decision subsequently to appoint Mr. Dermot Desmond Chairman of Aer Rianta despite the fact that the Tánaiste, <Col N="59" /> and other Ministers, knew what had happened. Nor indeed is there any investigation into the circumstances in which the Minister for the Environment instructed Dublin County Council to initiate a special pipeline across the Taoiseach's land.  Not only do these investigations not cover these important matters, and thus are ridiculously limited, but the Government's other proposals in response to these scandals have been entirely unconvincing.  There was no mention of a serious fraud office until after Fine Gael had called for it.  There was no mention of chairmen &ldquo;stepping aside&rdquo; until after Fine Gael had called for that also; even the precise words used were borrowed.  There was no mention of an ethics code until Fine Gael and other Opposition parties had called for that.  Significantly, the hastily proposed ethics code is to apply to State boards, but not to Ministers.  I wonder why.</P>
    <P>There are many Members who are fearful of a general election.  There are people outside this House who profess themselves worried about what they describe as &ldquo;instability&rdquo;.  Let me ask those people a serious question.  What, in all seriousness, could be more unstable than the attempted continuance of this Government for another two years?  No decisions will be taken, planning will stop.  Those who want no change in any area are always talking about &ldquo;instability&rdquo;. This is the most unstable Government this country could possibly have at this juncture in our national history.</P>
    <P>Any Government who could spend 13 weeks debating whether they could continue or not and then only make up their minds after a confidence debate has started are profoundly unstable.  If a political scientist wants to find an example of a government which is inherently unstable, then this Government represent that example.  This is not the first time. Throughout the past two years there has been a recurring series of &ldquo;high noons&rdquo; and last minute stand-offs.  This has created continuing instability and it will continue with ever greater intensity, no matter what is agreed or not agreed <Col N="60" /> today, tomorrow or next week, for as long as this Government lasts.  In today's case this stand-off has actually led to substantial outflows of funds because of the instability and uncertainty created by the fact that the Government cannot make up their minds whether to stay together or not.  These outflows of money can be documented.  It is costing this country money and much of this money will never come back.  If this Government continue in office, this sort of thing will go on happening month after month.  It is not good for the country.  The Progressive Democrats are not serving either their party's or their nation's interests by keeping the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, in power.  They know that and their supporters know it.</P>
    <P>As long as this Government continue, survival will be the sole guiding principle. The entire drama will be about one individual, not about the needs and aspirations of 3.5 million people who want to feel that this is their country and that it is a country to be proud of.  That is something they do not feel today.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I should like to say to Deputy Haughey directly, you and your associates, by staying on in office, are stifling the regeneration of this country; you are a barrier on the road; you are a reminder of past vanities, a hangover from an earlier era, it is time for you to go.</P>
    <P>If Members want to form an alternative Government they can and will do it.  That is what the Irish people want them to do. Of course smaller parties may protest that they would like someone else to do the job.  They might suggest that someone else should put Fianna Fáil back into office after the next election.  Supporters of all the parties in this House, apart from supporters of Fianna Fáil, do not want to see Fianna Fáil back in office after the next election with the support of anybody. I can confidently assert that there will be no party in this House who will wish to see Fianna Fáil back in office after the next election.  Whatever honest differences there are among the parties, there will be no party in this House who will collaborate in putting Fianna Fáil <Col N="61" /> back into office after what we have seen in the past two years.  The Progressive Democrats will not do it.  The Workers' Party will not do it and the Independents will not do it.  The Labour Party will not do it and the Fine Gael Party will not do it.  Our supporters do not want to see Fianna Fáil back in office and they will not let us put them back in office.</P>
    <P>We will put in place a Government who will not be led by Fianna Fáil.  That is what the people now want and that is necessarily and inevitably what they will get.  That Government will restore the faith of Irish people in themselves.  It will tackle long-ignored social problems in our community, including the problem of marriage breakdown.  That Government will tackle Ireland's endemic unemployment problem with a coherent set of measures and will be committed to sound fiscal policies which are the inevitable necessity for membership of a single European currency area.  They will be a Government who will reform the Dáil and give everybody's representative, including the Opposition Fianna Fáil Deputies, a chance to do a constructive job.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach in his speech this afternoon outlined his vision of the country he seemed to perceive from the distance at which he views it.  I strongly urge him not to get off the mythical horse of Tír na nÓg for fear that his vision may turn to stone.  The country the Taoiseach described is not the country in which I am living.  The country the Taoiseach eulogised is not the country which the pickets outside his palatial offices tried to bring to his attention as he drove into work, proclaiming that there are 258,700 people unemployed. The country the Taoiseach eulogised is not the one I recognise in Dublin City Council where there are queues of people looking for housing and money from the Department of the Environment who have resolutely refused them the money to build houses.  The same Department, as Deputy Callely will be aware, has not even given us the legislative framework within which to administer the grand sum of 150 housing loans to deal with a queue of 30,000 families.  I do not know what country Deputy Haughey thinks he is Taoiseach of but it certainly is not this land.  If the speech he made today is a true reflection of his perception of where this country is at, we have more problems than I thought we had when this debate started.</P>
      <P>This Government are a failed political entity.  I hope the Taoiseach recognises the phrase.  They have already lost the confidence of the farmers, the unemployed, public sector workers and the entire business community.  Significantly, the Government have also lost the support of a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies and very few of the Progressive Democrats have a good word to say about them. In short, the Government have lost the confidence of the people and we believe they should now lose the confidence of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country needs a new start and a new direction if we are to tackle the social and economic problems which now confront us but we must start with the Government.  They simply must go.  They are tired, dispirited and divided.  The two <Col N="63" /> parties in Government no longer trust themselves or each other.</P>

      <P>There are some 35 genealogical centres now spread throughout the 32 counties where computerising of records from parish and other universal sources is being undertaken by trainees from FÁS and ACE &mdash; Action for Community Employment, a programme run by the Northern Ireland Training Authority.  The number of records held on computer in these centres up to June 1991 totalled 4 million.  There are also 4 million items held in manual records some of which are also on computer records.  The estimate for completion of the work of computerising parish and other records is three to four years.  I am glad to report this progress in the provision of a nationwide genealogical service.</P>
      <P>Deputies will, no doubt, be aware that a homecoming festival is being arranged jointly by Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board for September 1992.  The objective of the festival is to attract an additional 10,000 visitors to Ireland, both North and South.  A programme of special events of a cultural and genealogical nature will form the core of the festival and the genealogical centres will be actively involved in these events.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay a tribute to the International Fund for Ireland for the contribution of £435,000 towards the costs of the festival.</P>

Would the Taoiseach agree that these records are not really useful until they are complete and cannot be fully promoted until that is the case?  Would he intervene to make sure that his target of three to four years is achieved by making the money available at the right time and on the right scale?</P>

      <P>Could the Taoiseach say if any parallel commercial activity is being envisaged in these various areas where profits might be made by various institutions from producing costs of arms and things of that nature, rather than hiving it off to individual private organisations?

I know the private sector is involved in this and is producing the required goods, but there is an excellent chance for the genealogical offices and the various branches throughout the country to get involved in that activity themselves, which is an automatic way of producing substantial profits with the various coats of arms signed by the Chief Knight in a very attractive fashion.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>On 18 July 1991, accompanied by the Ministers for Finance, Industry and Commerce, Agriculture and Food, Labour and Social Welfare, I met the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to review the progress of the programme and to review generally the economic and social background to it.</P>
      <P>On 31 July 1991, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and myself met representatives of the farming organisations which are party to the programme to discuss developments in regard to agriculture and food particularly the EC Commission proposals on CAP reform and difficulties in the beef market.</P>
      <P>On 8 October 1991, accompanied by the Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Agriculture and Food, Labour and Social Welfare, I met the Central Review Committee to discuss the general economic and fiscal situation.  Because of commitments in Germany, the Minister for Finance was unable to attend.  Copies of the joint statements which issued after the meetings have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the parties to the programme have agreed that the current serious economic and financial difficulties can best be tackled through co-operative action.  In the light of the prospective outlook for next year, they have agreed that there would be a series of bilateral discussions at officials' level between the Government and the social partners.  These discussions which commenced this morning will examine in more detail the outlook for 1992 and the possibility of measures in the areas of taxation, employment, the stimulation of growth, etc., that might <Col N="68" /> be taken, with the co-operation of all parties, to ensure that there was no deterioration in the public finances while protecting the basic objectives of the programme to maintain the competitive and growing economy established since 1987 after years of stagnation and falling employment.</P>
    <P>In relation to the CAP reform proposals and the negotiations on CAP related GATT proposals, meetings, as agreed at the meeting on 31 July, have been held by the Government with the farming organisations at technical levels and there was a further meeting between the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the presidents of the organisations this morning to discuss all the matters at issue.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to establish a separate forum on jobs on the lines envisaged by Deputy Bruton.  The Task force on Employment, established last June, under the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> have met on 13 occasions and have submitted four reports to Government.</P>
    <P>The first report of the task force identified an estimated £1 billion of products and components which could be made in Ireland to meet the needs and specifications of multinational companies in Ireland.  This area for action is being pursued by two working groups of the task force.</P>
    <P>The second report of the task force recommended to the Government the provision of additional places in public and third level institutions and an extension of the HE grant scheme to private institutions subject to appropriate designation of the institutions and certification of courses.</P>
    <P>The third report of the task force proposed the initiation of a new job training scheme which would comprise combined training and work experience for up to 3,000 participants initially.  Employers would contribute £30 per participant per week towards a training allowance.  The balance of the allowance would be met by FÁS from the Vote of the Department of Labour and compensatory savings <Col N="69" /> would be achieved in the Vote of the Department of Social Welfare when participants come off the live register.</P>
    <P>The fourth report of the task force recommends a revision in the exemption limits for the imposition of stamp duty on new houses on the basis that this measure would provide an incentive to increased activity and employment in the construction and building materials industries.</P>
    <P>All the reports of the task force will be considered by the Government in the context of commitments under the programme and the public finances.  The publication of the reports of the task force is a matter for the Central Review Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the programme outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> for 1992 in regard to commitments of various kinds was based on the economy achieving a growth rate of 3 per cent in 1992. As I explained earlier, the growth rate we had hoped for in 1991 will not be achieved and the growth rate that we expect for 1992 is not likely to be achieved. On that basis it will not be possible for us to meet all the commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the budget as such is not yet in course of preparation.  What is happening at present &mdash; as the Deputy knows, this is what normally takes place at this time of the year &mdash; is that we are engaged in the examination of the <Col N="70" /> Estimates of expenditure.  I might mention that next year it is our intention to ensure that these Estimates can be examined in detail by the House, commencing with the budget right through to the summer recess.  That is the element of the budget which is now in course of preparation.</P>
      <P>With regard to all the different aspects of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> what is happening is that we are meeting with the social partners &mdash; at present these discussions are at official level &mdash; to outline fully the difficulties the Government will encounter in 1992 in regard to the commitments in the programme and to seek the contribution of all the social partners in resolving these difficulties.</P>

      <P>I have already explained that it is clear to us, and I think to everybody else, that the economic conditions which will prevail in 1992 will not permit us to fulfil our commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to the full.  We are now engaged in this process of discussion with the social partners to foresee how between us, the Government and all social partners, we can deal with this difficult situation. As I have said again and again, we will not be calling on any one sector to bear the brunt of the difficulties but we will expect all the social partners in some way to contribute to the solution of the difficulties.</P>

      <P>In relation to Questions Nos. 8 to 11, inclusive, may I ask the Taoiseach if the task force subgroups are expected to report soon, specifically the one in relation to import substitution or the provision of components to many of the multinationals who are at present importing their needs? May I ask him if there are any other job creation plans, as distinct from providing places at university and training places at FÁS, emanating from the task force in relation to job creation in the context of the actual provision of jobs which will provide a week's wages for those employed other than the import substitution proposal which we dealt with in this House before?  When I asked this question previously in June the Taoiseach was not able to give a precise idea as to how many jobs would be created by attempting to provide this £1 billion import substitution.  Does he have any idea now as to the number of jobs which will be provided through this process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to one of my other questions which deals with the pay element of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> on a previous occasion the Taoiseach indicated that he was conscious of the low paid workers in the public service and the public sector generally and said he did not need to be reminded by me of the fact that there were thousands of these people.  Does he intend, as might be implied from what he <Col N="72" /> is saying, to ensure at the very least that these low paid workers will get the increases they were promised under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and which have been deferred a number of times?</P>

I do not know when the two working groups on the components aspect will be in a position to report but they know the Government are anxious to get the results of their deliberations as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> I cannot say at this stage what is likely to emerge on any front, including pay, but I wish to indicate to the House that we are asking all the social partners to make a contribution to the solution of the difficulties. As I mentioned, we are also considering formulating a scheme whereby employers will take on additional employees directly.  That is the response to the Deputy's question on whether we have any measures directed towards the specific creation of immediate employment.  It is something we are turning our minds to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach appreciate the uncertainty he is creating in the business community by his constant references both in this House today and on radio programmes to all sectors being asked to contribute towards a solution and that many people who are considering investment interpret this as meaning changes in the corporate tax structure which will, of course, mean postponement of investment?  Does he also appreciate that canvassing for new business by the IDA has come to a virtual standstill because of the use of this phrase by him?  He has a responsibility, which I hope he recognises, to resolve this matter as quickly as possible in the interests of job creation.</P>

With regard to participation by Opposition parties, surely, this House is the place where they can put forward any proposals they wish.  This debate gives Deputies an opportunity to put forward any proposals for consideration and there are many other ways in which Opposition parties can submit any sort of proposals they wish.  We have, as I say, a number of organisations and agencies already involved in the whole question of job <Col N="75" /> creation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most disappointed with the Taoiseach's response to Deputy Bruton's Question No. 4 on the national jobs forum.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that the social partners basically comprise people who are in receipt of income whether as employees or employers and that the interests of over 250,000 unemployed people are inadequately represented in the social partners? Would he agree to reconsider his answer to this question?</P>

      <P>I take the Deputy's point about the need to hear views from the people who are unemployed but I believe we have adequate access to their views.  First of all, I do not think the Deputy would deny that the trade unions represent the unemployed as well as the employed.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is news to me if that is not so.  To a major extent, the unemployed are all members of trade unions.  Also we in the Government have quite a number of ways in which we have access to the views of the unemployed, and I think, in particular, we will get a valuable and useful response from our area-based employment pilot scheme.</P>

Given the serious level of unemployment, whatever contribution we have to make could be made in a far more constructive manner if we had the information available to us and if we could make an input in this House on this very important topic.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, in his reply, in regard to <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> indicated that all sectors would have to make a contribution to the resolution of the Government's financial problems and I think we would all support that.  Nevertheless, he went on to say in response to a supplementary question that the tax regime in regard to manufacturing industry would remain untouched.  May I ask him in what way will the rest of the community &mdash; other than the PAYE taxpayers and the unemployed who are all the time asked to make a contribution &mdash; the other sectors, be asked to make their contribution to rectifying the finances of the State?  In particular, I would ask him to address the question of a report in the papers which indicates that only 5,000 of the self-employed have declared income in excess of £20,000 to £25,000 per year, which seems an extraordinarily low number of people in that category.  Does he intend to address the tax system so that there is a fair return from all sectors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A fair return from all sectors is a total priority of this Government and I think we have given evidence of our desire to achieve that.  We have, <Col N="77" /> over the last three or four years, initiated enormous improvements in that regard. I think there is still room for further improvement.  As part of our preparations for the 1992 budget and in other regards we will certainly see what further steps we can take to maximise the return of revenue from all sectors of the community and particularly from those who, on the surface, would not appear to be contributing enough.  With regard to what way other sectors could contribute I have already mentioned that we would expect a contribution from the private sector employers on the side of employment. There is no doubt that the two programmes have created conditions for development and expansion in the private sector.  Regrettably, so far that development and expansion in the private sector has not given us anything like the expected return in jobs.  That is one area we will be specifically exploring with private sector employers as to how in the reasonably good economic climate which the programme has created they can provide more jobs.</P>

I would like to ask the Taoiseach if he is aware that this is a matter of serious public concern? I applaud the attempt to have a review and to bring forward a new programme. Can he explain what particular difficulties the parties in Government are having in relation to this review and, secondly, does he not consider that it is, to some extent, very difficult to have a debate in this House on confidence in the Government in the absence of this programme?

      <P>It is fair for me to say there are matters of significant importance which still have to be resolved.  I think it is fairly common knowledge from the newspapers that one of the areas in which we are engaged in a very earnest and real discussion and on which we have done a great deal of research, is the whole area of tax reform.  Anybody in this House knows that in regard to tax reform there are many different validly held views as to what is the best system.  In regard to taxation one has to take into account a number of qualities which any good taxation system should have: first, equity as between taxpayers, second, it should be a tax system which provides incentives for development and growth and job creation and various other aspects of that.  I do not think it is a debate <Col N="80" /> which is capable of any very quick, facile solution.  That is one of the areas in which we are engaged in a very earnest and sincere discussion.</P>

      <P>There is not.  The Deputy can take it that the Fianna Fáil sector of the Government have a very clear view on taxation and on the changes that we would like to see in that area. The Deputy will accept that there are valid grounds for genuine differences of opinion as to the ideal form of taxation, particularly in our circumstances where we have a major underlying budgetary difficulty in servicing every year a very large national debt.  A great deal of our revenue has to go to that purpose.  We also have a clear need to achieve a much higher level of economic development to provide job.  In our circumstances it is not easy to decide on the ideal form of taxation.  That is a very valid ground for discussion.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach would take the opportunity today to indicate what has been agreed between his part of the Government and the Progressive Democrats part of the Government. The Taoiseach says there is a number of areas still outstanding, one being taxation.  Apart from putting the document in the House, if it is finally agreed, would the Taoiseach provide for a debate on the programme in the House at the earliest possible opportunity?</P>

      <P>In the context of the very helpful and extensive reply he gave to Deputy Spring in relation to tax issues, could the Taoiseach expand on that and confirm that the Progressive Democrats are seeking to abolish mortgage tax relief?  The Taoiseach might indicate his party's attitude to that.  In the context of the discussions that have taken place, is it intended that this programme will repeat all the promises made about Dáil reform that were contained in the 1989 programme and which were to be implemented in December 1989 but which have not yet been implemented? Could the Taoiseach explain why any such proposals repeated in a new programme should be taken seriously?</P>

I cannot be expected to reply to specific aspects of the taxation reform programme.  Suffice it to say that there is a comprehensive examination being carried out.  With regard to Dáil reform, the Deputy knows that that is primarily a matter for all parties in the House, through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but the Deputy can be assured that there will be considerable proposals in that regard in the programme.</P>

I would not like to venture an opinion on it but in my view the dreadful situation which has emerged could not be attributed to anybody other than the people directly engaged in these awful campaigns.

      <P>It is appropriate to join with other Deputies who have declared that they are appalled by the assassinations being carried out by various sectarian gangs, both Nationalist and Loyalist.  May I ask the Taoiseach if he would consider it of benefit if the democratic parties in Northern Ireland recommenced their discussions as a means of filling the political vacuum which exists there?  There is little doubt that once it is seen that the democratic parties in Northern Ireland are hidebound or inactive in some way the sectarian gangs become very active.  That has been the experience over many years now.  It would be helpful if the Taoiseach encouraged the parties in Northern Ireland, without apportioning blame in any way as to responsibility, to engage in talks.  Such encouragement coming from the Taoiseach would be of help in starting to fill the political vacuum which exists.  May I also ask him if he is aware of the statements which emanated from the Tory Conference in Blackpool last week which seemed to indicate a drift towards the greater integration of Northern Ireland with the United Kingdom rather than a move down the road of seeking to establish a devolved Government?</P>

I believe it represents the best possibility for progress.  I also believe that the general format of the discussions which was worked out after a lot of agonising was a good workable formula.

      <P>May I first join with other speakers in sympathising with the relatives of those who have lost their lives in Northern Ireland during the past week in the pointless set of tit for tat killings?  If there is anything anybody in this House can do, not alone should we wish to do it to save lives but it is our responsibility to do it.  In relation to the talks, would the Taoiseach not agree that both the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and himself have not been helpful in allowing the impression to be given that the British general election in some way will dictate when these talks will recommence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two constitutional parties in Northern Ireland who are willing to sit down today to continue the talks process. However, two other parties &mdash; the Official Unionists and the Democratic <Col N="91" /> Unionists &mdash; see the British general election as an opportunity to postpone talks. The Taoiseach in his broadcast on 22 September, and prior to that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, have managed to give the impression that the British general election &mdash; which at that time was supposed to be taking place this side of Christmas and would dictate when the talks would recommence &mdash; will not now take place until next May.  Those talks &mdash; and the Taoiseach and Secretary of State have left the door open in this regard &mdash; may not now commence until next June which certainly does not indicate any sense of urgency in regard to putting in place in the North some kind of political institution to which both communities can show their allegiance.  Will the Taoiseach agree that it is his responsibility, the responsibility of his Government, and that of the British Government, to withdraw the encouragement they gave to some parties to stay away from the table until after the next British general election?  Will the Taoiseach get those talks under way as quickly as possible and bring an end to the violence in the North?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the Secretary of State or I in any way indicated that the talks should not resume until after the general election.  At that time the likelihood of a British general election was a practical difficulty; there is no point in being unrealistic about these matters.  If political parties were preparing for a general election they were not likely to be prepared to enter into fuller discussions.  However, since then the matter has been advanced as far as possible, the Secretary of State has been talking to party leaders in Northern Ireland and discussing the possibilities with the Minister for Foreign Affairs here through the Intergovernmental Conference. We are in many ways clearly indicating our wish that the process should recommence as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Can the Taoiseach give any indication to the House that those talks <Col N="92" /> will commence this month?  It is essential that these people get round a table and devise a formula among themselves, acceptable to all, which would allow the Government to negotiate some replacement for the Anglo-Irish Agreement?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would strongly support an early resumption of the talks, in fact I said in response to a suggestion by Deputy Spring, that we would encourage an early resumption of the dialogue process.  However, the Deputy will understand that it must involve all the parties.  If some of the parties are not willing to participate there is not very much we can do about it except to continue to express our interest in participating in further talks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the British Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Kevin McNamara, on behalf of his party has indicated that, notwithstanding any possible change of Government, the incoming Labour Administration would support the Brooke Initiative?  They are anxious that talks should not be delayed or stalled because of a possible change of Government either before Christmas or as now seems probable &mdash; in May.  Having regard to that, will he undertake to directly request the British authorities to convey that political position to the four parties, because there must be four parties to the talks in Northern Ireland to ensure that those talks commence without delay? Will the Taoiseach further agree that there is a perception among some of the Unionist Party supporters that a change of Government, with an uncertain composition, might be to their advantage?  If there was an advantage it would certainly not be in relation to Northern Ireland. Will the Taoiseach undertake a pro-active policy by his Government to getting these talks started before May? Otherwise we will simply have more sectarian murders &mdash; I do not regard them as assassinations.</P>

I am sure that it helps to advance the situation and encourage people to proceed.  With regard to our Government taking a pro-active stance, I claim that we are already doing that.  First, we have indicated our full support for a resumption; secondly, we have indicated our willingness to take part immediately; thirdly, we have fully supported the Secretary of State's decision to talk to party leaders in Northern Ireland; and, fourthly, we have had discussions with the Secretary of State on the whole question of how the talks could be restarted, again indicating to him our full support for anything that could be done to restart the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 47 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>The legislation and, where relevant, memorandum and articles of association governing the State-sponsored bodies under my aegis set out the accountability, control and methods of reporting of the boards of these bodies.  The legislation stipulates that for items such as major capital expenditure, increases in borrowing limits or the establishment of subsidiaries, the prior sanction of both the Minister for Finance and myself is required.  In the case, for example, of legislation in respect of the Electricity Supply Board, Bord na Móna, Nuclear Energy Board, Coillte Teoranta and Bord Gáis Éireann these matters were recently brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas for passage into law.</P>
      <P>The question of managerial practices and codes of standards in State-sponsored bodies are matters for the boards and senior management of these organisations. I am aware that these matters are fully addressed through a combination of requirements of legislation, provisions in memoranda and articles of association and systems of codified company circulars.  These codes of conduct set out standards, authority levels, systems, procedures and controls which govern all matters of financial control, accounting, procurement, contracting, income and expenditure control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to conflicts of interest at board level, the boards of the Energy <Col N="98" /> State-sponsored bodies apply the following broad rules: where any board member, otherwise than in his/her capacity as a director, is in any way whether directly or indirectly interested in a matter he or she shall at the meeting disclose to the company the fact of such interest and the nature thereof. The board member shall not take part in any deliberations of the meeting relating to such matter save to the extent as the chairman may permit.  In such instances the board member shall not vote on a decision relating to the matter.  Any such disclosure shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to doubt that the legislation governing these bodies together with their internal systems of control are adequate with regard to the Energy State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>I would not wish to prejudice the proceedings of the various inquiries currently underway other than to say that any improvements in this regard which comes of these inquiries will be implemented by my Department.</P>
    <P>A review is currently being carried out by the Minister for Finance concerning the principles which govern the relationship between Departments of State and the State-bodies under their aegis together with subsidiary and associated companies which take account of the procedures at present in place.  I expect that this review will be completed in the near future and I am open to any suggestions for improvement in this area.  My Department have examined recently the arrangements in place in relation to each of the State bodies concerned and are not aware of any incidents which give rise to concern.  Nevertheless, I am conveying to the chairmen of each State-sponsored body under my aegis the Government's concern and requesting a written assurance that the desired standards of conduct and the highest levels of personal integrity are being followed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I note from what the Minister has said that he is carrying out the review.  May I ask him in that context if he considers that it is within the code <Col N="99" /> of standards that board members of State companies may also be members of boards of subsidiary companies of the main State company, having regard to the fact that as members of the State company they receive a fee of approximately £800 per annum and in some cases as members of the subsidiary board they may receive fees of £5,000 per annum? I would like the Minister's view as to whether that is within the code of standards as he would like to see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it is only in recent times that legislation has been enacted here which empowers semi-State bodies, certainly in the energy area, to form subsidiary bodies, and some of them have done so.  The practice to which the Deputy referred of appointing persons to the subsidiary boards, be they directors of the main board or senior management of the company, has resulted in a position where some of the controls that apply to the parent board, the semi-State body, may not in all cases apply to the subsidiary body.  This is a matter which is at present under examination. The instance given by the Deputy of directors of subsidiary boards being paid sums in excess of that which is allowable to the parent company is a matter about which I am concerned and I am having examined at present.</P>

I only have to look at the front page of this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> to check on that matter.  The matter which the Deputy has raised has been brought to my attention.  I have inquired about it and I am satisfied through my investigations that it does not require any further examination by me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>The total amount paid to NCB was £662,000 and withholding tax of £170,000 was deducted from this amount at the time of payment.  The amount also included VAT of £132,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, of course, normal practice in the Department of Energy to appoint consultants or financial advisers after a competitive process in which price, track record, specific expertise are all taken into account.  For the sale of the State's 25 per cent shareholding in Tara, however, competitive tenders were not sought.  I am informed that the reason for this at the time was that there were very specific legal and tactical reasons, arising from the original 1975 Agreement with Tara, that no hint should in any way be given to the majority shareholders as to the Government's intentions.  These reasons have been made public in great detail at a number of meetings of the Public Accounts Committee and indeed as recently as 6 June this year when there <Col N="102" /> was a specific debate in this covering the issue arising from the second interim report of the Committee of Public Accounts on the Appropriation Accounts 1987.</P>
    <P>The view was taken at the time that a public tendering process would send a clear signal of the State's intentions and would have quickly weakened the Department's negotiating position.  This would have put the State and ultimately the taxpayer at a clear disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In the event, therefore, the financial advisers were selected on the basis of qualitative criteria; in particular it is important to recall that NCB are the largest independent corporate finance and stockbroking house in Ireland without an association with a bank or other financial institution.  There was, therefore, no potential conflict of interest arising from the existing or past lending relationships with Tara, its parent Outokumpu and associated companies.</P>
    <P>I see no reason to change the standard procedures for the engagement of consultants by my Department.  The normal practice for any Government Department is the competitive process which I have already described.  Indeed an upcoming EC directive on public procurement is likely to make our practice mandatory. The decision to depart from the practice for the sale of the State's shareholding in Tara was taken by the then Minister in the very particular circumstances which surround this complex transaction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of issues arise here.  The Minister has addressed the issue of how the contract was given out without going to tender, a legal and complex issue, but no one can judge that. Would the Minister say whether the Minister made the decision himself or was it made by Government?  Second, in his reply the Minister did not address the scale of the fee paid to NCB who got this contract &mdash; I take it from his reply that the company got a net figure of £492,000. Would he agree that the average fee for such a job would be about £120,000, which is a very substantial fee indeed? <Col N="103" /> Would he give some indication why such an enormous fee was given in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have already answered the question.  My information is that the Minister made the decision, but I was not there.  The Deputy asks why the fee was so large but the relevant question is whether value was received for the money paid.  The services rendered by NCB were way beyond what would be involved in a normal brokerage transaction.  It was unique in that it required sustained input and advice on the approach, the valuation, internationl commodity prices and a large amount of legal work together with intensive work at the negotiation stages.  From January 1988 NCB Corporate Finance Limited gave a full working commitment to a review of the Minister's rights and powers under the State-Tara shareholding agreement and mining lease and detailed financial analysis of Tara's performance and future prospects.</P>
      <P>The main component of the work done by NCB in the first half of 1988, aside from the strategic advice on the emerging positioning by the Department relative to Outokumpu, was the preparation of a preliminary report of the State's objectives and expectations in the sale negotiations. This involved an exhaustive review of the company's operations, up-to-date research into the zinc and lead metals and concentrate market, currency exchange rate forecasts, operating costs and revenue estimates.  The approach called for widespread and discreet discussions with Department officials and other sectoral interests in Ireland and overseas.  This work culminated in the building of computer models to value the State's shareholding in Tara Mines.  The fee reflected all this work.</P>

      <P>The Minister raises the question of value for money, but how are we to judge that?  I do not think anybody but the Minister at the time, and possibly the current Minister, believes that the £35 million paid for the State's interest in Tara Mines represents value <Col N="104" /> for money.  The State never got a penny out of it for over 20 years, but sold its stake for £35 million; that is all the State ever got.  That is not value for money. The justification for a fee of three times the norm to the company that sold our stake has not been explained.  The Minister gave a long, detailed and complex statement which is all we got in regard to Tara Mines for all those years.  I have been questioning this every six months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of course with hindsight one can argue whether the fee structure might have been different.  The fee was based on 1½ per cent of the total price for the State's share plus VAT.  The <i>ad valorem</i> fee structure, in the Minister's view, gave the company the incentive to achieve the maximum return to the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>Before I recommence, may I inform the House and seek their <Col N="475" /> agreement to the fact that I will speak on behalf of the Labour Party but that my colleague, Deputy Spring, will be the main speaker?  He will take the 45 minutes tomorrow or the next day and I propose to take the 25 minutes now. Accordingly I calculate that I have approximately 23 minutes left.</P>
      <P>As I was saying before we went into that most illuminating period of questions and answers, this country needs a new beginning and a new direction if it is to tackle the major social and economic problems that confront it.  A start must be made with the Government &mdash; they simply must go.  The Government are tired, dispirited and divided.  The two parties in Government no longer trust themselves or each other.  The Ministers no longer trust the Taoiseach and the backbenchers no longer trust their Ministers. Instead of a clear and decisive Government led by a Cabinet of energetic and well-moded Ministers, we have a cluster of politicians who are cowering in a Cabinet bunker, unsure of what they will meet outside and incapable of dealing with what they find inside.  The Cabinet are clinging to office by their fingernails, desperate to remain in power, yet incapable of governing.  The struggle for power within this beleagured coalition has now been superseded by the race for power within Fianna Fáil itself. Indeed, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I gather that that race has now started as and from this afternoon.  Already the first blood has been drawn by the four picadors, who have irreparably damaged the credibility and the standing of their party leader, the Taoiseach, by the wounding comments and declarations of no confidence they have proclaimed both in public and in private.  It is clear that Fianna Fáil have lost the confidence of their own supporters among the public and that the Taoiseach has lost the confidence of his own backbenchers in the Dáil.  If the Taoiseach was depending on the level of applause that greeted the finale of his speech this afternoon then he most certainly has lost their confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the past four months the nation has experienced the high drama of ongoing discussions, not yet concluded, between the coalition partners concerning their detailed and agonised negotiations about a new Programme for Government, which still remains inconclusive.  Perhaps the timing of its finale is related to the Dublin Theatre Festival, for which the Taoiseach, as Minister for culture, has some responsibility.  Indeed, properly scripted and carefully choreographed, the events of the past few weeks could have been submitted by the Government press officer &mdash; otherwise known as &ldquo;Mara&rdquo; on certain radio programmes, a fictional character, I hasten to say &mdash; as their contribution to Samuel Beckett's <i>Theatre of the Absurd.</i> It would undoubtedly be a drama of high farce if it were not such a tragedy for the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>This country has lost its way simply because the Government leading it no longer know where they are, what they are doing or where they are going.  There could be no more savage indictment of the incompetence of the present management of the economy by this Government than the comprehensive results of the survey of business opinion published last Sunday in the <i>Sunday Business Post.</i> Members are now being asked to vote confidence in a Government which itself, even as I speak, has not agreed its own programme for the rest of this session and for the next three years.  Confidence in what and for what, that is the question.</P>
    <P>The Government, who repeatedly proclaimed the miracles of their own economic success in the vain hope that they would be sustained if the lie of their so-called success was repeated often enough, have now lost the confidence of the very sector that they claim to lead.  In the Taoiseach's own words, we now have &ldquo;an appalling economic crisis&rdquo;.  That was some miracle that has now been transformed into &ldquo;an appalling economic crisis&rdquo;.  Is it any wonder that dissatisfaction with the Government and their performance has increased among the business community from 18 per cent <Col N="477" /> in June to 58 per cent in September or that pessimism about the performance of the economy has increased from 65 per cent in June to 81 per cent in September? It should be underlined that those figures represent the views of people who are currently at work.</P>
    <P>It must also be recognised that unemployment has increased to its highest level ever in the history of this State. What has been the Government's response?  It has blamed our birth rate. It has come up with the reason that some Irish emigrants had the timidity and the temerity to want to return home.  It is perhaps symbolic that a member of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, as his contribution to the national endeavour, personally flew, courtesy of Aeroflot &mdash; that is some irony &mdash; across the Atlantic to lodge 2,000 applications for Morrison visas in Virginia in the United States.</P>
    <P>The House should pass a vote of no confidence in the Government because the people who are trying to make our economy work no longer have confidence in the Government's ability to manage the economy and oversee our affairs.  The Labour Party have always recognised that economic growth is essential if we are to achieve the targets set out by our own policies and, indeed, the targets set out in the original <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>We do not blame the Minister for Finance for the continued recession in either the United States or Great Britain.  We blame the Minister for Agriculture and Food for many things, but we do not blame him for the continued crisis in relation to the GATT talks or for the current shape of the MacSharry proposals. Nor do we blame the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications for the shortfall in the numbers of tourists coming to this country across the North Atlantic.  But we do blame each and every one of them for not reading the signs soon enough and for not listening to the valid criticisms of the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party and every other party on the Opposition benches in this House and of every economic commentator outside the House.  Ireland has <Col N="478" /> had a deaf and dumb Government that will not listen and cannot speak.</P>
    <P>The figures provided by the Minister for Finance in the January budget were wrong.  He rejected criticisms when challenged not only by himself but also by others.  When the Minister for Finance introduced the Finance Bill last April to give effect to that January budget the figures he provided then were also wrong. When challenged, he again rejected our criticisms.  Despite repeated challenges to restate a new course for economic management in the light of the facts that were then available to him and his Department, the Minister for Finance and his Government resolutely stuck their heads in the sand and refused to listen and refused to speak.  However, within days, virtually within hours, of the Dáil going into recess &mdash; if not recession &mdash; the Department of Finance published their economic review and outlook for 1991.  Lo and behold, suddenly they had seen the light.  If that is democratic, accountable government, then this is some other place and I am not living here, because we are not in fact dealing in the real world at all, and that is why this Government do not deserve the confidence of this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced in July &mdash; after the Dáil had gone into recess, after we had adjourned for three months &mdash; a package of cuts in Government expenditure amounting to about £100 million. No adequate information was given in relation to the cuts, to where the savings were to be achieved or to how the services that they underpinned could be either replaced or maintained.  An impressario's magic wand was waved over the &ldquo;temporary little difficulties&rdquo; of the budget in the midst of a summer recess.</P>
    <P>The Government in general and the Minister for Finance in particular have frequently lauded the contribution made by the social partners, in the trade unions in particular, through the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and its successor the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> towards economic stability, wage restraint and industrial harmony.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="479" /> However, within weeks, in July, a ten-year strategy with its three-year initial programme was arbitrarily abandoned with the dismissive and irresponsible assertion by the Minister for Finance that the Government could not and would not pay a proportion of the public sector pay bill which was to fall due in 1992, notwithstanding its commitments, undertakings and promises.</P>
    <P>The elaborate process of discussion, dialogue and consultation between the social partners, as orchestrated and manipulated by the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil, was exposed for what it is, a sham designed to con the public into thinking that the trade unions had become subservient, that the public sector could be taken for a ride in hard times, by denying them the legitimate pay increases awarded them by the arbitrator, and in good times proclaiming that yet again they must wait until the really good times had finally arrived.  The really good times did arrive late this summer for a small specially privileged group of people in our society who had repeatedly told the Government and the rest of us that investment and job creation could not come about until the right climate had been created.  Well, ordinary workers did create the right climate as they saw it but the jobs have not materialised.  A few very unrepresentative people in the business community have benefited uniquely from their close position to the centres of power and from political influence.</P>
    <P>After 16 weeks of recess, on our first day back in this democratic Assembly, I want to put on the record of the House that the Irish people feel betrayed and sullied by the way in which our affairs have been managed by this Government over the past 16 weeks.  Clearly the Irish people have lost confidence in the ability of this Government to run our nation's affairs.  The Minister for Finance should have convened, through the proper channels a comprehensive meeting of the social partners to review the progress of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in the light of new national and <Col N="480" /> international economic circumstances but he did not.  Instead he casually announced &mdash; which seems to be the new style of this Coalition Government &mdash; in the course of a Sunday radio news programme to thousands of low paid public sector workers throughout the State, that lo and behold, they would not be paid the increases they had been awarded and which they had confidently expected would be paid in January 1992. It was obvious from the concern and panic among his Cabinet colleagues, the Minister for Labour and the Taoiseach's own spokesperson, they realised that irreparable damage had been done and that some rescue operation should be put in place.  But no rescue operation has been put in place because this Government no longer have the ability to mount that kind of operation.</P>
    <P>In Brussels in less than eight weeks there will be the finalisation of the two treaties that will determine the future of this nation for the rest of this century but this Assembly does not know what the Irish Government are saying.  Neither does anybody in Brussels, Strasbourg or indeed in the European Parliament itself. Because Fianna Fáil are impoverished on the stage of European politics they are frightened at the prospect of more democratic powers being given to that Assembly. We are about to trade a major portion of our sovereignty into two treaties that will determine the ability of this economy to improve the life of every citizen.  We simply do not know what the Minister for Finance is saying at the EMU discussions or what the Minister for Foreign Affairs is saying at the EPU discussions.  There is no democratic accountability to this Chamber.  The Government are simply waiting, cowering in the corridors of Brussels, hoping that at the end of this entire process some extra funds will be put into the Structural Funds basket that will enable Ministers to come scurrying home and announce to all and sundry that they have got a few rich crumbs from the European table.</P>
    <P>If that is what 1916 was about, if that is what 70 years of sovereignty is about, then I want nothing from it from the <Col N="481" /> soldiers of destiny because that is not what brought the Labour Party into politics or indeed any other party in this democratic Assembly.  We can do better than that.  We have a view of Europe; we have a view of this nation, of our history and future.  It is being sullied, frustrated and betrayed by the Fianna Fáil Coalition Government of all the talents.  There is no economic miracle in this country: there is economic impoverishment.  There is no democratic accountability: there is Government by secrecy and cabal.  There is no European vision.  There is a Celtic mist of the past, outlined by a man on a white horse who was afraid to dismount for fear that Tír na nAosta would turn into ashes.  I say to the Taoiseach, wherever he is, that it is no longer Tír na nÓg. He no longer represents the people who will grow up and be citizens of his island because he has lost touch &mdash; as have his Government &mdash; with this nation, with its heart and future.  He has lost the confidence of the people.  To coin a phrase from another Chamber, in God's name, go.</P>

      <P>For the second year in succession the opening of the Dáil year is dominated by a confidence motion in the Government.  Last year the issue was the standards people could expect from those in Government.  The issue again this year is about standards &mdash; of those in Government, those in semi-State companies and in private business. However, the difference is that this year the debate takes place against a background of a deteriorating economic situation, record unemployment levels and television pictures of tens of thousands of young Irish people battling for visas to give them hope of a new life and a job in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have been stunned, shocked and sickened by the revelations of sharp practice, malpractice, downright dishonesty and corruption which have emerged. Day after day we have had more disclosures which have thrown new light on the operation of what has been referred to as the &ldquo;golden circle&rdquo;.  The operation of such a group had been well <Col N="482" /> known. Certainly, The Workers' Party had pointed to it repeatedly.  However, what has emerged for the first time in the past two months has revealed in all its ugliness the level of their greed and the ruthless nature of their activities.  We have seen a world in which greed is God, where the pursuit of even greater profits seems to justify the use of virtually any means, in which this small elite &mdash; and it is a small elite &mdash; appeared to believe that they had the political connections necessary to render themselves immune from the normal regulatory and supervisory procedures to protect the public interest.</P>
    <P>Greencore, Telecom, Celtic Helicopters, Carysfort, NCB &mdash; the list of questions is virtually endless, the answers from Government virtually non-existent. The Government and responsible Ministers have failed utterly to respond to questions about what they knew, about the manner in which they supervised semi-State companies for which they were responsible.  They have withdrawn into their Ministerial bunkers and refused to answer the people.  As head of Government the Taoiseach has a particular responsibility to the public for all of these scandals but he, too, has gone to ground. His decision to transfer to other Ministers virtually all questions relating to these scandals, where they relate specifically to statements made or actions carried out by him, is the latest indication that he is determined that if the buck is to stop anywhere certainly it will not stop with him.</P>
    <P>These scandals are a sad reflection of the value system of some of those at the top of business and politics in this country.  Nobody who knew what was going on in Irish society will have been surprised at the improper activities of some of those who were involved in the Greencore and other affairs.  Perhaps the most surprising thing is that the improper activities have become public knowledge. To date those involved normally have managed to successfully hide their trail. I predict that what we have seen so far is only the tip of the iceberg of corruption <Col N="483" /> and improper activities now prevalent in some sectors of private business which, unfortunately is also eating into the public sector.</P>
    <P>After 70 years of independence it is time to examine our values and priorities as a society.  Despite the high-sounding principles of the 1916 Proclamation and the fine aspirations of the democratic programme of the First Dáil we live in a Republic in which an individual's rank and status in society is determined by the amount of personal wealth he or she can accumulate.  Indeed in Ireland the greatest prestige seems to attach to wealth accumulated in the least socially valuable way.  Land rezonings, property speculation, asset stripping, offshore companies, the use of inside information, access to political pull, the &ldquo;stroke&rdquo;, tax avoidance schemes, these seem to be the favourite routes to financial success rather than the creation of jobs or added value products which could be of benefit to the wider community.  It is a culture that ensures that job creation is at the bottom of the list, a culture which ensures that we have a parasitic economy, denying the rights of thousands of our people to a job, ensuring that investment will be in asset stripping rather than in the protection and creation of jobs.  The dominant political parties in this country have bestowed their blessing on wealth accumulated in this way.  This is especially so in the case of Fianna Fáil, who have encouraged and benefited from the stroke culture.  We are now paying the price for this attitude, with the reputation of Ireland abroad being badly damaged and political confidence at home eroded.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that those who blew the whistle are blamed for the damage to our reputation.  Those to blame are the ones who engage in these activities.  What we need, perhaps, as well as a code for politicians and for business is a code for the protection of whistle blowers.  They have done this country a favour by dragging into the light of day the activities we have heard about in the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> The first of the recent scandals to come to the attention of the public was the Greencore affair.  Greencore is particularly significant, not just because it opened the floodgates in regard to the other affairs but because many of the elements at the centre of it also feature in the other affairs &mdash; issues of honesty, of what is or is not an acceptable level of profit, the adequacy of company law, the use of devices such as offshore companies to disguise the real ownership of companies, the role of semi-State companies and the adequacy of ministerial supervision of the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>We are of course aware that various inquiries have been set up into the Greencore affair, but there are many questions which could and should have been answered by the Government and especially by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, without having to await the outcome of any inquiry by any Inspector. When did the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, first become aware that a number of Irish Sugar executives had acquired a 49 per cent minority shareholding in Sugar Distributors (Holdings) Limited? When did he first become aware that this purchase had been partly funded by a soft loan given to the executives by the company?  When did he first become aware of the subsequent resale of the shareholding to the Irish Sugar Company at a six-fold profit to the executives involved?  Was Deputy O'Kennedy, as the Minister with overall responsibility for the Sugar Company, consulted regarding the purchase of the Sugar Distributors shareholding, and did he approve of it?  When did he first become aware of a claim by Mr. Chris Comerford to beneficial ownership of a substantial shareholding in Talmino Limited?</P>
    <P>As my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, pointed out at the time, only days before the Greencore affair broke, the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, was only too glad to make himself available to the press to lecture the public about his views on morality, and particularly about the age at which condoms should be made available to young people &mdash; an issue which had nothing to do with his Department at <Col N="485" /> all.  But when the questions arose about Greencore, the Minister was suddenly unavailable, declining all invitations to appear on radio or television programmes, and refusing to answer all questions, even when cornered by journalists at the public functions he could not avoid.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, had plenty to say about the morality of making condoms available to 16 year olds, but he had nothing to say about the morality of a group of senior semi-State executives acquiring a shareholding in Sugar Distributors, and then selling it back to their employers at a six-fold profit.  The Minister had nothing to say about the propriety of executives of State companies setting up covert companies in tax havens like Jersey.  The Minister, like many of his colleagues, seems to relate to sexual matters only.</P>
    <P>In a Cabinet where mediocrity is the norm, with a few honorable exceptions, and incompetence taken for granted, the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, stands head and shoulders below the rest.  His handling of the Agriculture portfolio has been characterised by bungling and evasion. He is probably the most evasive of Government Ministers when it comes to replying to Dáil questions.  Even when he has nothing to hide, he sounds as if he has.  He persistently refused to acknowledge any allegations of irregularities in the beef industry &mdash; even as he announced the setting up of the Tribunal of Inquiry &mdash; yet only two weeks ago he was forced to send his inspectors, accompanied by armed gardaí, into a number of Goodman owned plants.</P>
    <P>He criticised Deputies who raised legitimate questions about the use of substances like angel dust and tried to downplay the whole problem, before eventually being forced to admit the dangers involved and take some remedial action.  He insisted on ramming the Bill to privatise the Irish Sugar Company through the Dáil, using the guillotine to curtail the debate at every Stage, and we are now paying the price for this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> I do not intend to deal in detail with the other scandals, which my colleagues will be speaking of during the course of this debate.  However, I would like to make a few points about Telecom and the Ballsbridge site, because it symbolises much of what is rotten in Irish society and especially much of what is rotten in Irish business.  It is an episode which proves that business strokes kill jobs.  I would remind the House of the 500 Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien workers, who lost their jobs with the closure of the bakery in 1989 and who are, in many respects, the forgotten victims of the scandal surrounding the sale of the Ballsbridge site.  This whole episode illustrates once again the ruthless nature of some of those at the top of Irish business who are quite prepared to destroy jobs and livelihoods in the pursuit of huge profits.</P>
    <P>The bakery was put into liquidation in February 1989 although its parent company, Odlums, was making substantial profits at the time.  When the sale was originally announced it was supposed to be part of a plan by the company to move to a new custom built premises.  This was never proceeded with and a liquidator was appointed by the company only months later.  There must now be serious doubts as to whether the new premises was ever a serious proposal, as the parent company declined an offer of a management buy-out to keep it in operation. It seems far more likely that the parent company simply decided that its most valuable asset was the site, which was put up for grabs to the highest bidder.</P>
    <P>While there are many questions remaining to be answered about the progress of the site from ownership by Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien, through the various deals to its eventual purchase by Telecom Éireann, what is very clear is that substantial profits were made along the way by a number of individuals.  A small group of wealthy people have got even wealthier.  A profit of more than £4 million, probably tax free, was made in just 18 months.  But what has happened to the 500 bakery workers?  How many are still unemployed?  How many have been <Col N="487" /> forced to emigrate?  How many families have been broken and lives destroyed by the resulting stress?  These are the real casualties of these scandals.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the experience of the Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien workers is not unusual in Irish society.  Too often we have seen the asset strippers move in and dispose of premises, plant and equipment without any consideration for the workers involved.  What is more, as I said earlier, the dominant political parties in this country have bestowed their blessing on wealth accumulated in this way.</P>
    <P>One common element in most of the recent controversies has been the firm of National City Brokers.  NCB is no stranger to controversy &mdash; there was considerable disquiet in 1989 over the manner in which it was awarded the contract for handling the privatisation of the Government's shareholding in Tara Mines.  The contract was not put out to tender and many people believe that what NCB was paid for their work was about three times the going rate for the job.</P>
    <P>But it is really because of their role in the affairs which have come to light in the past few weeks that NCB have come under close scrutiny.  It was, of course, NCB which advised the Irish Sugar Company on privatisation, and which either failed to notice the Sugar Distributors deal or else did it not consider it important enough to bring it to anyone's attention.  It was NCB which one of the firms commissioned to carry out a study of the prospects of privatisation of Telecom Éireann &mdash; Mr. Smurfit said that the Government had requested the study, the Minister, Deputy Brennan, said he knew nothing about it.  It was NCB which established the firm of United Property Holdings, which played a central role in the various deals involving the Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien site &mdash; a site which eventually cost Telecom Éireann more than twice the price it had been sold for 18 months earlier.  It was NCB which, according to Mr. Smurfit, failed to <Col N="488" /> advise him that UPH once owned the Ballsbridge site and it was NCB which was involved in the leaking of confidential commercial and financial information about Irish Helicopters to a rival helicopter firm in which the Taoiseach's son was a partner, in circumstances that still have to be adequately explained.  Certainly the claims of a postal misdelivery are unconvincing and the full story has still to be established.  It is not good enough for Aer Lingus to claim that a briefcase was not involved &ldquo;as is alleged&rdquo;.  What we want to know is whether a briefcase was involved.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that I decided to make public details of a document which came into my possession which provides startling new evidence of the special relationship between National City Brokers and Fianna Fáil in government. In the document, NCB cite &ldquo;intervention at the highest level&rdquo;, &ldquo;the use of personal contacts at the highest level, including the Minister for Finance and the Secretaries of the Departments of the Taoiseach and Industry and Commerce&rdquo;, and the use of favours from &ldquo;political contacts&rdquo; to justify a huge fee of £2 million charged to one of its commercial clients.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will now know the document in question is a letter written to Pernod Ricard in France (for whom NCB acted in the takeover of Irish Distillers) dated 6 January 1989 and signed by Mr. Dermot Desmond.  It raises very serious questions about the relationship between NCB and the Government and political figures.  I will read this letter on to the record of the House so that there is no ambiguity about its contents.</P>
    <P>It is on NCB notepaper and it is addressed to Thierry Jacquillat, Director General, Societe Pernod Ricard.  It reads:</P>
    <P>Dear Thierry,</P>
    <P>It was a pleasure to see you again yesterday.</P>
    <P>As you wish to give some further consideration to NCB's fees, I thought it might be helpful if I summarised the factors which we reviewed both during our meeting and over a most enjoyable <Col N="489" /> lunch.</P>
    <P>The first point I would reiterate is that our fee estimate of IR£2 million is put forward in the spirit of honesty and openness in which we acted for Pernod-Ricard throughout the takeover battle.  It was not conceived as an exaggerated opening position with a view to bargaining, but as a very basic and modest estimate of the value of our contribution to the success of Pernod-Ricard's acquisition of IDG.  I honestly expected you to accept it as such, giving you the opportunity to offer more.</P>
    <P>From the outset our sole intention was to create value for Pernod-Ricard and our fee structure was based on this principle.  If Pernod-Ricard had not succeeded in acquiring IDG, we would not have made any charge.  I enclose a copy of a Memo sent to Robert Woodroffe of Societe Generale dated 13th September indicating this.</P>
    <P>You are in a better position to judge our value in relation to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) Strategy.</P>
    <P>(b)  Negotiating with FII and Irish Life.</P>
    <P>(c)  Obtaining irrevocables in excess of 50%.</P>
    <P>(d)  Our Interaction with the Irish Media.</P>
    <P>We made sure that the Irish media started and finished as supporters of the Pernod-Ricard bid and added greatly to its credibility as far as the media and the public were concerned.</P>
    <P>(e)  Our involvement in the High Court proceedings and similarly in the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>(f)  Our contribution in relation to the Takeover Panel proceedings.</P>
    <P>(g)  Our Passion for Victory.</P>
    <P>Throughout the whole process we bullied and policed every other party involved, from lawyers to tax experts and ensured that we either got a high quality service from them, or else effectively supplied it ourselves.</P>
    <P>We feel that our fee is justified on the basis of the contributions listed above, but I think that there is further justification if you look at the following, <Col N="490" /> which is specific to NCB.</P>
    <P>1.  At the outset, our conception of the share purchase alternative and our success in backing it with a strong tax counsel's opinion had a major strategic importance in getting the bid price set as low as £4.50.</P>
    <P>2.  But for our intervention at the highest levels in connection with the Monopolies and Mergers decision, it is certain that Pernod-Ricard would have been constrained to dispose of one or more brands and that GC &amp; C would have been allowed to acquire in excess of 30%.</P>
    <P>3.  We orchestrated entirely the successful campaign to get a positive tax opinion from the Revenue Commissioners which involved using personal contacts at the highest level, including the Minister for Finance and the Secretaries of the Department of the Taoiseach and Department of Industry and Commerce.  Our success had a major impact in undermining FII's credibility in Court.</P>
    <P>In relation to 2 we consider that the impact of the decision which would not have been obtained without our involvement is at least worth a fee of £2 million.</P>
    <P>Finally, there were indirect costs to NCB because of our total commitment to Pernod-Ricard and yourself.  I as Chief Executive was responsible for taking this decision.</P>
    <P>At a more fundamental level, we put NCB's reputation and position in the Irish markets at risk throughout the campaign, yet we did not draw back at any stage.  Nor did we put a cash price on our continued involvement in the battle at any stage even though we were putting our entire business at risk.</P>
    <P>Over a three month period the entire commitment of NCB's top management team was solely devoted to ensuring the success of the Pernod-Ricard bid.  As a result, in that period other major business opportunities were let go.  I will give just one example &mdash; although advisers to GPA we lost the opportunity to do a £167 million private placing of GPA shares with <Col N="491" /> Irish institutions.  This cost us almost £1 million in commissions.</P>
    <P>We used up a large proportion of the favours we can call upon from our political contacts &mdash; and no doubt will pay a price on the other side.</P>
    <P>We believe that without NCB's involvement Pernod-Ricard would have found it difficult to succeed in capturing IDG; nor would it have succeeded in winning at a price as low as IR£4.50.  I believe that it is possible quite coldly and objectively to measure our overall contribution as greater than the combined contribution of Schroders and Societe Generale and, on the defensive side, as greater than that of IBI and County.</P>
    <P>As I said to you at our meeting, you must also, however, weigh heavily the spirit of total commitment in which we made our contribution.  I know that you appreciate the value of that aspect personally and I am sure that Pernod-Ricard will respond to us in the matter of fees in a manner which will reflect the same values.</P>
    <P>With kindest personal regards,</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>DERMOT F. DESMOND</P>
    <P>That letter throws light on an area which up to now has been murky, to say the least.  It was in the context of NCB's involvement in virtually every other affair that has been revealed in the last few months which ensured that I would have to make that public.</P>
    <P>In my statement on Sunday I said that there was now an obligation on both NCB and the Government to spell out exactly the basis of their relationship, to explain the nature of the political favours referred to, and to identify those who were involved in these contacts, and especially the references to &ldquo;the highest level&rdquo;.  I am still waiting for a satisfactory response to these points.</P>
    <P>It is entirely a matter for NCB what fees it charges its clients for commercial work undertaken on their behalf, and it is entirely appropriate for them to make <Col N="492" /> representations on their behalf. However, it is a matter of very serious public concern when the company appears to be suggesting that it has some unique special relationship or some sort of inside track with those in power and that it can call upon political favours to serve the interest of its clients.  This letter must greatly add to the public concern arising from the recent allegations of political favouritism involving NCB.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most serious passage in Mr. Desmond's letter is where he tells his client:</P>
    <P>We used up a large proportion of the favours we can call upon from our political contacts &mdash; and no doubt will pay a price on the other side.</P>
    <P>The common sense implication of this would appear to be that, having extracted the favours from the political contacts, NCB was, in some way, going to have to repay the favour to those who obliged their client.  Equally alarming is the passage in which Mr. Desmond says:</P>
    <P>We orchestrated entirely the successful campaigns to get a positive tax opinion from the Revenue Commissioners, which involved using personal contacts at the highest level, including the Minister for Finance and the Secretaries of the Department of the Taoiseach and Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>How is it appropriate for NCB to use personal contacts with the Minister for Finance and senior civil servants to extract &ldquo;a positive tax opinion&rdquo;?  Was pressure exerted on the Revenue Commissioners to deliver this &ldquo;positive tax opinion&rdquo; and what was the cost to other taxpayers of Mr. Desmond's ability to extract this &ldquo;positive tax opinion&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>In another part of the letter, Mr. Desmond writes of NCB's &ldquo;intervention at the highest levels&rdquo; in connection with a monopolies and mergers decision.  Does this mean the Taoiseach's office or some other Government Department?</P>
    <P>This letter raises questions of the most profound importance about the nature of the relationship between business and <Col N="493" /> commercial interests and the Government. It is one of the most revealing documents to have emerged in the past few weeks and casts some light on the operations of the golden circle about which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley recently expressed some concern.  Presumably the records available in Deputy O'Malley's Department will be able to shed further light on the claim of &ldquo;personal contact&rdquo; with the then Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and in the interests of open and honest government to which he subscribes he will make the records available to the House. Indeed the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance must produce their departmental records to this House in order to establish once and for all, the veracity or otherwise of Mr. Desmond's claims.</P>
    <P>The claim for £2 million in fees shows just how high the stakes are for companies like NCB.  Huge fortunes can be made on single deals.  This cannot, however, justify any element of political favouritism or the provision of any special facilities or concessions to those in business who claim some sort of special relationship with those in Government.</P>
    <P>There is a particular obligation on the Taoiseach to spell out exactly what is the nature of his relationship with Mr. Dermot Desmond.  In various media interviews Mr. Haughey referred to Mr. Desmond as a personal friend.  In a briefing given to political correspondents following the meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party on 2 October, the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Vincent Brady, quoted Mr. Haughey as saying that Mr. Desmond was not a &ldquo;personal friend&rdquo; but a &ldquo;business friend&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, there have been no satisfactory responses by either the Government or NCB to the issue raised by Mr. Desmond's letter to Pernod.  The recent &ldquo;personal friend&rdquo; of the Taoiseach has been disowned by all in Fianna Fáil in an attempt to save their own political skins.  The Government Press Officer is quoted as saying that they cannot be held responsible for the exaggerated boasts of <Col N="494" /> a businessman.  This is a polite way of accusing Mr. Desmond of being a liar.</P>
    <P>Mr. Desmond, on the other hand, now confirms the authenticity of the letter but says it is being misinterpreted.  Mr. Desmond is stretching credibility to the limit by suggesting that the only reason for the seeking by NCB of favours from &ldquo;political contacts&rdquo;, the &ldquo;intervention at the highest levels&rdquo;, and the use of &ldquo;personal contacts including the Minister for Finance and the Secretaries of the Departments of the Taoiseach and Industry and Commerce&rdquo; was to ensure that the Irish financial and political authorities acted in a &ldquo;comprehensive manner&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While it is understandable that people are very correctly angry and indignant at the disclosures of shady practices which came to light in the past weeks, the public should not lose sight of the fact that the Government's record on unemployment represents what is perhaps the greatest scandal.  The unemployment figures published on the first Friday of this month represented an increase of more than 40,000 over the same month last year. Each month during this summer we have seen unemployment climb to levels never experienced before in the history of the State.  For this reason alone, Mr. Haughey and his colleagues have lost all moral right to govern and should be hounded out of office at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Our lack of confidence in this Government long pre-dates the disclosures of the past few weeks.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, in the Programme for Government negotiated in July 1989, promised to make job creation their number one priority.  Instead, to use Mr. Haughey's favourite phrase, they &ldquo;stood aside&rdquo; and allowed the dole queues to lengthen and the human misery that comes with unemployment to increase proportionately.  We knew all along that we had a Government who were spectacularly incompetent and who had failed to honour the commitments given in the Programme for Government to make employment creation &ldquo;the major priority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> There is, in fact, a direct link between the scandals of the past few weeks and the failure of the Government to make any impact on the unemployment problem. The Greencore, Telecom and Carysfort scandals all represented attempts by what were already some of the richest people in Ireland to increase their wealth by &ldquo;strokes&rdquo;&mdash; property speculation, cute deals and offshore companies.</P>
    <P>Charles Haughey's Fianna Fáil have shamelessly encouraged and benefited from this parasitic culture.  They have always seemed to consider the stroke or the inside deal to be a far preferable route to wealth creation than the slow, hard, risky slog involved in setting up a manufacturing industry which might add to the wealth of society in general and create badly needed jobs.  Until we have a Government who treat these parasitic deals and strokes as the anti-social activities they are and who set about encouraging and promoting wealth creation through manufacturing industry or useful services, we are, unfortunately, going to have to face continued unemployment at this shocking level.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the outcome of this week's vote of confidence here in the Dáil the massive level of applications for Morrison visas is a huge vote of no confidence in the Government on the part of hundreds of thousands of young Irish people.  Young people are voting with their feet by trying desperately to get out of the country.  The massive level of applications for these visas is a reflection of the sense of despair felt by so many young people.  Young men and women, many of whom have spent long years in college and university have not been able to get even menial jobs.  They feel betrayed and let down by a Government who came into power in 1989 promising to make job creation their number one priority and who have since stood aside and allowed unemployment to climb to record levels.</P>
    <P>It is clear that Mr. Haughey and his <Col N="496" /> colleagues have totally abdicated their responsibilities and see renewed emigration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is clear that the Taoiseach and his colleagues have totally abdicated their responsibilities and see renewed emigration as the only hope of reducing unemployment.  He said as much in his recent RTE interview.  Is it not a sad reflection on this country that after 70 years of self-government all the stops can be pulled out to facilitate the mass exodus of young people out of the country, while the Government plead that nothing can be done to give them jobs at home?  What is even more pathetic is the spectacle of Fianna Fáil politicians, such as Senator Dan Kiely, shamelessly exploiting for political purposes the desperate desire of people to emigrate.  What a proud record Senator Kiely will be able to look back on at the end of his career. When he is asked what he did for his people, he will be able to say proudly that he helped 5,000 people to emigrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not blame these people for trying to emigrate, but we regret their loss to the country.  Many of those who get Morrison visas will return only for holidays.  The loss of their energy and enthusiasm will be incalculable.  Ireland simply cannot afford to endure a haemorrhage of our young people at this level. There must be a change in emphasis in <Col N="497" /> national economic policy away from the sort of strokes and speculation which we have seen exposed in the past few weeks to investment in productive jobs.</P>
    <P>Deputies on all sides of this House would be making a grave mistake in underestimating the damage that has been done to the political system by the failure of the Government to address our economic problems, and especially by the endless stream of scandals.</P>
    <P>Monday's <i>The Irish Times</i> MRBI opinion poll which showed that three-quarters of the people believe that political standards have fallen should provide food for thought for all Members of the Oireachtas.  While the Government have, quite rightly, suffered a major loss in support because of their handling of the recent scandals, it is very clear that a large section of the public is becoming increasingly cynical about and disillusioned with the entire political system.</P>
    <P>Action must be taken by all parties in the House to re-establish public confidence in the political system.  The aim should be to ensure that if an opinion poll is taken 12 months from now three-quarters of the people will believe that political standards are rising.  A major source of public cynicism is the close relationship between those at the top in business and those at the top in politics. A little light has been thrown on this area in the past few weeks, but many among the public believe that what has emerged so far is only the tip of the iceberg.  I share their concern.</P>
    <P>If, as many of the businessmen and politicians involved have protested, they have nothing to hide, then there should surely be no objections to a clear statutory requirement for politicians to declare all their interests, direct or indirect, in all business and commercial activities.  This would have to be accompanied by a requirement for full disclosure of all contributions to political parties from commercial or business interests.  Given what has emerged in the past few weeks and the comments of people like the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Harney, and Mr. Michael McDowell, it is hard to see how the Progressive <Col N="498" /> Democrats could retain any shred of credibility if they remain in Government without ensuring that watertight guarantees are given on legislation in this area at least.</P>
    <P>We must take steps to ensure that the law is applied equally to all citizens.  We have an impressive body of company law but we must ensure that it is implemented and tightened up, if found to be inadequate. We must ensure that those who are charged with running semi-State companies on behalf of the people are adequately paid, but are harshly dealt with if they break the people's trust.  We must end the situation whereby wrongdoing at the top of industry is rewarded by golden handshakes and early retirement while wrongdoing on the factory floor is punished by dismissal without compensation.  We must end any trace of corruption and abuse in both the public and the private sectors.  We must ensure that anti-social activities are treated with the contempt they deserve.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that there is proper political accountability and that no Government is allowed to run away from their responsibilities.  This is at the kernel of this confidence motion.  Can the Dáil have any confidence in the Government after what has come to light in the past few weeks?  Semi-State company after semi-State company has been rocked by scandal.  The chairmen of three semi-State bodies, appointed or re-appointed by this Government, have been forced to resign in various degrees of disgrace. Ministers have failed utterly to exercise any degree of supervision of semi-State companies, have allowed the taxpayers to be taken advantage of in an outrageous way and have run away from the consequences of their neglect.</P>
    <P>This Government have now passed their &ldquo;sell by&rdquo; date.  The odour of decay grows stronger each day.  Whatever agreement is cobbled together between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats may provide a temporary stay of execution but it will not sustain this Government for the next two years or save it from the ultimate verdict of the people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> Before I sit down I wish to address one final point.  The Taoiseach &mdash; and I am giving him his correct title &mdash; in the sly manner which has become his hallmark, tried to blacken the names of Deputy Rabbitte and myself through the use of innuendo this morning in the House when he said: &ldquo;I would now like to ask him here in this House to tell us about some of the people not so well known he&rdquo;&mdash; referring to Pat Rabbitte &mdash;&ldquo;and his Leader have been meeting&rdquo;.  He then departed from his prepared script and said &ldquo;the chief of staff of the Official IRA&rdquo;.  It was not entirely clear whether this was uttered as a statement of fact or as a question.</P>
    <P>In either event I want to state categorically that neither I nor Deputy Rabbitte have anything whatsoever to do with any group styling itself the Official IRA, the Provisional IRA, or any other paramilitary group.  I have dedicated my time in politics to opposing para-militarism and will continue to oppose political violence with all the vigour at my disposal.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach believes that I or any other Member of this party in this House have met any person which he describes as &ldquo;the chief of staff of the Official IRA&rdquo; then he has an obligation to the people of this country and to this House to give that information to the Garda.  I promise him he will receive every co-operation from me and Deputy Rabbitte and any other Deputy in this House in any inquiries the Garda may pursue as a result. Unless he is prepared to give that information to this House and to the Garda, he should withdraw that innuendo.  We have not engaged in innuendo or false accusations inside or outside this House. We have put the evidence we received on the record of this House.  I do not know who the chief of staff of the Official IRA is, if indeed, such a person exists, but then the Taoiseach has always seemed to know more about who is in the IRA than I ever have, and he seemed to have a particular interest in this area in 1969 and 1970 when the Provisional IRA was being established &mdash; the Provisional IRA which has slaughtered so <Col N="500" /> many men, women and children in both parts of Ireland, in Britain and on the Continent.  When he is on the subject of meetings, perhaps he could fill us in on some of the interesting persons, well known and not so well known, whom he met in 1969 and 1970.</P>

      <P>I believe the Government have the confidence of Dáil Éireann.  I have been listening to three Deputies from the Opposition who have competed with each other for some hours in expressing their moral indignation.  They have been wringing their hands and craw-thumping about business ethics and the judgment of this Government.  Might I remind the public that these lectures are being delivered by, among others, former Ministers who were virtually run out of office for their gross neglect of our Irish economy. These were the Deputies who presided over a national debt which doubled during their term of office; these were the Deputies who pushed the economy to the brink of collapse; these same Deputies were those who, as Ministers, pushed the Exchequer borrowing requirement to 13 per cent of GNP; these were the Deputies who, as Ministers, pushed the national debt to 130 per cent of gross national product.  This was the Finance Minister, Deputy Bruton, who presided over the highest personal tax regime ever &mdash; a standard rate of 35 per cent, the highest in any OECD country. This was the Finance Minister who subjected one out of every three taxpayers to paying the highest rate of taxation. Was it any wonder then, that this Government which left office in early 1987, was rejected by the Irish public at that election?  Was this not the same former Tánaiste, the same former Minister for Finance, the same Fine Gael Party and the same Labour Party that gave us, in their time in Government, the Irish Shipping scandal, the Insurance Corporation of Ireland scandal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was making the point that I can certainly take lectures and, indeed, advice &mdash; as all of us can &mdash; about the responsibility of Ministers in regard to the supervision of companies, but I find it hard to take some of the lectures today from the same Deputies <Col N="502" /> who, when in Government, oversaw perhaps the greatest list of business fiascos in the history of our State.</P>
      <P>In the case of Irish Shipping the then Minister for Communications, Deputy J. Mitchell, told the Dáil that speculative charter agreements were entered into without his knowledge or without his consent as Minister of the day.  He also made it clear that the Minister for Finance was not aware of these speculative charters. There was no suggestion at that time from any Deputies on that side of the House that they should have known or ought to have known.  In June 1986 the <i>Irish Spruce</i> was sold off for £3 million a fraction of its original cost.  Estimated liabilities at the time amounted to £117 million, of which about £40 million was guaranteed by the State and had to be met by the Irish taxpayer.  Had that Government not panicked at that time I believe the company could perhaps &mdash; as I am now attempting to do with the B &amp; I &mdash; have been repackaged and placed in new ownership.</P>
      <P>The Insurance Corporation of Ireland, whose liabilities were in the region of £200 million, were bailed out by an arrangement involving the Central Bank. Where was the supervisory role of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism of the day, Deputy John Bruton?  What of the emphatic reassurances of Minister of State, Deputy Eddie Collins, that there was no crisis in the industry, barely one month before the collapse?  Did the Government of the day feel that the business crisis was the Government's fault?  Did the Taoiseach of the day or the Ministers ask those responsible to step aside or to resign? They did not.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, explained on RTE with regard to the PMPA debacle that had he known earlier and been able to act sooner he may have saved the taxpayer some £10 million. Where were the lectures about ministerial responsibility for such companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Dublin Gas, Deputies Bruton and Spring in Government did a deal with Dublin Gas which allegedly <Col N="503" /> insured that the private sector would carry its share of risk.  This resulted in the taxpayer being liable for all the debts of Dublin Gas, amounting to £129 million when Dublin Gas went bankrupt and were taken over by Bord Gáis Éireann. Deputy Gay Mitchell criticised the company for its lack of accountability, however where was the criticism by Deputies then, of ministerial responsibility during that crisis?</P>
    <P>These few example show the hypocrisy of the protestations today in the speeches we have heard in relation to the responsibility of Ministers with regard to the supervision of business matters.  The Deputies well know that it is impossible in Government to fully supervise every detail of every company.  It has been demonstrated that our predecessors were unable to do that.  It is not the Government's job to supervise these details.  It is the Government's responsibility to provide legislation to promote the development of business within an appropriate framework.  It is also the responsibility of Government, when wrongdoing or bad judgment come to their attention to take firm and decisive action.  Unlike our predecessors in office this Government have done that.</P>
    <P>This debate is timely.  We have to clear the air about events of recent weeks.  It is important to state clearly that from our perspective these were business scandals, not Government or political scandals. Nevertheless, they were totally unacceptable to the Government.  There is not any Government member in any way involved in such scandals.  All the alleged matters took place in the semi-State sector or by the action of individual business people.  It is important to understand the difference.  The only way the Government of the day can be judged is how they respond to such matters.  The Government took swift, decisive corrective action wherever and whenever problems were identified.  We took swift action in relation to Aer Lingus Holidays.  Within hours of being notified I directed the company to bring the matter to the immediate attention of the <Col N="504" /> Fraud Squad whose findings are now with lowing a review over several weeks, I also instructed Aer Lingus to shut down the subsidiary company involved, to overhaul their procedures and take disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>The Telecom affair first came to my attention in the summer of 1991.</P>
    <P>I immediately asked Telecom for information on their Ballsbridge site.  Following a review over several weeks, I remained unsatisfied with the information made available to me.  I immediately ordered a formal inquiry under the Secretary of the Department of Communications to investigate all matters connected with Telecom's Ballsbridge site and other properties.  I also immediately froze further development of the Ballsbridge site.  I also announced that there would be full disclosure of the inquiry's report.  After establishing the inquiry I agreed, with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that if the inquiry did not receive full co-operation from all the parties involved, we would immediately request the Minister to appoint an Inspector under the Companies Act.</P>
    <P>When this co-operation was not forthcoming from one of the parties, on 1 October, 1991, the inquiry requested that an inspector be appointed.  The inquiry subsequently published their findings in full that day.  An inspector was also appointed that day.</P>
    <P>This was another example of firm action by the Government.  It shows what can be done.  The Government took swift, decisive and correct action in regard to the Telecom affair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I instituted a thorough, professional inquiry and I would like to pay tribute to the public servants who worked untiringly on this inquiry. The inquiry established 13 key facts and <Col N="505" /> made five key recommendations which I intend to follow up.</P>
      <P>With regard to Celtic Helicopters, when the leader of the Opposition, Deputy John Bruton and his Transport spokesman, Deputy Yates, approached me with certain allegations that confidential Aer Lingus information had been provided to Celtic Helicopters on Wednesday evening 25 September, I took immediate action to learn the facts. I replied to Deputy Bruton on Friday 27 September.  When Deputy Bruton sought further information on Friday 27 September, I again sought this information from Aer Lingus and forwarded same to Deputy Bruton on Saturday 28 September. Additional information was provided by Aer Lingus to Deputy Bruton this week.</P>
      <P>In referring to Government action in relation to this matter, I wish to highlight that, as in the Telecom affair, I, and the Government, acted in an open manner, fully divulged all the information asked for, did not hide behind any State company and acted honourably at all times.</P>
      <P>Ministers cannot be held responsible for particular transactions of semi-State companies which do not require their approval or consent.  It is a duty of directors to run these companies on behalf of their shareholders and staff.  Directors of companies are responsible for ensuring the proper day to day management of the companies.</P>
      <P>It is the obligation of the board of directors to vigorously investigate issues which give rise to concern.  They should not wait around for the Government, media or indeed the inspectors to take action for them.  Boards of semi-State companies have authority.  I advise them again, as I have done many times in the past, to use that authority to develop their companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial crisis of the Deputy Garret FitzGerald and Deputy Dick Spring coalition Government was tackled head-on by the Fianna Fáil Government of 1987-89 and by the present Government. The magnitude of the difficulties facing the Government were extreme. We were heading for bankruptcy.  We <Col N="506" /> had reached the edge of the financial cliff and we were toppling over.  We had to take action.  We reduced public borrowing; improved the competitiveness of Irish business; maintained a stable IR£ within the EMS; created 40,000 more jobs than in 1986, and reduced the tax rate to 29 per cent from 35 per cent.  We developed the financial services centre, the envy of many capital cities.  We negotiated the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, both historical agreements, with the social partners.  We negotiated EC Structural Funds, total investment £9 billion to restructure our economy and we played a leading role in the development of the new Europe.</P>
    <P>The Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications accounts for 17 per cent of GNP and 13 per cent of total employment in the State.</P>
    <P>The tourism sector has taken off since Fianna Fáil assumed office in 1987.  Tourism has achieved record targets of 15 per cent growth for the past three years &mdash; three times more than the world average. It is now earning in excess of £1 billion in foreign earnings.  It now employs 80,000, a 45 per cent increase since 1987. It is still producing 5,000 new jobs every year.</P>
    <P>The Government have also presided, at EC level, over a liberalisation of air transport which is opening up the skies of Europe.  We have invested heavily in regional airports and are fully committed to their development.</P>
    <P>An Post are experiencing difficulties. Despite their financial position I could not support An Post's viability plan because of its effects on rural Ireland and I decided that the plan should be scrapped. However, An Post must, at a minimum, break even and they can do so if both sides are willing to compromise on their current positions and jointly plan the way ahead.  I urge both sides to leave aside their differences in the current dispute and sit down and secure the future of the postal services.</P>

Of the 28 consultancies given by my Department since 1983 NCB received one which was given to them by the then Minister for Communications, Deputy Jim Mitchell.  I wanted to clear that matter up in the House as I am sure it is important.  Deputy Bruton asked why I did not include Findlater House and the property on the Merrion Road in the inquiry.

      <P>As I am sure former Ministers realise, one is tempted to consult the files when one has them at one's disposal particularly when Members are playing the perception game.  I do not want to play that game, I have resisted the temptation to do so.  However, I am <Col N="509" /> aware of many cases &mdash; I stress that I do not think there is anything wrong with this &mdash; where State companies have done business with supporters of the Opposition parties who run companies well. They do good business with State companies and there is nothing wrong with that.  I am aware of many cases where supporters who previously had been excellent fund-raisers for Opposition parties appear on State boards.  I am not suggesting there is anything wrong with that so long as there is full declaration. What I am suggesting from my casual perusal of the files is that I would prefer not to be lectured by the other side of the House about these matters, in particular by former Ministers who should know better.  They should know &mdash; if one wants to play the perception game &mdash; that one can put all the simple facts on a piece of paper, that so and so raises money for a party, appears on a State board and does business with a State company, and if one produces it on the right day, at the right time and in the right atmosphere one has a scandal.  We could all play that game.  I was very tempted in carrying out research for this debate to do so but it is not my style and I would prefer not to get into it.</P>

      <P>Another point I should like to make to my good friends in The Workers' Party is that they too can play the selectivity game and I would not blame them for that.  That is one of the ways political activity has developed. They castigated the boards of directors &mdash; the fat cats, as they would call them &mdash; the business people and much of it was justified.  I agree that many of the practices are unacceptable but I know they do not mean to exclude, for example, the very fine worker directors on State boards when they castigate the board of a State company.  There is no such thing as different types of directors, <Col N="510" /> there are the worker directors and ordinary directors and if one wants to complain about the board of a State company one has to include all members, including the worker representatives and ministerial appointees.  I know The Workers' Party do not exempt anyone from criticism and I take it that when they criticise a board they criticise the whole board without selectivity.</P>

      <P>Few controversies in 1986 received as much publicity as the decision by the then Minister for Education, former Deputy Gemma Hussey, to close Carysfort College as a primary teacher training institution.  We all recall the very vigorous campaign led by the then principal of the college, Sister Regina Durkan, who was fully supported by the then Opposition spokesperson on Education, Deputy O'Rourke.  We recall the considerable hysteria whipped up by the controversy, the large crowds, the public protests outside the gates of this building.  We vividly recall the very clear unequivocal commitment given in 1986 by Deputy O'Rourke delivered very forcibly both inside and outside this House that if and when she became Minister for Education she would keep Carysfort College open as a teacher training college.</P>

      <P>History records that Deputy O'Rourke became Minister for Education in March 1987 and far from keeping Carysfort College open she presided over its closure.  It was fair to assume that Carysfort College as a controversy had firmly been put to bed. It certainly seemed so when a property development company purchased Carysfort College and its 90 acres of land in October 1989.  As its primary interest was in the area of housing development, Davmac sold the college and the 20 acres immediately surrounding it to a company known as JHA Exports whose two directors were William Harris and his brother, the well known businessman and motor <Col N="512" /> car and truck importer, Mr. Pino Harris. The price was £6.5 million.</P>
      <P>It is well known that Mr. Harris intended initially to use Carysfort College as a multi-private educational institution and entered detailed negotiations with various interested parties with a view to putting this type of operation in place.  Plans and costings were commissioned and drawn up.  However, within one month Mr. Harris changed his mind and wanted out of the deal.  Mr. Harris is a man of means and it is quite obvious he was confronted with the sudden realisation that his private third level education complex was not such a good idea after all and was not going to yield the type of short term dividend and profits he would have wished and expected.  The problem in such a situation is to get a buyer for the property and make a profit.</P>
      <P>It is well known that when the Sisters of Mercy decided to put Carysfort on the market, University College Dublin displayed an interest in acquiring it in view of its proximity to the college. However, UCD were given no encouragement by the Department of Education. In April 1989 UCD decided therefore to go ahead with their own plans to build the Smurfit Graduate Business School on their 300 acre Belfield campus.  The cost of the project was to be £5 million and it was to be self-financing with £1.5 million coming from Mr. Smurfit, £1 million by way of a repayable loan from the college development fund, a further £2 million from private resources and £1.5 million by way of grants.  It was to be self-financing and was not to cost the taxpayer anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1990 the architects' plans for a new building were approved by the college building committee.  According to Dr. Masterson, President of UCD, last Tuesday, &ldquo;by April-May, as detailed costings emerged, it became clear that the cost of the proposed new building was going to be a serious problem&rdquo;.  Dr. Masterson went on to say that they then began to scale down the building with a view to keeping it within the £5 million budget projection.  However, there are <Col N="513" /> no details of how much it would be scaled down or how much over budget it would go.</P>
    <P>According to Dr. Masterson the estate agents, Gunne, acting for Harris Brothers approached UCD in July 1990 with a view to considering the possibility of purchasing Carysfort College.  UCD looked at the property but decided not to go ahead because of the cost factor.  It is worth recalling that when the Sisters of Mercy decided initially to sell Carysfort, UCD &mdash; as I said before &mdash; were given no encouragement by the Department of Education to buy the property.  When Davmac put the property on the market in June 1990 and when it was available for £6.5 million UCD were not approached or did not receive any contact or encouragement from the Department of Education.  Nothing happened by way of advice to them to go ahead and purchase the property.  Yet, suddenly in September 1990, a mere three months after Mr. Harris purchased the property for £6.5 million and a mere two months after his agents approached UCD to buy the property, the Minister for Education entered the scene.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Dr. Masterson for clarifying once and for all last Tuesday, despite repeated attempts by the Minister for Education to evade the issue, that these major initiatives in relation to the purchase of Carysfort College by UCD were taken by the Minister for Education in September 1990.  As Dr. Masterson put it, &ldquo;an initiative by the Minister for Education inaugurated a new phase in the college's interest in Carysfort&rdquo;.  Dr. Masterson went to say that the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, held a meeting with the registrar, the secretary of the college and the Chairman of the Graduate Business School to discuss the possibilities of a graduate business school.  Suddenly the Belfield plans, which were very far advanced, were abandoned and intensive &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; and urgent negotiations began in relation to the purchase of the college by UCD.  It is quite clear that there was a considerable conflict within UCD as to the wisdom of going ahead and as to whether they <Col N="514" /> should depart from their long-standing core policy of campus consolidation, of locating all their faculties and facilities on their more than adequate 300 acres in Belfield.</P>
    <P>Dr. Masterson's statement also makes it clear that the commerce faculty refused to allow their undergraduates to be transferred to Carysfort.  However, in view of the new spirit of openness and the positive promptings of the Minister for Education, a purchase price of £8 million was agreed between UCD and Gunne in November 1990.  There was, of course, the other little factor that it would take a mere £3.5 million to convert the building and make it suitable for a graduate business school.  At the end of November 1990 UCD told the Government quite bluntly that the most they were prepared to pay was £2 million towards the overall cost; in other words, there was a clear ultimatum to the Government that if they wanted UCD to buy this facility they had better come up with the money.</P>
    <P>On 12 December the Taoiseach, the Minister for Education, the President of UCD and Mr. Laurence Crowley, chairman of the Graduate Business School, met to discuss the funding of the project. According to Dr. Masterson the Taoiseach tried to persuade UCD to raise a greater proportion of the overall cost of the project.  Dr. Masterson couched his refusal to do so in the diplomatic language, that &ldquo;this suggestion the President declined for various reasons&rdquo;.  The UCD President went on to explain that &ldquo;the Taoiseach indicated that he would recommend that the Government support the purchase along the lines of the college proposal&rdquo;.  Lo and behold, University College, Dublin, ended up purchasing Carysfort Training College for £8 million from the Harris Brothers, thereby giving them a grand profit of £1.5 million for a mere seven months' investment.  Not bad when you consider that at the time because of the impending Gulf crisis, a slump in the property market and an over-abundance of commercial property, there was a considerable reduction in property value.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> The Smurfit Graduate Business School which is going ahead in Belfield as a self-financing project costing approximately £5 million in April 1990 has now been transferred <i>en bloc</i> to Carysfort Training College for a total purchase price of £8 million, plus £3.7 million refurbishment costs, of which the taxpayer has to fork out £9.7 million, with UCD and Mr. Smurfit paying the balance &mdash; £2 million &mdash; between them.  I am afraid, from the point of view of the taxpayers, this is not the end of the story because the Taoiseach again became involved.  On 21 December 1990, Dr. Masterson returned the Taoiseach's telephone call during which, in his own words, &ldquo;an issue concerning operational costs was satisfactorily clarified&rdquo;.  It now transpires that John Citizen, the taxpayer, is again stuck for the operating costs as well as for the capital cost of purchasing this graduate business school to honour the contribution of Dr. Michael Smurfit to Irish business, as a result of the personal intervention of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education are one of the big spending Departments and have a budget of £1.3 billion.  They operate, like other Departments, very rigorous accounting procedures; yet, on this occasion, virtually all the rules, regulations and accounting safeguards were dispensed with.  Carysfort could have been purchased by UCD in June 1990 for £6.5 million, yet it ended up costing the taxpayer £8 million plus an additional £1.7 million a mere seven months later. No independent valuation was carried out by the Valuation Office or any independent agency which must be the case when public money is involved.</P>
    <P>According to Dr. Masterson &mdash; and indeed the Minister &mdash;&ldquo;the competent college experts judged this to be good value&rdquo;.  I wonder whether this is the same expert opinion which underestimated the cost of the graduate business school which was to be built initially in UCD. Was this the same team of experts which looked at Carysfort in July, a few months beforehand, and thought it was too expensive at that stage?  Suddenly in <Col N="516" /> December it became excellent value.  Of course, from their point of view it was good value in that they were getting an asset valued at several million pounds without any contribution from their own coffers as well as having the running costs underwritten by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting &mdash; and this has not come out before &mdash; that in April 1989 the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Education, Mr. Finbarr O'Callaghan, wrote to the Sisters of Mercy, Carysfort, stating that the Department of Education had no interest in and no plans for Carysfort.  In other words, they were given the nod to go ahead and sell it. Yet, the following year the Minister for Education and the Taoiseach became intimately involved in a series of meetings and telephone calls in order to ensure that the property was bought by UCD.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority are the statutory agency for supervising and monitoring all third level education and yet, in this case, they were ignored and by-passed.  The Minister acted illegally in doing so.  Section 5 of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, states that the Higher Education Authority &ldquo;shall advise the Minister on the need or otherwise for the establishment of new institutions of higher education, on the nature and form of those institutions and on the legislative measures required in relation to their establishment or in relation to any existing institution of higher education&rdquo;. The section is quite clear.  It states that the Higher Education Authority &ldquo;shall advise the Minister on the need for new institutions of higher education&rdquo;, yet, here we had a new graduate business school costing £11.7 million in the process of establishment and the statutory obligation of the Minister to be advised by the Higher Education Authority is not complied with.  Not alone was it not complied with, not alone was there no consultation or dialogue with the Higher Education Authority, but the members of the Higher Education Authority actually wrote to the Minister for Education expressing their annoyance at their exclusion from any involvement in <Col N="517" /> the project.  It is quite clear that the Minister acted illegally by not consulting the Higher Education Authority, by not seeking their advice and by not being advised by them.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (1) of the same Act states &ldquo;Any request by an institution of higher education for State subvention shall be submitted by the institution to An tÚdarás&rdquo;&mdash; in this case the Higher Education Authority &mdash;&ldquo;in such manner as An tÚdarás may require&rdquo;.  Yet, here we had a situation where UCD needed £9.7 million of State subvention and yet no submission or request was made by them to the Higher Education Authority as specified in this Act.  Furthermore, the Minister for Education, being fully aware of the facts, again decided to conspire with UCD in order to totally bypass and sideline the Higher Education Authority, thereby flouting one of the key requirements of this Act.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (1) of the same Act states that the Higher Education Authority &ldquo;shall assess amounts of State financial provision, both current and capital, which it recommends for higher education and research or for any part thereof, either in relation to current or future periods&rdquo;.  Here we have a State financial provision of £11.7 million being made for capital expenditure and yet the Higher Education Authority which have been vested with the power and, indeed, the obligation because it states &ldquo;shall assess the amounts of State financial provision&rdquo;, are totally precluded from any involvement in carrying out such an assessment and indeed get the proverbial back-hand from the Minister when they try to protest at being prohibited and obstructed from carrying out their statutory functions.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the statutory supervisory, monitoring and regulatory role of the Higher Education Authority was totally flouted as a result of the direct intervention by the Minister for Education. It is quite clear that the Minister for Education, probably acting on the Taoiseach's instructions, conducted direct negotiations with University College Dublin completely above the head of <Col N="518" /> the Higher Education Authority.  Apart from the gross insult offered to the Higher Education Authority, there is the deliberate undermining of the Higher Education Authority's statutory position. By her actions in the Carysfort project the Minister has acted in a highly irregular manner.  She has arbitrarily dispensed with all the normal procedures and guidelines.  What she did is illegal in that she flouted the specific and binding requirements of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that at a time when we have the highest primary class sizes in Europe with over 607 classes having more than 45 pupils, when parents are being asked to dig deep into their own pockets to fund primary and second level education, which is supposed to be free but is not free any longer, when the same school bus breaks down three times within a fortnight leaving children stranded on the side of the road, when teachers have to count the number of sticks of chalk they use in the classrooms, when school managers are heavily overdrawn in the bank because the Department have left them stuck for cheques for repairs, maintenance, heating and electrical work, and when the primary school system in inner city Dublin in particular is in danger of imminent collapse because of lack of resources, she acted in a highly irresponsible manner by wasting £9.7 million of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>The Minister may make the point that the Dáil voted through a Supplementary Estimate on 18 December 1990 for the purchase of Carysfort College, but the Opposition voted against it.  What the Minister did not tell the House however at that time was the background and details leading up to the purchase of Carysfort.  What she did not tell the House was the entire sequence of events leading up to the finalisation of the transaction. What she did not tell the House was that it took the personal and unwarranted intrusion of the Taoiseach and herself to clinch the deal.  Finally, what she did not tell the House was that every single rule and guideline put in place over <Col N="519" /> the years to safeguard the public interest was flouted in this case.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the most serious breach of regulations was the shoddy treatment of the Higher Education Authority.  One may well ask why the Higher Education Authority were relegated to the role of a mere frustrated sideline spectator.  I will tell you why they were left out of the action &mdash; the Government knew full well that the Higher Education Authority would give the thumbs down to the proposal. The Government knew full well that in pursuit of their statutory oligations the Higher Education Authority, being fully <i>au fait</i> with all third level requirements, would advise that the £9.7 million was badly needed and could be better spent elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Government knew full well that the Higher Education Authority would not go along with the proposals and therefore they took the extraordinary personal intervention of the Taoiseach, with personal meetings and phone calls, and the Minister for Education to rescue and bail out their friend, Mr. Harris and his ill-judged £6.5 million investment.  I would put it to the Minister for Education that if any school principal anywhere in the country, any chief executive officer, any clerk in a vocational education office or any caretaker of a school had acted in breach of the basic rules and regulations governing the spending of public money, they would have been booted unceremoniously from office on the spot.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the President of UCD, Dr. Masterson, for clarifying the sequence of events, albeit belatedly.  It took many hours of skilful drafting by a public relations company in order to hone, refine and produce the eventual text.  However, his statement last Tuesday is clear, unequivocal confirmation of the involvement of the Minister for Education and the Taoiseach and an indictment of their roles in the whole sordid affair.  I am happy that in making a statement Dr. Masterson adhered to the principle of his predecessor, John Henry Cardinal Newman who said &ldquo;As <Col N="520" /> far as we are not on the side of truth, we shall shiver to death&rdquo;.  Would that the people at the highest level of political life in this country, the people who have direct involvement in this issue, namely, the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, would even have the slightest glimpse of the implications of such a statement.  Unfortunately, they have not. Week in, week out, both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education, since the controversy broke afresh, have refused to answer any of the specific questions relating to what was and is essentially a shady deal.</P>
    <P>Today in this House the Taoiseach did as he did on several occasions recently &mdash; he simply walked away from the questions by merely stating again that it was a good deal.  Yes, indeed, it was a very good deal for Mr. Harris, but we are entitled to know who exactly the Taoiseach met besides Dr. Masterson.  We are entitled to know whether he met Mr. Harris or Mr. Dermot Desmond who, coincidentally, happens to be on the board of the Smurfit Graduate Business School.</P>
    <P>The Minister in her usual fashion has sought to confuse the issues by her usual convoluted package of conundrums. When asked by Shane Kenny on &ldquo;Today at One&rdquo; on 1 October if the Taoiseach had any meetings with Dr. Masterson in relation to the purchase of Carysfort Training College she ducked, bobbed, weaved and eventually when pressed said: &ldquo;I would have no doubt that he would have met him on many occasions, on several occasions at various events to which they were both invited&rdquo;.  It then transpired that, far from a casual meeting, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, as confirmed by Dr. Masterson's statement last week, actually sat down with the Taoiseach, Dr. Masterson and the chairman of the new college to discuss indepth at a full business meeting all the arrangements surrounding the Carysfort deal.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to come into this House and again recite the argument <Col N="521" /> that she was making more places available for third level education.  It is quite clear that the places for third level would have been provided in UCD at no cost to the taxpayer.  That argument simply does not wash.  No money was available to UCD when they first became interested in the project.  Lots of money was available to UCD in order to enable Mr. Harris to get the monkey off his back.  No independent valuation was carried out as even the humblest urban district council must do if they are disposing of a labourer's cottage.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority had their statutory function and role totally undermined.  If one trawled round for a good example of a bad deal, a wrong deal, a crooked and a rotten deal, one need look no further than the Carysfort saga.  It smells of croneyism.  It smells of TACA&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I, like most Members of this House, am concerned at recent developments in a very small number of companies, both private and State.</P>
      <P>The truth needs to be established and the public informed.  Wrongdoing must be dealt with and correct processes put in place where necessary.  If there are loopholes, they must be closed.  If there has been a slippage in standards, then standards must be reasserted.  If there is wrongdoing, it must be appropriately dealt with.</P>
      <P>If we look world wide other countries have their own problems.  The world of finance is going through a troubled period.  A period where the old rules are no longer effective.  Japan, the United States and Britain have been rocked by scandals that did not involve a few million pounds, but hundreds of billions of pounds.  Fortunately we have few such problems in Ireland and consequently they are all the more shocking when they occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no place for any financial misbehaviour in our society.  It must be rooted out.  However, the manner in which these issues are pursued is critical to the national interest.  As Members of the Oireachtas there is an obligation on <Col N="523" /> us to do this not just effectively but responsibly.</P>
    <P>National interest demands that all the issues raised and allegations made be dealt with in a proper, fair, just and logical manner.  The manner in which these issues are pursued is critical to the national interest.  There are allegations being thrown around as if they were proven fact and that is certainly not in anybody's interest.</P>
    <P>While the wrongdoing of a few must be dealt with, it is important to ensure that confidence is maintained in the overwhelming majority of upright businesses that we have in this country.  As politicians we have a responsibility to ensure that we do not damage our people, our country or our image internationally.  I am afraid from the behaviour of the Opposition parties at present that this is not very high on their agenda.</P>
    <P>The portrayal of events by the Opposition has created great unease for all the wrong reasons, for short term political gain.</P>
    <P>The Government reacted promptly by using the full power of the courts by ensuring thorough investigations, for example, the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Industry, the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications Telecom inquiry and the Siúicre Éireann and associated companies inquiry.  I am satisfied with the nature of these inquiries. I know that the Government will take whatever action necessary following these investigations.  The Dáil can question the methods of investigation and whether they can be improved.</P>
    <P>However, it is not in anyone's interest and certainly not in the national interest that individuals and companies should be tried by innuendo, convicted and sentenced before these reports are available. The Government will take any action necessary when they receive the reports.</P>
    <P>I welcome constructive criticism.  The Opposition have their role and that is part and parcel of our democratic system. However if you look at the Opposition at the moment you wonder where the <Col N="524" /> national interest ends and policial opportunism takes over.  This highlights a fundamental difference between Fianna Fáil and the present Opposition parties.  Compare the Opposition's behaviour today with that of Fianna Fáil in opposition in 1982-87.  We can all recall what happened during that period in Irish Shipping and ICI.  ICI was the greatest business scandal of the past ten years, If the Opposition of that time behaved in the same way as the Opposition are behaving today they would have caused the collapse of a major bank involved at the time.  Look at the facts in 1985.  Fine Gael and Labour were in Government when the ICI scandal occurred.  Look at how Fianna Fáil in opposition behaved compared with the parties in opposition today.  The situation was so serious then that emergency legislation was necessary.  The then Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy John Bruton, now Leader of Fine Gael, introduced the Bill and left many questions unanswered.  Let us look at how the Opposition behaved at that time.  Speaking on the legislation, as reported at column 708 of the Official Report for 27 March 1985, Deputy Haughey, Leader of the then Opposition said:</P>
    <P>As the principal Opposition party, we immediately took a definite, responsible attitude and indicated that as the Government had said they were acting in the national interest we would, in order to avoid a crisis of conscience, make it clear that we would take the Government at their word and offer whatever parliamentary support was necessary to overcome the difficulty and protect the financial institutions of the State and the country's creditworthiness.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey continued:</P>
    <P>It is important that the world at large should see whatever else can be said about politics in this country the Oireachtas was prepared, where necessary, to give any support needed when the Government could indicate that <Col N="525" /> it was taking action in the national interest.</P>

      <P>Could anybody say one word in favour of the way the Opposition today have behaved when the Government faced up to their responsibility on these problems?</P>
      <P>Deputy John Bruton, the then Minister for Industry Trade, Commerce and Tourism responded as reported at column 1124 of the Official Report for 28 March 1985:</P>
      <P>However, it must be accepted that there was an endeavour by all sides to find a solution and this is true of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition who is present.  All tried to find a solution and to contribute to the best of their knowledge, ability and experience.  Although this debate was occasioned by a very regrettable and sad event it was useful in helping to formulate policy.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach of the day be able to say that the Opposition gave any assistance in dealing with situations in the business world which were totally outside the control of the Government and, as the Taoiseach has pointed out, no politicians were involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil in Opposition could be as tough as the best of them in adversarial debate.  When the national interest demanded it we always rose to the occasion.  We took a responsible position as I have stated under our present Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey, then Leader of the Opposition. That is not the situation today with the Opposition parties and in my view is one of the reasons they have spent so much time in opposition since 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have demonstrated over the past two years that they have no alternative policies whatsoever and perhaps they believe that rhetoric and irresponsible <Col N="526" /> behaviour will hide these facts from the public.  Not alone are they irresponsible in opposition but the Fine Gael and Labour Parties were irresponsible when in Government.  I dealt at length before with their behaviour in the area of the health services and when they allowed health boards to overspend £55 million which they never provided.  That was something that caused major problems for us when we came into Government.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with my own particular area of responsibility where enormous progress has been made despite our financial difficulties, I want to refer to the overall record of Fianna Fáil since we took office in 1987.  At that time the public finances were out of control, growth in the economy was non existent, the national debt had reached crippling proportions and confidence in the economy was at its lowest ever.</P>
    <P>We now have, because of the action taken by the Government, a sound economic base for our future development. The public finances have been brought under control.  It is true that we have a short term problem in relation to 1992 but this problem will be tackled by the Government in the same determined way we approached the crisis situation we inherited.  The underlying economic position is very strong as a result of the action that has been taken since 1987.</P>
    <P>Economic growth has returned and has been sustained.  We have low inflation and a favourable balance of payments and a stable exchange rate ensuring a major improvement in our competitive position.  We are well placed to benefit from the upswing in economic activity already forecast worldwide.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to remind this House of the major part played by the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in turning our economy around.  The programme was negotiated in 1987 and it brought the unions, the employers and the farmers together to forge a consensus to save the country from bankruptcy.  We are all aware of the major personal part played by the Taoiseach himself in achieving that agreement and in dealing with the very <Col N="527" /> serious problems confronting the country.</P>
    <P>We all acknowledge the serious unemployment situation in the country today. Sadly, that is not a problem unique to Ireland.  The general global recession is affecting us here, as is the return of many emigrants who cannot get jobs abroad. The economic growth forecast worldwide will no doubt cause this situation here to improve.</P>
    <P>An indication of this was announced only yesterday, with the Director General of the CII reporting that manufacturing industry was showing recent improvement in exports and output. Against fierce competition, we have also succeeded in attracting major high technology investment into this country.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 major improvements have been made in tax reliefs and reforms. Income tax rates have come down.  VAT has come down.  Income tax relief exemption limits were raised to help the people on low pay.  We have succeeded in keeping ahead of inflation with social welfare payments.  Each year we have given special increases to raise the real standards of living for people who are long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to have this opportunity of placing the Government's record in developing our heath services before the House today.  It is a record of solid achievement based on carefuly thought out strategies to build on the strengths of the existing system.</P>
    <P>Looking directly at health, I believe that the progress we have made in the health area over the past few years is an indication of the Government's determination to establish a proper course of action and to stay with it.  We have achieved this despite the severe constraints facing the public finances generally.  We have made important progress and have taken a number of key decisions on eligibility and organisational structures this year which will have a very positive impact in the future.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1987 there was no cohesive approach to developing our health system in accordance with recognised <Col N="528" /> needs or to addressing its problems.  The Government have set about a consistent, rational process of identifying service needs, examining how best they can be met in the most cost-effective way and planning for their structured implementation.</P>
    <P>We have paid particular attention to the need for medium to long term planning. The restructuring and reorientation of our health system has, of course, been difficult but we have pressed ahead with devising and implementing a streamlined health service which is capable of responding to the enormous demands placed upon it.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind Deputies of the practical steps taken by the Government and of the tangible progress made in the past few years.  In 1987 I established the Commission on Health Funding, a broadly based body representative of a wide range of interests and expertise in the health services, to advise me on the direction that health policy should take.  The Commission reported in late 1989 and provided the first comprehensive analysis of the entire health system since the White Paper of 1966.</P>
    <P>The Commission made recommendations on all of the key issues in health policy, including the approach to funding, eligibility, administrative structures and individual service areas.  Its report now forms the basis of a number of important decisions that have been taken by the Government since then.</P>
    <P>The Commission's work has proved invaluable in pointing the overall direction our health service should take. However, I also established a number of other expert groups to advise on individual aspects of the health services, given the complexity and technical nature of many of the issues to be considered. These bodies included the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group chaired by Professor David Kennedy, whose series of splendid reports I launched last month, and the Hospital Efficiency Review Group under Noel Fox.</P>
    <P>We have been criticised frequently for establishing these working parties and other advisory bodies in the health area. <Col N="529" /> I think this is ironic, given that the reports to which I referred are now providing the foundation of the process of improving the quality and efficiency of our health services.</P>
    <P>Let me remind Deputies of the progress made in implementing the report of the Commission on Health Funding.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year we streamlined the system of eligibility for health services, in accordance with the Commission's recommendations.  Prior to 1 June this year we had a three category system which was acknowledged as being unfair in its assessment of income and as giving rise to potentially serious anomalies in the assessment of eligibility for hospital services.</P>
    <P>The Government therefore accepted the Commission's recommendation that Category III be abolished, and the Oireachtas approved the necessary legislation earlier this year.  This decision was also supported by the social partners under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Its positive effects will become obvious over time, particularly since we have combined it with a fair system of access to public hospitals. Under this arrangement, which is being phased in at present, patients in non-emergency situations must opt explicitly for public or private care.  The previous practice of combining public ward accommodation with private consultant care will no longer be permitted.  This will ensure fairer access for all to public hospitals and will be of greater benefit to public patients.</P>
    <P>One of the most important conclusions reached by the Commission on Health Funding, and echoed strongly by Professor Kennedy's group, was that we would have to address urgently the problems inherent in the administrative structure of our health system.  These problems have built up over time and must be resolved quickly so that an adaptable, responsible service can be put in place.</P>
    <P>Both the Commission and the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group pointed to the fragmentation of different services and to the lack of co-ordination between <Col N="530" /> hospital and community based services.  I have been conscious that these difficulties have led to an over-involvement by my Department in the day-to-day management of services, at a time when policy-making on the future direction of services should be to the fore.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that I announced the setting up of a new regional health authority to replace the Eastern Health Board.  The new authority will have a more direct relationship with all of the health agencies in its area, thereby ensuring a greater co-ordination of hospital and community based services.</P>
    <P>I should point out, however, that the legislation will have important national effects as well as those directed specifically towards the Eastern Health Board area.  It will, for example, clarify the roles, relationships and accountability of health board members and their chief executive officers.  It will also clarify the functions of the Minister for Health, the Department of Health and agencies involved in service delivery.</P>
    <P>In this way, the legislation will make much clearer who should be doing what in the health system.  My Department and I, as Minister, will be able to concentrate on the development of health policy and the overall control of expenditure, rather than becoming over-involved in the detailed day-to-day management of individual services.   Operational management must be devolved to the appropriate health agencies if we are to achieve greater efficiency. I am confident that the new organisational arrangements in the Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow areas will have a very positive impact in this regard.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise, as I did when announcing the Government's decisions on these matters, that there will be full consultation with all interested parties on the details of these decisions.  Indeed, I have already invited agencies to make written submissions on the issues of concern to them, and I look forward to their responses before proceeding further with the preparation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> Since taking office the Government have been anxious to identify the most appropriate means of tackling any problems in each area of the health service. In the acute hospital sector Professor Kennedy's reports have proved invaluable. His group's interim report, published in June 1990 made a series of recommendations on the best practices and policies aimed at ensuring a quality service with the maximum of efficiency and effectiveness.  Many of the hospitals involved in the study by Professor Kennedy's group have now implemented the recommendations on such areas as: admission and discharge policies, bed and patient management and the operation of Accident and Emergency Departments.</P>
    <P>After completion of the other reports Professor Kennedy agreed to chair an advisory group which, together with my Department's officials, will oversee the implementation of the group's recommendations on improvement of hospital services.  They will also help me to monitor and review progress over time.  I am very pleased to say that Mr. Noel Fox, whose efficiency review of Dublin hospitals was of such value, has agreed to become a member of the Kennedy Advisory Group.</P>
    <P>It will be clear to Deputies, therefore, that the Government have a carefully devised, well thought out approach to the improvement of our hospital system.  It is based not simply on ploughing countless millions of pounds into the service in the hope that any problems will thereby be solved but instead draws on the recognised objective expertise of eminent professionals who have examined the acute hospital sector in detail and have made sensible, realistic recommendations which can now be implemented systematically. A key point of this process has been the development of the necessary consensus, without which wide-ranging changes cannot be implemented successfully.</P>
    <P>This planned approach to service developments extends also to the community based services.  Starting with the <Col N="532" /> Commission on Health Funding and drawing upon a range of expert reports on individual areas, the Government have a very clear view of the direction which these services should take in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Health Funding stressed the need for an analytical approach to identifying service needs, examining alternative options of meeting those needs and of monitoring the implementation process in the light of changing circumstances.  I might stress that there is little to be gained from merely pumping moneys into particular services without regard to effectiveness or efficiency.  The course which we have charted ensures that money is allocated only after careful assessment of need and of the best method of meeting those needs in each locality.</P>
    <P>It is with this approach in mind that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> committed the Government to a planned expansion of designated community-based services, in accordance with the recommendations of the groups which reported on each area.  This is an important element of the Government's policy on the future direction of the health services.</P>
    <P>The Government have made significant progress in a number of areas of health legislation.  I have referred already to the recent important improvements in the eligibility system introduced under the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991.  We have also passed the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which provided amongst other things, for a new system of registration under which all non-health board homes, whether run for profit or on a voluntary basis, will be obliged to operate.  It also provides for a fairer approach to subventing nursing homes based on the merits of each individual applicant.  This will replace the present unsatisfactory system which did not guarantee that the limited funds available were channelled towards the most appropriate applicants.</P>
    <P>Then there is the Child Care Act, 1991. For some time past the Government have been extremely anxious to address a <Col N="533" /> range of legal issues in the area of child care.  Therefore I was glad to see the Oireachtas enact the new Child Care Act 1991, before the summer recess.  That Act imposes a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of any child in the community not receiving adequate care and protection.  It also gives the boards new powers to provide child care and family support services, introducing a new legal procedure enabling health boards and the Garda to intervene where children are being neglected or abused.  The Act takes account of the many practical and cultural developments, such as the need for legal controls on pre-school services and a modernised statutory framework for the regulation of children's residential centres.  The new Act updates the grounds on which children may be taken into care and introduces new provisions regarding legal representation to children involved in care proceedings.  As in the case of other community-based services the Government have committed themselves to making the necessary resources available for implementation.  Indeed that commitment is contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>The Adoption Act, 1991, recognising foreign adoptions, was passed by this House.</P>
    <P>Other areas in which there has been progress in health services include a patients' charter.  The Government have placed special emphasis on ensuring that not only the efficiency but also the quality of services to patients receive close attention. After all, the patient is the central focus of our services.  Patients' needs must be to the forefront when planning our services.  With that in mind the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> reiterates the Government's commitment to introducing a patients' charter.  In consultation with hospitals throughout the country we are making good progress in developing that charter which will be based on the fundamental principles of access to service in accordance with need, the right to privacy, to information and to confidentiality of all <Col N="534" /> medical records along with the right to make a complaint and have that complaint properly dealt with.  The charter will also recognise the right to respect for religious and philosophical beliefs and the right to refuse to participate in research projects.</P>
    <P>Closely allied to the patients' charter is the need for a formal statutory appeals system for medical cards for those whose applications have been rejected.  I undertook some time ago to introduce such a system.  I am finalising the preparations for putting this in place.  Recently the relevant chief executive officers reviewed their methods of assessing eligibility for medical cards.  Hopefully that will improve the system.</P>
    <P>A common contract for hospital consultants has been introduced.  It reflects the importance of hospital consultants to our hospitals system, providing them with an appropriate role in the management of hospitals.  Given their influence over the allocation of resources it is important that the involvement of consultants in the management process be recognised and structured appropriately. I am happy that the revised contract will achieve this objective and that the functioning of hospitals will be the better for it.</P>
    <P>The wide range of initiatives and concrete developments I have outlined to the House clearly demonstrates that the Government have acted consistently and firmly in relation to the health services. We have not depended on pumping money into the health system in the hope that problems will just go away.  Instead we have examined problem areas methodically. I and my colleague, the Minister of State, have identified with the help of experts, what needs to be done and set about the implementation process with the same purpose of mind.  An increasing amount of money is being provided each year, and we have discussed that matter here on other occasions.  We will not be pushed into unwise, impulsive action merely to be seen to be doing something. We have a clear view of the direction our health services should take and will <Col N="535" /> continue to implement our approach with conviction.</P>
    <P>The Government have an important job to do keeping the finances in order, continuing to maintain and develop the environment for further job creation, in addition to playing an important role in the building of the new Europe.</P>
    <P>I believe the House should vote confidence in this Government and let them get on with the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>According to all recent opinion polls, two-thirds of the Irish public do not have confidence in this Government. The Government have lost all moral authority to continue in office. Unemployment has risen each month this year in real terms.  It is now at its highest level in the history of the State.  There has been no response, no new initiatives undertaken by the Government to meet this heightening crisis.  The budgetary targets set by the Government in January this year have proved to be fraudulent and false.  The borrowing target is now likely to be, for 1991, £760 million, which is £300 million in excess of the target set for the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has been proved to have been based on unsound and unreal assumptions.  These facts now mean that gardaí, nurses and teachers, who provide invaluable public service, are to be asked yet again to be the sacrificial lambs of Government mismanagement.  Similarly health boards, not least of which mine, the South Eastern Health Board, are being asked to cut back £2.5 million between now and the end of the year. This will mean the closure of wards, cutbacks on dental and speech therapist services and not calling people from waiting lists because money has run out due to economic mismanagement.  Similarly, public transport had to be increased three times this year, way above the current rate of inflation last month, to pay for the Government's errors due to their cutbacks in the subvention to public transport. Thousands of families awaiting local authority housing are left without <Col N="536" /> any hope because of the virtual elimination of the Government's public housing programme resulting in almost 30,000 applicants on their lists.</P>
    <P>Early in 1991 we clearly saw that the budgetary exercise was a cosmetic and fraudulent one designed to deceive the public in the run-up to the local elections. The true state of the public finances and of the economy are only now emerging. On top of that has come public disillusionment, disbelief and anger at the daily revelations of the activities of the &ldquo;golden circle&rdquo; and their special relationship with the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is not yet clear whether the different inquiries set up into Telecom Éireann will reveal the mystery financier or the Cypriot company who handled the massive profits on an over-valued site which Telecom Éireann do not really need.</P>
    <P>It has not been determined whether Stock Exchange rules were breached in terms of disclosure by Sugar Company executives at the time of the public flotation of Greencore.  It has not been explained why the Minister for Agriculture and Food was not aware of the multi-million pound deals in the 49 per cent sale and resale of Irish Sugar Distributors at a profit of £7 million within one year.  It remains to be seen if the exact ownership of Gladebrook, Talmino and other offshore companies will be ever truly established. Some of these matters have not been finally resolved.  However, there is inescapable and conclusive evidence already that the Fianna Fáil Government of 1987-89 deliberately or negligently failed in their supervisory role of these semi-State companies of Irish Sugar and Telecom Éireann.  At the most benign interpretation, Fianna Fáil are guilty of incompetence and negligence.</P>
    <P>The further revelations about National City Brokers, and the personal relationship and friendship of the Taoiseach and members of that Government with Mr. Dermot Desmond, could lead to a more sinister explanation to the greed culture of what has happened.  Fine Gael are appalled at the breach of confidential <Col N="537" /> financial information from the State-owned Irish Helicopters to Mr. Ciarán Haughey's Celtic Helicopters, their principal rival.  This breach of confidentiality by National City Brokers was so unprofessional, so unethical that it is simply not good enough for some junior executive to take responsibility.  I was appalled to hear last Sunday of the open and flagrant boasting and bragging by Mr. Dermot Desmond in his letter to the boss of Pernod Ricard in relation to the services provided in the Irish Distillers deal.  It is remarkable that Mr. Desmond should seek so openly and brazenly in written form to extort additional fees on the basis of his political friends and his alleged exclusive relationship with them.  Moreover, that he would in turn allegedly have to repay to his political friends in some unspecified fashion is both remarkable and shocking.  I should like to refer to the Taoiseach's comments in his speech this morning regarding his relationship with Mr. Dermot Desmond.  He said:</P>
    <P>I had no relationship or association with Dermot Desmond in regard to any other matter in either the area of public administration or the private sector.</P>
    <P>He referred to the Sail Ireland project and the International Financial Services Centre.  The Taoiseach's statement is simply untrue.  He must have had dealings with Mr. Dermot Desmond to appoint him last year as chairman of Aer Rianta.  That is a matter of public record. I will not go into detail about the Angela Phelan and Terry Keane gossip columns which weekly show photographs of Mr. Haughey's family and Mr. Desmond. That is a matter of public record and public titillation.  It stretches credibility when the Taoiseach says he had no relationship or association with Mr. Dermot Desmond other than on those two points.</P>
    <P>Denials have been made by many people but the public are now immune to such denials and do not accept the credibility of many of the principals involved.  No satisfactory explanation has <Col N="538" /> been given regarding the lack of tendering for the consultancy contracts of some semi-State organisations.  I would wish to see a full disclosure of the circumstances and the amounts of money paid by State companies in the context of the Sail Ireland project.  Specifically, I seek clarification by the Minister for Energy in relation to the sum of £250,000 paid by the ESB and the approaches made to them to pay this sum when it was known to all and sundry that the Sail Ireland project was a financial disaster.  I do not believe the ESB got value for money or any particular benefits from their sponsorship.  The question must arise whether representations were made by the Taoiseach in view of his acknowledged support for this project.  He said in his speech that he makes no apologies for supporting it fully.  We need some clarification of his role in relation to that sponsorship and that payment by a company who are in debt and who have increased their charges to the public.</P>
    <P>One of the most hapless and hopeless figures during the Dáil recess was the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy.  This pitiful figure, who was able to moralise about condoms, was not even available for comment through most of the Greencore revelations. Any time he did appear before the public he repeatedly stated that he did &ldquo;not know&rdquo; of any of these details. The question must be asked, if not, why not?  His attack on Mr. Bernard Somers, the accountant, showed that he was both foolish and precipitous in trying to be an over-enthusiastic public watch dog.  All of this would be just sad were it not for the fact that Irish agriculture, farmers and the food industry are facing the most devastating future if the Common Agricultural Policy reforms, as proposed by Commissioner MacSharry, go through. We have already seen in the past two years a 30 per cent drop in farm incomes and the sheer depression and anxiety to be faced in rural Ireland if there are further cutbacks will be unbelievable.  We must obtain at European level a special understanding and derogation in view of our unique dependence on the food <Col N="539" /> industry.  We must be allowed a period of at least six years to phase in these cutbacks in EC supports through the CAP.  It is clear that Irish farmers have no confidence in the ability of the Minister for Agriculture and Food to protect Irish interests.  Only last week we saw his total lack of action when decisions were taken to legalise the importation of beef from Eastern Europe, which will depress further the Irish beef sector.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly serious international damage has been done to the reputation of this country and its ethical standards in business and politics.  It is vital that the Government take immediate steps to act to restore the good name of Irish business and Irish politicians.  Fine Gael demand the immediate establishment of a serious fraud office, not under the Attorney General, as the Taoiseach has proposed, which would entail quasi-political control, but under the Garda Commissioner, who has seen his fraud squad seriously under-resourced.</P>
    <P>It is also a matter of extreme urgency that our political system is seen to be transparent in terms of the links between political parties and the business community. Such transparency can only be brought about by a declaration of interests of politicians which should be made to a Parliamentary Ethics Commission. This should be made up of the Ombudsman, the Comptroller and Auditor General and a High Court judge. There should be a change in the funding of political parties, with a maximum limit on the level of expenditure by political parties in an election, a limit on the contributions that can be made by business or private individuals, and full disclosure. The State should fund the activities at national level of political parties and provide finance for general election campaigns at a limited level.  I believe £1 per person, per year, about £3.5 million, would be the amount of money it would take to clean up our political system, coupled with maximum limits on expenditure. It is wrong to have political parties dependent on voluntary contributions <Col N="540" /> and vulnerable politicians susceptible to the possibility of corruption.</P>
    <P>It is also vital that we have more accountability by the Government to the Dáil.  It has been shown that our procedures for scrutinising legislation and financial affairs do not work.  The fact that over £6 billion of expenditure was rushed through the Dáil in a couple of days is simply unacceptable.  Increasingly we see on Wednesdays in this House guillotine motions introduced to rush through ten, 20 or 30 sections in a period of three hours.  Many Opposition amendments are never reached.  The cosy secrecy between the Government and the Civil Service, in which public services are provided, is not good enough any longer. Fine Gael, therefore, propose the establishment of three strong committees dealing with economic affairs, social affairs and general affairs to deal with the broad range of these vital Government services.</P>
    <P>It is inexplicable that there is still no foreign affairs committee, especially when we saw throughout this over-lengthy Dáil recess so many international developments taking place without comment by the Oireachtas.  On top of these reforms there is the immediate requirement for a freedom of information Act which would open up Government to proper scrutiny and accountability.  We need a Government system that reveals more than it conceals.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to think that all the blame for the present difficulties can be laid at the door of the Taoiseach.  It is a fact that disunity between Government parties has developed over the summer and that there is deep mistrust within the Cabinet.  This has worsened due to the naked leadership contest that is taking place between Cabinet colleagues within Fianna Fáil, given the inevitable demise of Deputy Haughey as leader.</P>
    <P>We are not satisfied with the explanations given so far by the Minister for Education why she paid £1.5 million more for Carysfort College than she could have bought it for some months earlier.  The Minister for Labour has to explain his role in enticing the social partners, and particularly the trade union <Col N="541" /> movement, into believing that pay increases could be paid as laid out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which were known to be unsoundly based and were known at the time to be unreal by any independent analysis.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has not only made a total mess of this year's financial management of the country but also faces serious questions which will be resolved in the context of the Goodman inquiry into his role as Minister for Industry and Commerce in the issuing of export credit insurance to that organisation.  He has not explained, in the context of Mr. Dermot Desmond's letter to Pernod Ricard, his role in the monopolies and mergers legislation at the time of the Irish Distillers takeover that Mr. Desmond said was so favourable to the French drinks company.  It is also obvious that his corrective action in the Dáil recess to rectify the budgetary disarray of this year will, in fact, not save £100 million, but rather £30 million.  He seems so preoccupied with cultivating backbenchers and developing his leadership ambitions that he is doing an exceedingly weak job in his present Ministry.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are showing this week that they have lost all political nerve and credibility.  It is undoubtedly the case that in opposition they would be leading the charge with calls for &ldquo;high standards in high places&rdquo;. This does not even figure on their agenda of discussions in terms of the future life of this Government.  I understand the final act of this charade will be concluded tomorrow in relation to an agreement on the remaining life of this dying Government. The real story of this week is that the Progressive Democrats have been blinded to the reality of the current scandals.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to escape the principle of collective responsibility by all members of this Government and a change of leadership in Fianna Fáil will not reduce the lack of confidence of Fine Gael in this Government.  Fine Gael believe that this Government should be replaced by a Fine Gael led Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="542" /> Our priorities are the development of an enterprise society in a developing Europe.  We want quality public services within a liberal and tolerant society with a pluralist ethos.  We want to shift the tax burden away from employment to reduce the cost of creating a job.  We want to set up a national jobs forum with the political and social partners to provide long term planning and solutions to our employment requirements.</P>
    <P>We believe the productive capacity of the economy can be improved and made more competitive by an integrated transport policy.  I quote the Tánaiste's own area of responsibility in relation to ports. Virtually 100 per cent of everything that is imported and exported in relation to our manufacturing industry comes through our ports, yet they operate outdated legislation passed in 1946.  They require the Minister's approval fo everything, from selling property to commissioning a loan to superannuation. There is the most deep rooted bureaucracy as well as totally outdated industrial relations practices.  This is, in effect, a tax on everything that moves in and out of this country.</P>
    <P>As an island economy there is no more critical factor in developing the productive side of the economy than having a dynamic new structure for the ownership and deregulation of our ports.  We need to implement the investment programme to ensure that our roads are brought up to a European standard and we have seen that the proposals of the Minister for the Environment as announced on 6 March this year, modest and all as they were, will not now be implemented in relation to new starts on national primary roads at a time when our transport costs are twice the European average.  If we are to overcome our peripherality we must get an integrated transport plan together. Let us not be so taken up with our island status that we believe we cannot achieve success in relation to this.  When we look at Japan and New Zealand and their real peripherality on the other side of the southern hemisphere we see that we are not truly peripheral and that if we take the correct decisions we can grow and <Col N="543" /> expand.  The present lack of commitment on the part of the Minister for the Environment in meeting his own modest proposals earlier this year in terms of a national major roads development has been simply appalling.</P>
    <P>In terms of the tax code we need a new starting rate of tax of 15 per cent for low paid workers.  It is wrong that our lowest rate of tax is so high.  We need to have an intermediate rate that low paid workers can lock on to.</P>
    <P>We need to restore the incentive for work by reintroducing some tax-free allowance for children because under our social welfare system, the more child dependants they have the more people are paid.  Under our present income tax system one gets the same tax-free allowance irrespective of whether one has no children or ten children.  The reality is that there is no incentive for people with large families to go to work.  We need to change our industrial policy by switching IDA capital grants, which are not linked to job creation, to tax credits on actual jobs created.</P>
    <P>We need to extend our training and education programme to improve the skill levels of potential employees.  We need to extend the scope of the social employment scheme for the long term unemployed so that more people on the live register can find gainful employment opportunities.  We need retraining vouchers for people who are made redundant at an older age.  Most of all, we need sectoral development that will create jobs.</P>
    <P>In the food sector Fine Gael believe that grant aid should be geared to proposals which only have a detailed marketing strategy.  For each food product there should be an Irish food quality mark for the health conscious European consumer.  Financial support should be available to producer goods to provide guarantees of quality and continuity of supply.  We need to enact a new food safety Act to raise standards.  There is huge potential to assist the level of timber imports into Ireland by the substitution of Irish timber products.  Fine Gael believe <Col N="544" /> that instead of setting up tax avoidance attractions in the form of the Financial Services Centre which will not actually create more jobs but will rather switch white collar employment from one side of town to the other, we should be establishing an international telecommunications service centre to attract specialist telecommunications based industries to Ireland in the areas of telephone sales organisations, information trading companies and value added network services.  These are real employment opportunities unlike the German brass plate companies which have been attracted to the Financial Services Centre and whose employment content is only cosmetic.  It is vital that, in all these areas of economic activity and job creation, Fine Gael restore some level of hope that there will be a dynamic economic future for this country.</P>
    <P>The most damning indictment of this Government was the horrendous queue of young people to post applications at the GPO in the recent postal dispute for the 16,000 Morrison visas for people to get out of this country.  Young people have lost all faith in the present Government. It is obvious, given the events of recent weeks and the parliamentary meetings of recent weeks, that many Fianna Fáil backbenchers if offered a free vote in this debate would not have confidence in this Taoiseach.  Recent statements by Fianna Fáil backbenchers have clearly demonstrated their lack of confidence in their party leadership.  At this time of huge international change, the dismantling of Communism, the opening up of Eastern Europe and the abolition of apartheid, we should be preparing for the vital changes that are necessary for the Single European Market.  Instead we are beset with scandals, demoralised through financial mismanagment, facing cutbacks in essential services of education, health and housing and on top of this, we have a flurry of industrial disputes due to the Government reneging on pay commitments which they freely entered into only a few months ago.</P>
    <P>I will finish with the obvious conclusion that with over 20 per cent unemployed <Col N="545" /> and with more than 160,000 people emigrating in recent years this Government depend on the economies of America and Britain to resolve their failures in the employment arena.  This Government have lost their moral authority to govern and should allow the public to decide whether it wants them to continue in office.  Fine Gael are determined that the golden circle of which we have had glimpses in recent months will not only be fully exposed but disbanded.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt the vast majority of people in this country feel totally nauseated by the hypocritical stance of the Opposition in putting down a motion of no confidence in the Government.  It appears to me that the combined Opposition parties are motivated by one issue and one issue only &mdash; to undermine, by whatever means, fair or foul, mostly foul, the credibility of this Government.  They are not concerned with the national interest.  They are not concerned in any way with the adverse effects of their actions and statements on the required confidence in our economy &mdash; confidence which was restored by this Government after the disastrous period of office of the Fine Gael-Labour Government. They deliberately ignore, for the basest of political reasons, the widely accepted view that this Government have, since coming into office, injected a new spirit of confidence and enthusiasm for the future, resulting in new investments, 40,000 net new jobs and new hope for further development.  While this may not be enough jobs, we are en route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The simple answer to the plethora of allegations now being levelled at the Government, and at individual members in particular, is that no Government can legislate for human behaviour.  The Opposition parties know this full well &mdash; indeed my colleague the Minister for <Col N="546" /> Tourism, Transport and Communications indicated how well they should know &mdash; but in their rush to burnish their tarnished image they follow every rumour, piece of gossip and tittle tattle for the sake of even a single mention in the media, and all the better if they can be portrayed as taking a high moral stance on these issues.  I reject their pinchbeck moralism.</P>

      <P>Much of what the Opposition spokes-people have been doing over the past number of weeks has been blatant band wagoning, in itself an indication of the paucity of ideas which is now evident on the opposite side of this House.  They have taken all their cues from media reports &mdash; despite their often privately expressed contempt for the media and its activities.  In essence their performance has been nothing short of a complete sham and underscores yet again the absence of concrete policy proposals for the overall good of the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy John Bruton and his colleagues have great reliance on a recent opinion poll.  What are the facts?  In 1989, 43 per cent of the opinion polls supported Fianna Fáil while 41 per cent supported them in the most recent poll.  What support have Fine Gael?  They had 31 per cent support in 1989&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make another <Col N="547" /> point for Deputy Bruton who, like a blind Samson when he cannot see where he is going, is anxious to pull down the whole edifice.  In 1989 his predecessor, Deputy Alan Dukes, had 69 per cent support while he now has 39 per cent support. Deputy Alan Dukes supported this Government from 1987-89 and Deputy Bruton should remember that as a result of giving that support he gained four seats for the Fine Gael Party, which is more than his successor is headed for now.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier it comes as no surprise that the response of the Opposition to the country's economic and social challenges is a motion of no confidence, negativism. It is both an ironic and an appropriately timely reminder to the people and the electorate of the legacy left by the Opposition, when last in Government, to Ireland and its people: confidence in its financial system at rock bottom; confidence in its currency at the lowest ebb possible; confidence by the business community non-existent; confidence in its economy lower than it has ever been; and the people's confidence simply a thing of the past.</P>
      <P>As a brief reminder to those who may have managed to suppress the trauma in 1983-87, let us not forget some of the more pertinent aspects of their tenure in office; a reckless doubling of the national debt &mdash; this has been stated by several contributors from this side of the House; the complete failure to develop a cohesive and unified team approach to the management of the economy; and the collapse of investment reflecting despair at the impotence of Fine Gael and Labour. In the end Ministers allocated double jobs before the Government finally collapsed and came before the people who at the ballot box rejected them fully and comprehensively.  It is against this bleak background that the achievements of the Government between 1987-89 and from 1989 to date can be contrasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Aegam memento rebus in arduis servare mentem</i>&mdash; remember to keep a calm mind when times are troublesome.  I would commend those wise words to those across the floor who, of late, have <Col N="548" /> been prone to exaggerated, even apocalyptic forecasts about the current and medium-term direction of our economy.</P>
    <P>A calm and measured approach to the difficulties we are facing is not only advisable but essential if the challenges posed are to be met and overcome.  Since coming into office this Government have provided a steady hand at the tiller and have already demonstrated their willingness and capability to take corrective action to keep the ship on course, despite the hollow criticisms of those opposite who lacked the courage to do what needed to be done, and had it been done Ireland would now be a better place to live in.</P>
    <P>The benefit of the corrective measure taken last July to reduce the emerging budgetary over-run &mdash; I dispute the figures given by Deputy Yates &mdash; will not begin to have full impact until the final quarter of this year.  However, it is perfectly clear from the end-September Exchequer returns that Exchequer borrowing can be expected to turn out close to 2 per cent of GNP even before taking account of the significant proceeds from the Irish Life flotation and that the debt-GNP ratio will again decline in 1991.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding our tough policy stance the harsh reality is that we continue to confront a problematic budgetary position next year.  The wisdom of the consensus approach which we have initiated over the last few years, and reasserted earlier this year in the negotiations of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, shows clearly that a unified approach to Government does work.  I want to say here that that consensus approach was worked on very hard by the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey.  This is a tribute to him, and when the economic history of this period is being written, that development of the consensus which he worked so hard at will mark this whole economic period as one of great success.</P>
    <P>The year 1991 has been one of global turmoil.  From the war in the Gulf through the dizzying pace of change in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and the grim and troubling events in <Col N="549" /> Yugoslavia, these have all fed through into an uncertainty on the economic front and we have been confronted with an international downturn which has cast a dark shadow over the domestic economy. As a result, the pace of economic growth is lower than we would otherwise have expected.</P>
    <P>These international events have provided us with a salutary reminder of the limits to which we can insulate the Irish economy from unfavourable external policies and trends.  I have no intention of minimising the difficulties which we face, but neither will I minimise the achievements of this Government and the extent to which the economic fundamentals have been turned around to enable us to overcome our problems.</P>
    <P>Look at some of the facts.  We have one of the lowest inflation rates in the European Community; we have maintained currency value within the EMS; we have improved competitiveness; we have a healthy surplus in the balance of payments; there is a narrowing interest rate differential with Germany; we had an Exchequer borrowing requirement of 2 per cent of GNP last year and, as we now know, it will be close to that again this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This situation is a far cry &mdash; 40,000 net new jobs &mdash; from the days when Fine Gael and Labour were in office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the direct result of the policies we have pursued as well as the support through consensus &mdash; and I would like to emphasise its importance &mdash; of the social partners over the past few years.  Add to this the growth abroad up to mid-1990 which bolstered demand for Irish exports and it can be clearly seen how we came though the late eighties to a situation where we are basically better <Col N="550" /> equipped than before to tackle the difficulties of the present international economic environment.</P>
      <P>Of course the factor of external growth was not within our control; this began to weaken from around the middle of last year.  The slowdown was particularly marked in the United Kingdom and in the United States &mdash; two of our most vital export destinations; Germany comes next, France and then the Netherlands. But even in this area, improvements in competitiveness and investment have ensured that Irish exports have held up well in the circumstances.  Not all of our trading partners have suffered recessionary problems; the experience internationally has been quite varied. Germany saw continued strong growth; the other EMS partners saw a slowdown but not a reverse.  Our performance in 1991 is not aberrant: it is, as we might have expected, in line with the better performing EMS countries.</P>
      <P>The fundamental improvements in economic performance also mean that we will be well positioned to seize the advantage of the world upswing in economic activity as it gets under way, and as envisaged by the key international agencies. It is predicted that growth will return to the UK and the US in the second half of this year and will further improve in 1992.  We can, therefore, chart a steady course towards a more satisfactory domestic growth rate next year.  Consumer spending should begin to pick up as the signs improve; we expect inflation to remain comfortably low and the balance of payments to continue to show a healthy surplus.  And, again, as external growth resumes an upward track we can reasonably expect a recovery in investment and a continued very good export performance.  Of course I do not need to tell the House that the Single Market will bring huge benefits in trade terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, and before the opportunities of a recovery in international growth present themselves, we must confront the short term slowdown in growth and the level of unemployment while maintaining the gains we have made over the past four years.  What we <Col N="551" /> need is less of the gloomy punditry which is commonplace to the Opposition parties and a more cautious and sober assessment of the problems as well as an agreed approach to tackling them where we have the scope to act.  We must continue to take decisive action.  As I mentioned earler, the Government did precisely this last July when we moved swiftly to contain the size of the emerging budgetary gap.</P>
    <P>I must stress again, as I have been doing in speeches to other fora, and as I will continue to do, the imperative of holding firm on the present strategy, backed up by the support of the social partners.  Nothing I have read or listened to in recent months convinces me that any of us can afford to deviate from that course even in the face of though and often unpalatable decisions which must be taken in the context of next year's budget.  Let no one be under any illusions about this: we have to keep the public finances in shape to underpin our growth potential.  We must also speed up the rate of employment growth &mdash; that is the purpose of the exercise &mdash; and we must maintain competitiveness, profitability and good industrial relations.  In other words, preserve and conserve the gains we have made while implementing the strategies which will enable us to reap the benefits of international upturns.</P>
    <P>Yes, we face tough budgetary decisions as the public expenditure estimates for next year are being finalised.  No area of expenditure can or should be expected to avoid coming under the most detailed scrutiny.  Let me sum up my view of the situation in which we find ourselves: the ship may have run into heavy weather but it is most definitely not adrift and has a good captain in charge.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with my own area of responsibility in the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>Lest it be forgotten, the policy decision to establish a new Government Department to co-ordinate and implement Government policy on the development of marine resources was a Fianna Fáil initiative.  In the past, major areas of <Col N="552" /> marine administration were fragmented with wasteful demarcation lines and overlaps between Departments.  The past few years have witnessed a streamlining of the administration of all the major sectors of the marine industry with effective general control and guidance over the numerous agencies operating under the Department's aegis.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record of the House the achievements of this Government in the marine area.  A number of major policy issues which will have very far-reaching implications for the development and economic well-being of the Irish sea fishing industry are now under active consideration by the European Commission.  I would expect that within the near future and right up to the end of next year decisions of vital importance to our fishing industry will be made in Brussels.  In these circumstances, I consider it to be an absolute priority that the interests of the Irish industry as a whole be taken fully into account before any policy proposals are tabled.</P>
    <P>With this objective in mind, at Fisheries Councils and in bilateral contacts with Vice-President Marin and other Fisheries Ministers, I have underlined my grave concerns about possible policy adjustments which, if implemented, could create major problems for our fishing industry.  In all such cases, I have made it absolutely clear that Ireland's development potential in the fisheries sector must be safeguarded and cannot be bartered away.  In no circumstances am I prepared to contemplate any erosion or diminution of the advantages or opportunities deriving from European Community membership.</P>
    <P>The current negotiations with EFTA countries on the creation of the European Economic Area (EEA) are undoubtedly our most immediate cause for concern, desirable and all as is the creation of the EEA.  In these negotiations with the Community, the EFTA side has sought total liberalisation; in other words, removal of tariff barriers for all fishery products from EFTA countries.  If acceded to, this would be disastrous for our industry as our main markets within <Col N="553" /> the Community would be threatened by imports from the fishing industries of that bloc.  In particular, total liberalisation would seriously threaten the herring and mackerel processing and salmon farming sectors and undermine employment in those communities, particularly in the west and south of Ireland which are heavily dependent upon fishing.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear to the Commission, and indeed in bilateral contacts with the Norwegians and some member states that liberalisation of these three sensitive products cannot be contemplated and in so far as Ireland is concerned is non-negotiable.  I have in discussions with the Irish Fish Producers' and Exporters' Association given assurances that industry concerns on fishery issues could not be set aside in the context of the EEA negotiations.  I would hope that these matters will be satisfactorily resolved from an Irish viewpoint in the current negotiations.</P>
    <P>Another cause for real concern at present is the review of the Community's fishing fleet policy being undertaken in the context of the Multi-Annual Guidance Programme for the fleet for the period 1992 to 1996 and the impact that this could have on essential fleet development. The exercise is taking place against the background of declining fish stocks and overfishing within Community waters as a whole.  In Ireland's case however, it has been clearly demonstrated in our Multi-Annual Guidance Programme submission that there is still scope for some expansion within our fleet to facilitate the take-up of under-utilised quota, mainly white fish species and non-quota species, mainly off our west coast. At present, we simply do not have the type of boat capable of exploiting these opportunities.</P>
    <P>I have made it very clear that I will not accept an across-the-board capacity reduction in the Community fleet as a whole over the next five years without regard to special circumstances of the Irish fleet.  An across-the-board major reduction, while justifiable in Community waters where stocks have declined in recent years and where quotas <Col N="554" /> have been fully exploited, makes no economic or biological sense in the context of the opportunities available in waters off our western and south western coasts.  I am insisting that these factors must be taken fully into account by the Commission before programmes are finalised.  I am pressing, and will continue to press, for a practical recognition by the Commission of the development needs of our fleet over the next five years.  Any decision which fails to take these factors into account will simply not be acceptable.</P>
    <P>Before turning from fisheries issues, I would like to say something about the mid-term review of the Common Fisheries Policy which is scheduled for next year.  Decisions taken in the context of this review will have long term implications for our industry.  The importance, therefore, of articulating Ireland's position prior to next year's negotiations cannot be overstated.  In that regard I would again take this opportunity of congratulating the industry advisory group, under the chairmanship of Dr. T. K. Whitaker, whose recent report and advice have made a valuable contribution towards the policy position being developed by me in this context.</P>
    <P>In preliminary discussions at Council and in contacts with Commissioner Marin, I have already outlined issues that will be of particular concern to Ireland in the review.  It has been made abundantly clear that the Government are determined to secure the future of disadvantaged coastal regions and that they see the development of the fisheries sector, on the basis of the fish stocks contiguous to these regions, as playing a key role in promoting this economic development.  In addition, the Government's concerns, to ensure that the Common Fisheries Policy, in accordance with the Hague principles and stated objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy itself, should continue to promote this development and not act as a constraint, have been forcibly put to the Commission.</P>
    <P>I anticipate very difficult and lengthy negotiations as debate on the review <Col N="555" /> intensifies during the course of next year. My objective will be to secure the best possible deal for our fishermen with particular emphasis on the areas of priority that I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Irish aquaculture is currently worth £30 million.  The annual output of 26,000 tonnes is making a major contribution to the Irish economy/balance of payments and to local economies in isolated coastal regions.</P>
    <P>Government policy has been geared to encouraging production of the main commercial species &mdash; salmonids, mussels, oysters, and clams &mdash; while research and development is well advanced on the commercial potential for new species such as scallops, sea urchins and turbot.</P>

      <P>Having expanded from negligible beginnings in the early eighties it is only in the past few years that this sector has been given the attention it deserves.  Employment full time in the industry is almost 1,000 with a further 1,000 persons employed on a part-time basis.</P>
      <P>With regard to inland fisheries our objective in the medium term is to increase the contribution of the inland fisheries resources to the national economy through increased tourism and development of the home angling base.</P>
      <P>In 1991 we are investing £6.75 million in inland fisheries.  As Deputies also know a Bill setting up a co-operative system to develop inland fisheries has gone through this House and the co-operatives would have been establised but for the gratuitous refusal of Members of the Opposition to take a brief amendment from Seanad Éireann before the recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Harbours were mentioned by Deputy Yates.  In order to maximise the fishery contribution to the economy the industry needs an adequate infrastructure.  To this end the Government are committed to a programme of substantial investment to provide adequate infrastructure at strategically located fishery harbours.  The <Col N="556" /> programme I announced last year provides for an investment of some £20 million over the period up to 1993.</P>
    <P>With regard to commercial harbours the Government have sought to ensure that Ireland will have the necessary port infrastructure to compete on equal terms with other member states in the completed internal market.  A committee are sitting on the legislation covering harbours. Projects approved under the operational programme on peripherality include the provision of new and improved handling equipment, extra berthage, docking facilities and port access routes, both road and rail.  Total capital expenditure on commercial ports under the programme will reach almost £69 million.  The bulk of that will be spent at Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Rosslare with aid also going to Drogheda, Dundalk, Foynes, Galway, Kinsale, Limerick and New Ross.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure on commercial harbours in 1991 will be in the region of £17 million.  With regard to ship building we are glad that Damen Shipbuilders have taken over at Verolme and we expect them to be in business very shortly.  I am glad also that in shipping our dead weight tonnage is now 190,000 tons, an increase of 34 per cent since 1986.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Bell Pioneer&rdquo; must be viewed as a breakthrough in that it is the first hatchless container ship to operate anywhere in the world.  It has improved turnaround times at harbours by 40 per cent. It is also a very good ship from the point of view of fuel consumption.  With regard to transport costs, I agree with Deputy Yates that ours are double those on the mainland.  We want to develop a sea bridge through that kind of shipping.  A major study was commissioned by the Government and half paid for by the European Commission on the whole subject of transport.  I do not have time to go into that matter now.</P>
    <P>In the coming session I will introduce a Bill on the safety of passengers being carried for fares on small ferries and small boats.  I established Slánú during the year.  A medium range helicopter is in place and is operating.  In relation to <Col N="557" /> marine research an institute will be set up in a matter of weeks and I am proud to tell the House that under the STRIDE programme £10 million will be available from the European Community for research in my area.</P>

      <P>Listening to the spirited defence of the Government by the Tánaiste who berated Opposition Members for having the cheek to talk about confidence in the Government, one would think that not any member of the Fianna Fáil Party had uttered a word in recent weeks.  Much of what is being said about the Government came from Fianna Fáil backbenchers and most people were grateful for that.  Certainly the polls indicate that their view was not too far off the mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our decision to oppose this motion of confidence is a positive assertion of the disapproval of the ordinary people of the actions of this discredited Government. The people have watched with amazement the unfolding of scandals which have tainted this Government.  The Government cannot now be said to deserve the confidence of the people.  To date the Government have mismanaged the country's finances and have been <Col N="558" /> embroiled in scandals which have bedevilled the political system here in recent weeks.  They have failed also to provide the leadership the people deserve.  This Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition Government for however long they will last, promised the people this economic miracle, but the only people who seem to have benefited from this alleged miracle are the close friends and associates of the Government. Political nepotism appears to be one of their core values.  Individual Ministers and indeed the Taoiseach himself still face serious questions concerning their roles in the various scandals which have been uncovered.  I hope the answers to some of those questions will unfold during this debate over the next few days. It needs to be said that this debate is a charade, a ritualistic debate and vote, but confidence in the Dáil in political life and the system we adhere to is urgently required.  That is a mission in which the Members of this House and the people we represent have a common stake.  By their actions this Government have proved to be blatantly unequal in their treatment of the Irish people, favouring the old boys network and in the process the vast majority of ordinary people are forgotten.  Unemployment has increased, health care has suffered in spite of our warnings and free education is merely an illusion of yesterday.</P>
    <P>The people the Labour Party represent are struggling to survive in the unequal Ireland of the nineties.  The electorate have delivered their warning, a warning that is reflected not only in the latest opinion polls, but in the local elections and the presidential election.  The Labour Party unequivocally adhere to the fundamental belief that health care in particular is a basic human right, so basic a right that there is an explicit obligation on the community to discriminate positively in favour of the poor and those in need.  However, this Government's policy has been to discriminate against the less well off in our community making it increasingly difficult for people on low incomes to secure any access, let alone equality of access.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> Having listened to the Minister for Health today, it is clear that we will never be able to describe health care as a basic human right.  He referred to the Fox report, the Kennedy report and the legislation enacted in 1990, including the Nursing Homes Bill which cannot be brought into operation because he has not signed the ministerial order&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as my colleague has just said, he has no money.  In other words, because he has not signed the order, health boards are not in a position to pay subsistence to old people who need accommodation in nursing homes which cannot be provided by the State.  Is this what society expects our senior citizens to suffer under this Minister for Health and the Government in whom we are asked to have confidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to outline various changes he had made in schemes, including the drug refund scheme &mdash; another three card trick.  Under this scheme a person who spent in excess of £32 on drugs in any one month received a refund, but as a result of the unequal system he introduced on 1 July, people who spend £90 in the final week of a quarter or in the first week of the following quarter, will receive no refund. That is some trick and people will suffer. Those changes were introduced as a cost cutting exercise.  The effects of other health cuts are visible all around us.  The Minister said the same level of service will be maintained in 1991 as obtained throughout 1990, but we know that this is not the case.  The health boards at the end of July &mdash; and I have documentation to prove this &mdash; were millions of pounds in the red because of this Minister's failure to structure health funding.  The Minister promised the health boards that he would recoup their costs in demand led schemes, which he has not done, and today he intimated that he may refund only 50 per cent of the <Col N="560" /> costs which would increase their deficit of almost £20 million even further.</P>
    <P>Mental handicap services are in a crisis. It is a scandal that the parents of children with mental handicap had to picket in cold and wind in O'Connell Street yesterday while today others picketed this House because they do not have a hospital in County Clare.  Last night in Tallaght hundreds of people, in the presence of Deputies Harney and Flood, both Ministers of State, complained that this Government have reneged on their promise to build a hospital in Tallaght, despite the fact that £9 million has been spent since a former Minister for Health, the then Deputy Desmond, left office. What we have been left with is a £9 million hole in the ground in Tallaght and 150,000 people are without a hospital service.  One cannot have confidence in a Government who continue in that vein.</P>
    <P>Why should we not bring these discrepancies to the attention of the public?</P>
    <P>We know in our hearts that everything that has been uttered by Ministers in this debate so far cannot be proved to be correct.  All the documentation coming off the Government production machine seems to imply that things have happened, but nothing we have heard today from Ministers on their performance in their Departments could lead us to have confidence in them.</P>
    <P>It is my contention that this Government have presided over the destruction of the health services.  The concept of a comprehensive health service, free at the point of access, is a decision of principle. No final decision can be made by any Government or any Dáil about the allocation of funding for health services unless it is agreed in advance that access to the health services is a basic human right.  It is clear that this Government do not accept that principle.  It is for that reason alone that I, on behalf of the Labour Party, cannot support this motion of confidence in the Government and I am quite sure that no member of the Labour Party could concede that there is any confidence in this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage we have <Col N="561" /> listened to the Taoiseach's opening contribution and to the contributions of four members of the Cabinet to this debate. They have structured their contributions in two parts, the first part seeks to devalue the concern being expressed nationally and in this Chamber as mere gossip or mischief, and in the second part of every contribution, they give a report on what they suggest is good, better or adequate management of their particular areas and the economy in general. However, there is nobody in this country, among the public or in any specialist role, who is in any doubt but that these two sets of events are inextricably linked, and they are linked as follows.</P>
      <P>In recent times, particularly in the eighties, a culture of financial thinking and economic activity has grown in this country.  For ease of reference that should be called a speculative culture.  It differs from what was old fashioned in the Right, or in the traditional business sector of Irish economic history.  It is not a culture of production; it is not about starting a factory; it is not about producing a commodity which is sold on the domestic market or abroad.  The culture of speculation is about making money in an unaccountable fashion and, if possible, doing so in a way which will not yield one penny to the economy or to the revenues.  The culture of production, on the other hand, might have caused the Labour Party and the parties of the Left traditionally to have arguments in relation to it but it made something, it was caught, if you like, within the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the two sections of the speeches made by the Taoiseach and members of the Cabinet cannot be seen as easily divisible one from the other is that the Government and the parties of the Right are seen more and more as the political expression of a culture of speculation. There are many other elements attached to it.  When people speak about a declaration of interest and so forth they are not talking about a person who might call <Col N="562" /> into a factory at election time and pick up a cheque.  The fact is that the parties of the Right know that the old visits to the factory have given way to the nice, manila envelopes which arrive from the financial sector.  The culture of speculation has been good to the Right in this House and it is because of the incredible dilatory and hopeless nature of financial journalism, economics and formal scholarship, that it has been unable to draw a distinction between a culture of speculation and a culture of production.</P>
    <P>The culture of speculation created a certain kind of an élite in this country, a new class and, whether we like it or not, the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, is seen as part of the circle which goes around the golden circle.  There is a group of élite drones who do not produce, who are proud of not paying their taxes and who are proud to serve &mdash; as they would put it &mdash; on semi-State bodies.  We are supposed to set up an ochón after their leaving and wonder whether we will get their likes again to serve.  They come to their positions at the board meetings with offshore registered companies.</P>
    <P>When I was learning economics a long time ago, we were taught about the relationship of capital, labour and enterprise and about the distribution of wealth.  I remember people in this House who were not anxious to do business with somebody who came waving an offshore tax dodge mechanism.  Let me be blunt about it, I have some sympathy with the Taoiseach when he said pathetically that they were not all his friends, that some of them were friends of others.  The Taoiseach said he was proud to have got someone to produce a boat to go round the world, of which we could all be proud. There is a querulousness and bad temper in the Taoiseach's speech which tells us a lot about his character.  In the beginning, for example, he said in relation to the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition: &ldquo;they have some audacity after the way they devastated the Irish economy and our public finances even to participate in this debate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Later in his speech the Taoiseach referred to Deputy Rabbitte as the <Col N="563" /> anchor man of RTE.  I am glad the Minister for Justice is present as he is closely associated with vindictive attacks on public broadcasting and on RTE.  It is an insult to RTE &mdash; and to Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; to refer to him as an anchor man of RTE.  The Taoiseach is really saying he does not like Deputy Rabbitte being interviewed again and again about matters that discomfit the Taoiseach.  Why does he not have the courage to say so? Of course what we will see are the side-shafts thrown into RTE through the Broadcasting Bill.</P>
    <P>A seedy group of people, who are not associated with producing or selling anything, constituted themselves as a new group.  Through the adulation of certain sections of the public who, in the absence of a royal family, wanted to know who was spending £1,000 on a meal, wasting their money and behaving in a fashion that would have put Caligula to shame, this class were uncomfortably around the Government.  There is no point in the Taoiseach saying he has not spoken to them lately and that he met them only casually.  What were the consequences of putting our trust in that kind of person, in such a group of people?  What were the consequences for the country?</P>
    <P>The public were told that these people have a genius for making money.  They play golf which costs several thousand pounds per hour and the public thought that because they could do that they might be able to do it for everyone.  That is dangerous nonsense.  They engage in speculation, evasion of taxes and are not ashamed of enjoying wealth which has not been produced.  That is the type who were glorified and the result has been the present economic difficulties.  The public are now asking questions and I ask them to think long and hard about the matter.</P>
    <P>When the Mitterrand Government were elected in France a propaganda point was made that international financial business communities would lose confidence in France.  Did the threat to financial propriety and to economic management come in this country from the Left?  The Taoiseach made an arrogant <Col N="564" /> point in his speech when he talked about &ldquo;stuff that comes from what is called the Left&rdquo;.  However, the public would love to know what the Taoiseach calls himself. We know that the people he will not disown are the people who have dragged this country's financial and economic reputation into the gutter.  The questions must be answered.  People who need jobs want a sensible and rational economic approach, they do not want this nonsense that is trotted out insultingly at the beginning of every Dáil term.  There is talk about creating an economic environment, a climate for investment and that the jobs will automatically come.</P>
    <P>I remember being mocked in this House when I said that you could have economic growth, a low interest rate, good trade figures, a good balance of payment figures and still have an absence of investment which gave the required jobs.  I spoke bluntly about the difference between market economies that regard the social results as a residuum of market forces and of social economy drawn from the old-fashioned version of political economy in which the economy was used as an instrument to pursue job creation based on international traded commodities. There was an ideological opposition to such a view and now the public might well ask if it would not have been better to have had confidence in people like their sons and daughters who worked in the State and semi-State sectors. Would it not have been better to have capitalised the semi-State sector properly instead of taking people from the speculative end of financial services and planking them on the semi-State bodies?  I mean bringing the capital side of the semi-State bodies into correctness and enabling them, because of their scale &mdash; they could hire marketing, research and development &mdash; to trade abroad.  That strategy was available to us.</P>
    <P>What was the role of the credit institutions in all this?  How moral and serious a commitment have they to anything in this country as they report losses made outside this economy?  It would appear that when you put up rather dubious <Col N="565" /> loans you can turn to the credit institutions and get money; effectively, to go to the races for a short term scam.</P>
    <P>At the same time the doors of factories are being closed, workers are losing their jobs and owners of small businesses have to sign in blood for small loans.</P>
    <P>Something good must come from what we are debating, and whether one is of the Left or the Right that is important. It is important that we recognise that the culture of speculative gambling in economic terms is not productive and is not in the national interest.  It will never create jobs.  It is time that some people realised that their deadly anti-State ideology and their blindness in asserting that we must take people from the most dubious kind of fiscal activities in the private sector and move them to the State sector is a prejudiced nonsense.</P>
    <P>Bord Telecom are a marvellous company, even on a world scale, because we borrowed money in the seventies to invest in the telephone system.  That belongs to the public; why should it be stolen from them.  It is not something of wires and exchanges that had magic worked upon it by one individual.  That is the kind of nonsense we have had to put up with, people saying that they performed miracles like striking rocks when describing their performance in the semi-State sector.  There was a public investment in this company.  There are hundreds of thousands of people who are proud to work honestly and give of their intelligence in using the capital being provided by the Irish taxpayer.  There are more than one million, I am sure, who despise those who will not work or create wealth, who do not want what they do to create jobs for their fellow citizens but want to take their little bit of gain, put it in a company outside this jurisdiction and avoid paying tax.  The people are weary of the kind of moral turpitude that is at the basis of our present economic structures. They hear such a phrase as &ldquo;a mezzanine company&rdquo;, that lovely piece of language, which means yet another intermediate device to avoid the obligation of paying tax of one form or another.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> The crowds came out against a wealth tax, which was very small here, one of the smallest in Europe.  It yielded very little but it yielded information on the structure and nature of wealth.  That was information we badly needed.  It was not intended to take something from people that was unreasonable; it was simply to distinguish between productive wealth and speculative wealth.  If we knew what was productive wealth we would have a better idea of how to structure an economic incentive system that would extend its productive capacity, create jobs and, in turn, create revenue.  It was of course the people who were making the quick speculative money who were able to organise political opposition to the wealth tax.  That was killed off not for what it yielded in its very short time but for what it was making known.  This present crisis is a crisis of that kind of thinking.  I advise those who are fortunate enough to be able to make academic commentaries on the way we run things to think of this distinction.</P>
    <P>When I was studying economics, when one looked at the share quotation of a company, it had something to do with its assets, its materials, its trading patterns, its future policies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am simply saying one cannot break one's speech into two to say: &ldquo;These are all rumours and I am now going to talk about what my Department are doing&rdquo;.  That is pathetic.  The way a Department is run is affected by the kind of Government we have, and that is affected by the kind of political culture we support.  I could have been specific about my area, the Gaeltacht.  What has the Minister for the Gaeltacht done to encourage my confidence, be it in terms of Telefís na Gaeltachta, labhairt na Gaeilge or school textbooks in Irish?  I could have spoken about foreign affairs.  What <Col N="567" /> has been done in that area?  There has been a pathetic retreat from a moral responsibility at a time of death in Africa. The Government have retreated from their overseas development aid commitments. They have insulted the House in terms of a foreign affairs committee. It would be wrong to say that this gives one pleasure, but it is certainly appropriate that this House expresses its lack of confidence in the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to put before this House the reasons that a vote of confidence in this Government should be unequivocally carried by the Dáil at this time.  As Minister for Justice with the safety and security of our citizens as my chief concern, I am determined that this country should be guided into a new age where all may feel secure and where the law serves as a protection and a support for our people rather than a burden which diminishes their lives.  To this end, since I became Minister for Justice in 1989, an unprecedented legislative programme has been put in place which will only be surpassed by the programme which I shall introduce in the next two years of Government.</P>
      <P>To give examples, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, makes it an offence to incite hatred against persons on account of their membership of certain minority or vulnerable groups. The Larceny Act, 1990, replaces the existing offence of receiving stolen property with a new offence of handling stolen property.</P>
      <P>The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, has greatly strengthened the Garda in dealing with those who carry weapons such as stun guns, crossbows and knives on our streets or for use for some criminal purpose.  It was my privilege, in the Criminal Justice Act, 1990, to finally remove the death penalty from our Statue Book while ensuring that what were previously capital offences would incur a penalty of life imprisonment with a minimum mandatory term of 40 years to be served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> The Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, provided for radical reform of the law on rape and indecent assault.  It made marital rape a crime and extended the definition of rape to provide the maximum psychological as well as legal protection for victims.  The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, provides the Garda with power to obtain bodily samples from persons suspected of serious crimes for the purpose of forensic testing.  The Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991, is designed to deal with the problems that arise when a child is abducted across international frontiers in defiance of a court order or against the wishes of the other parent.</P>
    <P>The Contractual Obligations (Applicable Law) Act, 1991, enabled Ireland to ratify the Rome Convention in the law applicable to international contacts which is complementary to the EC Judgments Convention.  The Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1991, amends the law on the limitation of actions in personal injury cases and provides for new and better rules on when the limitation period for the commencement of legal proceedings begins to run in cases of latent personal injuries.</P>
    <P>The Courts Act, 1991, increased the civil jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts and increased the number of High and Circuit Court judges and justices of the District Court.  It also provides for the service of District Court summons by post.  The Courts (No. 2) Act, 1991, amends the law relating to the execution of District Court warrants for arrest and imprisonment for non-payment of fines.  The Criminal Damage Bill, 1990, which is at Committee Stage in this House, simplifies and modernises the whole law of malicious damage to property. It also makes it an offence to get access to a computer system without authority &mdash; what is usually called &ldquo;hacking&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>By any reckoning this is an impressive and substantial catalogue of legislative achievement over the past two years. However, there are a number of very <Col N="569" /> important legislative proposals being prepared which I am committed to seeing enacted into law over the next two years including a Bill to provide for the confiscation of the proceeds of crime to which I am giving urgent priority to provide for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other crimes and the prevention of &ldquo;money-laundering&rdquo;. The Bill is currently being drafted and I hope to circulate it during the current session.  The Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulations) Bill will regulate on a statutory basis interception of communications for the purposes of criminal investigation and State security.  The Solicitors (Amendment) Bill will be circulated to Deputies very shortly.  It will take account of many of the recommendations made by the Fair Trade Commission in their report on the legal profession, including complaints machinery, multi-disciplinary and multi-national practices involving solicitors, fee advertising, easier interchange between the professions and consumer protection through indemnity insurance.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law Bill will modernise the underlying basis of our criminal law by abolishing the distinctions between offences known as felonies and misdemeanours and by abolishing penal servitude and hard labour.  The Criminal Evidence Bill will be published in the next few weeks.  It will make business and administrative documents, including computerised records, admissible in evidence. It will make it easier for children and persons with mental handicap to give evidence in cases of physical or sexual abuse.  It will also set out clearly the circumstances in which the spouse of an accused person is competent and compellable to give evidence for the prosecution, the accused person or a co-accused.</P>
    <P>The Courts and Courts Officers Bill provides for the establishment of a Court of Civil Appeal which will help to reduce the workload of the Supreme Court and thus reduce delays in that court.  In the family law areas, The Family Home Bill is being prepared to give each spouse <Col N="570" /> equal rights of ownership in the family home and contents.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill is under preparation to amend the law on criminal insanity.  Certain issues are being examined in the context of the legislation. These include fitness to plead, verdicts of &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; the right of appeal and the introduction of a concept of &ldquo;diminished responsibility.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission's report on receiving stolen property which led to the drafting of the Larceny Act, 1990, was the first stage in the commission's overall examination of the law in relation to dishonesty generally.  The commission are currently putting the finishing touches to the proposals for reform of the law on that subject and the report is expected soon.  The commission's examination includes consideration of offences of larceny, false pretences, fraudulent conversion as well as false accounting, other fraud offences, offences relating to computers, conspiracy to defraud, forgery, counterfeiting and related matters.  The thrust of these proposals is to tackle the problem of so-called white collar crime and computer fraud.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention to make whatever changes are necessary in the criminal law in this area to modernise it and make it as effective as possible.</P>
    <P>There are a number of further legislative proposals being prepared in my Department at present.  Work is under way on the preparation of a Juvenile Justice Bill to replace the Children's Act, 1908.</P>
    <P>There are also proposals to achieve savings in costs and in Garda time through changes in procedure in criminal cases, to change the law on homosexual offences, to comply with the judgment of the Court of Human Rights, to place the civil legal aid scheme on a statutory basis, to make changes in the statutory criminal legal aid scheme, and to convert the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds into a semi-State body.</P>
    <P>In relation to family law, an interdepartmental review of developments in the area of marital breakdown is nearing completion.  The outcome of that review <Col N="571" /> will be reflected in a White Paper which will be published shortly by the Government. The issues which arise in endeavouring to determine the most appropriate response to marital breakdown are clearly wide-ranging and complex; inevitably they are matters which can give rise to strongly held and often opposing views.  Nevertheless, I am confident that the proposed White Paper will make a very significant contribution in the effort to ensure that effective policies exist to assist in the preservation of stable marriages and that appropriate responses are available where marriages break down.</P>
    <P>It must be agreed that this is a substantial programme of legislative reform. However, the area of law enforcement is not one which has been neglected by the current Government.</P>
    <P>This Government have always listed the fight against crime among our top priorities.  We realise that crime is an issue which gives rise to public concern and the record of the Government in providing resources to the Garda to enable them to meet the challenge of the criminal head-on is second to none.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years I have secured the Government's agreement to a number of packages of measures which greatly increased the Garda Síochána's capacity to fight crime.  I will remind Deputies of some of these measures: by December 1,000 Garda trainees will have been recruited to the force since 1989; a new competition to recruit a further 1,000 Garda trainees over the next few years is now under way; 350 experienced gardaí and sergeants have been retained in the force for an additional year by reason of the Government's decision to raise the retirement age of these ranks; civilian recruitment to the Garda has been introduced on a scale unknown since the establishment of the force seventy years ago.  Two hundred and fifty civilian clerical staff are being recruited for the purpose of releasing desk-bound gardaí for outdoor duties; the management of the Force has been greatly strengthened by over 660 promotions in its ranks in the <Col N="572" /> past two years; this year alone, £10 million is being provided to purchase the most modern and effective equipment available for the Garda; and by December, £40 million will have been spent on the current Garda building programme to upgrade the accommodation in Garda stations throughout the State, and since the commencement of the programme, some 55 large stations, mainly of divisional and district headquarters size, will have been completed and occupied by the Garda.</P>
    <P>With regard to policing systems, I have over the past few years approved a number of important initiatives.  These include: the total reform of the juvenile liaison service and the establishment of a national office to oversee its countrywide operation; the implementation of a number of community-based initiatives, in areas which have seen repeated occurrences of crime, designed to win over the support of the community in stamping out petty crime and vandalism; the establishment of a Garda schools programme where community gardaí visit schools on a regular basis; and the introduction of the new community policing initiative in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the new community policing scheme represents a watershed in the organisation and delivery of police services in this country.  For the first time in the history of the State, the Garda authorities have been given the go-ahead to move away from a policing system rooted in the 1800's to one which addresses the more complex policing needs of modern society and the infinitely more demanding crime problems which now confront us.</P>
    <P>The aims of the community policing scheme are to provide a more efficient Garda service, to ensure greater availability of gardaí to the public and to give the community a more personalised and caring service.</P>
    <P>Critics of the new scheme have labelled it a cost-saving exercise which is intended to reduce Garda manpower and resources in rural areas.  Others have accused both myself and the Garda authorities of introducing the new scheme as <Col N="573" /> a front for the closure and downgrading of rural Garda stations.  Nothing could have been further from the truth. Already the people residing in those districts where the first phase of the scheme has been introduced are seeing additional resources.  Communities are experiencing the influx of new Garda cars, witnessing the arrival of additional Garda personnel and seeing more of the gardaí who are being released from outdated record-keeping in favour of active outdoor duty.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that the introduction of the scheme has gone very smoothly.  The scheme will be formally reviewed three times in the coming six months by Garda management to resolve any teething problems which arise during implementation.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my outline of our future legislative programme, the Government are determined that all appropriate measures will be taken to combat serious financial fraud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>And planning fraud?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Our approach to the challenge posed by large scale fraud has and will continue to be directed towards enhancing the capacity of the criminal justice system as a whole to deal with the problem.  That will involve improving our capacity to detect and investigate those offences.  Likewise, it will involve measures to improve our capacity to successfully prosecute those offences which come to light.  Much work has already been done to this end.  I have already initiated the first comprehensive review in recent years of the operation of the Garda Fraud Squad.  This was undertaken by Garda management who have now completed a detailed report on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That report is now with me and the House may be assured that its recommendations will be given effect.  The recommendations which the report contains extend over a wide area and will involve a significant strengthening of the fraud squad itself through restructuring, the allocation of additional resources and <Col N="574" /> improvements in training.  Moreover, the report contains recommendations &mdash; which I particularly welcome &mdash; to strengthen the links between the fraud squad and other professional bodies and agencies, such as the professional accountancy bodies, which have the ability to make significant contributions to the success of Garda investigations.</P>
    <P>The Government, as I have already indicated, are determined to ensure that our criminal justice system has the capacity to deal with fraud in all its guises. It will be clear from what I have just outlined that the groundwork, which will ensure that our approach will be comprehensive, has already been done.</P>
    <P>This Government are not concerned with reform which only amounts to a mere tinkering with the existing approach, but are preparing fundamental changes which will significantly alter the balance against those who are guilty of perpetrating fraud in our society.</P>
    <P>As part of that approach, a variety of options are and will be considered.  One such initiative which has already been mentioned by the Taoiseach is the establishment of a serious fraud office which would be responsible for both the investigation and prosecution of serious fraud offences along the lines of the serious fraud office in the UK.  I understand that the establishment of this office represented a major and quite successful approach towards tackling this very complex area of crime and it is entirely appropriate that we should give very serious thought here also to the establishment of something on these lines.</P>
    <P>Many references have been made, a Cheann Comhairle, to the irregularities which have received prominence of late in our media.  It would, of course, be entirely inappropriate for me to make any comment on these matters on which certain investigations and inquiries are presently under way.  Indeed, I want to emphasise that my references to fraud generally and the capacity of the criminal justice system should not be taken as carrying any implication that the occurrence of fraudulent practice has been established in any of these cases.  That is <Col N="575" /> simply not so, and I want to make it absolutely clear that I do not suggest otherwise.</P>
    <P>My comments are of a general nature and my message simply is that the Government are prepared to tackle the problem of fraud head-on.  The reaction by the Government in seeking the truth behind any recent allegation made has been swift, determined and fair; always with concern for the national interest being the primary and basic consideration behind any action taken.</P>
    <P>The Government have dealt resolutely and determinedly with all these controversies and will not be deflected from their course, which is to get to the bottom of each of them.  It is this determination and the action which has arisen from it which should give the Irish public the assurance they expect and demand.  All questions will be answered, all doubts about the propriety of dealings will be dealt with and all allegations will be investigated.  This Government are determined that this will be so and all may take comfort and confidence from this commitment.</P>
    <P>Of course, that is not to say that all allegations will be borne out.  This brings me to a question which I feel must be posed.  Do any of the parties sitting opposite me actually propose that they could offer a Government in which this House can express any sense of confidence?</P>
    <P>I have little doubt that my other colleagues will speak at great length about the role of Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the events of the past few weeks. I, however, would like to consider the role of The Workers' Party.  Last Sunday we heard the leader of that party speak to us on RTE radio station about the ethical standards in Irish politics and business.</P>
    <P>Surely there is no greater ethic than that which protects and guards the sanctity of human life, yet he was strangely silent when a recently produced British <Col N="576" /> television programme, the BBC's &ldquo;Spotlight&rdquo; programme, was broadcast.</P>

The continued existence of the Official IRA was attested to by Dr. Brian Mawhinney, Northern Ireland's Minister, when on 11 December last in the House of Commons in reply to a question by John Taylor, <Col N="580" /> he said, &ldquo;I believe the Official IRA still exists&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party Leader is very concerned about contacts at the highest level of politics and has suggested there is something behind the old truism which declares that by their friends you shall know them.</P>
      <P>Well, who are the contacts; who are the natural allies of The Workers' Party? It is true that some are no longer in a position to reciprocate their comradery, but, by their own admission, they have included the Governments of North Korea, East Germany and the Ceausescu regime of Communist Romania.</P>
      <P>Of course, in relation to North Korea, in particular, that country appeared to feature prominently in the travel arrangements of the top brass of The Workers' Party, Messrs Mac Giolla, Garland and others.  And Ireland, in turn, at various Ard Fheiseanna of The Workers' Party, has been honoured by the visits of various foreign delegations who, no doubt, made contributions of great intelligence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They never explained what the purpose of this contact was or whether any funding or other material assistance was derived from these contacts. More fundamentally, The Workers' Party have never indicated in what way the national interest was, is, or could have been served by these contacts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard Deputy De Rossa call for a full, frank and open debate on the scandals which came to light since August and that came from the leader of a party who in less than two decades have changed their name four times.  It was Sinn Féin; then it was Official Sinn Féin; <Col N="581" /> then Sinn Fein the Workers Party and today we have The Workers' Party.  They have out Windscaled Sellafield.</P>
    <P>What purpose do The Workers' Party hope to achieve with their role in the current spate of so-called revelations? Perhaps they are conscious that the dogma of socialism, for which they are champions, has been rejected by virtually every nation that has practised it, willingly or unwillingly, over the last 70 years.  Surely they recognise that they will be unable now to sell this failed ideology to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>They obviously understand that the only means they have of participating in government is by undermining the faith and hopes of the Irish people, bringing into question the integrity of every Irish institution and cynically using the Irish media to sell themselves as a high-minded alternative.</P>
    <P>Is that an alternative to a Government who over the past two years have proved themselves to be imaginative, efficient, effective and dedicated to the beneficial development of all the people of all of Ireland?  I have no hesitation in urging this House to declare its confidence in this Government.</P>

I make no apology to any side of the House for calling the father of the House, former Minister of many portfolios and, consequently, entitled to be heard.  In so far as this Chair is concerned he has a particular regard to uphold the rights of minorities in this House.

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this debate, in a sense it is a cause of wonder that we are debating whether there should be confidence in this Government and that that appears to be related almost entirely, if not solely, to the recent scandals, scams or allegations of such that have been made in the financial world all around us &mdash; in semi-State boards, private boards and so on.  These have not yet been proven.  Nor has there been any proof yet adduced to connect the Government or their Ministers with any wrongdoing that may emerge as a result of the tribunals and investigations going on.  Though these scandals have not been proven it looks fairly likely that some of them will be proven.  On the other hand there has been no evidence of Government or ministerial involvement.  Again due to persistent media and reportage of those making the allegations, innuendos, it would appear that there is a perception of guilt on the part of or in relation to Ministers and/or the Taoiseach as the case may be; a perception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the dangers I see emerging from all of this is that perceptions can destabilise Government, diminish respect for this House and every Member of it.  Generally speaking we ourselves have been our worst enemies, as Members of this Parliament, over the years in adding to that concept popularly put around: oh sure, they are all the <Col N="584" /> same.  Well, they are not all the same because, if they were all the same, we would not be debating anything here this evening; we would all be in the same boat.  Naturally we would not start fighting about the boat or its nature if we were all the same.</P>
    <P>On the so-called scandals, and the allegations of scandals and scams &mdash; again perhaps I am being unfair &mdash; but I do feel that, not being in Government, or sufficiently close to Government to know what is the scene at present, what it has been in the recent past, or indeed over the past ten to 20 years since I was in Government, Ministers, under whose jurisdiction boards have been established &mdash; were I in their place &mdash; even if only out of curiosity would like to have known fairly frequently what was going on.  That has not been demonstrated fairly clearly to be the case.  It would appear from what I have been hearing from the Government side this evening &mdash; and I am sure if the Opposition were in Government they would be telling us the same thing &mdash; that they have given freedom to those boards they have appointed in order that they may the better compete commercially with the private sector or with such boards in other countries in international trade.  Perhaps that is the answer.</P>
    <P>I am not passing judgment.  I am not seeking to pass judgment.  I do not believe we should be wasting our time &mdash; and it is a waste of time &mdash; other than to correct allegations that have not been proved or to put it to the public that, as yet, these are only allegations, that we should await the outcome of the investigations and tribunals before we start pointing the finger and accusing this, that or the other person of wrongdoing.  If and when those investigations show that any people, whether inside or outside this House, in Government or in Opposition, have any connection with them, then they should be dealt with thoroughly, completely, properly, justly but, above all, that they will be exposed.</P>
    <P>My concern about voting confidence in this Government has little to do with the news-making scandals of these past <Col N="585" /> weeks.  Rather do I go back over some period to examine this Government's performance, to examine it from the point of view of the circumstances prevailing in this country, regardless of interest rates, balance of payments deficits and all the things that have been properly trotted out by Government spokesmen as their achievements.  Despite all of these &mdash; and they have painted a very good picture from the material at their disposal &mdash; what we do have to keep in mind &mdash; and this applies to all the parties in the House perhaps with the exception of The Workers' Party who I do not think really existed at the time about which I am speaking &mdash; is that we started borrowing in 1972.  It is very interesting that the Minister whom I think was mainly responsible for that at the time is now the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He began in 1972 on the basis that, because of the oil crisis, we could not run our current budget and balance the books.  We had an election in 1973 won by a Coalition who, in the following four years, in addition to the couple of millions of pounds that Deputy Desmond O'Malley and his then Government in 1972 might have borrowed, ran up a debt on current spending of £6 billion.  That was the figure for the first four or five years of our spending spree; the rakes progress had started.  In the following election in 1977 Fianna Fáil had their largest ever majority.  Lo and behold, from 1977 to 1981 we doubled the national debt, again on current spending, not balancing our books.  I might add that up to 1972 in the history of this parliament we had never budgeted for a deficit.  We had never budgeted for a deficit in the 13 years in which I was a Minister in a Fianna Fáil Government.  It was unheard of.  We began in a small way in 1972 but, by the year 1977, we were £6 billion in the red. By the year 1981 we were £12 billion in the red.  Between a short term of a Fianna Fáil Government and another Coalition, up to 1987, our debt had increased to £25 billion, with not a thing to show for it because it was all spent on housekeeping. <Col N="586" /> That figure of £25 billion is today £27 billion-plus.  It will be wished away by telling us that it is a lesser percentage of GNP by far than it was ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The fact is we still owe more than £27 billion and we have nothing to show for it except cut after cut, a diminution of the services to our people and a rising debt.  Call it a percentage of what you will, it does not add up to proper government or good government.  It ill behoves those in Government to castigate the Opposition about it, and it ill behoves the main Opposition party to castigate the Government about our present economic situation.  All together were responsible for it &mdash; the rake's progress, the elections by auction.  We have not had a Government properly elected since 1969. The dog was fed with a bit of his own tail in every election since then.  Governments were put out rather than Governments returned.  By auction we did it and this is the result.</P>
    <P>In the early eighties there were 60,000 people unemployed; the figure now is nearly 260,000 and rising.  Half a million of our young people have gone in the same decade and work is not available for those coming on the market.  Surely we should be talking about unemployment, emigration and our incapacity to rectify the debts which we incurred for no good purpose in previous years.  We must try to work ourselves out of those problems rather than borrow further.  We have been trying to borrow our way out of our problems.</P>
    <P>I look at the Government and ask how can I have confidence in them.  Then I look at the other side and ask what confidence I could have in any other concoction. That is the dilemma of the public.  We have all contributed by abusing each other in all sorts of little ways, aided and abetted by the media who gleefully tack on to anything we say about each other.  In the eyes of the public we are all the same.  An election in the morning would not give the public any great glee because they will look as I am looking and ask where we will get a Government that will be any better or worse or do any more or any less than at <Col N="587" /> present.  That is the perception outside. We deserve that perception and we have contributed largely to it, not only by the wrongdoings in our economics and in our financial operations but in our abuse of each other.</P>
    <P>We must consider what we might have done about this and what we still can do about it.  The Government, instead of puffing out the chest and boasting about the good lines they are getting from the international agencies praising them for their achievements in relation to the balance of payments, bringing down inflation and interest rates and so on, should remember that this is being done at the expense of the public and of our emigrants.  Whatever the international agencies may think about our performance, our Government should not feel in any way proud of their achievements when they are at the expense of our people.  Government and Parliament must be about people's wellbeing.  We should not be proud of ourselves in that we have been chasing them out for the past ten years and cutting expenditure on health, roads and education to bring about the improvements which are praised by these international agencies. We should ask if this is the correct way. Are we achieving anything really worth while?  Are we not deluding ourselves when we hear Government spokespeople saying that we have to get inflation and interest rates down and the balance of payments in credit before we can begin to provide jobs for our people?  Where will those people be by then?  Where are they today?  More of them would have left were it not for the recession which has hit our nearest island and the USA as well.  We have nothing to be proud of in our performance as a Government or Parliament over the past 20 years or more.</P>
    <P>This vote of confidence was brought about for the wrong reasons and is being discussed in the light of the wrong reasons, but it is nevertheless a vote of confidence.  How can anybody in his <Col N="588" /> sanity think in terms of a vote of confidence or no confidence in a Government when the whole scene is overshadowed by the internal strife of the components of that Government?  The Progressive Democrats are almost writhing about on the floor, throwing fits and tantrums, as to whether or not they can vote confidence in their Government, the coalition Government of which they are part.  If they cannot vote confidence in that Government they will be casting a vote of no confidence in themselves. Many on the Opposition benches would say they should do so.  I do not disagree, but that is neither here nor there.  It is ludicrous that this major debate is being overshadowed by the little men of that little coalition wrestling together to see who will come out best at the end of this week.  Regarding the Progressive Democrats, I will not mention any names because I believe it is not fair to mention names of people outside the House.</P>

      <P>In this case that person will have had his say and no doubt will be afforded by the media generally more say than anybody over there or here.  I refer to the ayatollah who is not in this House but who controls the Progressive Democrats.  It is an extraordinary situation. A man who is not a Deputy is calling the shots as to what the Government will do with the coalition and whether they will survive.  It is bloody ludicrous.  The little ayatollah should be told where he gets off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Probably the most serious aspect of all in facing up to the confidence vote in this Government has to do with the national question, the North of Ireland, the Six Counties, our occupied territory, our war-torn corner of this country.  We have a Government who are collaborating with the occupiers, who have done so many U-turns, starting with the hunger strikes and the attitude towards the hunger strikers.  When they could have done something they did nothing.  I condemned the Anglo-Irish Agreement on <Col N="589" /> the night Deputy FitzGerald signed it. Within minutes Fianna Fáil through their spokesman condemned it and said it was copperfastening partition.  Now they operate it and the only excuse I have got, inside or outside this House, is that because a previous Government had come to some arrangement they felt bound by it.  If that was the case we would be still 32 counties in UK occupation.  We would never have got out of that if some sort of Government had done that deal before our time.  We would still have the Governor General in the Park and would be still paying the land annuities across the water.  We would still have the soldiers and we would have the Navy in Lough Swilly and in Cork if there was any basis for the justification which has been given to me for operating the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>Extradition has been a disaster for Fianna Fáil.  They were totally against it but now they operate it. Dessie Ellis is going through it at present and he should not even be in England.  That again is one of the problems that I face.  There is section 31, not that it matters a damn whether it is there or not because if the gurus of the media, whether national television, radio or newspapers, wish to keep people out of the news they can do it without section 31.  Fianna Fáil were committed to removing section 31 and they operate it as if it was their baby for all time.</P>
    <P>On these matters, the collaboration with and the operation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the continuing bloodshed and death as I have said time without number in this House and I repeat it again, will continue so long as there is an occupation force in the country claiming jurisdiction over part of our land.  Do not have any doubt about it.  I wish it could be otherwise but that is the way it is, and the first people we have to convince of that is the Government of the day in this House whether it is this Government or another.  If the Government, speaking on behalf of the parliament of this nation, are not convinced, how then can we expect the British to be <Col N="590" /> convinced that the best thing they could do is to find a way to get out of their occupation of our country and give us the hope of having the beginnings of peace in our land.  Without that we will never have it and our own Government are the people who are more to blame than are the British.  How can we expect the British to see our point of view from an Irish standpoint if our own Government do not see it from that standpoint.  And they do not see it that way.  They want to continue collaborating with alleged security forces.  If they were put in the dock, as are these financial people who are being investigated at the moment, all those here who have collaborated with them &mdash; and most have &mdash; would be ashamed of themselves.  The shoot to kill people are still there.  All the black-guarding that ever went on is still going on.  The discrimination in jobs is unbelievable today, so much so that I was shocked when I saw some of the up-to-date records from the fair employment agencies up there.  I was literally shocked because I thought the changes that had taken place with one man one vote, the prorogation of Stormont, had brought about some improvement instead of which the discrimination in jobs is bad if not worse today then it has been at any time in the last 70 years.</P>
    <P>Those are the people we are dealing with.  Those are the people we are treating as if they would be reasonable. They are not and they never will be reasonable while Britain maintains her presence and her assurance that she will remain there as long as the majority, a contrived majority, wish it.  Those people cannot even talk to us for the simple reason that by so doing they would be regarded as committing treason because unionism is not divisible.  It cannot be compromised.  The very act of sitting down to talk about the real problem, which is partition and unionism, is an admission that unionism is in fact capable of being talked about and therefore a concession by those on the Unionist side that it is something that can be dispensed with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> That is the way it is and that is the way it will continue to be so long as we are the gutless lot that we are here in this House who are prepared to play along with any old game without facing up to the realities, biting the bullet, and telling the British that we and they must find a way for them to get out of our country and leave it to the people of Ireland, North and South, to govern themselves in the manner of their choice without interference from any outside power in the future.  I believe the day that Britain decides to follow that road, since no other one will work &mdash; and God knows they have tried many &mdash; is the day we will begin to get together as we have never done before and true peace and, ultimately, true unity will exist.</P>
    <P>I will conclude with those thoughts and the others that went before, mainly on our economy and on our finances and some local parochial matters as well like the airport we never got in Letterkenny because we were so concerned about putting it in Derry that we did not give a damn about Donegal, or the new RTC Bill which would float our RTCs into orbit at the wishes of the vast majority of the principals of those colleges in cahoots with the Minister who is herself by profession part of them.  She is doing a damnedly bad job if she does this.  They are good institutions doing great work and they are part and parcel of our local authorities. We hear lip service given to local control.  Here we are taking away the most vital thing that has been provided in the last 25 years and taking it out of the control of the local authorities and restoring it to the central control back down in Marlborough Street.  It is a bad day for Ireland, a bad day for third level education, and a bad day for this Government from which three years ago I got an assurance that this would not happen.  I thought I had convinced them that it should not happen but apparently those that are seeking to be leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party in the future are now too strong to be curbed and they push on their own way.  Thank you, and through you thank you to the Ceann Comhairle <Col N="592" /> for standing up for the rights of a minority Deputy in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate this evening.  For the past four weeks the Opposition parties have been preoccupied with attacking various Ministers and individuals without any reference whatever to the major economic problems which are again surfacing in this country.  They have made their attacks on a continuing basis and in so doing avoided offering us any glimpse of what proposals they have to reverse the present economic problems which this country faces.  I find it incredible that two of the parties opposite, Fine Gael and Labour, are now laying down the law to the Government and chastising them for the manner in which they are running the country but while they were in office they brought this little State of ours to the edge of total economic collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When they left office in 1987 the national economy had gone through four successive years of negative growth, the public finances had deteriorated to a state where we had the highest ever current budget deficit at 8.3 per cent of GNP and the national debt had doubled from some £12 billion to over £24 billion.  There was a total lack of confidence in the economy, <Col N="594" /> international bankers were concerned that our economy was fast reaching the stage of almost total failure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lack of confidence now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;our internatinal competitiveness had vanished, our external reserves were at a dangerously low level and our interest rates were intolerably high.  All of the foregoing had a demoralising effect on our country and its people. Unemployment was increasing at a rate not seen before, emigration was in full swing and the future held out very little opportunity for young people who were coming on to the jobs market.</P>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1987 they took firm and decisive action which immediately started to rectify the situation.  The firm and decisive action taken by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987 set in train an overall recovery in the state of our national finances and rebuilt confidence in our economy and country which had been lacking during the previous four years.  A testimony to the success of the actions taken in 1987 is the new invigorated economy which we now have.  The state of our public finances has been transformed and achievements since 1987 have been commended by many well respected external and national financial commentators. This transformation was brought about by a skilled and courageous management team.  The Opposition parties had some audacity to criticise this Government in view of their own record in office and what has been achieved by this Government since 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Deputy's party have criticised them as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1987 we have had a period of sustained growth, averaging some 4.5 per cent per year.  This growth is a measure of the international and national confidence which has been restored since our party returned to power and which has been assisted by some favourable international considerations. Compare our borrowing requirement which was 12.8 per cent of <Col N="595" /> GNP in 1986 with the present level of 2 per cent.  Our current budget deficit has been brought down from a record 8.3 per cent in 1986 to 0.7 per cent of GNP now. Total Government expenditure has been reduced from 55 per cent of GNP in 1986 to 41 per cent of GNP this year.  The Revenue take was reduced from 40 per cent of GNP in 1986 to 36.6 per cent last year, thus leaving more money in the economy in order to prime our recovery.</P>
      <P>This transformation has been the result of good management where difficult decisions were taken and sacrifices demanded in the national interest were made.  One of the most striking figures which underline the success of this Government since 1987 compared to the disastrous administration who were in power from 1982-86, when there was the drop of 66,000 in total employment, is the increase of 40,000 in employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>And unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also worth noting that these additional jobs are being maintained even in today's difficult circumstances. However, a downside to this is that due to the international recession unemployment is still at an unacceptably high level.</P>
      <P>A feature of the success of this Government is the successful efforts which have been made in the area of personal taxation. This success was essential to our economic recovery.  The previous crucifying high rates of personal taxation were choking enterprise and stifling initiative.  We have one of the lowest inflation rates in the European Community and lower interest and mortgage rates.  The reduction in the standard rate of income tax from 35 to 29 per cent and the reduction from 58 to 52 per cent in the top rate of income tax have been very welcome.  These improvements in income tax allowances and exemptions are of special benefit to PAYE earners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to turn my attention to the recent spate of alleged scandals. These allegations, particularly those in relation to Greencore and Telecom Éireann, are doing serious damage by distracting the Government's attention <Col N="596" /> away from the real economic problems facing this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The rebuilding of public confidence in the political system and in Irish semi-State business will not be an easy task in the aftermath of these recent revelations.  There is widespread public cynicism about certain sections of politics and Irish business.  I commend the Government for setting in train high-powered investigations into these allegations. The investigations into the allegations concerning Greencore and Telecom Éireann in particular will go <Col N="597" /> some way towards exposing what exactly went on in these companies.  The public have become very alarmed at the spate of irregularities which seem to have been part and parcel of these businesses.  I hope the investigations will give speedy results.</P>
      <P>The events of the past few weeks were serious enough to warrant active consideration being given to recalling the Dáil in order to debate them.  The public are angered, dismayed and frustrated by these revelations.  Irregularities have been exposed in the semi-State commercial area, an area in which public funds are involved.  It is most disturbing that as these investigations are continuing it is proving very difficult to obtain answers to some of the questions which have been asked.  I regret but must accept the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle in the matter of the Greencore allegations.  I hope that at some time in the future we may be permitted to inquire about and comment on the happenings in what was then Irish Sugar.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to say calmly and without any degree of emotion or exaggeration that the public are greatly alarmed at the suggestion that some people appointed by the Government have failed to protect adequately the interests of the taxpayers and that substantial private profits have been made at the expense of the public through a lack of vigilance by board members, some of whom, as I have said, were Government nominees.  We should remind the people on the far side of the House &mdash; Fine Gael and Labour &mdash; that it is absolutely ludicrous that they should suggest there is no confidence in this Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like also to remind the people on the far side of the House that Deputy Bruton and Deputy Spring were major players in that period: they were the people who ran that Government.  I would like to remind Labour that it was Deputy Spring who, I think, from his hospital bed, made a statement &mdash; the first of many statements &mdash; where he endeavoured to pull that ludicrous Government down.  They say we have no unity, but that was the most disunified Government in the history of the State.</P>

Deputy Spring has made a rule that the Labour Party will never again take part in any Government.  That is a cop out as far as I am concerned.  Obviously, they got their fingers burnt between 1982 and 1987 and they will not make that mistake again.  The reality is that from 1987 to date, we have had low inflation and low interest rates.  These have been the achievements of the Government.</P>

      <P>Allegations have been <Col N="600" /> made over the last number of weeks and crocodile tears were shed because somebody was mentioned from this side regarding the naming of people in this House.  Many people were named in this House over the last year but no crocodile tears were shed for them.  I am very surprised that people with a legal background &mdash; such as Deputy Spring, Deputy McCartan and members of their parties &mdash; have come in here and made allegations without producing any proof.  I always understood that somebody was presumed innocent until proven guilty, yet, here we have allegation after allegation without a scintilla of proof.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in the US Senate Judiciary Committee.  Senator Alan Dixon said that Judge Clarence Thomas was entitled to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.  That was a very telling phrase and that is why the majority of the Senators backed him.  He was presumed innocent until proven guilty and the allegations made against him were not proven.  The one thing in Judge Clarence Thomas's favour &mdash; and may be that is a flaw in this Parliament &mdash; was that he was able to answer the allegations made against him in the same forum in which they were made, unlike some of the people who were named in this House over the last year.  They were not able to come in here and disprove those allegations which were made under absolute privilege.</P>
      <P>This brings me to Dáil reform.  The Workers' Party brought forward a document the other day about Dáil reform. That party have not covered themselves in glory on the Oireachtas working committee on Dáil reform.  At nearly every meeting we have had a different member of The Workers' Party was present.

    <P>I want to refer briefly to the allegations <Col N="601" /> made in this House under absolute privilege which were read out at the tribunal, and immediately the media were in trouble.  May be it is a salutory lesson to the media and to people on the far side that allegations cannot be made without substantial proof.</P>
    <P>In relation to Dáil reform, we had a show here this morning for an hour involving calling for votes, which delayed proceedings.  Perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should try to find some way to ensure that unsubstantiated statements cannot be made in this House unless they are backed up with some proof.  One barrister at the tribunal referred to it as Leinster House tittle tattle.  I think that says it all.  It is an indication of why politicians are held in such low esteem by the general public.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring is a hypocrite.  He challenged Goodman's right to go into court and contest constitutional issues, yet if anyone other than Larry Goodman wanted to contest constitutional issues, Deputy Spring would be the first on the high moral ground crying halt, saying we were trying to override that person's constitutional right.  Why is Mr. Goodman not as entitled as anyone else to go as far as he can in our courts?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that this matter was selected for the adjournment debate on the first night of the new session. I thank the Minister of State for coming in to reply and I hope to get an assurance on the matters I am about to raise.</P>
      <P>Prisons are an unfortunate necessity in society but their very existence demands a certain level of protection for prison officers and staff in the confines of the institution.  Last July a fire took place at Portlaoise Prison.  It could have had disastrous consequences for those employed there.  Twenty-seven members of the prison staff were hospitalised following the fire.  A prisoner set fire to a mattress in his cell and it was a carefully designed effort to upset the prison regime.  He added some toxins, paints and solvents to the fire and it could have had serious consequences for those involved.</P>
      <P>The incident underlined a serious problem in our prisons which I hope will be addressed by the Minister for Justice at the earliest opportunity.  I question whether adequate and essential equipment is available to the prison staff to deal with such occurrences.  I wish to know the nature and level of equipment available with specific reference to breathing apparatus, fire extinguishers and materials to deal with toxins and so on.  Is there any fire drill or training afforded to prison officers prior to taking up positions in the prisons?  Is there adequate protective clothing available to prison staff in the event of an emergency?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister undertake a total review in order to allay the fears of prison staff and the community at large having regard to the fact that many prisons, including Portlaoise Prison, are situated in residential areas?  Is there an adequate level of radio contact available in prisons? I understand that in the case I mentioned the fire and the gases emitted rendered the radio equipment somewhat defective so that it was inadequate to deal with the communications process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the summer months there have been a number of near riots <Col N="604" />&mdash; commonly called rooftop protests &mdash; in prisons.  In the event of rooftop protests what sort of emergency plan is available to prison officers and staff?  Is the Minister happy with the level of first aid training afforded to prison officers in the prisons and prior to their taking up their positions?  Is the Minister happy that every prison has an annual fire review, leading to the issue of a fire certificate? Every public house in the country needs an annual fire certificate before getting a licence.  Do we employ the same criteria in prisons?  We have had major reports in relation to the Stardust, Whiddy and other fires.  There is a serious question mark over the level of fire training available to prison officers, and in relation to the state of our prisons in the event of a fire.  I hope the Minister will deal with the matter urgently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the evening of 22 July a prisoner in Portlaoise Prison set fire to a cell.  Immediately, the general alarm was activated, the Fire Brigade were contacted and the fire was brought quickly under control.</P>
      <P>Following from this event, it became apparent that certain procedures for dealing with such incidents required review and, as is normal in the aftermath of any incident in prisons, the Minister for Justice ordered an immediate review of procedures.</P>
      <P>The overall review of the procedures is still ongoing and I know that, in view of the difficulty in marrying the aims of safety with that of security, particularly so, in the context of a prison environment, the House will appreciate the necessity of carefully examining and determining the appropriate action to be taken to ensure that many of these conflicting aims are carefully evaluated and as far as possible resolved.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, having identified certain deficiencies in procedures, which required immediate and urgent attention a revised fire and evacuation plan was drawn up.  This plan, which will eliminate many of the deficiencies identified, has now been finalised and will very shortly be the subject of discussion with staff at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> Another feature, which the review has highlighted is the ineffectiveness of available breathing equipment, that is smoke masks, which are used for escape from heavily smoked areas.  However, prototypes of a lightweight short term breathing apparatus, which gives a rescuer an independent air supply have become available on the European market for the first time during the past month. Different types are at present being studied by an evaluation group and they are expected to make a recommendation as to the most suitable option over the next month or so.</P>
    <P>On the question of the equipment available in Portlaoise, I am happy to say that smoke detection, fire alarm and emergency lighting systems were installed some time ago in the circulation areas of Portlaoise Prison and indeed on the day in question all of these systems functioned properly.  A fire fighting ring main is being installed in Portlaoise Prison.</P>
    <P>On the general question of safety in prisons, the Minister for Justice and myself are fully committed to ensuring that the obligations imposed by the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, are complied with as far as reasonably practicable, in so far as they relate to prisons.  Indeed, I am happy to say that in many respects, we are probably more advanced than most in making preparations for dealing with the many and complex problems, which face employers in this area; a fact which was fully recognised by prison officers representatives, following the Portlaoise incident.  The proposals which are being developed in this context, take fully into account all aspects of safety including staff training.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the excellent staff in Portlaoise Prison for the effective manner in which they handled what was potentially a life threatening situation on the occasion in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important matter which arises from a serious road accident in North Cork last July.  The implications of the affair are very serious. <Col N="606" /> It may be necessary for the Minister for Justice to appoint a senior judicial figure to inquire into all aspects of the affair. There is grave public disquiet in the Ballyhooley &mdash; Fermoy &mdash; Castleisland area regarding this affair.  As a result of the accident a young man lost a leg and will be disabled for the rest of his life.  Now it emerges that the blood sample which could have determined whether or not the driver of the car which struck the young man's motor cycle was complying with the law regarding blood-alcohol levels for motorists was apparently deliberately damaged in the course of its journey by registered post from Fermoy Garda station to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The public's concern is intensified by the fact that the driver in question is the spouse of a member of the Garda Síochána and was fined £10 on the day for having no driving licence.  Media reports have suggested that the sample was destroyed by being cooked in a microwave oven.  Clearly, this could not have happened by accident and it must have been done deliberately by someone who had access to the sample at some stage during its journey.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there has been a Garda investigation into this affair but if that does not clearly establish the full facts of the case I ask the Minister to agree to appoint a judicial figure to carry out a full investigation into the matter.  It may also be necessary to review the procedures for transmitting blood or urine samples following accidents.  I contend that those who suffer injury or the relatives of those who die in accidents are entitled to have established beyond doubt the blood-alcohol level of the drivers involved.  I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to establish the facts of the case.</P>

      <P>This matter has already been referred to on two occasions today by Deputy Edmund O'Keeffe and Deputy Sherlock.  In his answer to the parliamentary question the Minister for Justice informed the House that on the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions the case concerned is now the <Col N="607" /> subject of a formal investigation by a senior Garda officer from outside the Garda district concerned.  In these circumstances the House will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the matter or say anything which might pre-empt the outcome of that very important investigation.  The Garda will, in accordance with normal practice, take account of any matters which they consider relevant in conducting their investigation and, while not endorsing the remarks made by the Deputy in any way, I have no doubt that the Garda will have full regard to any information which he provides also.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Naas (Kildare) Water Supply Contamination.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>My immediate concern arises from a proposal last year by the Dublin authorities to ration the supply of public water to County Kildare.  I will not go into the reasons for that situation but it created the danger that it might be necessary to ration water supplies in the county town of Naas.  As a result another source of supply which had been unused for 30 years, that is, Sunday's Well, was opened for public use to supply approximately 40 per cent of the town's needs.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of last week an epidemic of gastric disorders hit Naas. About 17 people have been hospitlaised while on Friday of last week a number of schools in Naas were closed because so many of the students were ill.  The source of those disorders has been traced back to contamination of the Sunday's Well source by coliform bacteria.  While the source has now been closed off, it is anything but clear what the public and the responsible local authorities should do or what course of action should be recommended to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the supply was closed off some householders were advised on Tuesday of last week that for a period of 48 hours they should boil all water before use. Some affected householders got no advice until Thursday and none of the householders concerned was told for how long they had to boil water before it could be used.  The Minister will be aware as I <Col N="608" /> am that most modern automatic electric kettles do not boil water for any substantial period of time.  There was also some conflicting advice.  For example, some householders were told that they should not use water for washing without previously boiling it while others got no such advice. At the same time as this conflicting advice was being given to householders, catering establishments in the town were being advised not to use tap water at all in the preparation of food or for the washing of hands by staff.  I find it hard to believe that water which is not suitable for use in catering establishments under any circumstances can be made suitable for domestic use.</P>
    <P>Even with the contaminated source of supply closed off the contamination remains in the system, in the pipes, in holding tanks, in header tanks in houses and so on.  Super chlorination of the water is being carried out but it is clear it will take time for that to have effect and for the system to be flushed out.  It seems that while contamination has been reduced in some parts of the system there are other parts of the system where there has been no improvement at all.  It is appalling that it is only today, ten days after the problem first emerged, and only after the firm insistence of my colleagues on the Naas Urban District Council last night, that any consistent advice had been issued to householders and that a helpline service has been set up which is manned by Civil Defence volunteers.</P>
    <P>The public need to know where the responsibility for co-ordinating the response to this problem lies.  Is there an emergency plan?  Are there operating guidelines and if there is a plan or set of guidelines who is in charge of overseeing it?  The public and the medical practitioners need to know the exact type of contamination involved.  We have been told that it is the E-coli bacterium.  Is that sufficiently precise to enable medical practitioners and the health boards to take the necessary action?  We need to be assured that the advice being given to the public, to domestic and commercial users of water, is based on an accurate identification of the nature of the contamination, that it takes account of the <Col N="609" /> peculiarities of the supply system and that it is consistent.</P>
    <P>Finally, the public need to be assured that the Sunday's Well supply will not be reopened for use again unless and until the present source of contamination has been dealt with effectively.  It appears the problem may lie in the fact that a sewer some 15 to 20 metres away from the source of supply has been blocked up and has leaked contamination into the surrounding area.  We need to know how it was decided to put a sewer near a water supply source of that kind and who made the decision.  I ask the Minister to give us now a clear statement on the precise lines and distribution of responsibility for dealing with this matter which is a cause of grave and recurring concern for the people of Naas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for raising this important matter.  I am gravely concerned at the most serious pollution episode which occurred last week in Naas. The widespread illness and the disruption and anxiety in human terms which resulted underline the fundamental necessity of maintaining pure and uncontaminated water supplies.  Thankfully incidents of drinking water contamination on the scale of last week's are exceedingly rare.  I can assure the House that, as soon as all the facts have been accurately established, I will be impressing the lessons of last week's bad experience on all sanitary authorities.  In this way, the possibility of recurrence will be minimised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of a pure and wholesome supply of water is a statutory responsibility of individual sanitary authorities. This responsibility is enshrined in the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878.  In addition, sanitary authorities are empowered to cut off water supplies in cases where waste, contamination and misuse arise.  In 1988 I made regulations governing the quality of water intended for human consumption which gave legal effect in Ireland to a corresponding EC Directive.  These regulations set minimum quality standards for all water supplied through public or private water <Col N="610" /> supply schemes either for human consumption and/or for use in food production. The regulations cover some 55 parameters of water quality relating to the physical and chemical characteristics of the water, its microbiological quality and the presence of toxic or other substances in water.  These standards represent the final quality check on drinking water at the point it is made available to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to state that a preliminary report prepared at my Department's request by the Environmental Research Unit on the quality of drinking water throughout Ireland for 1989 is about to be published.  This fulfils a promise I made to this House on full disclosure regarding the quality of drinking water.  My Department have also recently prepared, and will be circulating through local authorities, a leaflet on measures to be taken to protect drinking water quality in private group schemes.</P>
    <P>As far back as May 1986 my Department issued a comprehensive circular to all sanitary authorities entitled <i>Guidelines for Emergency Planning to Protect Water Resources.</i> The thrust of this circular was not only to remind authorities of their statutory responsibilities but also to ensure that a uniform approach was taken to see that appropriate procedures were put in place at local level to deal with any eventuality or emergency that might arise.  The protection of water resources and drinking water supplies were, of course, a central purpose of these procedures.</P>
    <P>When these resources or supplies were threatened the authorities were advised to take a number of immediate steps which include (a) shut-off water intakes where necessary; (b) early notification arrangements, by public address and media, to users and public at large and to appropriate agencies, of the hazard and what action is required of them; (c) consultation with chief medical officer for analysis of public health risk in the supply; (d) to arrange for samples at various locations throughout distribution system; (c) arrangements for alternative supplies to users; and (f) arrangements to keep users up-to-date with progress and required response.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> When my Department became aware of the scale of the problem in Naas, a detailed report was sought from the council and a senior engineer from my Department visited the area to get a first-hand account of its extent and the measures taken by the local authority to remedy the problem.  I have been assured by the local authority that immediate steps were taken to alleviate and remedy the situation. I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to monitor the situation until normal supplies are restored at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The statutory standards now in force for drinking water quality are, rightly, very stringent.  I introduced these standards, and the first ever comprehensive report on them is about to be published. This report will not pull punches.  It will show that drinking water quality in Ireland, as in the rest of EC member states, is still not in full compliance in all areas with all parameters of the regulations. This in no way compares to the health threatening circumstances instanced in Naas but nevertheless it is a situation to be remedied.</P>
    <P>A strategy of major investment to solve these quality problems was one of the key priorities of the environment action programme which the Government published in January 1990.  We pledged expenditure of up to £300 million between now and the year 2000 on improved water supplies and we have met this commitment to date.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear two minutes statements on matters appropriate to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I propose to call the Deputies I have selected in the following order: Deputy Michael Kitt, Deputy Deenihan and Deputy Deasy in respect of matters to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and Deputy Lowry and Deputy Hogan in respect of matters to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently the Minister for Agriculture and Food announced that 95 per cent of lands in County Galway were to be reclassified as severely handicapped. I sincerely welcome that and thank the Minister for the biggest ever reclassification in the county.  However, I am disappointed that something like 30,000 hectares were excluded which affect all 17 district electoral divisions in south-east Galway.</P>
      <P>I was at a recent meeting held by the IFA with my Oireachtas colleagues in east Galway and we were told very clearly by the Teagasc officials at the meeting that individual farmers could lose from £132 to £850 because they were excluded from these areas.  Will the Minister of State confirm that the Government have at all times been working to have all County Galway included and that they have submitted the whole county for inclusion under this scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Oireachtas Members in my constituency have been accused of lobbying for other parts of the county to the exclusion of south-east Galway.  I reject that &mdash; and I know my colleagues would do the same &mdash; because we are strongly committed to having the whole county included.  I am personally disappointed that the 5 per cent was not included.  The Teagasc studies have shown that these lands in south-east Galway are by no means the best in the county as much of the land is flooded. Tynagh Mines have been closed for some years and the area has not recovered <Col N="613" /> from the loss.  However, it has not been included.</P>
    <P>I should like an explanation from the Minister why counties like Roscommon were included, why the appeals procedure has not been set up and how it will work.  Of course, I should like to have all the lands in the area surveyed, every farmer should be visited to see what the percentage of national farm income is in south-east Galway.  We must change the criteria if we cannot get this part of Galway included.  It must be on the basis of the individual farmer, not the district electoral division or the townland.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that Deputy Kitt acknowledged and welcomed the fact that 95 per cent of County Galway is now classified as more severely handicapped.  Compared to west Cork, Deputy Kitt is doing extremely well.  To be reclassified from less to more severely handicapped status and gain the additional benefit of headage payments on all categories of cattle other than beef cows, an area must be homogeneous, consist of poor land and have the characteristics of low farm incomes and heavy dependence on agriculture.</P>
      <P>The 5 per cent of County Galway in the Eyrecourt-Portumna area which was not reclassified did not meet these criteria. Under the appeal panel procedures, however, an excluded area can appeal the assessment made and all excluded areas will be given the opportunity to have their case reviewed.  Press notices setting out the appeal arrangements will appear shortly in the national and relevant local papers.</P>

      <P>I now call on Deputy Deenihan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inexplicable that no land in the north Kerry constituency was reclassified as more severely handicapped. Vast tracts of land in north Kerry which are now classified as less severely handicapped must be regarded as the poorest land in the country.  I am puzzled as to why it was not reclassified. However, when you consider the manner <Col N="614" /> in which the survey was carried out in 1989 in the north Kerry area it does not really surprise me.  The survey was not scientific or thorough and indeed the CAO in Kerry admitted at a recent special meeting on agriculture called by Kerry County Council that this was the case.</P>
      <P>The survey was also based on the average income of a DED being 40 per cent of the national farm income at that time. However, farm incomes &mdash; I do not have to remind the Minister &mdash; have fallen drastically since 1989 in north Kerry, in some cases by up to 40 per cent.</P>
      <P>In the original submission made by the Government to the Commission, no part of the south Kerry constituency was included for reclassification.  I was glad that three DEDs were included in the final announcement.  However, this proved one point, that exceptions could be made.  If the DEDs of Kilnanare, Kiltallagh and Milltown could be included why not the neighbouring DEDs of Mohahiffe, Aglish and Rockfield?  The same applies to areas in north Kerry which are among the poorest land in the country.  I cannot see any reason for places like Kerry Head, Asdee, Pallas, Ballyhorgan, Lixnaw, Cliontrobraid and many more areas not being included.  It was a totally politically motivated reclassification and many of our farmers have suffered as a result.  I ask the Minister to explain how these people can appeal at this stage or is there any point in appealing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>First I reject the old nonsense about political motivation in this matter.  From my standpoint north Kerry has done quite well.  About 20,000 acres in the townlands which Deputy Deenihan mentioned have been reclassified from less to more severely handicapped.  If there was a political input, at least some hectares in west Cork would have been so reclassified, but that did not happen on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general the reason a greater proportion of Kerry was not reclassified relates to the high incomes of the farmers <Col N="615" /> in that locality.  For example, the average farm income in north Kerry is 2.8 times that of south Roscommon which was reclassified.  If the farmers in the areas which have been omitted feel aggrieved they are entitled to appeal and, as I said in my previous reply, notice to that effect will appear in the national and local newspapers. I wish the farmers in those areas the best of luck with their appeal.</P>

      <P>The most recent bovine TB eradication scheme which was introduced in 1988 and was heralded as the complete answer to the problem has been a colossal and costly failure.  In approximately three and a half years virtually £200 million has been spent on a futile exercise.  It is worth recalling that in the previous 35 years we were told it was a scandal to waste virtually £1 billion of taxpayers' money, not to talk of the immense hardship to the farmers who suffered major financial losses.</P>
      <P>There is now an admission by ERAD, the body set up to oversee the eradication of the disease, that it is technically impossible to eradicate bovine TB.  What an admission.  The reasons given are: defective testing, which is detecting only 40,000 to 45,000 of the 60,000 reactors in the national herd each year; inadequate control over the movement of animals; sharp practice by a small number of farmers; sloppy administration of the scheme by the Department of Agriculture and Food and spread of the disease by wildlife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am now asking the Minister to release the report he commissioned Mr. Fred Morris, senior counsel, to prepare 14 months ago on defective testing and which was completed last December. More importantly, I am asking him to stop the lunacy of wasting £60 million of taxpayers' money per year on a scheme that is not working.  The disease levy should be abolished and farmers should be allowed do their own testing using their own veterinary surgeons at their own expense while the Department of Agriculture and Food's veterinary surgeons would carry out the pre-movement <Col N="616" /> tests at a modest cost.  It is time to stop the nonsense, stop throwing good money after bad and face up to the fact that the scheme has been a diabolical failure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for raising this matter.  Everybody accepts that the progress, or lack of it, of the scheme to date has not been very exciting. Its implementation up to now has been a failure by any standards.  A good deal remains to be done under this scheme.  Since 1988, the year mentioned by Deputy Deasy, over 42 million animal tests have been carried out, and in the current year over five million tests have been carried out.  This intensive testing regime has seen the removal of the order of 40,000 plus reactors annually. However, the hoped-for significant reduction in the residual disease level has not materialised.  Of course, we all know it is the farmers who are losing most by this problem.</P>
      <P>A number of factors contribute to the difficulty of eliminating the residual disease in the herd.  The time is now opportune to re-evaluate and reassess the scheme.  We certainly have enough reports on it and enough experience of its implementation.  The message must be clear that we will have to eliminate this disease.  There is a relatively small number remaining in the national herd. The task facing producers, farming organisations, veterinary surgeons and the State is to improve the existing position whereby 97 per cent of herds and 99 per cent of animals are TB free.  On paper that might look good enough, but there is a residue of the disease which we will have to get rid of.</P>
      <P>Some measures are being put in place to help eradicate the disease.  These include the computerised movement permits. We all know that cattle in Ireland are moved about seven times during their lifetime.  Another measure is a reliable test, particularly a reliable blood test.  A vaccine for badgers has been identified as essential in the total eradication of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending the coming onstream of this technology we will have to pursue the <Col N="617" /> matter diligently and in a way that has not been done to any great effect up to now by most of the parties involved. Nevertheless it can be pointed out that TB levels have been reduced from 20 per cent or so in the sixties to 1 per cent at present, but that is to no avail if this residue exists.  If bovine TB is to be eradicated expenditure is necessary, but that expenditure has to be directed to specific areas and the weaknesses that exist.</P>
    <P>EC funding is a very welcome back-up for the scheme.  There have been some difficulties in reaching agreement on the conditions associated with the provision of this funding, and discussions are continuing with the Irish Veterinary Union. Given the position of the national finances I cannot over-emphasise the importance of securing this funding.</P>

      <P>Merriott Limited was established in Thurles in response to the demise of the Thurles sugar factory, closure of which had just been sanctioned by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy.  At that time the Government were very keen to provide so-called alternative jobs to appease a very irate workforce and electorate. It has since become obvious that this damage limitation exercise, was ill-conceived, rushed and highly speculative. This is borne out by the fact that only two of the promised five projects are functioning at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Merriott Limited was formed with the wholehearted encouragement and financial support of the Irish Sugar Company. Its opening was greeted with great joy, enthusiasm, optimistic projections and, indeed, pronounced self-satisfaction by the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy.  A short 15 months later it is simply another statistic in the ever-expanding industrial scrap heap.  How could this happen?  How can a company in which a State-sponsored company invested almost £2 million of taxpayers' money together with other State grants collapse after such a brief trading period owing a huge sum of money to creditors?  Who was responsible for market research and a feasibility study?  Did Shannon Development grant-aid these studies?  Did Shannon Development vet the final report?  Did Shannon <Col N="618" /> Development monitor their investment in the company on behalf of taxpayers?</P>
    <P>The role of the Irish Sugar Company in this debacle is incomprehensible.  They handed over £2 million with no guarantees, no in-built protection mechanism, no return for their money.  How could they allow their money be squandered in such a short time?  Merriott Limited had two significant attributes.  It had an excellent quality product, produced by a competent and willing workforce.  I fail to understand why the Irish Sugar Company or Shannon Development did not see the glaring deficiencies in company structure. It was obvious that administrative costs were excessive for the size of turnover and that they could not justify the retention of an ineffective English based sales force.  Yet these overheads were still in place the day the factory closed.</P>
    <P>There were two offers to purchase Merriott in receivership.  The offer favoured by the Irish Sugar Company would have retained the factory and jobs in Thurles.  This begs the question, why was this offer not accepted by the Merriott directors in view of the investment of the Sugar Company and why were the Sugar Company over-ruled?  Had the Sugar Company no legal hold on the only important asset of Merriott, its patent? Who owned the patent?  Was it paid for by company moneys or by directors personal funds?  Who sold the company patent and who were the financial beneficiaries of this sale?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that a company such as Merriott was put into receivership and sold off.  Its failure was due mainly to the economic downturn in the UK which was its principal market.  Despite every effort by all concerned, it did not prove possible to maintain a viable operation at Thurles. I am satisfied from the information available to me that there was no alternative to placing the company in receivership, and that under the circumstances, it was inevitable that this should happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I regret that jobs are lost to Thurles, I welcome the fact that it was another Irish-based company which acquired Merriott and that a number of <Col N="619" /> the manufacturing jobs involved have been kept in Ireland specifically in County Tipperary.  In this regard, I should point out that the benefits accruing from patent licences held by Merriott have been transferred to the new Irish owners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I wish to thank you for allowing me to raise this matter.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce enacted the Competition Bill, 1991, and he hopes that this will result in sufficient competition in the marketplace to benefit the consumer. This is a theoretical notion of the free market which is the hallmark of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley's philosophy on consumer issues generally.  In a small jurisdiction like the Republic of Ireland it is difficult to generate genuine competition.  This is particularly so when a few multiples seek to dominate the grocery business, for example, to the virtual exclusion of neighbourhood shops and the local grocery business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that the consumer will ultimately pay for these so-called cheap prices by paying higher prices for other commodities.  Under the 1991 Competition Act, the Director of Consumer Affairs has no power to intervene if overcharging occurs in the grocery trade when the ban on below cost selling is removed. The Minister for Industry and Commerce introduced the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order in 1987 after careful consideration and study.  It was clear then that below cost selling was taking place. A price fixing order was introduced in <Col N="620" /> 1987 and if this order is now removed, the Director of Consumer Affairs will have no power in relation to basic food prices for milk and bread and the cases now being analysed and which are potentially the subject of court proceedings will have to be dropped.</P>
    <P>If the ban on below cost selling is removed under the Competition Act, 1991, it will demonstrate the anti-consumer policy of this Minister and this Government.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify the position tonight on whether he intends to remove the ban on below cost selling; whether he will publish as soon as possible the Fair Trade Commission report which analysed the 1987 Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, and if he will indicate if any recommendations on this issue are contained in that report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, during the course of the debate on the Competition Bill, 1991, the Minister for Industry and Commerce undertook not to revoke the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, until the Fair Trade Commission's report on their review of the order had been received. The Fair Trade Commission's report was submitted to the Minister in August of this year.  The report is being studied very carefully and the Minister will be making his views known on the recommendations when the report is published.  The Minister hopes that it will be no more than a matter of weeks before the report is published.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 17 October 1991.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>There have been calls over the years from many interested organisations and individuals for the Government to take legal action to secure the closure of the Sellafield plant.  More recently these calls have concentrated on the proposed development of a radioactive waste disposal site at Sellafield in Cumbria.</P>
      <P>While the Government have always been and continue to be committed to legal action if a sufficient case for it can be shown to exist, they cannot initiate such action without a firm legal case based on sufficient evidence.  It should be made clear at this point that Greenpeace have never put such a case to me or to my Department.  Any such legal action would have to be based on scientific evidence as to the injurious effects of operations at the Sellafield plant in Ireland. To find convincing evidence to establish a direct cause and the effect link between the operation of the Sellafield plant and damage or injuries to people in Ireland may be very difficult.  Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that activities at the Sellafield plant are in breach of the relevant EURATOM directives and regulations.  If there was, legal action could and would be considered.  In addition to the EURATOM Treaty, options for legal action which have been examined include possible action pursuant to the EC Treaty, Directive 76/464/EEC &mdash; on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged from land based sources into the aquatic environment of the Community &mdash; the Law of the Sea, the Paris Convention, the London Dumping Convention, and action in the UK courts and in the International Court of Justice.  These have all, however, been confronted by the same obstacle &mdash; the lack of sufficient evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 17 April 1991 members of Greenpeace with their legal experts met with <Col N="115" /> officials of the Department of Energy and of the Attorney General's Office to discuss possible legal action in relation to Sellafield/nuclear safety.  Greenpeace outlined three procedural options regarding the International Court of Justice which might be explored and subsequently forwarded these in written form.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the Greenpeace presentation related solely to legal procedural possibilities and they did not attempt to put forward any possible case supported by facts or evidence.  The Greenpeace presentation has been examined in detail and the legal advice available to me is that recourse to the International Court of Justice would be unlikely because the court would lack jurisdiction without the consent of both parties and because of difficulties in determining issues arising prior to such consent.  Even if consent and jurisdiction obstacles were overcome there would have to be non-compliance by the UK with some international law or convention or other legal norm if the Government of Ireland were to succeed in the court.  There is no available legal or evidential basis for establishing this at present.</P>
    <P>It can only be concluded that even if the State were to bring the matter before the International Court of Justice by some means or other, there would still be no sufficient case to present to the court.</P>
    <P>The Government are open to information and evidence from any source to support a sustainable case regarding closure of Sellafield.  They are not, however, prepared to proceed to legal action without a sustainable case, or purely for the &ldquo;embarrassment factor&rdquo;, as has been suggested in some circles.</P>

      <P>Although the operations at Sellafield cannot be monitored directly by my Department, an environmental radioactivity monitoring programme is in place.  This programme is implemented by the Nuclear Energy Board on behalf of my Department.  The concentrations of radioactivity in the Irish Sea, in fish, and in the air are measured by the board and these same facilities will be used in order to ascertain whether there is any increase in concentration when certain planned expansion activities come on stream at Sellafield.</P>
      <P>Any new activities in relation to the Sellafield operation are subject to scrutiny by the Commission under Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty.  Furthermore, the operator cannot implement any arrangements for discharges until he has received the Commission's opinion under Article 37, which is given after consultation with a committee of experts drawn from member states.  This opinion has not yet been given in relation to expanded activities at Sellafield.</P>
      <P>It is not open to me as Minister for Energy to monitor other member states' compliance with EC directives or regulations apart from the degree of monitoring I have mentioned above.  Monitoring of compliance with relevant EC law is a matter for the Commission, and Deputies will be aware that I have long been pressing for a Community force to inspect nuclear installations. Member states can of course raise particular issues with the Commission, should they become aware that the law is not being complied with.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 61 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>Final results of a survey undertaken by the Nuclear Energy Board in 1989-90 indicate that about 5 per cent of houses tested in the west exceed the reference level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre. This is the level agreed by the Government above which remedial measures should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Radon measurements have also been undertaken in 437 schools in counties Galway, Mayo and Clare.  The survey identified 18 schools in need of further <Col N="120" /> investigation.  Advice regarding remedial measures in a limited number has been conveyed to the relevant school authorities and to the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Since 1989 the NEB have been undertaking measurements of radon gas in Irish homes.  Work initially was concentrated in counties Mayo, Galway and Clare as earlier surveys showed these counties to have higher levels of radon.  Any householder can have a measurement carried out by the NEB at a charge of £15 and a campaign to publicise this service in newspapers was undertaken in the west earlier this year.  Where screening measurements indicate a level in excess of 200 bacquerels per cubic metre, householders are advised of the recommendation to reduce the concentration levels in their homes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment is responsible for preparing and disseminating technical guidance to householders and builders regarding the treatment of radon problems in affected areas.  A booklet &ldquo;Radon in Buildings&rdquo; is available from the environmental research unit of that Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 90, 92, 98 and 103 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department together with the INPC are continuing to evaluate <Col N="122" /> projects for the modernisation of Whitegate refinery and upgrade of Whiddy oil terminal.</P>
    <P>At the outset I wish to refute any veiled allegation or imputation contained in the questions before me that I or my Department have been less than enthusiastic in our efforts to date.  It would be, as the House can readily attest to, very unwise to enter some arrangement or pursue some project that has not been fully examined and put through rigorous analysis.  Any project must meet with the Government's full approval.</P>
    <P>The oil business is shaped by global political and economic developments. Rash decisions taken in haste can have disastrous results.  A cautious sensible approach must be adhered to if the nation is to benefit from the further development of these existing assets.</P>
    <P>In relation to Whitegate refinery I am in a position to inform the House that a particular project has been identified which warrants further detailed examination. This is in progress.  I am not in a position for reasons of commercial confidentiality however to give details of these ongoing discussions.  I must also stress that these discussions are at an embryonic stage.</P>
    <P>Naturally disclosure of information relating to correspondence entered into with the proposers of any possible project would not conform to the strict standards of confidentiality adhered to by my Department.  All approaches have been dealt with promptly and good relations are maintained with all those expressing interest in either facility.</P>
    <P>Progress is also being made on a possible future for Whiddy oil terminal. Again I must stress that external international developments impact on the marketability of this facility.  No firm decisions have been taken to date.  Any permanent use of the facilities would naturally have to meet the highest safety standards.</P>
    <P>Following my decision to request the INPC to place 205,000 tonnes of crude oil <Col N="123" /> at the terminal during August-September last year, works relating to refurbishing fuel tanks at Whiddy were undertaken. The cost of this work will approach nearly £2 million and it has qualified for grant approval of up to 50 per cent expenditure from the European Commission, under the Perifra programme which is designed to finance limited action of an exceptional nature which would aid peripheral regions of the EC during 1990.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware.  I announced in April 1991 that a proposal from Renewable Energy Ireland Ltd to construct a wind farm at Bellacorick, County Mayo had been selected subject to the conclusion of satisfactory contract arrangements by 31 October this year.  Work has been proceeding since between the various parties concerned with a view to conclusion of agreements and contracts in relation to payment of EC grant, construction of civil works, supply and erection of turbines, transmission and purchase of electricity and associated matters such as financial insurance and bonding.  The company have recently informed me of certain changes in the project arrangements that they are proposing which they claim would enhance the viability of the project.  I am having these matters examined with a view to satisfying myself that these are acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Construction of the wind farm would <Col N="124" /> provide about 35 temporary jobs.  Operation and maintenance would give continuous employment to two people.  It is estimated that electricity production would be in the region of 18 gigawatt hours per annum, depending on actual windspeeds, of course.  This is the only wind farm project being considered by my Department at present.</P>

      <P>With regard to the last part of this question, I should point out that the job-sharing scheme, as it operates in my Department, is not as restrictive as is inferred in the question.  Staff on job-sharing have the choice of a wide variety of working arrangements to suit their particular needs.  In addition to this, most staff on job-sharing also enjoy the benefits of a system of flexible working hours which affords considerable latitude in the organisation of their hours of attendance. The job-sharing scheme was agreed centrally between the Civil Service unions and the Department of Finance and any amendments to the scheme would be for negotiation between those parties.</P>

As there was no such surplus of staff in this Department at that time, these three applicants were refused as their requests were for career breaks for the purpose of foreign travel.</P>

      <Quest>the current position regarding the future of the ESB power station at Allenwood, County Kildare, and the peat briquette factory at Lullymore, County Kildare; if he will confirm that there is no likelihood of the closure of either of these operations in the foreseeable future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The position in relation to the ESB power station at Allenwood has not changed since my last reply to the Deputy on this issue on 16 May 1991.  The ESB will continue to operate the power station and Bord na Móna will supply turf to the station as long as supplies from the local Bord na Móna bogs permit.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the critical factor in relation to Allenwood Station is the ability of ESB to operate there, having regard to the age of the station and the possibility of a major breakdown occurring.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Lullymore briquette factory, the position is that the whole question of briquetting capacity is currently under scrutiny by the solid fuels division of Bord na Móna.  This matter is being considered in relation to all four of the company's briquette factories.  When this study is completed the board will be in a position to give consideration to the appropriate strategies to be followed in that division.</P>

      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann have a statutory obligation to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas on a commercial basis.  Accordingly, proposals for the extension of the gas grid are a matter for the board themselves to assess in the light of that obligation.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the board that they are not, at this time, considering a supply for Dungarvan, County Waterford. The nearest gas supply is 20 miles away, the cost of extending the gas network would be very high and there are no loads <i>en route</i> which would contribute in any significant way towards recovering the infrastructural cost.  In these circumstances, the board are satisfied that it would not be economically viable to extend the network to Dungarvan.</P>

      <P>The storage and disposal of all radioactive waste in Ireland is subject to control by licence under the Nuclear Energy (General Control of Fissile Fuels, Radioactive Substances and Irradiating Apparatus) Order 1977, S.I. No. 166 of 1977.  These licensing controls are operated by the Nuclear Energy Board.</P>
      <P>The low level waste referred to by the Deputy arises from the use of radioisotopes in hospitals, research and industry. For reasons associated with maintaining commercial confidence it has not been board policy to disclose the names of institutions or individuals licensed to use radioactive substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> The organisations involved dispose of this waste by storage on site until decayed to levels at which disposal as ordinary waste is permitted.  I am advised by the board that such storage does not present a hazard to persons or to the environment, and this view has been supported by a team of experts in waste management from the International Atomic Energy Agency who visited Ireland in July of this year.  However, the agency team have also pointed out that the optimum solution is to provide a national facility dedicated to the storage of all radioactive waste.</P>

    <P>The Arts Council's financial procedures have been in effect since 1952. They have been developed and expanded over the years to take account of auditors' requirements.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council's annual report and accounts are lodged in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>National Concert Hall: the accounts of the National Concert Hall are audited annually by Hayden Brown, Chartered Accountants, 34 Grafton Street, Dublin 2. The audited report is sent directly to the board of directors.  Copies of the annual accounts are sent to the Department of the Taoiseach for submission to the Oireachtas.</P>

All cheques are entered into a book of prime entry &mdash; cheque <Col N="132" /> payments book &mdash; in numerical sequence and then to computer.  Cheques which are cancelled are entered as such, as the cheque stub marked with a stamp &ldquo;cancelled&rdquo;. All lodgements are entered chronologically and separately to the cash receipts books.  Any outstanding cheques and/or lodgements at a period end are reconciled to the following month's bank statements, (3) the debtors control account is reconciled monthly.

    <P>RHK/IMMA: The accounts of the Irish Museum of Modern Art are audited on an annual basis by: Cooney, Carey &amp; Co., Chartered Accounts, Northumberland Road.</P>
    <P>The following controls have been in existence since May 1987: (1) the board of the concert hall receive detailed information on the financial position of the IMMA at their regular monthly meeting; (2) creditors control accounts are prepared on a monthly basis.  All credit balances are investigated; (3) when payments are being prepared, the company's ledgers are compared with the suppliers invoice and reconciled.  Each invoice is checked with order book and proof of delivery; (4) debtors control accounts are prepared on a monthly basis.  All balances in the fourth month are investigated; (5) all debtors cheques are entered separately in cash receipt book; (6) bank reconciliation is done on a monthly basis.

Copies of the report of the Comptroller shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these accounting systems represent thorough and accurate monitoring procedures while maintaining management autonomy.  I am also satisfied that they are adaptable to changing circumstances and perceived requirements.</P>
    <P>Údarás na Gaeltachta: Tuigim ó Údarás na Gaeltachta go bhfuil córas d'iniúchadh inmheánach i bhfeidhm san eagraíocht ó bunaíodh í i 1980 agus go raibh córas i bhfeidhm roimhe sin i nGaeltarra Éireann.  Is chuig an bpríomhfheidhmeannach go díreach a thuairiscíonn an t-iniúchóir inmheánach a bhfuil dualgais eile air chomh maith, rud a chiallaíonn gur ar bhonn páirtaimseartha atá an cúram mar iniúchóir inmheánach á chomhlíonadh.  Baineann an t-iniúchadh inmheánach le obair an Údaráis féin agus a fhochuideachtaí.  Socraítear na córais agus na sceidil dualgas don iniúchadh inmheánach laistigh den eagraíocht chun díriú ar na réimsí sin den obair is mó go bhfeictear gur fiú iniúchadh a dhéanamh <Col N="134" /> orthu.  Is gnó do Bhord an Údaráis go príomha, tríd an bpríomhfheidhmeannach, é féin a shásamh go gcuimsíonn an córas d'iniúchadh inmheánach na gnéithe riachtanacha le haghaidh mionscrúdaithe agus de neamhspleáchas bainistíochta agus tá iarrtha agam ar an Údarás an cheist sin a scrúdú agus toradh an scrúdaithe sin a chur in iúl dom.  Scrúdaíonn an tArd-Reachtaire Cuntas agus Ciste cuntais an Údaráis go bliantúil.</P>
    <P>Bord na Gaeilge: Níl córas foirmiúil iniúchóireachta inmheánach i bhfeidhm i gcás Bhord na Gaeilge.  Scrúdaíonn an tArd-Reachtaire Cuntas agus Ciste cuntais an bhoird go bliantúil agus táim sásta gur leor sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 112 to 128, 131 to 139 and 141 to 143 together.</P>
      <P>The Government first decided to allocate national lottery funding for arts, culture and the Irish language projects on 8 May 1987.</P>
      <P>In the period 1987-88 a total of £10.977 million was allocated by my Department to arts and culture projects.</P>
      <P>During this time, decisions regarding grants payable to arts and culture projects were made in each case following careful consideration of the particular project's merit.  The following Table A shows the amount of lottery grants paid by my Department in 1987 and 1988 on a county by county basis.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to give the breakdown as requested on the basis of particular constituencies as this information is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated to the Dáil on 29 November 1988 that, in general, lottery funding for <Col N="138" /> the arts, other than the funding of national cultural institutions, would be distributed by the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>A total of £31,343,000 including lottery and Exchequer funding was disbursed by the Arts Council in the period 1987 to 31 December 1990.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council enjoys statutory independence in how they disburse their funds and Deputies may wish to contact the Council directly for details of spending on individual counties.</P>
    <P>A number of grants have been made available by my Department on a once-off basis to particular projects since 1988.</P>
    <P>These include:</P>
    <P>Dublin 1991 City of Culture Programme £1.25 million.</P>
    <P>Galway Arts Centre £1.30 million.</P>
    <P>Limerick Tercentenary £0.30 million.</P>
    <P>Duke of Northumberland Hoard (to purchase) £0.145 million.</P>
    <P>Tall Ships' Race (Cork) £0.05 million.</P>
    <P>My Department continues to allocate national lottery funding to the national cultural institutions.</P>
    <P>The National Heritage Council offers once-off grants to projects relating to the physical heritage.  Offers are made following applications to, and assessment by, the Council.</P>
    <P>The following Table B sets out the distribution of those offers of funding.</P>
    <P>In the case of Dublin North Constituency, St. Doulagh's Restoration Committee were the only organisation offered a grant from the National Heritage Council and this grant, which amounted to £20,000, was availed of in full.</P>

      <P>The questions raised by the Deputy relate to the internal management of the bodies concerned.  Some 38 bodies of a semi-State or statutory nature report to my Department.  The accounts of these bodies are by and large subject to audit by either the Comptroller and Auditor General or the Local Government Audit Service or professional auditing firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of these bodies are small in nature and formal internal audit structures have not been established. However, the boards and management of these bodies have in place various procedures designed to ensure that the scope for any irregularities is minimised.  On the basis of the reports of the external auditors, I have no reason to believe that <Col N="153" /> there are any serious deficiencies in present procedures.</P>
    <P>In the light of recent developments I am reminding all the bodies under my aegis of their responsibilities and the importance of having in place adequate internal procedures in this regard.</P>

      <P>I announced yesterday, 15 October, the launch of Ireland's operational programme 1991-1993 under STRIDE (Science and Technology for Regional Innovation and Development in Europe).  The operational programme totalling 17.59 million ECU (IR£13.5 million) has been approved by the EC <Col N="154" /> Commission, with a contribution in the form of grants from the ERDF towards the programme of 13.065 million ECU (IR£10 million) over the period &mdash; the remaining 25 per cent of the cost to be contributed from national resources.</P>
      <P>Marine is the largest of the four sub-programmes under STRIDE, the remaining three being Environment, Forestry and Food.</P>
      <P>The Marine sub-programme addresses the requirement to build up expertise and capability in marine science and technology, so as to stimulate activity in marine resource development.</P>
      <P>The measures in the Marine sub-programme fall under five main headings; (1) Fisheries Research Centre (Development of the Marine): £2.0 million to provide essential laboratory equipment to support the fishing and aquaculture industries; (2) Martin Ryan Marine Science Institute (UCG): £3.0 million to fit out and equip laboratories and facilities in the new institute with the full range of oceanographic equipment; (3) Coastal Engineering and Resource Management Centre (UCC): £1.7 million to equip a hydraulics laboratory and coastal management unit to European standards; (4) Marine Data Centre (Department of the Marine): £0.7 million to establish and equip a national centre for marine data management with computer and modelling facilities; (5) Marine Research Vessel Lough Beltra (Department of the Marine): £0.7 million to provide specialized equipment for the national marine research vessel.</P>
      <P>I have arranged for a copy of the STRIDE Operational Programme for Ireland to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Ireland and its partners in the European Community have publicly expressed their firm support for the unstinting efforts of the UN Secretary General and his Special Representative to implement in full the provisions of the UN Plan for Western Sahara.  Central to the plan is the proposed referendum to be held in the territory under the auspices of the United Nations Mission for the referendum in Western Sahara, known as MINURSO, early next year.</P>
      <P>One of the tasks of the Secretary General's Special Representative will be to secure the release, before the referendum campaign begins, of all Western Saharan political prisoners or detainees. An amnesty is envisaged as the first stage in the process of prisoner release.  In this task the Special Representative will be assisted by an independent jurist appointed by the Secretary General.  It is envisaged that MINURSO will oversee the release of political prisoners and prisoners of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government fully support the UN Plan and the work of the Special Representative, in particular his efforts to <Col N="159" /> secure the release of all political prisoners. Ireland will contribute 15 Army officers and 15 gardaí to MINURSO.</P>
    <P>I may add that the Government welcome the release by the Moroccan authorities in June of this year of several hundred Western Saharan detainees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Citizenship and Nationality Act, 1956, provided that any person, one of whose grandparents was born in Ireland, was entitled to Irish citizenship subject to registration.  In such a case, citizenship was deemed to date from 17 July 1956, the date of passage of the Act, or the person's date of birth, whichever was the later.</P>
      <P>Where an applicant's citizenship took effect from the date of the Act, then any child of the applicant born after that date was in turn entitled to Irish citizenship, as the child of a person who was now deemed to have been an Irish citizen at the time of the child's birth, even if the parent had not actually been a citizen at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, tightened these provisions. Under the new Act, citizenship does not take effect retrospectively but only from <Col N="163" /> the date of registration &mdash; except for persons who registered during a grace period up to 31 December 1986, during which, as stipulated in Section 8 of the new Act, the provisions of the 1956 Act would still continue to apply.  A consequence is that any child of a person who registered after the grace period is entitled to Irish citizenship only if born after the parent's registration.</P>
    <P>During the grace period over 8,000 applications were received, most of them towards the end of the period.  A large number of these involved combination applications from both grandchildren and great-grandchildren of Irish born persons, where registration of the latter was dependent on the prior registration of the former.</P>
    <P>Additional staff resources were allocated to processing these applications in my Department and some 4,200 were dealt with before the grace period expired.  This compares with 1,600 in 1985, the highest number of registrations previously dealt with in a single year. However, this left a balance of some 4,000 applications which could not be processed by the deadline of 31 December 1986.  The advice of the then Attorney General was that any application not actually processed by that date fell outside the statutory grace period and could not therefore be dealt with under the provisions of the 1956 Act, without special amending legislation.</P>
    <P>The possibility of introducing such amending legislation is being examined by the Minister for Justice, who replied to a Parliamentary Question on this issue on 2 May 1991.</P>
    <P>As to the specific application to which the Deputy refers in his second question, I can confirm that the application was received by the Irish Consul in Johannesburg in November, 1986.  It was forwarded shortly thereafter to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin.  I regret, however, that this application was among those which could not be processed before the deadline to which I have referred and it cannot now <Col N="164" /> be dealt with unless there is amending legislation.</P>

      <P>I stated in my address to the United Nations General Assembly last month that the UN Plan for peace in Cambodia offers the best guarantee of a just, durable and comprehensive settlement of the conflict.  I am aware that the non-governmental organisations referred to by the Deputy have expressed certain concern about the UN Plan, but I believe the plan as currently drafted meets these concerns and offers the best hope for the future of the long-suffering people of Cambodia.</P>
      <P>The framework for the plan was endorsed by the UN Security Council in its Resolution 668 of 20 September 1990 and acclaimed by the General Assembly on 15 October 1990 as the basis for the elaboration of a comprehensive political settlement through the processes of the Paris Conference on Cambodia.  Since July of this year negotiations among the Cambodian parties have intensified.  Such has been the progress made that the Paris Conference is scheduled to resume later this month to endorse formally and to sign the necessary agreements on the comprehensive political settlement giving effect to the UN Plan.</P>
      <P>This comprehensive political settlement will ensure for the Cambodian people the right to determine their own political future through UN supervised free and fair elections; it will provide the most rigorous safeguards to allow them to make a free choice; and it will offer for the future special measures to ensure protection of human rights and the non-return of the genocidal practices that outraged the conscience of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN role in the transition period will be of the greatest importance.  This role will begin shortly after the signing of the comprehensive political settlement when a UN advance mission will be deployed in Cambodia.  This mission will have as one of its main tasks to assist <Col N="167" /> communications between the four Cambodian parties in matters relating to the cease-fire until the full UN transitional operation (UNTAC) begins.</P>
    <P>Ireland will give full support to the United Nations as it prepares to implement one of the most difficult and important operations it has ever undertaken; and, if we are asked, the Government will give favourable consideration to participation by Ireland in the UN advance mission.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a company (details supplied) in County Cork has recently received tax demands for previous years during which they were issued C2 certificates on an annual basis; and if he will agree to have their alleged tax liability reviewed.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a C2 certificate allowing a subcontractor to receive payments without deduction of tax is issued only when a company's tax record is up to date.  The company was last issued with a C2 certificate on 6 April 1990.  On that date the company had no outstanding liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The demands which issued were in <Col N="172" /> respect of liabilities which arose subsequent to the issue of the C2 certificate. In the case of PAYE/PRSI the demands referred to liabilities for the year 1990-91 which became due after the issue of the C2 certificate.  The demand for VAT covered estimated liabilities for the periods January/February 1991 to May/June 1991.  I understand that the company has recently agreed its liability in respect of the periods demanded and paid the tax outstanding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The supply of agricultural contractors' services is generally liable to the 12.5 per cent VAT rate which applies to most services.  Any rate changes which I may introduce in next year's budget must be consistent with the harmonised EC indirect tax regime which will apply after 1992.  Under decisions taken by the EC Council of Economic and Finance Ministers, reduced rates, after 1992, will apply, on an optional basis, to an agreed list of specified goods and services; agricultural contractors' services are not included on this list.  Ultimately, therefore, such services will have to be standard rated.  In these circumstances it would obviously be inappropriate to reduce the rate applicable to agricultural contractors' services to 10 per cent.  I would point out, however, that unregistered farmers are compensated for VAT they bear on their farm purchases by way of the flat-rate VAT refund, the level of which reflects the rates of VAT on those inputs.  This will continue to be the case after 1992.  VAT registered farmers can, of course, reclaim VAT on agricultural contractors' services directly.</P>

      <P>Under the Taxes Acts, expenditure which is wholly and exclusively laid out for the purposes of a trade is allowable as a deduction in arriving at profits which are subject to taxation. Unless a trade has commenced, no deductions can generally be claimed for pre-trading expenditure.  There are however a number of reliefs which cater specifically for pre-trading expenditure, for example, relief for capital expenditure on scientific research; on construction of an industrial building; on the <Col N="174" /> acquisition of patent rights and &ldquo;knowhow&rdquo;; in connection with a mine, and, for abortive exploration, expenditure on mining; on dredging; on the treatment of effluent; and on construction of toll roads and bridges.  In addition, relief is available for certain pre-trading expenditure incurred on the recruitment and training of staff.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any recent representations seeking an alteration in the tax treatment of expenses in the start-up of businesses, or claiming that the establishing of new industry is hindered by the current tax treatment.  I see no reason to change the present arrangements, especially given the current budgetary constraints.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the situation in relation to the EC budgetary provisions for consumer protection and the promotion of consumer interests.  During the first reading of the 1992 draft budget, Ireland fully supported the provisions proposed by the EC Commission.  Unfortunately, there was not a qualified majority to include the full amounts proposed by the Commission in the draft budget which the Council submitted to the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>In the event that the European Parliament proposes the restoration of the original amounts or similar, Ireland will, of course, support any such proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that, in accordance with the provisions of the EEC Treaty governing the budgetary procedure, the European Parliament rather than the Council will have the final say over the <Col N="186" /> expenditure in question.  In this connection, the Department of Finance, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, has advised Irish MEPs of the interest which Irish consumer groups have in the expenditure concerned.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline, in respect of the latest year for which information is available to the Revenue Commissioners, the number of self-employed persons who declared an income of more than £25,000, broken down on a county by county basis.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest relevant actual statistics available are in respect of the income tax year 1988-89.  The number of persons on tax records whose main source of income derived from self-employment, that is, a trade, profession, rent or other investment, and who declared gross incomes in excess of £25,000 for that year was some 16,000, or 9 per cent of the total number on record.  The estimated corresponding number for the current tax year is 28,000, or some 14 per cent of the total.</P>
      <P>A geographical breakdown of the figures is not available.  The figures should be read in the light of the following observations:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  these figures differ from the <Col N="187" /> income distribution figures given in the 1990 statistical report of the Revenue Commissioners in that: (i) they are based on gross incomes declared whereas the figures in the report relate to a technical definition of &ldquo;total income&rdquo; which is total declared income after deduction of such items as capital allowances, interest paid in full, losses, allowable expenses, retirement annuities and superannuation contributions; and (ii) they include proprietary directors of incorporated family businesses totalling around 7,000 who, while formally taxed under the PAYE system, are akin to the self-employed;</P>
    <P>(b)  because self-employed incomes were then taxed on the basis of previous year's income the figures for 1988-89 appertain to income arising in the year to 5 April 1988; self-employed are now taxed on a current year basis; and</P>
    <P>(c)  it should be borne in mind that not all the self-employed have large incomes; there would be a large proportion of individuals in this class with low incomes e.g. smaller farmers, small shopkeepers, low investment incomes and so on.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that no anomaly arises from the operation of the tax system in the circumstances raised by the Deputy. Regulations which applied from the introduction of PAYE make special provision to overcome any anomaly that might exist by permitting an employer to apply an additional tax-free allowance when calculating tax on the 53rd payment. Special procedures operate on a review of a taxpayer's liability for such a year to ensure that the benefit of the additional tax allowance is maintained.</P>

    <P>&dagger;Provisional &mdash; subject to revision.</P>
    <P>(i) Includes the effects of the tax amnesty in 1988.</P>
    <P>(ii) Excludes the effects of the tax amnesty.</P>
    <P>The figures in column (a) of the table are based on income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism which covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors <Col N="191" /> of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
    <P>Notes on table</P>
    <P>Column (a)</P>
    <P>(i)  The average tax payment for each year is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in each calendar year by the number of taxpaying units effectively liable to tax in the income tax year in which the calendar year ends, e.g. the 1985 net receipt is divided by the number liable to tax in 1985-86.</P>
    <P>Column (b)</P>
    <P>(i)  In calculating the figures in this column the estimated net receipt from farm taxation in each calendar year has been divided by the number of farming tax units assessed to tax on their farming profits in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends, e.g. the 1985 receipt is divided by the number assessed for the year 1985-86, irrespective of whether the assessed tax was actually payable.</P>
    <P>(ii)  the reduction in the average tax payments made by farmers over some of the years in question is mainly due to the introduction of additional numbers of farmers to tax records since 1983-84 consequent on the abolition of the rateable valuation threshold.  It follows that the new cases, in general, had much smaller holdings and consequently had, on average, lower taxable incomes.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Full-time farmers and farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession have been included in the calculations in respect of tax paid on their farming profits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> (iv)  Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and because of this it cannot be separately distinguished. Accordingly, the figures shown for tax payments by farmers are estimated.</P>
    <P>Column (c)</P>
    <P>(i)  The figures contained in this column are obtained by dividing the estimated net receipt of income tax in each calendar year from tax units whose main source of income is from self-employment, other than full-time farming, by the estimated number of those units assessed to tax in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends as explained in note (i) for column (b).</P>
    <P>(ii)  Some of the increases in the average tax payments made by other self-employed in 1987 and 1988 are due to the introduction of the withholding tax on professional fees in 1987 and the combined effects of the tax amnesty, the introduction of the self-assessment system and a full year payment of the withholding tax in 1988.</P>
    <P>The 1989 yield was the first to reflect a full year's credit for withholding tax paid in the previous year.</P>
    <P>Columns (a), (b) and (c)</P>
    <P>(i)  A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected to have the income of both spouses assessed on the husband is counted as one tax unit.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Some figures in the columns differ from those given previously.  This is due to more accurate information becoming available in the meantime.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Receipts of deposit interest retention tax and tax deducted by building societies under the <Col N="193" /> former composite rate arrangements are not included in the calculations. Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of these taxes referable to interest paid or credited to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give details of the formal or informal written submissions which have been made by his Department to the Inter-Governmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union since January 1991; if such document or documents will be made available to Dáil Deputies for information and comment; if not, the reason therefor; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>In early January 1991, Ireland presented a formal paper to the Inter-Governmental Conference on economic and monetary union which outlined our general position on a wide range of issues and which contained specific proposals to amend the existing provisions of the Treaty of Rome concerning economic and social cohesion.  A copy of that document was placed in the Oireachtas Library last February.</P>
      <P>As the discussions in the Inter-Governmental Conference developed, Ireland, like most other member states, tabled further specific proposals whenever it was considered necessary to do so in response to draft texts put before the conference by the Presidency.  However, as those proposals were made in the context of continuing negotiations, it would not be appropriate to disclose details concerning them at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be correct to assume that written submissions are the most effective way of influencing proceedings at the conference.  In fact, since the initial papers at the start of the conference, most of the contributions by member states are of an oral nature in response to Presidency <Col N="194" /> drafts and the large measure of agreement already achieved is mainly the result of constructive dialogue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 197 and 203 together.</P>
      <P>It has not been the practice to release information on the distribution of national lottery sales on a county basis. The national lottery company operate in a competitive retail environment and such commercial and marketing information must therefore be regarded as confidential.  Releasing such information might also raise security considerations.</P>
      <P>As regards the distribution of national lottery grants the position is that while as Minister for Finance I have overall responsibility for the national lottery, the operation of the various national lottery funded spending programmes is a matter for each of the Ministers concerned.  I would suggest, therefore, that the Deputy might wish to raise this matter directly with these Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of my Department the one activity which is funded by the national lottery is Gaeleagras na Seirbhíse Poiblí, the allocation for which in 1991 is £82,000.  Gaeleagras operate through their headquarters in Dublin where approximately £75,000 will be spent in 1991.  The provision of Irish language courses outside Dublin will involve the <Col N="195" /> following expenditure: County Galway, £2,500; County Kerry, £2,500; County Donegal, £2,000.</P>

      <P>(a) Teagasc has appointed a staff member, who is a qualified accountant, as internal auditor to the organisation; (b) the system was set up in April 1991; (c) the internal audits are carried out according to professional accounting practice and (d) reports will be made to the Director in the first instance and will also be available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>The Racing Board</P>
      <P>(a) The Board operates an internal audit system by means of an independent division within the board's administrative structure with special responsibility for the audit of the operations and systems of the board; (b) the audit division is in existence since the establishment of the board in 1945; (c) the division audits, on a regular basis, all of the operations and systems of the board and (d) the division reports directly to the chief executive and its reports are also available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

    <P>The National Stud, Bord na gCon.  Coras Beostoic agus Feola and An Bord Glas <Col N="200" /> None of these bodies has separate internal audit units; they rely on stringent internal controls.

    <P>I am satisfied that the systems in force combine the necessary elements of scrutiny and managerial autonomy.  I consider that the adequacy of internal audit practices is a matter in the first instance for the auditors charged with the responsibility of preparing the annual accounts.</P>

Consequently as no milk was produced on the holding of the person indicated, <Col N="201" /> during the quota reference year of 1983, no quota attaches to that land and he was not therefore entitled to a basic quota allocation.</P>

The EC funds referred to by the Deputy, therefore, were received about two months after <Col N="206" /> each month's payments of 1990 ewe premium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On my recommendation, the Government have taken a decision as to the way in which the rural development programme is to be implemented for the future.  That decision was, of course, taken in the light of the experience gained in the operation of the pilot programme under my Department and having regard to the budgetary resources available and the other rural development initiatives currently being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, the Government have decided that the basic elements of the pilot programme will be retained, e.g. core groups, &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; initiative, co-ordinators and shared experience.  In the interests of efficiency and best use of resources, in the western areas the county development officer, whose remit will be suitably widened, will provide the new service.  In reaching this decision, cognisance was taken of the operation of the county development teams on a statutory basis under the central development committee, the socio-economic conditions of the areas they serviced, the <Col N="212" /> rural development nature of their functions to date and their access to the Western Development Fund in support of local projects for which financial assistance was not otherwise available.</P>
    <P>To operate the new arrangements through the county development officers in &ldquo;non-designated&rdquo; areas or through the re-establishment of county committees of agriculture as suggested would remove the &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; approach which is seen as the rationale for the new programme. As I have emphasised before, the new programme is a State-backed, self-help initiative.  It will not operate as another development agency and will not compete with existing agencies or voluntary organisations.  It will, rather, have a complementary role to existing &ldquo;top down&rdquo; development and act as a stimulus for local enterprise and voluntary effort.</P>

      <P>The townland of Coolroe in the district electoral division of Graiguenamagh has now been given less severely handicapped areas status as part of the recent reclassification agreed by the EC Commission.  Previously, the mountain sheep grazing areas in that townland were classified as disadvantaged for sheep and goat headage purposes only.  The revised classification will entitle farmers in these areas to additional benefits in the form of headage payments on beef cows and horses.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 249, 251 and 260 together.</P>
      <P>As I announced on 27 September, 34 business plans were received from various groups under the EC LEADER programme on rural development.  The plans were assessed and placed in order of merit by a firm of consultants based on the quality of the plans and the specific LEADER criteria such as guarantee of solvency, administrative ability, local presence and expertise in rural development. The Government decided in the light of the general high quality of the plans, to submit all of them to the EC Commission for consideration together with the consultants' recommendations.</P>
      <P>My aim is to have as many as possible of the 34 plans accepted for funding but obviously the final selection depends on the merit of the plans themselves and the extent of funding available.  I am, however, hopeful that at least 10-12 plans will be successful.</P>
      <P>Four of the 34 plans received relate to County Kildare or parts of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A decision on some or all of the successful groups is expected towards the end of this year.  I will make an announcement at the appropriate time, including <Col N="215" /> details of levels of investment and national and EC funding.</P>

      <P>There is a forage area limit in the disadvantaged areas schemes which limits payment to a maximum of 1.4 livestock units per forage hectare.  In order to apply that limit, it is necessary to know the forage acreage grazed by the animals of each applicant &mdash; for this reason the acreages stated on applications are being cross-checked with copy folios, title deeds etc. to ensure their accuracy.  As it is not possible to do this for every applicant in one year, it is being done on a phased basis over a number of years &mdash; that is why some farmers whose statements of acreages in some previous years were accepted as accurate are now being asked for documentation to verify that their acreages have indeed been stated accurately.</P>

      <P>The reasons for the delay were as follows: (a) the EC regulations governing the scheme were not finalised until July 1990 after all other cattle scheme applications had been issued in Ireland, (b) those regulations were so complex that discussions with the EC Commission services were necessary this year to ensure that we were implementing them properly in Ireland and (c) there have been some difficulties in obtaining details of the milk quotas owned by certain applicants so that their eligibility for the scheme and the number of cows on which premium could be paid could be established accurately.  These problems have been largely resolved now, however, and payment of 1990 and 1991 grants under this scheme should start in November 1991 with all other 1991 cattle scheme payments.</P>

      <P>FÁS have an internal audit unit in operation since its establishment on 1 January 1988.  The scope and function of the internal audit work encompasses the examination and evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the organisation's systems of internal control.  The manager of the internal audit unit reports to the board secretary on day-to-day matters. The manager also reports to an audit subcommittee of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CERT have a system of internal audit and control in operation since its establishment in 1963.  The system is operated <Col N="227" /> by staff within the accounting/finance section of the organisation.  The operation of this system entails regular reviews of the organisation's financial control systems and the effectiveness of its operations.  Reports are made to divisional heads and the chief executive, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Neither the Employment Equality Agency, Labour Relations Commission nor the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health have a formal internal audit system.  These bodies are funded through grants from my Department's Vote and their accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <P>The submission from the Scheme Workers Alliance related to the staffing of centres for the unemployed under the social employment scheme.  Many of the issues raised were a day to day matter for FÁS.</P>
      <P>I pointed out in my reply that there were just under 11,000 participants on the scheme at the end of September and that the end of year target was 12,500. Expenditure on the scheme this year will be £73 million approximately of which £61 million will come from the Exchequer with the balance coming from the European Social Fund.</P>

      <P>The ESB have informed me that ESB International only compete for major prestige engineering and related consultancy contracts in Ireland many of which would otherwise go to foreign consulting engineers. The ESB fully recognise that it would be counter-productive to create new jobs through their subsidiaries at the expense of employment in the private sector in Ireland.  The ESB see the limited activities of ESB International in Ireland as channelling more work in the direction of Irish sub-contractors who are given every opportunity to compete for such contracts.</P>
      <P>The Competition Act, 1991, which has now come into effect, provides appropriate machinery for dealing with cases should the question of unfair competition arise.</P>

      <P>Two non-commercial statutory bodies, the Combat Poverty Agency and the Pensions Board, operate under the aegis of my Department.  Neither body have, as yet, an internal audit function within their organisation but both are quite small and are subject to a variety of controls and monitoring by my Department. In addition, my Department are represented by senior officers on the boards of both bodies.</P>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency, which was established in 1986 and has 15 staff, operates under financial guidelines which have been set by my Department in consultation with the Department of Finance. The prior approval of my Department and in some instances that of the Department of Finance, is required for certain expenditure such as that involving the recruitment and rates of pay or staff.  The agency is obliged to comply with Government contract procedures and to implement tax clearance arrangements laid down by the Department of Finance concerning the placing of contracts.  The agency's annual report and accounts audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, must be submitted to my Department not later than six months after the end of each financial year.  These documents are subsequently laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Similar arrangements already apply or are in the course of being applied to the Pensions Board which was set up in January 1991 and has six staff at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The governing legislation in the case of both bodies contains provisions relating to the disclosure of interest and information. Any member of the boards of these bodies who is directly or indirectly interested in any company or concern with which the body proposes to make any contract must make this information known to the body and is debarred from taking part in any discussion or voting on the proposed contract.  The legislation also specifies that any member of the <Col N="242" /> boards of the bodies and staff, advisers or consultants employed by them cannot, without the consent of the bodies, disclose any information obtained in the performance of their duties.</P>

      <P>The revision in the means is due to the fact that she has sold some property and the proceeds must be assessed in accordance with the formula set out in the Social Welfare Act.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have been made to have her rate of payment adjusted.</P>

      <P>I have, over the last few years gradually increased the age limit for payment of child dependant allowances to long term social welfare recipients where the child remains in full-time education. In the case of invalidity pension, and other long term payments such allowances can now be paid up to the age of 21.  In the case of short term payments such as disability benefit, child dependant allowances are paid up to the age of 18. An extension of this age limit would have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context, having regard to available resources.</P>

      <P>The relatively higher growth in the number of women on the live register is due, in part, to the increasing participation of women in the labour force.

      <P>The person concerned, who is an old age pensioner, has been assessed as being the beneficial owner of a business premises.  The premises in question was transferred to a son who works abroad.  Subsequently, the premises were leased to relatives of the pensioner and his son.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation, a person who disposes of property in order to qualify for pension continues to be assessed with the income from that property for social welfare purposes.</P>
      <P>It was decided, and this was confirmed on appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office, that the person should continue to be assessed as the beneficial owner of the business in question.</P>
      <P>When the leasing arrangement was first introduced, the pensioner's means were assessed at £37.50 per week.  The rent on the lease was increased subsequently and this increase resulted in a revised means assessment which took effect from 9 August 1991.  The new means assessment means that the person is now entitled to a pension of £17.00 per week.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for old age non-contributory pension in January 1991.  Following investigation, the application was rejected by a deciding officer as his weekly means of £58.06 exceeded the then statutory limit of £56.00 per week.  The means assessed are derived from farm holding and capital.</P>
      <P>This decision was appealed by the claimant in April 1991 and his case was referred to an independent appeals officer for determination.  The appeals officer determined on 19 July 1991 that the person concerned was not entitled to an old age pension up to 25 July 1991. However, with effect from 26 July 1991 the appeals officer assessed the person's means at £57 per week &mdash; just below the new statutory limit of £58 per week.  This entitled him to a reduced old age non-contributory pension of £3 per week, plus an adult dependant allowance of £2 per week from that date.</P>
      <P>The decisions of appeals officers are final and I have no power to alter their decisions.  If the person's circumstances change, he can apply for a review at that time and his entitlement will be reinvestigated.</P>

      <Col N="259" /> As can be seen, the majority of adult dependant allowances were increased by around 4 per cent or more.  Only where the adult dependant was aged 66 or older, and his or her spouse was receiving an old age contributory or retirement pension, was the increase significantly lower than 4 per cent.  The adult dependant allowance paid in these situations is the highest in the social welfare system, and is only paid in cases where there is other income. Where the couple have no other income, an adult dependant over 66 can qualify for the full non-contributory old age pension in his/her own right, at the rate of £55.</P>

      <P>A new branch manager was appointed in Killarney on 1 December 1989.  She was given a seven year contract, subject to her providing alternative premises to those in use at present.  She acquired premises at Bohereencael, Glebe, Killarney which was considered suitable by my Department, subject to renovations. However, she was refused planning permission for the renovations and this decision was upheld on appeal.  The branch manager has now identified another premises which, subject to renovations and planning permission, would be deemed suitable by my Department.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made to ensure that the services provided in this branch office are moved to new and improved premises as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71 sets out the social security arrangements for nationals of EC Member States who work and move within the Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> Provisions for entitlement to unemployment benefit are contained in Articles 67 to 71, inclusive, of the regulation.</P>
    <P>It is a general provision of Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71 that the country to which a claimant last paid social insurance contributions shall be responsible for paying unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>In accordance with this provision, an unemployed person who returns to Ireland having last paid social insurance in another EC country must pay at least one social insurance contribution in Ireland before unemployment benefit can be paid by my Department.</P>
    <P>Article 71 (b) (ii) of Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71 deals with a particular category of unemployed person who, prior to becoming unemployed, paid social insurance contributions to one Member State while residing in another Member State.  If such a person makes himself or herself available for employment in the country of residence, unemployment benefit can be paid by that country.  The payment of social insurance contributions to the country of residence is not a prerequisite for the award of unemployment benefit in this particular situation.</P>
    <P>Certain categories of seamen residing in Ireland who were employed on ships carrying the flag of another EC Member State are covered by the provisions of Article 71 (b) (ii).  They are therefore exempted from the need to pay at least one Irish social insurance contribution before unemployment benefit can be awarded.</P>
    <P>When a claim to unemployment benefit is received from a seaman residing in Ireland who last worked aboard a vessel flying the flag of another EC country, my Department obtains details of the claimant's social insurance record from that country.  If that insurance record satisfies the conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit, payment will be made by my Department.</P>
    <P>The procedures carried out by my Department in relation to the award of unemployment benefit to emigrants returning from other EC countries are <Col N="267" /> fully consistent with the relevant EC Regulations.</P>

      <P>Some of the detail sought by the Deputy is not readily available but I shall within the next few weeks supply as much of it to him as can be extracted from available records without the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the length of sickness period allowed on full pay and reduced pay, the position is as follows.  Full pay may be allowed for up to a maximum of <Col N="274" /> 183 days absence on properly certified sick leave in any period of 12 months. Thereafter sick leave may be granted at half-pay for a further 182 days in any 12 month period.  Where these sick leave provisions have been exhausted, a member whose service could render him eligible for pension may be granted further sick leave at pension rate of pay until his resumption of duty or discharge from the force on grounds of ill-health.</P>
    <P>An exception to the normal provisions for paid sick leave arises in the case of a member of the Garda Síochána who is injured on duty.  Such a member may receive full pay pending his return to duty or discharge from the force on grounds of ill-health.</P>
    <P>As regards certification of illness, the position is that a medical certificate for the purpose of sick leave in the Garda Síochána must be completed either by a qualified medical practitioner or the Garda surgeon.  The certificate must state the relevant member's name and the period for which he is unfit for duty.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic Acts provide a comprehensive range of parking controls on vehicles generally.  Responsibility for the enforcement of these controls, including the removal of vehicles, rests with the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the need for a special <Col N="280" /> system to control the parking of large vehicles in built-up areas.  Proposals for such a system have been developed by my Department, in conjunction with Dublin Corporation and the Garda, and I understand that the Garda Commissioner is now considering the making of local traffic and parking by-laws or temporary rules to cover the matter.</P>
    <P>As regards noise, the position is that regulations made under the Road Traffic Act, 1961 require vehicles not to cause excessive noise when in use.  Enforcement of these regulations is a matter for the gardaí.  Controls in relation to neighbourhood noise generally are contained in section 51 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, as amended.  The Environmental Protection Agency Bill will, when enacted, provide more comprehensive noise control powers.</P>
    <P>As part of the existing compulsory vehicle testing scheme, the exhaust emissions of heavy goods vehicles, buses and ambulances are tested every year.  Compulsory testing will be extended to light goods vehicles &mdash; those under one and half tons unladen weight &mdash; from 1994-95.  Testing will apply to such vehicles over four years old every two years.  Consideration is being given to the introduction of a more stringent test when testing of light goods vehicles commences on 1 January 1994.</P>

      <P>The provision in my Department's Vote for recoupment in 1991 of expenditure incurred by housing authorities in relation to accommodation etc., for homeless persons under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988 is £600,000.  No payments are made from this provision direct to voluntary organisations.  As indicated in &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo;, the financial arrangements which housing authorities may make under section 10 with voluntary bodies providing accommodation for homeless persons have been adjusted to ensure that available funding is utilised in a flexible and effective manner.  The new arrangements have been notified to housing authorities.</P>

      <P>An application for funding under the remedial works scheme has been received and is being examined; a decision on the eligibility under the scheme of the works proposed will be made as soon as possible. However, the priority rating accorded to this estate by the corporation <i>vis-à-vis</i> other estates, the financial commitments on the corporation's eight approved projects and the overall high demand by local authorities for funding under the remedial works scheme would not allow the designation of St. Michael's Estate at this stage, even if the works proposed are deemed eligible under the scheme.  The management, maintenance and improvement of their housing estates and the fixing of priorities between different estates are matters for the corporation in which it would not be appropriate for the Minister to intervene.</P>

      <P>Schedules listing the grants allocated for amenities and recreational facilities for the period 1987/1988 and for each of the years 1990 and 1991 are available in the Oireachtas library.  There was no grant scheme in 1989.</P>
      <P>The allocations have been grouped by reference to the local authorities which recommended the projects and totals are provided for each authority.  Details of the allocations on a constituency basis are not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>Over 3,600 projects had been recommended by the local authorities to my Department under the 1991 scheme and allocations were made to 982 of these.  I am not aware of any project sponsors who have been unable to avail of their grant under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocations have been notified to the relevant local authorities whose function it is to advise the individual sponsors of the outcome of their applications. Because of the limited funds available, it was not possible to allocate grants to the remaining projects.  In the event of a similar scheme being introduced in the <Col N="297" /> future, it would, of course, be open to sponsors of projects which did not receive an allocation under the present scheme to submit a fresh application for a grant.</P>

Revised proposals for the phasing of work in this estate are awaited from Dublin Corporation, which is responsible <Col N="300" /> for the planning and execution of the project.  The time-scale for the completion of work will depend on the capital provided for the remedial works scheme in the annual public capital programme, the demands by authorities generally for assistance under the scheme and the priority given to the estate by the Corporation in the assignment of funds from their capital allocations.  Accordingly, it is not possible to say when the entire project will be completed.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 239 of 24 October, 1990.  The position in relation to the provision of isolated cottages is similar.  No specific allocation is made for the building of isolated rural <Col N="305" /> cottages; the funding of such houses forms part of the annual capital allocations made to housing authorities for their housing construction programme as a whole.</P>

      <P>This scheme involves the provision of a new single carriageway road from the Galway Road at Fonthill to Newlands Cross.  As the road will not form part of the network of national roads, the timing of construction work on it is primarily a matter for Dublin County Council.  The cost of the work would normally fall to be financed by the local authority from its own resources, supplemented by the discretionary grants for regional and county roads allocated annually by my Department.  Two sections of the road have already been provided, with special road grant assistance from the Department.  The question of providing such assistance towards the cost of the remaining sections of the road will be considered in the context of the determination of the road grant allocations for future years, having regard to the overall level of funds available for such grants and the competing demands of other schemes throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Section 42 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, as amended, confers on a planning authority the power to make a special amenity area order in respect of any area where it appears to the planning authority that, by reason of its outstanding natural beauty, its special recreational value or a need for nature conservation, the area should be declared to be an area of special amenity.  The making of such an order is a function reserved to the elected members of the council.  While I have power to direct a planning authority to make such an order for a special area, I consider that the matter is more appropriate for consideration and decision by the planning authority.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the maintenance and improvement of main and county roads rests with the county council in whose functional area these roads are and the cost of such work falls to be financed by the authority from its own resources, supplemented by the discretionary grants provided annually by my Department.  The discretionary road grant allocation to Kildare County Council in 1991 amounts to £1.868 million including a supplementary grant of £500,000, for improvement works, because of the special needs of the county.  I am satisfied that this is an equitable proportion of the overall funds available to me for such grants and I intend that the council will continue to get an equitable share of such grants in the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 484 and 486 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work on the Leixlip-Maynooth-Kilcock by-pass will be undertaken under two main civil engineering contracts. Contract one involves the provision of approximately 10 km. of two lane motorway, 1.3 km. of single lane carriageway, <Col N="313" /> an interchange at Straffan Road, five other bridges and associated works on the line of the by-pass between the Maynooth-Celbridge Road and a point about 3 km. west of Kilcock.  The acceptance of a tender for this contract was approved by me on 12 August 1991 and it is now a matter for Kildare County Council to complete the necessary legal formalities and get work underway.</P>
    <P>Contract two will involve the balance of the civil engineering work and contract documents for this work are expected to be submitted to my Department for approval in the near future.  There will be no undue delay in approving these.</P>
    <P>This scheme will be fully funded by road grant.  The by-pass, when completed in the spring of 1995, will replace the existing stretch of the national primary route N4 which will then serve local traffic only.  In the circumstances, it is not the intention to finance further improvement work on the existing route at Laraghbryan, Maynooth by direct grant from my Department.  It will be open to Kildare County Council to finance such work from their own resources, supplemented by the annual discretionary grants from my Department.</P>

      <P>As Shaw Bridge is located on a regional road, primary responsibility for the proposed project rests with the local authority, Kildare County Council.  The cost of such works falls to be financed from local resources supplemented by the discretionary grants provided by my <Col N="315" /> Department for such roads.  In the case of Kildare County Council, these grants total £1,868,000 in 1991, including a supplementary grant of £500,000, for improvement works, because of the special needs of the county.  The determination of priorities in the expenditure of these grants is a matter for the local authority.</P>
      <P>In March 1989, consultants appointed by the local authority prepared a preliminary design and a cost estimate for a scheme involving improvements to Shaw Bridge and the immediate approach roads.  These proposals were submitted to my Department with a request for special road grant assistance for the scheme.  Having regard to the level of funds available to me for such grants and the competing demands in respect of other projects throughout the country, I am not in a position to provide a special grant in this case.  The local authority has been so informed.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the special radium treatment machine in St. Luke's Hospital. Dublin 6 is constantly breaking down and as a result patients who travel from the country to this hospital must return home without this urgent treatment; and if he will consider having funds made available to have extra machines provided in this hospital.</Quest>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the events at St. Luke's/St. Anne's Hospital when one of the linear accelerators broke down on the 16 September last.  A replacement part was obtained from the UK and the machine was repaired by the 19th.  This interruption of service necessitated a rescheduling of patients. However, with regard to the specific point made by the Deputy, I am assured by St. Luke's/St. Anne's Hospital that no patients were sent home without treatment.</P>
      <P>At the request of my Department, the hospital are at present reviewing their equipment requirements, which, when submitted to my Department, will be considered in the context of the available resources and having regard to the many other competing priority requirements throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Luke's/St. Anne's are currently treating an additional 34 patients who would usually be treated at Cork Regional Hospital.  This situation has come about as a result of the cobalt unit in Cork Regional Hospital breaking down. <Col N="328" /> As the cobalt unit in Cork was not repairable, I was glad to immediately approve a capital grant of £455,000 for the purchase of a new machine, which is expected to become operational during the month of November.  This was in addition to a grant of £300,000 which I approved in respect of a new linear accelerator at Cork Regional Hospital.</P>

      <P>Persons in receipt of in-patient services for more than 30 days within a 12-month period may be liable for charges under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1987.</P>
      <P>The amount of the charge is not fixed but is based upon the patient's income. The regulations specify that an adequate amount must be left to the patient for personal needs.  The amount concerned is determined by the chief executive officer of the health board, taking into account the patient's financial commitments and any other relevant circumstances.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the regulations, a patient may incur liability for charges once 30 days are exceeded in any 12-month period, irrespective of whether this arises from one admission or a number of admissions.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that on 30 May 1991 I informed the Dáil that I proposed to have a review carried out of these regulations.  This review is in progress at present.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to recent requirements imposed by the Medical Council on persons in a certain category, the effect of which will be their exclusion from temporary registration on the basis that they are living in Ireland with specific reference to the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kilidare; if he intends to take any action to alleviate this discrimination; if his attention has been drawn to the qualifications of this person; if he expects to have the difficulty resolved in view of her application for British citizenship; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>: In the case to which the Deputy refers, the applicants' eligibility for temporary registration was considered in accordance with the statutory criteria under which the Medical Council operates.  The applicant failed to satisfy the council that she was eligible for temporary registration in accordance with those criteria and was so advised by the council.  I am not sure what the Deputy's point is in relation to the applicant living in Ireland.  I can advise him, however, that one of the statutory criteria is that a person must be in the State temporarily for the purpose of employment in the practice of medicine in an approved hospital.</P>
      <P>The person in question had first applied for full registration.  One of the requirements of the council for full registration is EC nationality.  If the applicant can satisfy the council that she has acquired citizenship of an EC member state, she will be eligible to take a written examination for full registration.  I am satisfied that there is no evidence of discrimination against this person.  The manner in which her application for permission to practice medicine in this country was dealt with by the council was in accordance with the relevant statute and the council's own rules.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that many former psychiatric patients are dependent on charities such as the Simon Community.  Before a patient is discharged from a psychiatric hospital, a thorough assessment by a multi-disciplinary psychiatric team is carried out to assess a patient's ability to cope with living in the community. Patients also participate in rehabilitation programmes designed to ease the transition to community living.  I am satisfied with the standard of care given and the dedication of staff caring for patients in the community.</P>
      <P>Comprehensive community-based psychiatric services are being put in place at local level in each health board area in line with Government policy as outlined in the report of the study group on the development of the psychiatric services &mdash; Planning for the Future, published in 1984.  The community psychiatric services in place comprise community based local residences, psychiatric day hospitals, outpatient clinics and training workshops. Former patients of psychiatric hospitals are placed in the care of the community services and are continuously and closely monitored to ensure that the transition to the community is successful.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Deputy's question dated 5 June 1991, I explained that information in the form requested was not routinely kept in my Department.  However, as promised in my reply, my Department asked health agencies to endeavour to compile information in the form sought by the Deputy.  This work is at present being carried out by the agencies but is not yet complete.  I will communicate with the Deputy when I have received all the information.</P>
      <P>On the general question of waiting-lists, I would, however, draw the Deputy's attention to the conclusion of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group that the numbers recorded as being on waiting-lists may significantly overstate the number of patients who are, in fact, awaiting treatment, in the absence of regular validation to remove the names of patients who have been treated elsewhere, moved, or died.  The group stated that such validation is not common at present, and recommended that it should be adopted as a firm policy in each hospital.  Deputies will be aware that I have established an advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor David Kennedy to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group.</P>

The service at the special clinics organised by health boards is available to all women free of charge.</P>
      <P>As far as medical card holders are concerned, those who require a cervical smear test as part of their medical treatment would be entitled to have the smear taken by their general practitioner free of charge.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Out-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1987, women undergoing cervical smear testing are liable for the £10 out-patient charge in respect of the hospital laboratory test.  Exemptions under the regulations include medical card holders and women receiving services in respect of motherhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I established a working group on cervical screening in 1988.  The working group concentrated on the arrangements for the taking and analysis of cervical smears.  Considerable progress has been <Col N="345" /> made in these areas and reporting intervals are now generally satisfactory.</P>

      <P>Restrictions on smoking in public places and certain public offices were introduced by me in May last year.  On the basis of feedback from a wide range of interests there appears to be a very high level of general support for the regulations and there would not appear to be any evidence of widespread non-observance.</P>
      <P>I have established a consultative committee to examine the possible extension of the regulations to the workplace.  This committee consists of representatives from the relevant organisations and agencies &mdash; the Departments of Health and Labour, the Health and Safety Authority, ICTU, the FIE and a consultant medical practitioner.  I also propose to undertake, this year, a general review of the regulations to evaluate a possible extension to their provisions.</P>

      <P>In line with Government policy, as outlined in the report of the study group on the development of the psychiatric services &mdash; Planning for the Future, comprehensive community based psychiatric services are being put in place at local level.

Comprehensive data on the numbers so treated are not available.</P>
      <P>Persons suffering from alcohol abuse and alcoholic psychoses are also admitted to psychiatric hospitals.  In 1988, the latest year for which details are available from the Health Research Board there were 6,478 persons admitted with such diagnosis, 2,239 of whom were first admissions, 303 (5 per cent) of total admissions were under 25 years.  In addition, the hospital in-patient inquiry scheme records show that 176 persons were admitted to acute hospitals suffering from alcohol poisoning in 1989, the latest year for which figures are available.</P>

    <P>The figures quoted are in respect of direct expenditure by each health board and the relevant amount spent by public voluntary hospitals and the GMS (Payments) Board on behalf of each board. Expenditure per head of population is calculated on the basis of the 1986 census of population.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that expenditure per head of population is an unweighted average and fails to take account of a number of important demographic and geographic factors.  The difference in the cost of health care in each region is also influenced by other factors such as access to higher specialties, density of population and the present stage of development of the services.  This should be borne in mind when using these figures for comparative purposes.</P>

      <P>The details requested by the Deputy are set out in tabular form beneath.  The Deputy will be aware of the circumstances which gave rise to the determination of agency non-capital allocations in 1987.  The general level of funding in that year reflected the need for significant operational economies within the health services, together with the <Col N="351" /> introduction of charges for both in-patient and out-patient services which had the effect of reducing the net allocations of agencies.  The full year effect of such <Col N="352" /> charges were also reflected in the allocation figures for 1988.</P>

    <P>The 1991 allocation figure represents the original allocation, notified at the beginning of the year.  This will fall to be adjusted for each board in respect of pay awards, lottery funded programmes, service developments and other approved additions to spending which arise in the course of the year.  The final allocations for 1991 will not be determined until all the relevant data on these elements are available.  It is, therefore, necessary to exercise caution in interpreting the significance of the figures provided in respect of 1991.</P>

    <P>My Department's allocation excludes salaries and other overheads incurred in the running of the unit.  The increase of approximately 30 per cent in funding this year compared with the 1990 allocation reflects my commitment to health promotion and the development of important support programmes at national and local level.</P>

      <P>Information on the distribution of the health allocation of lottery funds is not readily available on a constituency basis. However, the following lists show projects which can be identified on a county basis as well as projects which relate to the Mid-Western Health Board area rather than to specific locations.

      <P>Sterile equipment and supplies includes items which are capable of being sterilised, e.g. gowns, drapes, theatre instruments and dressing packs together with a range of consumables and disposables such as needles, syringes and catheters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Individual health agencies generally purchase these items on an annual basis by way of tender.  The recent hospital efficiency review group report has recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that agencies pool their collective purchasing power with the objective of securing optimum terms. The group's recommendations in this <Col N="393" /> area are now being followed up with those agencies concerned by the value for money unit within my Department.</P>
    <P>The concept of central purchasing is applied at health board level but my Department are keeping under review the potential benefits from wider group purchasing initiatives, particularly in relation to those products which would be amenable to such a strategy.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on sterile supplies is not indicated separately in health agency accounts.  It is included under a much broader heading of medical and surgical appliances which is estimated at £40 million for 1991.</P>
    <P>As a result of an initiative taken by my Department in 1990, price information is exchanged on a monthly basis with UK health authorities on a wide range of products to ensure that health agencies here increase their market awareness through access to a wider database.  International price information comparisons, however, must be viewed in the context of different procurement systems which apply to individual services in different countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> The Deputy can be assured that achievement of economies through rationalisation of purchasing arrangements will continue to be pursued as a top priority.</P>

An exercise on costings in a number of larger hospitals throughout the country is underway at present and this shows an average cost per bed day for a general surgical bed of £173 and for an orthopaedic bed, £157. The average cost per long stay bed is £26 approximately a day.</P>

This is in line with the development plan for acute hospitals in the Mid-Western Health Board area, which the board adopted in March 1988.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that substantial work has been undertaken at Ennis in the past few years &mdash; fire precautions have been enhanced; the surgical ward and both medical wards have been upgraded to a high standard of accommodation; operating theatres have been upgraded; the accident and emergency department and the physiotherapy department are both being enhanced in conjunction with the development of the geriatric assessment unit.</P>
      <P>An additional consultant post of physician in geriatric medicine has been sanctioned and the appointee is expected to take up duty in early December 1991.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true to suggest that an outright embargo on staff recruitment was re-established in June 1991.  Revised arrangements were introduced by my Department to ensure that employment <Col N="416" /> within the health system would remain at a level which was consistent with the Government's policy on public service employment generally and with each agency's financial allocation.  While the revised arrangements require agencies to submit all proposed permanent appointments to my Department, there has been no delay in clearing appointments in agencies which are operating within their approved financial and employment parameters.</P>

      <P>My Department have funds at their disposal for the support of youth services generally and services for disadvantaged youth in particular.  The youth service grants scheme is but one of the mechanisms under which grants are channelled to the service providers.  The allocation in any one year under this particular scheme takes many factors into account including the total allocation available for youth services and changes in emphasis between services funded through the youth service grants scheme and other schemes, including a special scheme for the disadvantaged.  The grants paid to individual organisations under the youth service grants scheme do not, therefore, necessarily represent the full funding available to them under the youth service programme nor do they fully reflect the priorities set out within the programme.</P>
      <P>The distribution of funds in 1991 continued the change of emphasis from general services to services specifically aimed at the disadvantaged and there are no plans to change this approach now.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the availability of post-primary school places for pupils from the Castleknock/Hartstown/ Dunboyne areas has been under continuing review in my Department in the light of the most up-to-date data available on demographic trends, housing developments and primary school enrolments. Following recent meetings with parental representatives, I felt that, in the particular circumstances, independent consultants should be engaged to undertake a study to determine whether a new post-primary school is needed in the area and, if so, the required size and most appropriate <Col N="452" /> location, having regard to relative population densities and the locations of existing schools.</P>
    <P>The study is currently at an advanced stage.  Following receipt and consideration of the consultants' report in my Department, a final decision will be made on the second level requirements for the areas in question.</P>

      <P>The Tempus Programme, which is the Trans-European Mobility Programme for University Students, was introduced, negotiated and agreed during Ireland's Presidency of the EC in the first half of 1990 and was adopted by the General Affairs Council in May of that year.  The programme, which is part of the PHARE initiative to assist the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, provides opportunities for third level students and staff from these countries to spend a period of time studying/teaching in the member states of the European Community, or participating in a placement in business or industry.  The initial pilot phase, three years, of the scheme commenced on 1 July 1990.  Participants do not pay tuition fees, but the institutions concerned receive a grant equivalent to about half the fee per student from the EC funding available for the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are five Hungarian students registered at Trinity College Dublin under the terms of the Tempus scheme in this country.  The content of the courses being followed by the Hungarian students is a matter between the students and the college authorities. <Col N="455" /> However, I am pleased that one of the students in question is studying old Irish having taken Irish as part of her undergraduate course in Hungary.  Tempus is a multilateral programme financed by the European Commission, and as such the question of funding by my Department does not arise.</P>

I have requested the working group to submit their report to me as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have extended an invitation to the private sector to submit proposals to me for the development of a modern public transport system for Dublin.  Already considerable interest is being shown by a number of international transport companies in association with local, private and public interests, in the development of an integrated light rail system for Dublin.  However, a number of issues must be evaluated comprehensively, including the possible network of operations and the financing of the investment involved.  These matters are being examined in detail by the working group.</P>

      <P>Since the present licensing scheme came into operation in 1986, eight applications for licences have been refused.

Not all of these applications are subsequently pursued by the applicants.</P>
      <P>There are no quantitative restrictions on the number of licences issued.</P>
      <P>The following numbers of road freight carrier's licences have been issued under the present licensing scheme: 1986, 211; 1987, 481; 1988, 207; 1989, 738; 1990, 966; 1991 to date 677.</P>
      <P>Licences lapse after three years.  In such cases, new licences are issued on application provided the requirements continue to be met.</P>
