It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that: (1) Business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m. tonight; (2) No. 11 shall be decided without debate; (3) The proceedings on the remaining Stages of No. 14, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 5 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) In the case of the Supplementary Estimates to which No. 15 refers, the following arrangements shall apply: (a) The questions necessary to bring the proceedings on Votes 34 and 25 to a conclusion shall be put not later than 5.45 p.m. and 6.45 p.m. respectively; (b) In the case of Vote 34 the speech of each Member called on shall not exceed ten minutes and a Minister of State may be called on a second time to make a speech in reply to the debate not exceeding five minutes.

      <P>Is the proposal that business be interrupted at 10.30 p.m. tonight agreed?  Agreed.  Is it agreed that No. 11 shall be decided without debate? Agreed.  Is it agreed that the proceedings on the remaining Stages of No. 14, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 5 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications?</P>

      <P>My party object to the imposition of this artificial time limit on the debate on the proposal to sell the B &amp; I line because it is a very controversial sale.  I understand that only one of the 20 amendments tabled has been debated so far. As this time limit has been imposed it is probable that the majority of amendments tabled by Members of this House will not even be discussed, let alone voted on.</P>

      <P>On behalf of The <Col N="2095" /> Workers' Party I, too, object to the guillotine on the B &amp; I debate.  While it is useful to have squeezed the concession of an extra hour-and-a-quarter for debate today it is obviously not adequate to deal with the other 19 amendments which have still to be reached.  It is clear from the debate so far that there are many substantial issues yet to be teased out by the Members of this House and I, therefore, indicate that we are opposing the guillotine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The amounts involved here are not very significant, but would the Taoiseach not agree that this sort of restricted debate is inadequate as a means of dealing with financial business of any kind, and can he give the House some assurance that he has proposals for Dáil reform to allow proper committee style examination of both Supplementary Estimates and main Estimates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This procedure is one that we have adopted for some years.  It is really an opportunity for the House to discuss the Estimates in an overall context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy was talking about discussion on the Book of Estimates.  With regard to the 1992 Estimates, we intend to devote every Friday, right up to the summer, to discuss the Estimates in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, that is a distinct improvement.  Will the Taoiseach allow for some type of committee discussions on the Estimates, where questions could be asked and answered and dialogue might develop, rather than the set piece speeches of the traditional kind which do not involve consideration of the Estimates, within the meaning of the Constitution?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Standing Orders of the Dáil were amended to allow for that type of debate on Estimates, but the order to keep that type of debate in place was never renewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am on my feet I would also <Col N="2099" /> ask is this the new style of Government? Traditionally we had agreement in this House between the Whips on the Order of Business and if that agreement broke down, there was holy war here during my time as Chief Whip.  Pairs were cancelled and quorums were called.  Every day of the week now we come in here to see the Government ramming their business through by way of a vote.  It is disgraceful that this happens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Please, Deputy Barrett.  May I take it that the question I put to the House is agreed?  Agreed.  The next question I must put is if the proposal for the taking of divisions on Supplementary Estimates at 6.45 p.m. today is agreed?  Agreed.  The last question is &mdash; are the arrangements for dealing with No. 12 agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate the time frame for the publication of the White Paper on Maastricht? The Taoiseach will have read in the papers an indication that public opinion is potentially quite uncertain about this very important change.  It is important that the Dáil and the Government should inform public opinion at the earliest possible moment on the implications of Maastricht so that debate in the lead up to the referendum will be well informed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that in the context of the promised legislation to introduce a referendum to approve the Treaty amendments agreed at Maastricht, it is important that the Government should plan that in advance and publish a White Paper soon so that public opinion will be well informed?</P>

Given that the Government have made provision for an extra 22,000 people on the live register next year, may I ask the Taoiseach if the task force set up by the Government, I think, last June have reported or will they report in the near future?  Second, Dé Luain seo caite, dúirt an Taoiseach go mbunófaí Teilifís <Col N="2101" /> Ghaeilge i 1992.  An bhfuil suim airgid curtha in áireamh sna Meastacháin don tseirbhís seo?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last night I had just commenced my contribution on the amendments before us.  I consider these amendments to be important as they go to the core of the national interest in relation to shipping, that is, the need to guarantee continuity of service in the future.  In other words, it is self-evident that an island nation needs to be able to guarantee that there will be available at all times in the future ferry services to Britain and the Continent.  I also made the point that it would be highly desirable to seek to recreate a deep sea Irish merchant shipping fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we are all aware, under EC rules we are confined in what we can do to guarantee continued Irish ownership of the shipping fleet but there are a number of things we can do, as I have said.  First, we could set down generous investment limits under the business expansion <Col N="2105" /> scheme in relation to shipping.  In 1986-87 the Government of which I was a member extended that scheme to include shipping.  However the Government which followed soon afterwards in March 1987 so restricted investment limits in shipping as to render the extension of the business expansion scheme to it meaningless. Yet the business expansion scheme is one of the few vehicles available to guarantee Irish ownership because it is based on investment by Irish taxpayers in Irish companies.  I ask the Minister to seize this opportunity to create the basis to guarantee Irish ownership of the deep sea shipping fleet in the future by reopening the business expansion scheme to shipping.  This is a crucial point if we are to guarantee continuity of service.</P>
    <P>There has been much valid criticism directed at the Minister over the way in which he has handled this matter.  It is easy to criticise the Minister of the day but some of the criticism on this occasion is valid.  Much of the criticism, however should be directed not towards the Minister in the House but towards the Department of Finance.  The Minister is proposing to spend up to £36 million of public funds to clear the debts of the B &amp; I having put in £8 million to £9 million per year on average for the past several years.  I recall, when I was Minister for Tourism and Transport, proposing to the Department of Finance that we take on board debts totalling £20 million for the B &amp; I and set them up as an operating company, not without debts, but with sufficient debts to give them a gearing of at least one to one; in other words, their debts would not be greater than their assets.  The Minister has gone further and is going to clear all their debts leaving the B &amp; I as a very pluckable pear.  They will be free of debts despite the fact that they have considerable assets some of which are greatly understated.  For example, the pension fund and some other assets of the company are greatly understated.  This is a matter of concern.</P>
    <P>That point has been made.  The point I want to make is that much of the criticism which has been focused on the Minister <Col N="2106" /> should be directed at the Department of Finance.  The fact of the matter is that the performance of the Department of Finance in relation to the B &amp; I has been replicated in my experience in other areas of public expenditure.  If the Department of Finance had accepted the proposal made by the Department of Tourism and Transport in 1986, what is happening today to the B &amp; I would have happened earlier and the Exchequer would have been caught for a smaller amount &mdash; estimated at £20 million then as compared to £36 million now, a difference of £16 million, in addition to the money which has been spent in the meantime.  We are talking therefore about a figure of up to £50 million of taxpayers' money which has been spent in the meantime.  I think it would have helped the B &amp; I to get off to a much better start.</P>
    <P>Having said this, I agree that considerable improvements have been made in B &amp; I.  The board and staff deserve our praise but so, too, do the Department. B &amp; I were a mess for many decades.  There were many difficult problems and entrenched practices in the company but a great number of them have been sorted out over the years with a great deal of difficulty and pain.  These problems were tackled by the board, the management, the workforce and, indeed, the Department, and that has led to an improved performance by B &amp; I over recent years. As well as praising the B &amp; I performance we must also praise ICG, the remnants of Irish Shipping which tragically and heartbreakingly had to be liquidated in 1986.  As Minister at the time, no decision caused me more pain and no decision was more justified than that one.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity in this Bill to resurrect an Irish deep sea shipping fleet. I had always hoped that Irish Continental Line, now Irish Continental Group, would be the basis of a new deep sea shipping fleet.  Unfortunately, regardless of whether the buy-out is by management or by Irish Continental Group, the Bill will result in fewer jobs in shipping at a time of record national unemployment. We should be seeking ways and means of creating new job opportunities because <Col N="2107" /> we have a great number of highly qualified shipping personnel.  There is an opportunity to create more jobs rather than adding to the unemployment figures which will happen as a result of the takeover permitted by this Bill.  More jobs will be created only if there is investment in shipping and, most likely, if that is Irish investment.  Irish investment in shipping is most likely to be encouraged and faciliated if the business expansion scheme is generously opened up to shipping rather than restricted as was done by former Deputy MacSharry when he was Minister in 1987.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell has used the amendment to put forward some historical justification for his decision, and that of the then Government, in respect of Irish Shipping.  I do not wish to follow him down that shipping lane, not because I do not have views on it but because I do not think it adds a great deal to this amendment.  Perhaps the strategic argument he raised is more appropriate to our amendment No. 3.  However, he raised an important point concerning the traditional debt-equity ratio which strangled the performance of B &amp; I.  I recall in a different capacity making arguments to Deputy Mitchell, when he was Minister for Transport, to tackle that debt-equity stranglehold.  I did not know until today that he apparently took most of my arguments on board and that it was the Department of Finance who thwarted their implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary, and it is fair to point out, that the present Minister has managed to find &mdash; this is one of the central elements of the amendment &mdash; £36 million to wipe the balance sheet clear.  The significance of that was lost on the Minister, Deputy Brennan's backbench assistants of yesterday who professed not to be able to understand it and who &mdash; in full flight they are quite a sight &mdash; argued, if there are other buyers out there, where are they?  The point being made was that if the Minister made the dramatic decision at a time of scarce resources to find £36 million to wipe the <Col N="2108" /> balance sheet clear, he ought, by any commercial criteria, to have given B &amp; I the opportunity to trade in their new financial condition so that the multiple of pre-tax profits that would be the yardstick of the purchase of that company in any normal commercial sphere in the future would bring in so much more revenue to the State.  That point was made to the Minister by the board.  The board do not accept, nor do financial commentators, unions and others, that the normal tendering process was observed or that the Minister observed the normal privatisation prologue of which the Government already have experience in the case of, for example, the Irish Sugar Company. That is the nub of the matter.</P>
    <P>Why is there such indecent haste in this matter?  In a Dáil session in which major Bills have had to be dropped because we could not get around to them and other Bills badly need to be progressed, why does the Minister have to railroad the Bill through this House, without any notice, in order to sell off this company to ICG at such a disadvantage to the taxpayer?  That is the nub of the point which the Minister has not explained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Several issues were raised yesterday and I would like to deal with some of them on this amendment.  Deputy Yates took me to task about the golden share &mdash; he seems to be very interested in that concept. To take on board that suggestion would obviously entail some Government control over the future direction of the company and, in the manner in which the Deputy put forward the point, it simply would not be practical.  The Government's primary strategic concern for the future relates to capacity and to ensuring that the routes are competitive. If a change of ownership resulted in a restriction of competition at any stage, no Government would hesitate to invoke the substantial safeguards that exist at present under European Community and national law.  The imposition of a golden share would not necessarily give any more control than exists at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2109" /> The imposition of a golden share would most certainly have lowered the price we have been able to achieve because potential investors would naturally be wary, in my view of potential restrictions, of disposal of shares at any time.  In other words, anything which affects the saleability and tradeability of shares obviously affects the price, and in regard to the golden share I am certain that would have been the reaction of any potential purchaser.</P>
    <P>The point was made yesterday that ICG could sell off the company at some stage and that that would be a shame, but so too could MSBO.  There is no legal reason why they or their Danish backers would not sell the company to other Danish backers, and we would have no control over that.  The Danish backers might find themselves with plenty of money and might make an offer that the company could not refuse with the result that the entire company would become Danish.  If we make the claim that ICG could sell the company at any time, let us be fair and also admit that so too could the MSBO or their Danish supporters. There are two sides to that story and we should put them on record.</P>
    <P>I would refer Deputies to the agreement of the trade unions, which I placed on the record of the House yesterday, in regard to the question of the golden share.  I understand their position but they are reasonably satisfied with the assurances I have given in the matter.  I would like Deputy Yates to think again about some of those points.  The question of indemnities and warranties was raised yesterday.  I have given a very full explanation to the House on the question of indemnities and emphasised that they were also sought by the management-staff buy-out.  Certain warranties are being given to ICG as part of the share purchase agreement and every reasonable step has been taken to ensure the greatest possible protection for the Exchequer.  I pointed out yesterday that I am restricted in referring to this matter because of the court case in regard to the major indemnity.  With the exception of <Col N="2110" /> that item, I will give any other details required by the Deputies in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>Allegations have been made about the undue haste in this matter and that the sale was pushed through &mdash; the phrase used in the last few days is &ldquo;railroaded&rdquo;. This matter has been going on for more than 12 months.  It is over 12 months since I publicly announced that the Government had decided to sell the company to Irish Ferries.  The suggestions that this was a railroading exercise are unfounded but may, perhaps, have something to do with the end of season pressure on Parliament and Government to get the business done by a certain date.  The facts do not substantiate the claim that the Government railroaded the deal through.</P>
    <P>When Stokes Kennedy Crowley spoke to the Danish backers of the consortium on 2 October they stated clearly that they would require only two weeks to make a final bid.  They had already been associated with the previous bid a year earlier and their partners in that consortium were the company's existing management. They had been involved in it over a 12-month period which again shows, in my view, that there was no question of undue haste.  On 21 October, the chief executive of B &amp; I informed me that he would have a firm and final bid with me on behalf of the MSBO consortium within three weeks.  The industrial officer of ICTU on behalf of the B &amp; I group of unions also requested a period of three weeks in which to prepare a bid with the management consortium. When account is taken of extensions, as I pointed out on Second Stage, we agreed finally on a period of five weeks in which to make the final bid.  That was acceptable to all those making bids and, therefore, I do not understand why it should become a major problem for other people.  The people who wished to submit a bid got more time than they asked for in which to do so and, according to my <Col N="2111" /> records, they were satisfied with the time allowed.</P>

      <P>A totally false impression has been given in this debate also in regard to the profitability of the company.  Reference has been made to a trading profit of £4 million for the year 1992.  Let me put a very basic, but important fact on the record: the £4 million referred to is a very optimistic forecast for 1992 and is a 100 per cent improvement on the forecast outturn for 1991.  I read the facts of B &amp; I's actual performance into the record on Second Stage and I will repeat now for the benefit of Deputies, because the matter has been raised on this amendment, the actual results since 1984.  The trading profit before interest charges were as follow: 1984, a loss of £1.7 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The trading results before interest charges were: 1984, a loss of £1.7 million; 1985, a profit of £1.1 million; 1986, a profit of £1.1 million; 1987, a loss of £3.6 million; 1988, a profit of £1.8 million; 1989, a profit of £2 million; and 1990, a profit of £1.6 million. The results after charging interest were: 1984, a loss of £9.2 million; 1985, a loss of £6.6 million; 1986, a loss of £6.8 million; 1987, a loss of £10.7 million; 1988, a loss of £2.8 million; 1989, a loss of £1.5 million; and 1990, a loss of £2 million.</P>
      <P>In the same period, 1984-90 the Exchequer injected a total of £59 million in equity into the B &amp; I Line.  Indeed, as I have already pointed out, since we made this acquisition from the private sector a total of £106 million of taxpayers' money has been invested in the company. Deputies must speak, and quite rightly so, on behalf of the company and the workers, but somebody must also speak on behalf of the taxpayers because they are entitled to a voice in this debate also. We have invested £106 million in the company over a ten-year period and according to the original Stokes Kennedy Crowley report, a similar figure will be required to be invested over the next decade.  It is important that the taxpayers' voice, and not just the voice of the various interests involved in the disposal, is heard on the Floor of this Chamber today.</P>

      <P>One hundred and six million pounds is a lot of money, and we have two ships to show for it at the end of the day.  I was very taken aback by the negative attitude of some Opposition Deputies to the agreement I reached with ICTU and the B &amp; I group of unions. Despite the reservations of some Deputies, I think we achieved a major breakthrough.  I greatly appreciate, and I wish to thank publicly the B &amp; I workers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in concluding this agreement with me. The attitude yesterday of some of the Deputies to this breakthrough is to be regretted because it was a substantial agreement that showed that both sides to this argument were willing to lay aside their basic positions and reach agreement for the future of the company.  It was a pity that Deputies were not a bit more generous in complimenting the unions and the ICTU on reaching agreement, although I certainly would not accept them to compliment the Government on it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates suggested that we should have offered the workers similar rights to those offered to the workers in the Sugar Company in 1990.  Let me say that this is exactly what we have done in this agreement and we have offered broadly similar rights as were offered to workers in the Sugar Act, 1990.  The Deputy was quite right to raise the matter and I am pleased to say that is what we have done.  The amendment contained the wording already used in the Sugar Act, 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to reject the suggestion that I do not have the support at this time of the board and management of B &amp; I.  I wish to place on record the absolute and unequivocal commitment by the chairman that the board would co-operate fully with the sale to Irish Continental Group.  The chief executive of B &amp; I also gave a similar explicit commitment on behalf of the management and staff of the company.  I ask Deputies to note that this is the attitude of the chief executive and members of the board and not what <Col N="2114" /> they suggested.  There were difficulties and arguments with the board and I argued vehemently with the board about how to proceed and they quite rightly argued the case with me.  The worker-directors involved quite rightly spoke up about how they saw things and I spoke up on behalf of the taxpayer.  Finally we reached a meeting of minds on the matter, and the board, the chief executive and I broadly accept the direction in which we are proceeding.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that I had been making a &ldquo;sweetheart deal&rdquo; with Irish Ferries.  I regard that suggestion as outrageous. If it was the case, why has the share price of Irish Ferries hardly shifted in the past 12 months?  The fact is that since the sale was first announced the company's shares have remained more or less static &mdash; in other words, the hardnosed market people did not rush to buy the shares when Irish Ferries were offered this jewel and the share price did not move.  This &ldquo;steal&rdquo; did not affect the share price.  It is important that we take careful note of this because that is the market speaking and they were not at all excited by the deal that they landed.  They had a very neutral attitude to it as can be seen from any examination of the share price.</P>
    <P>Deputies have also tried consistently to maintain that I approached only one company.  Again I know that politicians will say these things, because their job is to wave the big flag and hopefully some of the mud they throw will stick.  Irish Ferries were not the only company that were approached.  It was also suggested that I used the MSBO offer as a stalking horse to put the price up.  One cannot have it both ways.  I am being accused of making a sweetheart deal with Irish Ferries so that they could get a few &ldquo;bob&rdquo; out of it and at the same time I am being accused of getting the MSBO to put in a counter bid so that Irish Ferries would have to pay more.  That is totally contradictory, both cannot be true, yet both are coming out of the mouth of the same Deputy at the same time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a horror <Col N="2115" /> of what the financial journalists would have had to say if he had sold the company for £6.5 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are totally contradictory suggestions so both cannot be true.  One states that I am doing a sweetheart deal with Irish Ferries so that they get a few bob and then in the next breath I am told that I used the MSBO as a stalking horse to jack up the price on Irish Ferries.  What does the Deputy mean?  Both statements cannot be correct.</P>
      <P>Although the Deputy probably will not listen, I want to put on the record that Stokes Kennedy Crowley got six reputable firms to examine the purchase very seriously and formally.  Those firms are substantial bidders: the P &amp; O Line, MERSK, Cenargo, Irish Continental Group, the management consortium with Danish backers and the management-staff buy out consortium, again with Danish backers.  I shall not embarrass the House by saying how many of those firms walked away after shutting the books.  It would be unfair to the workers in particular if I were to quote some of the comments made by some of those firms about the company.  One of them offered me £1 for the company, after I would have had taken out the debt.  That is the sweetheart deal that Deputies are talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  The incredibly weak defence put forward by the Minister that somehow or other the rug is pulled from under our arguments when we quote newspaper reports and <Col N="2119" /> then he in turn produces articles written by other journalists that state different things is quite outrageous.  I argue very strongly that Brendan McGrath, the markets editor of <i>The Irish Times</i> has no political axe to grind.  Very clearly he is a man who, as markets editor, understands the world of capital and understands the way in which money can be made and how it can be lost.  In fairness to the journalists about whom we have spoken, we have to remember that they are not cheap, shoddy journalists.  They are professionals in their own field &mdash; and they have expertise in the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important, therefore, to put on the record the position as outlined by this man, whom we have already quoted.</P>
      <P>I am outraged at the scandalous haste with which the Minister is pushing the Bill through the House.  Coming up to Christmas time; we are in an era of massive scandals &mdash; Greencore, Telecom, Carysfort &mdash; and now the Bill to sell the B &amp; I Line is being rushed through.  The Minister has given no adequate explanation as to the need for such waste.</P>
      <P>I suppose there is no harm in my quoting the same Brendan McGrath when suggesting that it is either the Minister or the Department who want to be rid of B &amp; I.  Brendan McGrath writes that the deal is thoroughly bad and seems to be based primarily on a feeling within the Department of Transport that the best option available is to get B &amp; I off the Government's balance sheet, no matter how poor the deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister attempted to suggest that the golden share would affect the saleability of B &amp; I.  That is not the political point we have been making.  Our political argument, going back 12 months, was that the Government took the decision to off-load B &amp; I at apparently any cost. We were not particularly interested in the saleability.  We were arguing that, whatever about the future, about what might become apparent in the full light <Col N="2120" /> of day, if sufficient time had been given to the issue we could debate in the House in a more reasoned way the possible disposal of some of the Minister's share, the possible involvement in a worker/management buy-out, the possibility of a joint venture between management, workers and the Government.</P>
    <P>We do not support the sale of B &amp; I. In fact, we consider now to be the worst time for any Government to consider the sale of the B &amp; I company.  The reason for saying that is, as has been pointed out by professional economic journalists and markets editors, that we are here essentially to defend the rights and the interests of the taxpayer but the Minister is disposing of B &amp; I in a sweetheart arrangement that will give the least return possible to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>We agree with the Minister that until 1987 or 1988 the company were in dire straits; we agree that it was not very successful.  However, after hammering out a five year deal with the unions and the management a remarkable change took place in B &amp; I.  In fact the rate of success surprised many of those who initiated the plan.  In that respect it is important to mention senior officials of the trade union movement and, of course, Mr. Kennedy, chief executive of the B &amp; I, who must be given credit for achieving that remarkable turnaround.</P>
    <P>What is now happening, late in 1991? The Government have decided to clear the £36 million debt which has been the one bugbear or problem which has inhibited the B &amp; I from showing real profits.  Had the Minister wanted to give taxpayers a proper deal or return why did he not do what he intends doing on behalf of a private company?  Why did he not scrub the debt this year, or last year, retaining a golden share, given share ownership to management and workers? The Minister had ample time in which to negotiate such a deal.  We could have had ships vying on the Irish seas, between Ireland and England and the Continent, on the southern and central corridors, with a shipping line showing real profits today and, next year, potentially more, had the Minister only scrubbed the <Col N="2121" /> crucifying debt.  In the Minister's philosophy what is so different between scrubbing it on behalf of a private enterprise and on behalf of taxpayers in order to re-create a shipping company who would trade more profitably in real terms?</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates tabled an amendment seeking the retention of a golden share. While we are opposed to the sale of the B &amp; I <i>per se,</i> particularly at this time, there were alternatives the Minister should have examined, such as a combination of his retention of a golden share with an involvement in share ownership by B &amp; I workers and management. Indeed the happy relationship that would have resulted therefrom would have constituted the ideal solution and a better way forward.</P>
    <P>As I said last week, I cannot for the life of me understand how the Government are being allowed to introduce this Bill which essentially constitutes retrospective legislation.  Perhaps the Minister will have an opportunity to answer that point.  The Minister has arranged the sale of the B &amp; I Line to the Irish Continental Group.  He has arranged deals with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the B &amp; I group of unions. All of those arrangements have been put in place before this Bill has been passed. I cannot understand how the Minister can manage to get away with selling the company, indeed, signing, sealing and delivering these deals on behalf of all the interested groups, without the requisite legislative base.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I contend that the real way to protect taxpayers would be by acceptance of our amendment No. 1.  At present they are getting a rotten deal.  The Minister will have to do much better than merely criticise us for resorting to newspaper reports to back up our case.  The public want to know the facts.  In this economic climate they want to know how it has been so easy for the Government to eliminate a £36 million debt in favour of a private company when they could not have done the same on behalf of the residents of this city who have a share in the B &amp; I Line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have dealt in some detail with most of the points raised yesterday but there are a number of small ones I should like to raise with the Minister. I might add that I will not be waving any papers at him across the Chamber.  I have read and studied the relevant papers, which is normal practice in the case of the sale of a company as important as the B &amp; I.  I have read all the commentaries, have studied them and made my own inquiries.  As the Minister said, contradictory views can be advanced, depending on how one views the matter. Nonetheless the Minister indicated the strategic importance of a shipping line to the country.  I should like to emphasise to the Minister that I too believe it is of strategic importance that we have Government input into such a shipping line, particularly in the current climate, in the context of our movement into Europe, when it will be even more important that the State should control some aspect of it.  I was not a member of the Government when Irish Shipping was sold.  Had I been I would not have agreed to its sale because it was a disastrous decision.  It is my firm belief that we need a shipping line such as Irish Shipping or the B &amp; I Line.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that this proposal was negotiated in the national/taxpayers' interests.  Of course, taxpayers' interest are of strategic importance to such a line, which would have access to Europe in the context of the Single Market and so on.  In that context I hope Structural Funds will be forthcoming to secure that line.  In addition the workers' input into turning it around should be recognised.  The Minister has bandied figures around about profitability and so on which I cannot substantiate or argue against since I am not an accountant but I do know the workers have turned the line around from its earlier lossmaking position and their views should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point the Minister made, and perhaps he was referring to me when he spoke of the trade union movement yesterday.  When I studied the agreement between the Minister, the Irish Congress <Col N="2123" /> of Trade Unions and the B &amp; I group of unions on receiving from the Minister one line stood out.  It was:</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the B &amp; I group of unions acknowledge the view of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communicatins that the acquisition is in the best long term interests of B &amp; I, its employees and customers and also acknowledge his views ...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;acknowledge his views&rdquo; it does no more than that.  Later the same agreement states:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications accepts the legitimate concerns of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in relation to the future development and ownership of the B &amp; I company and the development of Ireland's access transport services. To address these concerns the Minister hereby affirms that the Government ...</P>
    <P>The document went on to detail those Government proposals.  While the Irish Congress of Trade Unions acknowledge the Minister's views on this proposal &mdash; whether they agree with him is another matter &mdash; and while I acknowledge them, I have certain views I should like to put to the Minister.  It is my firm belief that it is in the national interest that the Minister have control of at least 51 per cent of the company which is sought in my amendment No. 7.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to rushed legislation. We have had legislation rushed through the House before and we know what happened.  For example, there was the infamous rod licence Bill passed, I think, in 1987 whose repercussions remain.  We have still not solved that problem &mdash; it will continue into the next year &mdash; because we had not the sense at the time to acknowledge that it was rushed legislation which would have a serious effect on quite a number of people.  The same thing, in a completely different context, could apply to this Bill. The Minister has contended that he <Col N="2124" /> announced it 12 months ago; perhaps he did; perhaps he had discussions and that there were many behind the scenes movements. But this House was not aware of that.  This House was not given an opportunity of discussing the proposal with the Minister or of putting forward Members' views on such an important issue.  Where I must disagree with the Minister &mdash; and I put this loudly and clearly on the record &mdash; is that we have not been given the opportunity of an indepth discussion of the points he raised. The number and contents of amendments should indicate to the Minister our fears in relation to the sale of the B &amp; I Line.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that there has been a restructuring of the company in recent years resulting in an enormous turn-around. Reluctantly I say to the Minister that he may be doing taxpayers a disservice because, four or five years hence, the B &amp; I might have been a very profitable company in the sense that they might have further restructured and streamlined their operations, with the benefit of Structural Funds.  Also the workers could see the result of their input to the restructuring of B &amp; I.  The Minister said that ICG could sell off, as could the MSBO, but in the latter case they would be reluctant to do so because they would have a lifetime of experience in that company. I have been through the experience of redundancy.  In a very short time the message strikes home that the compensation received is very little compared with the amount of work done and the length of service.  People who have a personal stake in a company will be reluctant to sell because they will be left with nothing at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very clever in representing his case as being in the interest of the taxpayers.  It is essential that in ten or 20 years time this nation has a State service which can carry our goods to and from Europe.  The Minister should have held 51 per cent of the shares and we could have had the best of both worlds.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on showing considerable skill at what I <Col N="2125" /> suppose Deputy Rabbitte would call deceit but which I would more charitably term manipulation, distortion and a representation of the facts to suit his own arguments.  The Minister started to play the game when Deputy Byrne had kicked in the ball in relation to newspaper quotations.  The Minister said he could produce quotations to support his side of the story.  To show how skilful he is at distorting, misrepresenting and manipulating his arguments I will refer to the two articles from which he quoted, published on 8 December last in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> and the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> The first article was by Mark O'Connell and the second by a fair commentator, Martin Fitzpatrick.  The Minister omitted to mention the third last paragraph in Mr. Fitzpatrick's article which stated that, &ldquo;Superficially at least, the argument was that the deal is an inexpensive one and ICG is getting a `steal'.&rdquo;  The Minister declined to give his presentation of that.</P>

      <P>After a year of tedious negotiations, Irish Continental Group has succeeded in clinching what is regarded as one of the softest takeover deals in recent times.</P>
      <P>The article goes on to state:</P>
      <P>As management and unions at the B &amp; I protest that their buy-out proposal was not given the consideration it deserved, deeper questions will now be asked about why the Government was in such a hurry to privatise the company in the first place.</P>
      <P>The article continues:</P>
    </Speaker>

What are the terms of the small print in relation to discounts from the £8.5 million?  I understand £8.5 million is a maximum price.  In what circumstances could we read in the newspapers in January or February that the price is actually less?  Are there any other conditions attaching to this deal which the Minister has not yet outlined and which we should know about?  I want the Minister to give details of all liabilities, discounts and any other conditions.</P>
      <P>I have spoken about the Minister's ability to present things in a Carr Communications-type way.  They have a special type of production for these things.  Perhaps that ability extends to this trawl which includes P &amp; O, Cenargo and other companies.  When Cenargo offered £1 for this, what was the arrangement as regards the debt? Nobody would give £1 if the debt were not being written off.  Those offers were made in 1990.  What is now being sold is completely different from what was then on offer.  The Government were not giving solid, cast iron commitments to write off the £36 million.  The Minister is making fish of one and flesh of the other. He refused to publish the original Stokes Kennedy Crowley report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made specific allegations on Second Stage to which the Minister has not alluded.  I stated that there were clear breaches of the Companies Act by the Minister, B &amp; I and their board in relation to sections 127 and 128 and 131 of the Companies Act.  The AGM has not been held, the data has not been submitted to the Companies Registration Office and the annual accounts have not been published on time.  Those allegations were never properly answered and the Minister has failed in his obligations under the <Col N="2128" /> 1963 Companies Act.  The Minister said that a golden share would reduce the price.  The independent value is £20 million and the price is £8.5 million.  The MSBO is history.  If the MSBO were being proposed here, I would still be insisting on the same conditions in relation to resale and the golden share.  We are talking about the common good, not any particular worker or shareholder.  The strategic national interest is involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the share price has not gone through the roof.  Irish Ferries have told me that they have not had access to the 1991 accounts of the B &amp; I Line.  The Minister has an advantage over Members of this House and everyone else in that there has been a very selective revelation of the details of this sale.  As I said Irish Ferries said they have not had access to the 1991 accounts.  All our information on the improvement there has been in 1991 and the subsequent projected further improvement in 1922 is based on B &amp; I sources.  I should like the Minister to give me specific answers to those points.  I am quite happy to have the amendments put to a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party would like to put this amendment to a vote as quickly as possible.  I do not want to go down the road of quoting newspaper articles but I want to return to the theme raised by Deputy Yates which is very important.  The Minister was an expert at communications before some of his colleagues heard about the term. Having had the opportunity to reflect on the matter overnight and say to the array of high calibre civil servants available to him, &ldquo;Dig out effective little ripostes for me so that I can advance them in the House tomorrow; some of them are really getting close to the bone and I will find myself in the same campus as some of my colleagues in Government unless you can get me answers&rdquo;, the Minister came into the House this morning with the kind of answers which do not really answer anything.  He tries to suggest that the Deputies on this side of the House are somehow representing vested interests.  I think he is suggesting that Deputy Gerry <Col N="2129" /> O'Sullivan and Deputy éric Byrne are representing the workers and trade unions and Deputy Ivan Yates is representing the management and board or something like that and that they are exclusive to the interests of the taxpayer. That is the kind of sleight-of-hand which has nothing to do with this argument.  The truth of the matter is that the arguments being advanced by the trade unions and the board and management of the company are in both cases about the lousy deal being got for the taxpayer.  It is the taxpayer who is being cheated because of the unsatisfactory deal.</P>
      <P>I will not quote any newspaper commentators except to say that I am greatly amused at the Minister's theory that a trend has recently developed where Deputies over here talk to journalists, what they say appears in the newspapers and they quote it as independent comment. If the Minister thinks that the journalists in this town talk to Deputies from The Workers' Party and trot out their comments as independent comment he really is living in another world.  He has some expertise in this area himself. Unlike my colleague, Deputy Byrne, I talk to journalists and they tell me how effective the Minister's personal secretary is in this area and how he is rarely off the phone to them when any advance of the Minister's interest is called for. The Minister knows what he is talking about when he talks about this kind of thing.</P>
      <P>I will not rely on any of the journalists who have been referred to.  I would rather quote briefly from a letter dated 9 December signed by Mr. Alex Spain, Chairman of the B &amp; I Line, and which was sent to all the staff.  I should like the Minister and his civil servants to hear this.  He states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event the consultative process has been unsatisfactory.  You will be aware through your representatives on the board that the Minister was advised by the independent Board Committee of the increased value that could be achieved for the Exchequer through options other than immediate sale.  He <Col N="2130" /> was further advised that if he were proceeding to immediate sale that the best price was likely to be achieved by a full process of competing bids.</P>
    <P>The Board is aware that there are precedents for favourable arrangements for the workforce when State-owned companies are privatised. There is merit in such a policy.  The Board Committee indicated to the Minister that any such arrangements with the B &amp; I workforce would be a matter for Government.</P>
    <P>It is evident that there is deep disappointment and anger through the Company at the manner in which matters have been handled.</P>
    <P>What in the name of God is anyone to make of that letter?  I want to emphasise that this letter was not written by some shop steward or trade union official but by the chairman of the company.  I think I know Alex Spain at least as well as the Minister.  He was the man with whom I negotiated the 1987 agreement.  Alex Spain can scarcely be described as holding a trade union point of view but he is outraged at the manner in which matters have been handled.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to accept, having given us a lecture on communications, that you do not get the chairman of a State company writing that kind of letter without there being very serious cause to do so.  In fact, I cannot remember a precedent.  My criticism of chairpersons or chairmen of State companies is that they rarely put their thoughts strongly and clearly to their Minister. One can imagine the kind of anger which gave rise to this letter.  That is the situation but the Minister has not dealt with it.  Mr. Spain criticises the manner in which the sale was handled, the absence of competition in the tendering process and the immediate sale which he says will bring the worst price and says that if they must sell the company immediately they should have proper competing bids.</P>
    <P>The Minister waved a pile of papers at me yesterday which caused me to remember when the former Minister for Justice. Mr. Michéal ó Moráin, whom I used to <Col N="2131" /> read about in &ldquo;Backbencher&rdquo;, put his briefcase on the bench and threatened to open it about certain Deputies in the House.  I do not recall the Minister giving me the answers he told me about or if he did I did not recognise them as answers. There is really no point in the Minister coming in here and lecturing Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan about his comments on the trade union agreement.  Let us put that into perspective.  One of the reasons the agreement did not proceed earlier with ICG is that they would not negotiate with the group of unions.  I know ICG would not do business with them and I met the group of unions at the time. Trade union members now find themselves in the position where not only will there be additional redundancies but their very pension rights are at risk.  Evidence that they are at risk is that the Minister has belatedly brought forward an amendment to cope with that situation. What would the Minister expect any group of workers to do in circumstances where they have been taken over by a company who would not negotiate with them and there is turmoil in the House about the handling of this issue but exploit that to get the best deal they could and protect their pension rights? That is exactly what I would have done in those circumstances.  I would not, as Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan said, have welcomed the Minister's approach to the matter in the opening paragraphs of his statement.  I presume that was the Minister's price in order to give them the pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not, therefore, come in here waving that piece of paper at me as though it were some great breakthrough.  We agreed in far more difficult times in the B &amp; I on measures which were to be taken.  That is no great breakthrough and if the Minister thinks it pulls the rug from under the feet of Deputies on these benches I should say that it does not do anything like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not name me but I <Col N="2132" /> think he accused me of saying that it was a sweetheart deal on the one hand and that it was being used to get ICG off the fence on the other hand.  He has a point there: there is some logical connection missing in that &mdash; I should like to explain that when I said he was using the staff-management buy-out proposals to get ICG off the fence I was quoting Paul Smith, chairman of the group of unions, who made the point that day and who has a substantial argument to advance for it because ICG were a bit backward in coming forward and obviously knew they had their man where they wanted him.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is asking me what my view is on the matter I will tell him my view very briefly in one sentence.  As this issue drifted on through the summer, as the unions were proving Bolshie from ICG's point of view and as the scandals broke around the Head of the Government &mdash; scandals about insider trading, Greencore, Telecom, etc. &mdash; it was imperative that the Minister set up quickly a mock competition lest he be exposed to similar allegations in the House.  I do not believe that Stokes Kennedy Crowley would ever come up with anything, it was Hobson's choice.  It was like Henry Ford saying you could have any car as long as it was black.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to think that he has convinced me by the force of his arguments, and I envisage a situation where this will be the subject of an examination by the Committee of Public Accounts in terms of value for money at some stage in the future.  I would greatly appreciate the managing director, Jim Kennedy, Alex Spain or the worker-director, Dermot Menton, and others appearing before the committee to air their views on what went on and why they were excluded.  There is no point in misrepresenting the position and the Minister saying that he was assured by the managing director, the chairman and the worker directors that they would implement the deal.  What kind of Bolshies does the Minister think they are?  What else would they do?  The Government put this through by a majority vote and I accept it; that is the <Col N="2133" /> way democracy works.  What else would the board do?  Of course they will co-operate but it does not convey the essence of their anger regarding the way it was handled and the bad deal for the taxpayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all repeating ourselves now.  Obviously, I totally reject any suggestion that there was a mock competition.  I have laid before the House on a number of occasions the lengthy, detailed and professional assessment procedure culminating in an assessment by senior officials of the Department of Finance, my Department and Stokes Kennedy Crowley Corporate Finance Limited.  We have been working on this for almost one year and a half and the best deal has been achieved for the taxpayer. Of course every commentator can say that perhaps if we had waited for another year or two something else might have turned up.  I accept the right of anyone to look two years ahead to try to assess what will happen in the market. However, the professional advice I took, the procedure I went through and the detailed analysis of the whole situation indicated that this was the best road to go.</P>
      <P>One of the options was to liquidate the company, which I desperately wanted to avoid.  This is probably the best way to proceed because it gives the workers and the company a future.  The full quotation in the letter from Alex Spain dated 8 October states:</P>
      <P>We agree that given a decision to sell now at the best price available, fair value is whatever is the best price that can be obtained in the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are referring to different letters.  On 8 October 1991 Mr. Spain wrote to me.  After the sentence which I have just quoted he went on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We support the view of the consultants that a true, competitive bidding process between more than one <Col N="2134" /> buyer is likely to produce the best price.  True market value will only be obtained where each bidder has confidence that if his bid is the highest then it is likely to be accepted.</P>
    <P>That is exactly what the Government did, they accepted the highest bid in terms of the chairman's view.  We could argue about different letters but I have quoted from the letter written in October.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan for his comments.  I am also concerned about the strategic situation but I am satisfied that there is enough legislation and clout to ensure that the strategic importance of shipping is recognised.  The agreement which I signed with the trade union movement &mdash; and of which I am proud &mdash; is very solid progress; maybe &ldquo;breakthrough&rdquo; is going too far.  I have acknowledged to them that shipping is of major strategic importance; we have agreed to differ on some points but the fact that we had a certain meeting of minds is important progress.  Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan understands that I was not referring to him when I expressed disappointment at the manner in which the agreement was received by the House.  I would have liked him to have been more enthusiastic but I was not criticising him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates asked me about indemnities and other matters.  There are two major indemnities, one in regard to Ro-Ro, on which I have gone as far as I can and the second is in regard to the <i>m.v. Kilkenny.</i>  It arises from the accident involving the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i> and the <i>Hasselwerder</i> on 21 November 1991 which provides for an indemnity against any net liability to the company after taking into account all related insurance receivables and claims against third parties.  I understand that all appropriate insurances are in place; the indemnity specifically excludes adverse trading implications arising from the particular incident.  The Deputy also asked about the <i>Pembroke.</i> There is no indemnity in respect of that ship.  If the B &amp; I pulled out in that case the new owners would have to bear any costs involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2135" /> Deputy Byrne accused me of introducing retrospective legislation.  This is legislation enabling the Minister for Finance to deal with debt, which is spread throughout the entire system and there are many other examples in this regard. It is not retrospective because any agreement with the purchasers is totally contingent on this House accepting the legislation.  If the legislation is not passed there will not be a deal.  Deputy Rabbitte asked a long series of questions on Second Stage and I have been through most of them, but I will check them again to see if I have responded to them all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the answers which the Minister has given but I specifically asked about discounts.  My understanding is that in the deal negotiated, if the B &amp; I do not achieve certain turnover targets or asset-based targets for 1991, the price will be reduced from £8.5 million to a lower sum.  The Minister did not refer to that.  I also asked whether there were any other conditions attached to the deal regarding which we should be aware but the Minister did not allude to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the extent of the insurance cover on the <i>m.v. Kilkenny?</i>  Did the Minister imply, in the event of the insurance not covering adverse trading, if it transpired that the <i>m.v. Kilkenny,</i> hypothetically speaking, were in the wrong, in these circumstances there would be a claim for adverse trading by the <i>Hasselwerder</i> in relation to their losses?  There is loss of life and cargo involved.  Is there a capping on the insurance question and if so, at what level?  Is there a trading claim?  We do not want to have to move this time next year a Supplementary Estimate for £24 million to cover this vitally important matter, rushing it through with five minutes per speaker.  The Minister did <Col N="2136" /> not respond to the breaches of the Companies Acts regarding which I made three allegations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i> as I have outlined, it is my clear information that all appropriate insurances are in place.  All I can do is pass on that information.  The indemnity specifically excludes any adverse trading implication which arise from the incident, and presumably that is on both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The indemnity specifically excludes any adverse trading implications but obviously it depends on what is in the insurance policy.  Appropriate insurances almost certainly include some aspect of trading.  I will examine that aspect but I am virtually certain that appropriate insurances would include some aspect of loss of profits or whatever type of other insurance would be necessary. Appropriate insurances are in place.  In regard to the Deputy's question about the price and trading, the Deputy is correct in saying that the maximum is £8.5 million.  In very exceptional circumstances that could be reduced by £1 million.  Nobody could envisage a situation arising where there would be such a detrimental fall in profits.  Even if half of what the Deputies have said about next year's profits are true, then there is no question of that happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It ill-behoves the Minister to quote us.  I should like to say for the record that Opposition Deputies have now proved conclusively on the Minister's latest submission to the House, that this House should sanction the final deal because we do not know what way this will go.  I take it the Minister is now giving a commitment that all of these aspects will be covered and I wish to inform him that I for one will be holding him to this commitment.  If there is a change there will be more about it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Where the Minister considers it is necessary for the public interest, he may make an order requiring the Company to maintain any passenger or cargo service which it operates at the date of the coming into effect of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>No one can deny that because of our geographical location, this island depends a great deal on the central corridor. Indeed 41 per cent of our exports are transported via this corridor to Great Britain and the Continent.  It is very important therefore that this amendment be accepted to protect the interests of the State.  In addition to transporting most of our exports via the high seas between Ireland and Great Britain and the Continent, the majority of tourists who visit this country use those sea routes, and the crucial role played by the tourism sector in the economy is another important reason for protecting them.</P>
      <P>We have to consider the question of how we are going to guarantee continuity of service for those manufacturers we invite to this country to establish an industrial base here in exporting the products that they produce to consumers all over the world?  Second, if we cannot guarantee continuity of service how can we hope to build confidence within the tourism industry, especially among those who market Ireland as a tourist location, having regard to the increasing number of tourists coming to this country with their motor cars?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to recognise that key strategic interests are involved.  In a sense, they have been protected to date because of State involvement in the B &amp; I Line. Now that the Government have taken the decision to transfer ownership to the <Col N="2141" /> ICG, a private company whose aim is to make profits in carrying tourists from Great Britain and the Continent to Ireland, the Bill will be fundamentally flawed if the Minister refuses to accept our amendment.</P>
    <P>While the world is relatively peaceful at present, one could pose the question when might it be necessary for the Minister to make an order requiring that our shipping routes or lanes and capacity be maintained to ensure that we continue to trade successfully.  When Great Britain is eventually linked to mainland Europe via the Channel tunnel we will become more and more isolated.  Indeed, we will be identified as the only member of the European Community which is an island nation.  It is important therefore that Irish companies, entrepreneurs, investors and multinational corporations who provide a large number of people with employment be given a guarantee that these links will be maintained.  Having regard to the fact that there will be no golden share, no State interest or involvement, having handed over our shipping interests to private enterprise, we will be extremely vulnerable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recognised that we will be vulnerable and the need to maintain control over these strategic links.  In an article by Lorna Siggins in <i>The Irish Times</i> the Minister is reported as having said that one could sell any company in the country, if one picks up the tab for the debt, that we are getting to a situation where the company, the B &amp; I Line, after a very sick time, are coming back to good health and that it would not be fair to all the people who have brought this about to let some bounty hunter pick up bits and pieces of a strategic business.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, that sums up our view also.  This is a strategic business.  I am not quite sure why the Minister changed his opinion on the strategic nature of shipping since 22 March 1990, but we ought to look at what he described to us as a guarantee in reading into the record his dealings with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the B &amp; I group of unions.  I am arguing that if the Minister does not embody our amendment in the Bill, <Col N="2142" /> which would give him and the State some control over shipping routes, the agreement reached with the ICG, the B &amp; I group of unions and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions will not be worth the paper it is written on.</P>
    <P>In an effort to address the fears of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in particular, the Minister said that he could affirm that the Government fully accepted the importance of these shipping routes.  He went on to say that they were seeking certain guarantees and that the ICG gave an undertaking to him that they would, for example, retain all existing B &amp; I shipping routes, provide extra capacity on the <i>m. v. Leinster,</i> provide long term sustainable employment in the B &amp; I and replace the B &amp; I's container ships.  Even though they are not the key elements we are seeking &mdash; because as they stand they are quite weak &mdash; unless legislative controls are built into the Bill which will give effect to this deal, all those indications from the ICG can be thrown out the window.  There can be no doubt in anybody's mind &mdash; the Minister has changed his mind since 22 March 1990 &mdash; that as an island nation we need to maintain controls over our shipping lines.  I am extremely concerned that this amendment will not be accepted and I take it that all parties on this side of the House are equally concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down an amendment, No. 6b, which was grouped with another amendment and which proposes that in any sale or disposal of strategic shipping services the Minister and the Dáil would have to give their approval.  I will certainly be supporting amendment No. 3 and voting for it.  The Minister made great play of the agreement between his Department and the unions.  That agreement states that ICG have indicated their intention to retain all B &amp; I shipping routes.  I would like the Minister to reaffirm to the House that, if that is so meaningful, so worthy of acknowledgement and so much of a breakthrough, he will be prepared to accept the amendment.  The objective of the amendment is the same as that of the <Col N="2143" /> agreement in that it proposes to retain all existing B &amp; I shipping routes.  We are not saying that new routes should be invented but rather that the existing routes should be retained.  I do not see how the Minister could have a problem with that.</P>
      <P>This is a matter of the utmost concern. In my preparation for this Bill I studied the ICG annual reports.  The chairman's statement from the <i>Annual Report &amp; Accounts 1990</i> of the Irish Continental Group makes interesting reading for anyone who is concerned about the maintenance of routes.  It states:</P>
      <P>As I previously reported in our interim statement, the Belfast-Liverpool Route continued to incur unacceptably heavy losses, despite the efforts of a dedicated management and workforce and consequently the route was closed in October 1990.  The Board of Irish Continental Group, plc regrets that it was not possible to justify the continuation of the route.  There was extraordinary profit, net of taxation, of IR£282,000, arising from the closure of the service and sale of the vessel used on the route, <i>m.v. Saint Colum I.</i></P>
      <P>If Tom Toner and his friends in ICG find they are facing unacceptable heavy losses on the southern corridor, specifically on the Rosslare-Pembroke route, they may, despite the best efforts of the Government, management and the workforce, decide to close down the route.  What can the Minister do to assure us that he will not stand by, as an idle spectator, and observe that happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This runs at the very core of a transport problem in this country in that all shipping matters are essentially matters for the Department of the Marine.  Because Departments other than the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications deal with transport matters, that Department do not understand the full agenda of issues involved in shipping. Irish Continental Group propose to establish three separate units in their operations: a container operation service, a Dublin port handling company <Col N="2144" /> and a passenger unit.  There is no guarantee whatsoever that this fig leaf, as I referred to it yesterday, this so-called agreement which is acceptable in terms of pay and conditions in that it makes some attempt to ensure fair play, similar to the case of Greencore workers, will be of any use in relation to strategic issues. Therefore I put it to the Minister that the current climate is one of extreme difficulty in relation to certain routes.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the southern corridor. At present on the short haul route the principal operator is Stena Sealink.  They have a very fine ship, the <i>m.v. Felicity</i> operating on that route, and the <i>m.v. Hibernia</i> operates the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route.  It is an open secret that Sealink incurred very serious trading losses in 1990 and 1991.  With the commissioning of these very expensive ships my understanding is that their borrowing limit has increased to £300 million, they have incurred a balance sheet loss of £30 million this year and they are proposing to lay off 1,000 workers in the Irish context. In those circumstances is it not obvious that at some time, with Irish Continental Group under pressure &mdash; they are projecting a three year loss as a result of the purchase of the <i>m.v. Munster</i>&mdash; it will be very tempting for them to operate a cartel.  They may decide to operate one ship, the <i>m.v. Felicity</i> and to pool the revenue.  There is already, on paper, in B &amp; I proposals from Stena Sealink to that effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister has professed an interest in competitive arrangements on the Irish Sea and also in capacity.  There is a projection for the year 2001 of about 6 per cent growth per annum in capacity requirements for cargo freight on the Irish Sea.  This is of vital importance if we are to meet our growth targets for the foreseeable future.  This is a live issue and one which the Minister can be fairly accused of washing his hands of.  As Deputy Byrne has said, there is also a vital tourism factor involved here.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has undertaken even a cursory examination of shipping on the Irish Sea will know that there has been a phenomenal increase in traffic on the <Col N="2145" /> Larne-Stranraer route on the northern corridor.  The central corridor is being wiped out because of the more frequent sailings on the northern corridor which is due to the fact that port costs and haulage rates are cheaper in the North.  Traffic travels from Kerry and Cork to the North of Ireland, from Larne to Stranraer and back down to the south of England rather than utilising the southern or central corridors. Ports in the North are 100 per cent aided and therefore port costs are cheaper than in the South, with the result that sailings to and from those ports are more frequent.  Real pressure will be put on ICG, with particular reference to the profitability of the southern route and the maintenance of those services.</P>
    <P>This is not a matter of some internal B &amp; I debate between workers, board members, Alex Spain and management.  It is a matter of strategic national interest.  The export association, CII and industry sources are so busy dealing with day-to-day matters that they do not think of these dangers.  The same argument could be made for European Container Services who provide vital medium haul routes for cargo freight operations from Dublin to Antwerp, Le Havre and Rotterdam. ICG have no commitment beyond the medium term to retain those routes.  I agree that this matter should be determined by a vote at 1.30 p.m.  It is absolutely essential that the Minister reserve powers on issues such as the growth of the Larne-Stranraer route, the unprofitability of the southern route, the likelihood of a cartel between Sealink and B &amp; I, the loss of traffic on the central corridor and the vital strategic interest for tourism, freight capacity and passenger services.  If the company are to be sold the Government should ensure, by order, that there be continuity of shipping services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the time because it is important that this matter be voted on.  The three amendments complement each other and I see no great difference in the motivation behind them.  We must emphasise as <Col N="2146" /> often as possible the strategic importance of the service to this island.  I know the Minister has certain powers in an emergency and he can requisition ships and use them to transport raw materials and so forth for the benefit of the State.  Such a power already exists but I would like to draw attention to a different situation.  As the two previous speakers have already pointed out, there is a tendency for cartels to cut their losses and run.  Speaking as a Member from the &ldquo;deep south&rdquo;, and not the southern corridor&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;below Rosslare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as a Member from the &ldquo;deep south&rdquo;, where the real Taoiseach comes from, we had major problems in regard to the B &amp; I service out of Cork.  I remember distinctly that people felt angry that they had been isolated and left behind when this very good service from Cork ceased.  In addition to the commercial service we had a passenger service which was vital to the southern region, and the Munster region suffered dramatically over a long number of years after this service ceased.  My fear is that something similar could happen again, say, in Rosslare or somewhere else when the balance sheet shows that the operation is no longer profitable.  That is why it is important that the amendments be discussed fully.  To a large extent the people living outside Dublin feel they have been forgotten as far as a ferry service is concerned.  People from the farthest point in Kerry had to travel to Rosslare before the Cork-Swansea route came into operation.  One can therefore understand the difficulties in attracting people to come to this country.  It is important that the Minister should have some element of control whereby he can order that the service should not cease and that this new company are bound by a sacrosanct agreement to provide a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to comment on ICG's investment of £30 million in the company.  The Minister appears to be satisfied that this investment will be forthcoming, but I would like to see this agreement lodged <Col N="2147" /> in the Labour Court so that we could ensure it has some standing.  As we all know, circumstances may change and difficulties may arise.  We have seen changes since the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was negotiated and people have been told they can do nothing about certain changes in the agreement.  Something similar may happen with this agreement and ICG could say they could not invest any more money due to factors outside their control. The points raised in our amendments should be written into the record and we should ensure that provisions are written into an agreement that is lodged in the Labour Court so that the workers are protected.  What we are trying to achieve in our amendments is to flesh out the bones of the agreement negotiated by the Minister and the trade union officials.  I have great confidence that B &amp; I will survive and thrive, but we have no way of controlling the company under new management.  My great fear is that someone along the line might decide to pull the plug if it was felt the company was not sufficiently profitable.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with one other point, the crewing of ships.  I did not see any reference to crewing arrangements in the agreement negotiated by the Minister and the unions, although he had made it a condition that there would be provision for long term sustainable employment in the B &amp; I.  That is a bit vague to my way of thinking.  It is just an aspiration to preserve sustainable employment.  I would like to see commitments and guarantees that the vessels would sail under the Irish flag and even if the vessel had to be chartered, and this is becoming big business, that Irish staff be employed. The labour cost is one incentive for chartering a vessel and I would not like to see our own people sidelined when staff are hired at a cheaper cost to crew chartered vessels.  I do not think that the Opposition Members in this House would like to see B &amp; I going in this direction.  I would like the Minister to consider these very important points which would copper-fasten the agreement he has reached with <Col N="2148" /> the trade union officials.  I hope the Minister accepts the amendments which were tabled in the best interests of both the State and the employees.  We feel that if ICG take over a State-controlled company, then certain obligations follow on that.  This is where I differ completely with the Minister because I think it is very difficult to try to control a company which is operating on a profit making basis and not just providing a social service. I hope the Minister has some answers to these important questions which will allay our fears.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Where the Minister considers it necessary for the public interest, he may make an order requiring the Company to maintain any passenger or cargo service which it operates at the date of the coming into effect of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputy would instruct other companies to maintain airline routes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see, it is an interesting philosophy in any case that the Deputy feels that irrespective of the economics of a particular route that the Government would instruct a company to maintain a route&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in that philosophy, because the Deputy warned <Col N="2149" /> me earlier that things would come back to haunt me, but should the Deputy ever make it over here that particular philosophy of his may come back to haunt him, and no doubt I will be the first to remind him of it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates asked a question about the Companies Act, and I will take the opportunity to answer it now.  There was some suggestion that I caused the company to be in breach of the Companies Act with regard to the publication of their accounts.  That is not the case.  Under the Companies Act an AGM should be held at the earlier of 15 months after the previous AGM &mdash; in the case of B &amp; I this is 25 July 1991 &mdash; or within nine months of the year end &mdash; and this is 30 September 1991.  In relation to the 1990 accounts the company advised the Department on 17 May 1991 that following the due diligence exercise carried out in the company and the general uncertainty, it was decided in consultation with Stokes Kennedy Crowley Corporate Finance and the company's auditors to defer finalisation of the annual report and accounts for 1991 for the time being.</P>
      <P>On 14 October 1991 the company wrote to the Department stating that they were now seeking to finalise the 1990 accounts.  The board subsequently approved the 1990 accounts at their meeting of 15 November 1991.  The report and accounts were presented at the Government meeting of 4 December 1991.  It has now been agreed that the annual general meeting of the company will take place on 31 December 1991.  That is the position with regard to the query about the Companies Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne spoke about a sale to a private company.  I do not want to argue with the Deputy about the definition of a private company, but there are those who would suggest the ICG is a bit more than a private company.  It is 70 per cent Irish owned, substantially by institutions and it is the pension funds of some of those institutions that are invested in ICG.  There are obviously substantial private interests in ICG, but to the extent that there are pension funds invested in <Col N="2150" /> the group it is not completely a private company in the ordinary sense of the definition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>But managers are just as capable of shifting funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  ICG is on the Stock Exchange, it is substantially Irish owned and from what I can determine there are substantial pension funds of Irish workers involved in the company. ICG is not made up just of private profiteers, it has the pension funds of Irish workers &mdash; for example, Irish Life are a shareholder of ICG.  That aspect should be made clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A question was raised about strategic importance and vulnerability. Deputies, we are not going to agree on the matter but I shall put my view on the record.  I maintain that Ireland would be much more vulnerable and much less strategic if it did not have B &amp; I, if B &amp; I went into liquidation.  All of the evidence that was in front of me at this time last year when the matter was considered carefully illustrated that one of the real options to consider was to close down the company.  That option was seriously considered because of the size of the debt involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that Ireland would be much more vulnerable if I had not taken the action that I did. The company would have had a very bleak future, it could have gone down the same road as Irish Shipping and then we would not have it at all.  At least we now have the company and it has some future.  The future of the company is now entirely bound up with Irish Sea routes, and I have to say that the position may have been different with the proposal incorporating Danish investors.  Irish Ferries and B &amp; I together depend entirely for their sustainability on servicing Ireland, not other countries.  Their future is inextricably bound up with the future of the country itself, therefore they cannot simply walk away from any route unless there are major economic difficulties with that route.</P>
      <P>I repeat that I take the agreement with the unions very seriously.  The Government, my Department and I intend to do everything possible to live up to every word of the agreement.  I pointed out that ICG have indicated to me their intention to maintain the company in Irish ownership and have confirmed that their plans for B &amp; I over the next five years include the retention of all existing B &amp; I shipping routes; the provision of extra capacity on the <i>mv Leinster;</i> the sourcing of an improved vessel to replace the <i>mv Munster</i> on the Rosslare-Pembroke route; an upgrading of facilities throughout B &amp; I; the replacement of B &amp; I's container ships; the provision of long term sustainable employment; shared ownership for B &amp; I employees.</P>

      <P>I differ from the Deputy on this issue and we cannot bridge the gap.  I do not believe that public or private companies can be ordered around in regard to economic services.  In times of emergency Governments do have the power to do so but I do not believe the philosophy professed by the Deputy, and I do not believe that he believes it seriously.  It certainly is not consistent with other approaches taken by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>When the Deputy asks questions of me at Question Time he seems to take a different approach to the idea of ordering companies to do uneconomic tasks.  I am very interested in the Deputy's approach that the Government would simply include in the Bill a section to have a company carry out a specific service, irrespective of whether or not that was economic.</P>
      <P>On that score, and there are many precedents in this regard, if the Government want to keep a route open and help their service they do not have to own the company.  Deputy Peter Barry in his excellent contribution yesterday gave an example when he pointed out &mdash; and Deputy O'Sullivan will know of this &mdash; that the Government have loaned money to the Cork-Swansea Ferry Company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <P>Incidentally, a consultant's report that came to me early last year suggested in no uncertain terms that I should not approve a loan to the Cork-Swansea Ferry Company.  In trenchant terms the report indicated that I should not approve the loan.  Nevertheless, I <Col N="2153" /> decided to suggest to the Government that we would do that, and the Government agreed.  It seemed to me that there was so much determination to make the service work that it had a real chance. The Government took that chance, we made the loan available and they have paid back the loan.  I take this opportunity to publicly thank everybody associated with the Cork-Swansea Ferry Company for making the service a success against the head and against the advice of consultants.  The point I want to make is that the Government do not own the Cork-Swansea Ferry Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government take consultants on their merits &mdash; unlike Deputy Byrne, who just does not like them at all.  I want to point out that the Government do not own the Cork-Swansea Ferry Company.  The Government have been able to assist the company strategically with funding at a critical time, based on the company's submissions, and the company have proved their worth, paid off the loan and I salute them.</P>
      <P>Another example which comes to mind is that of a ferry serving the Aran Islands, which Deputies know about, which is funded by the State.  I think that this year it was funded to the tune of approximately £500,000.  The Government do not own the ferry company, it is run by private interests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The service receives a fixed sum, it is tendered for regularly and in that way there is competition. The State gets the best value because the service is tendered for, there is no open cheque book.  The Government do not own that company but the service works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject the notion that to keep strategic control the Government have to own the shipping company, they do not.  The Government can assist it and support it <Col N="2154" /> in all kinds of ways but they do not have to own it.  That is my response to the query about strategic importance.  I believe in keeing the company going and in giving it a real future rather than just sitting back and letting it slide.  That is the best way to be less vulnerable.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asked about times of emergency.  My understanding is that there were substantial reserve powers in times of emergency, and that seems to be the Deputy's understanding also.  I am reasonably satisfied about that aspect. Deputy Rabbitte asked me many questions and I am always very careful not to be seen to run away from any questions he puts to me.  Yesterday he put 16 questions to me.  I have answered all except six of those questions, which questions are by and large to do with this amendment.</P>
    <P>I did not answer Question No. 3, in which Deputy Rabbitte asked me why I prevented the annual general meeting from taking place.  My response is that that is not true.  I am aware that there were delays in finalising the accounts, as I explained, because of uncertainty within the company, but given that the accounts were qualified by the auditors it may have been appropriate to delay finalising the accounts until the company's future was settled.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked me why my office sought to stop the issue of a letter from the chairman of the company on 9 December to all staff.  My response is that that is not the position. My office received a copy of that letter after it had been issued.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte's Question No. 12 read:</P>
      <P>Why did he not correct the record of this House of 3 December, at column 1953, when the Taoiseach told me that the Bill would not be taken in this session when he, the Minister, knew it was already with the printer and would be published the next morning?</P>
      <P>I am not accusing the Deputy of doing it deliberately but he did wave the Official Report.  It would have been fairer to quote what the Taoiseach said in response to him, which was as follows:</P>
      <P>Mr. Rabbitte: May I ask the Taoiseach when he proposes to introduce a Bill to deal with the sale of the B &amp; I? I take it that this question is in order?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach: I do not think it will be taken this session.</P>
      <P>That was the Taoiseach's response which the Deputy did not quote in the House. Rather, he accused the Taoiseach of misleading the House, although he did not actually say that.  I quote again from the same column of the Official Report of 3 December 1991, column 1953, and repeat the Taoiseach's response, which was as follows:</P>
      <P>I do not think it will be taken this session.</P>

      <P>Question No. 14 deals with pensions, with which I will deal in a moment.</P>
      <P>Question No. 15 read:</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has referred to the board's concern that there is adequate protection against unacceptable union practices being reintroduced into the B &amp; I under new owners.</P>
      <P>This has been raised consistently with me by the chairman of the B &amp; I.  The allegation has been refuted by the Irish Continental Group, who have undertaken to fully examine any specific allegtions or suggestions made.  So far no evidence has been produced to my Department by the B &amp; I.  Again, I would invite such evidence of allegations, when they will be acted on as quickly as possible wherever resources are available to me.</P>
      <P>That is my response to all except the question of pensions, Question No. 14, which the Deputy raised with me.  In that regard I should say that I wrote to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 1 November 1991.  I might quote what I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2157" /> I wish to assure you that the Government will not accept that any sale transaction be conditional on the company liquidating the assets of B &amp; I pension schemes for any amount.  In my view the control and management of pension funds are the responsibility of the trustees of such funds.</P>
    <P>I want to say that the sale of the B &amp; I to ICG is absolutely fully consistent with that commitment.</P>
    <P>Those were the 15 questions to which I have responded.  Obviously, the Deputy will be critical of some aspects of my response but I have responded as best as I could.</P>
    <P>I was asked a question by Deputy Yates about the southern corridor.  I want to tell him that the managment and board of the B &amp; I &mdash; this is important information for the Deputy &mdash; wished to cease service on this route and do a deal with Sealink in the matter.  It is important that the Deputy understands that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  They added that Irish Continental Ferries have offered to continue this service.  While I cannot absolutely hold them to that suggestion, the management/staff buy-out indicated that they would seek a joint venture with Sealink on the matter.  It is important to point that out to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne appeared very critical of the ICG role in making money, contending that they wished to make money. I do not have a problem with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wonder why, when the Deputy talks about the profits of the B &amp; I, he contends that is terrific, it is great.  But when he refers to profits being made by the Irish Continental Group, with substantial pension fund investment, he contends it is not so good, that it is a ripoff.</P>

      <P>Grand, that is all I wanted to get from the Deputy.  It does not matter who owns a company, it needs to make money.  Taxation policy can deal with surpluses and the like.  But the notion that if a company is private it should not make money and, if public, it should is patently silly.</P>
      <P>I think I have dealt with virtually all of the matters raised.  I want to repeat that I place great credence in our understanding with the trade union movement and with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I do not treat it lightly.  I am aware, and freely admit, that some of it is aspirational.  It is aspirational because I cannot control what will take place in the shipping markets of the world.  Therefore, some of it is aspirational; but it is a firm declaration of my intension and that of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and of the B &amp; I group of unions to make it work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne mentioned the chief executive of the B &amp; I, Mr. Jim Kennedy, on one or two occasions.  I should like to join Deputy Byrne in expressing my thanks to him for his excellent work and leadership.  Certainly, the B &amp; I Line were very fortunate to have had a man of his calibre.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; but I am indicating our intention to put it to a vote.  I want to indicate our disappointment that the Minister has not really addressed the key point of the amendment at all.  There really is no arguing with the Minister, who says that strategically we are a great deal less vulnerable now than had we liquidated the company.  There is no answer to that kind of logic.  The Minister is inescapably correct &mdash; if we liquidated the company we would indeed be more vulnerable.  But I did not hear anybody argue for the liquidation of the company. Therefore it is a non-argument; that was never the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also wrong of the Minister to take up Deputy Yates on his seeking to have enshrined in legislation the capacity to order a private company to do this or that &mdash; in this instance to retain a route the Minister would consider strategically important to the country's trading and other interests.  This is an exceptional measure.  We are not suggesting it is something that would be lightly used. The strategic arguments have been outlined by other Members, who have spoken in terms of this country's dependence on trade in particular, but there is <Col N="2160" /> also a tourism and passenger dimension to it.  The amendment says: &ldquo;Where the Minister considers it is necessary for the public interest ... &rdquo; The Minister of the day will make a judgment on that, whether the termination of a particular route is as important to the country's vital interests that in those circumstances he should intervene.  I cannot see how the Minister can accuse Deputy Yates of applying that as a general policy approach to any private company.  As I understand it, that is not what is being said at all.  Of course, what it extracted from the Minister in terms of what is his philosophy is very illuminating.  Not only are we going to sell this company for a song, but if they should come under pressure on any given route what will we do?  We will give them a subsidy.  That is what the Minister said.</P>

That is the pat on the head for Deputy Peter Barry for defending his corner and so on.  That is what it means.  This has emanated from this private marketeer who seeks to attack Deputy Byrne for suggesting something he did not suggest, which was that private companies should not make a profit.  He never said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens if, as Deputy Yates says, we have a recurrence of the Belfast/Liverpool termination, for example, purely for the commercial interests of the company?  Suppose that conflicts directly with our strategic interests as a trading nation?  Then it appears to me that, in circumstances in which the Minister has refused to even contemplate the suggestion of the golden share or any other mechanism to dictate the national interest, it would appear to <Col N="2161" /> me that this amendment is not only reasonable but necessary.  For the Minister to discuss an amendment designed to meet exceptional circumstances, having regard to the extent to which we depend on sea routes for our wealth as a trading nation, would appear to me to dismiss it out of hand altogether too easily.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 25, 32 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my reply to Question No. 35 on 14 November 1991 &mdash; columns 1734 to 1735 of the Official Report &mdash; dealing, with the two official inquiries under the Companies Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspector appointed by me under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990, furnished his final report to me on 4 December 1991.  I published the report on 5 December 1991.  The inspector concluded that, in his opinion, Mr. C. Comerford is the beneficial owner of Talmino Ltd. and, accordingly, of the loan note for the sum of IR£2,104,900 issued by Siúicre éireann cpt in favour of Talmino Ltd. on 22 March, 1990.  In the statement I made when publishing the report, I indicated that the restrictions I imposed on the loan note on 22 October 1991, under section 16 of the 1990 Act, remain in place.  The final report also indicates that sections of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, may have been breached. I therefore referred the report to <Col N="2163" /> the Director of Public Prosecutions on 5 December for his consideration as to further action.</P>
    <P>As regards the inquiry by the two inspectors appointed by the High Court under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, the court decided on Friday, 13 December 1991 to allow an extension of time until 11 February 1992 for the completion of a final report, notwithstanding concerns expressed by counsel on my behalf about the length of time being taken and the cost.  The court accepted the inspectors' contention that their investigations were at a critical stage and that adequate time should be allowed to ensure their proper completion.  The court has already ordered that the two interim reports produced earlier to the court are confidential and should not be published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned about the ongoing delays?  Does he intend to appeal the decision of Friday, 13 December?  Does he think the issue will be affected by the report on the Dermot Desmond application regarding the reply of 12 December which the Central Bank apparently issued?  It is alleged that information from the Central Bank was obtained by the Minister or his servants or agents illegally.  Would the Minister care to comment?</P>

I am not clear whether an appeal would lie on a matter like that.  I would have to take advice as to whether it would lie and whether there would be any prospect of success.  With regard to the other matter mentioned by the Deputy, that arises out of the Telecom investigation. All these questions relate to Greencore. An entirely separate question arises there and I do not know whether I should deal with it under these questions.</P>

Of the three inquiries under different sections of the Companies Acts, one has been completed since the beginning of this month and the report has been published.  Two interim reports have been received &mdash; but I am not allowed to publish them &mdash; in respect of another of the inquiries.  I believe the third inquiry would have been completed by now but for the litigation. Certainly I have learned a lot from these inquiries and from the procedures concerned. I would not propose to use the powers under section 8 again unless I really had to.  Section 14 and some of the other sections will probably be preferable <Col N="2165" /> in the future, except for very wideranging cases.</P>

Whereas all of us in this House accept that too much of the Minister's energy is taken up in trying to keep the Government on the not-so-straight-and-narrow, would the Minister not agree that primary responsibility for the unemployment problem rests with him as Minister for Industry and Commerce and that it is imperative that some proposals for revision and change in our industrial strategy are brought before the House as quickly as possible?</P>

The chairman, to whom I spoke about the matter yesterday, has told me that they will complete their report at the end of the year and that it should be handed to me during the first week in January.  I propose to publish the report very shortly after that.  I hope the report will help to initiate a national debate on many of these matters.  I have not yet seen the report but I believe it will be quite radical in its approach to many of the serious problems.  I hope it will stimulate a useful and constuctive debate and that in the course of 1992 we will see many of its recommendations implemented.</P>

Would the Minister not agree that we have had a great deal of debate over the past ten years, that there is general consensus that we are getting very bad value for the huge sum spent on industrial policy and that there is an urgency for us to bring specific recommendations for change before the House as distinct from waiting for the outcome of more debate?

      <P>I cannot of course reply to the last part of the Deputy's question until I see the report but I would be <Col N="2167" /> surprised if several of the recommendations did not require legislative change.  It is likely that many of the recommendations will require legislative change of a kind that cannot be promoted just by me as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I imagine it will also suggest extensive legislative changes that will have to be promoted by other Ministers. I hope to have the report discussed by the Government as a whole as quickly as possible in order that a collective view can be formed on it, because I have no doubt from the terms of reference I gave to the review group that they will be dealing with matters that are outside the scope of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The completion of the Single European Market presents small and medium sized enterprises with significant opportunities and challenges. The Government's Programme for Industrial Development 1989-93, which is supported by EC regional funds and which was placed in the Oireachtas Library on 23 January 1990 contains a number of sub-programmes specifically directed to develop small and medium sized industry. These include: the sub-programme for the development of Irish-owned small business, operated by the IDA, Shannon Development and the Irish Productivity Centre; the sub-programme for the development of medium-sized Irish-owned industry, also operated by the IDA and Shannon Development; the <Col N="2168" /> sub-programme for marketing development which is now operated by An Bord Tráchtála; and aspects of the sub-programme for science and technology and human resources development.</P>
      <P>In relation to the marketing development sub-programme, one of the key objectives of An Bord Tráchtála is to accelerate the growth and integration of Irish business in the Single European Market.  Since 1989 the Exchequer's funding of ABT has increased by 44 per cent, despite the budgetary constraints on the Government.  This additional funding has enabled ABT to initiate new marketing measures which have been designed to meet the specific needs of Irish SMEs facing the challenge of the Single European Market.</P>
      <P>The services of the major State agencies reporting to my Department are already regionalised through the network of one-stop-shops, which offer the combined services of the IDA, An Bord Tráchtála and Eolas.  I am, therefore, satisfied that there is adequate regional coverage in terms of the sort of advice referred to by the Deputy and that the appointment of a further special team of regional advisers would unnecessarily duplicate services already in existence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Small and medium sized businesses in Ireland will be the engine used to reduce our high level of unemployment in the future particularly in the Single European Market.  Many Irish-owned and Irish-located companies do not have the necessary marketing skills to enable them to take advantage of the huge potential market in the European Community post-1992.  The Minister referred to the network of one-stop-shops.  Instead of waiting for people to come to the doors of these shops the Minister should send <Col N="2169" /> out what would in effect be an army of commercial travellers to seek out industries which need help in marketing or setting up partnerships or joint ventures with similar companies in Europe so that they can take advantage of the potential market available in Europe after 1 January 1993.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy suggests is largely in place and is being done. An Bord Tráchtála are approaching a great many companies which they believe have the potential to build up significant export markets and encouraging them to do so.  As the Deputy knows, they have a number of regional offices which are available to people who are interested. Between February and May of this year my Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, hosted a series of seven seminars in different parts of the country to try to preach this message to small and medium-sized Irish-owned companies in particular.  They are constantly under pressure and encouragement to avail of the services which are now in place to assist them.  Companies which are seen to have special possibilities of increasing their export sales are intensively canvassed to that effect and pressure kept on them to encourge them to build up in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 13, 19, 21 and 29 together.  At the outset, I should like to say that I welcome the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement.  We in Europe, through the establishment of the European Economic Community itself and now through the greater European Economic area involving our neighbouring EFTA countries, have first-hand experience of the political and economic benefits which flow from such arrangements. Such benefits often accrue, not only to the participants themselves but also to third countries who can take advantage of the increased prosperity of the region. By the same token, I welcome the current negotiations between the US and Mexico to conclude a similar agreement.</P>
      <P>That said, there are some grounds for reservations about the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement.  The GATT Working Party established to examine the Free Trade Agreement took the view that the agreement may not be fully consistent with the provisions of GATT.  For example, while third country exporters, as a whole, may benefit in a general way from increased wealth in the region, particular companies could lose market share, because under the terms of the agreement US and Canadian exporters will now have preferential access to each others markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another concern was that the agreement might, in some respects, be overtaken by the Uruguay Round results and in recognition of this both the US and Canada have undertaken to review it <Col N="2172" /> after the Uruguay Round negotiations have been concluded.</P>
    <P>Additionally, the GATT Working Party propose to review the agreement periodically, the first such review to take place in 1993.</P>
    <P>As a contracting party to GATT, Ireland will continue to support all steps to see the conclusions of the working party followed through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

As far as I am aware, my Department have not received representations from individual companies in regard to this. Nonetheless, we have some concerns in regard to the terms of the agreement. For that reason, in conjunction with our Community partners, we have been urging the Commission in particular to draw the attention of the GATT headquarters to the agreement and to monitor it carefully.</P>

      <P>As well as merging NADCORP with the IDA we have also abolished Fóir Teoranta.  Whereas the Minister's list would indicate an increasing pattern of the IDA taking equities in these companies, will he indicate whether there is any other discernible pattern? Are these companies regarded as having considerable potential, did the companies in trouble need an equity injection and was this the only way they could get it?  Has any analysis been done of the companies which benefited apart from saying that 52 companies benefited in 1991 and so on?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the IDA did a study from which they concluded the company would benefit from an equity investment.  By &ldquo;equity&rdquo; in this context I mean not just ordinary shares, I am also including preference shares because quite a proportion is in respect of redeemable preference shares at a fixed coupon.  As well as benefiting the company, the policy which the IDA have been pursuing in recent years is a result of a general policy decision made by me that there should be a greater element of repayability in the support given to industry, particularly to Irish industry, so that the State can benefit from successes. The State loses very heavily on the failures &mdash; there is nothing we can do about that &mdash; but it should not lose on its direct assistance to the successes because some of them are, happily, extremely successful and it is no great strain on them to repay part of the assistance which has been given to them.  The aim is that at the end of a three year period from earlier this year 50 per cent of the assistance given to medium sized Irish companies should be in a form which would be remunerating and ultimately repayable. I believe that the IDA will achieve that objective but it will have to be phased in over a three year period because it would be too much of a jolt to try to do it all at once.</P>

      <P>May I repeat the question? In view of the upward trend in the number of companies in which the IDA have taken an equity in the past number of years have they followed that policy by the appointment of members to the board of those companies?  If it is Government or IDA policy can the Minister further state whether there could be a clash of interest at some later stage by virtue of competing products on the market or have the appointments to the boards been from members of the staff of the IDA or are they from outside?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information readily at hand.  When replying I will have to speculate to some extent and rely on my general experience rather than on specific figures which I can give to the Deputy by letter if he requires them.  In the great majority of cases the IDA would not seek to appoint somebody to the board, in some cases they do.  They <Col N="2176" /> would not normally be staff members but they would be people known to the IDA for their experience and their expertise whom the IDA would ask to go on the board to represent them and to convey the IDA's views on the company and how it should be run and to report back to the IDA if problems were perceived to be arising.</P>

      <P>Obviously, it would normally be a minority interest.  I imagine they would rarely go above 25 per cent and usually it would be as low as 5 per cent or 10 per cent.  There is power in the Industrial Development Act, 1991, which passed both Houses last night, to hold more than 50 per cent in preference shares.  Up to now the limit on preference shareholdings was 50 per cent.  Because of the merger with NADCORP it was thought desirable to increase the legal right to hold preference shares to above 50 per cent but that does not apply to ordinary shares.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that it is well known that a minority equity interest in the company provides very little protection to the investor, has consideration not been given to a more secure form of public money investment by means of securing the debt by debenture charge or something of that nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The shareholdings are entered into on the basis of shareholder agreements in each case which give protection. It is well known that a minority shareholder in a private company has only limited protection but he does have <Col N="2177" /> much more extensive protection now under the terms of the Companies Act, 1990, than he did previously and if he holds 25 per cent or more he can block a special resolution.  I do not think the Deputy should be unduly concerned in these circumstances.  I am sure he will realise if the IDA were to seek to exercise very stringent control over the company, the company would not welcome such IDA investment.  The promoters of the company and the owners of the majority equity would want to be free to run the company within reason as they see fit and in their best commercial interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This year, up to 1 October 1991, when price control was ceased contemporaneously with the commencement of the Competition Act, 1991, the maximum permitted retail price of premium and unleaded petrol reduced by 2p per litre.</P>
      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a list of the individual changes permitted during that period.  Since the ceasing of price control, I do not have official information on the price of petrol.</P>
      <P>Any comment on petrol price changes in 1992 would be highly speculative because of possible changes in oil prices and in the value of the dollar.  I have, however, already referred on a number of occasions to my expectation that the full benefits of competition should work through over time to the benefit of consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs launched a large scale survey, <i>inter alia,</i> into the retail prices being charged for petrol and diesel in filling stations.  The survey commenced on 25 November 1991 and concluded on 6 December.  It will take some time to collate the results of the exercise but when that is done the results will be made available to my Department.  Approximately 1,300 stations were surveyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to how the market place is operating, since I removed price control on petrol I was happy to see the headline in the <i>Evening Press</i> of 10 December &mdash;&ldquo;Petrol plummets by 5p a <Col N="2180" /> gallon.  Motorists have something to smile about as oil majors slug it out at the forecourts.  Ending of Government statutory price controls spurs hot competition at the pumps&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the petrol companies slugging it out at the forecourts, they are not slugging it out in the four provinces of Ireland but in the capital city of Dublin.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that the benefits of competition will work its way through in rural Ireland.  I have no doubt that that will happen in Dublin.  The Minister would want to be careful with regard to rural Ireland where motoring is far more essential and where public transport is not available.  Those people should also get the benefit of the slugging out between petrol companies and the Minister should ensure that they are not asked to pay the cost to the petrol companies of their boxing match in Dublin.</P>

I do not have any desire to see a situation in which there would be competition in the cities but where prices might rise to an unjustifiable extent in rural Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 38, 72, 73, 76 and 77 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies should be well aware as to the reasons for the level of insurance costs, including motor and liability insurance, in this country as this subject has been discussed on numerous occasions in this House.  The House has already been informed of how insurance costs in Ireland compare with those in <Col N="2182" /> other EC countries.  Data on EFTA and the United States is not readily available, nor indeed is data on the average cost per employee of public liability insurance.  I would particularly refer the Deputies to the contributions which the Minister for the Environment and I made to a debate on motor insurance in this House on 2 and 3 July, 1991.  In the course of these contributions details of a comprehensive list of measures to improve the environment for motor insurance, including insurance for young drivers, identified by the Inter Ministerial Group on Motor Insurance, and subsequently endorsed by Government, were given.</P>
    <P>While the group's work was primarily concerned with motor insurance costs, those of its recommendations which are designed to impact on the cost of personal injury compensation, particularly the legal costs associated with such compensation, will, it is hoped, have a positive impact on the cost of settling all personal injury claims including those claims covered by employers' and public liability insurance.</P>
    <P>The measures announced but not yet implemented, including the introduction of the necessary legislation by the Ministers for Environment and Justice, are being given priority attention.  The Deputies will appreciate that questions about road traffic legislation in relation to the courts are properly addressed to the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Justice.  The Department of Finance are considering the taxation aspects of personal injury compensation by means of structured settlements as opposed to lump sum payments.</P>
    <P>Unless and until the claims experience, including the claims frequency and levels of compensation paid to victims of accidents in Ireland, matches that obtaining in other countries there will be divergences between motor and liability insurance premia in Ireland and those applying in other countries.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform Deputy Sherlock that the question of restricting young drivers to driving between certain hours has already been considered by the Inter Ministerial Group on Motor Insurance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2183" /> The group concluded that the introduction of such a system would be neither feasible nor practical.  In any case third party insurance is the only form of insurance required under the Road Traffic Acts and any question of change or reform thereof is a matter primarily for the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Where difficulties are experienced in obtaining liability insurance, whether public or employers liability, an arrangement exists with the Irish Insurance Federation.  Before any case can be referred to the federation it is necessary that at least half the market &mdash; approximately 12 companies, including Lloyds &mdash; be approached by the insurance proposer without success.  Evidence of these approaches &mdash; for example, a letter from a broker &mdash; together with a brief synopsis of the risk should be forwarded directly to the Irish Insurance Federation, Russell House, Russell Court, Stephen's Green, Dublin 2.  It must be emphasised that, while this arrangement is reasonably successful, no guarantee can be given that cover will be forthcoming in each individual case.</P>
    <P>However, as the insurance supervisory authority I have a responsibility to ensure that insurance companies meet their statutory solvency and reserve requirements. Therefore, I must respect the right of insurance companies to make their own underwriting decisions, including the setting of insurance premia, in the light of their circumstances and assessment of the market.  No legal obligation can be placed on any insurer to quote in respect of any risk or to quote at any particular premium or to quote in any particular manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be discourteous to the Minister in the holy season of Christmas but would he not accept that, despite all his announced good intentions and those of his colleagues in this matter and the public fear that has been expressed over a number of years, remarkably little has happened to alleviate the burden on those seeking motor insurance and on people in certain <Col N="2184" /> categories seeking public liability insurance?  Will the Minister not accept that in some counties there are people in certain occupations who cannot meet public liability costs at all and who are either going out of business or are working without insurance, which is intolerable? Will the Minister indicate perhaps some measures which would shock the insurance companies and those who may be abusing the system, and thus contributing to the problems, to such an extent that some reason will prevail in 1992?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that nothing has happened.  A great deal has been done and the insurance companies are among the first to recognise that.  I have frequent consultation and discussion with them about this matter.  The rate of increase in premium has dropped off very considerably compared to what it was a year ago.  Earlier this year I asked companies, given all that the Government had done and had in train, to seek to avoid increases.  Companies acknowledged that steps already taken are beginning to work.  The frequency of accidents has dropped significantly.  The Minister for Justice gave figures in the House recently.  Also, the claims problems are improving slightly &mdash; of course, they are improving from an intolerable level by comparison with other countries.</P>
      <P>Some legislation has already been passed but I hope further legislation will be before the House early in the next session which will be very helpful in this task.  There is to be a major Bill on courts and court officers from the Minister for Justice and there is to be a major Road Traffic Bill from the Minister for the Environment.  The nature of this legislation has already been announced by the respective Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the improved trend we have seen in the last six months will carry through into 1992 and be maintained throughout that year.  Indeed, from my reading of the newspapers it would appear, for example, that the intensive enforcement of the Road Traffic Act, <Col N="2185" /> particularly the drunken driving regulations by the Garda this month, has been very successful in as much as the Garda are out in large numbers but are in fact catching very few offenders as the public at last are beginning to realise their obligations and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I hope in the course of 1992 that the widespread practice of making fraudulent claims for personal injuries in the courts will diminish.  It is now accepted I think that what I have been saying in this regard for the past three years is correct. I hope the exposure of some of these fraudulent claims of late will lead to a considerable diminution.  One individual, under one name or another, has made as many as 11 different claims for personal injuries within a three year period. People seem to make their living out of making these claims which is a great pity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall, before the abolition of juries, the indications from the insurance industry that if juries were abolished insurance premiums would come down?  Does he not find it regrettable that they have not complied in this regard?  Second, has he or the Department looked at the claims departments of insurance companies to see if they are dealing with claims in an efficient manner?  I put it to him that if he does so he may find that many of them are seriously and grossly inefficient and needlessly waste expenditure in prolonging the settlement of claims within a reasonable period thereby escalating their costs and giving themselves the excuse to keep their premiums at a level well above comparable levels abroad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question on the Courts Act and the abolition of juries, I was not in Government at the time but I fully supported that Act. I had an expectation that awards would drop to a more reasonable level, akin to other countries, instead of being the highest in the world &mdash; it appears that it is certainly the highest in Europe.  That did not happen.  The then Government, as well as many others and I were wrong in believing that it would.  This is a great <Col N="2186" /> pity but there is nothing we can do about it.  So far as the efficiency of insurance companies is concerned, there is a lot of truth in what Deputy Taylor has said.  It is my experience that claims departments of insurance companies frequently are anything but efficient.  They are frequently the authors of their own misfortunes. A solicitor who appeared for a plaintiff in a personal injuries case within the past few weeks told me that his client was in the High Court for four days in respect of a claim where there were three defendants who were represented by three insurance companies but because the companies could not agree between themselves, even though they were not denying collectively liability to the plaintiff, the case went on for four full days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That case is going to be very costly for the insurance companies concerned but it is abviously a matter which should have been settled between them and then between them and the plaintiff without going into court because the question of liability did not seriously arise.  This is repeated regularly.  If companies were more efficient and anxious to settle at an early stage the costs would be much lower.</P>

In a sense, I hesitate to ask it having regard to the sensitive position in which the Minister finds himself <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Judiciary at this moment but would he not consider that his suggestions of excessive compensation awards are not well taken and cast a reflection on the Judiciary, under the control of the Supreme Court, who set these standards; that each case is considered on its merits; <Col N="2187" /> that the Judiciary are well experienced in assessing awards and compensation under various categories and that the levels of compensation given are in accordance with the law and fair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be but I am not criticising it from that point of view. I am simply stating it as a fact that the levels of compensation paid for personal injuries are very much higher than in most other countries.  I do not go beyond that.  Obviously the Judiciary feel that that is the way they want it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>I led a business mission to South Africa from 24-30 November 1991.  The purpose of the visit was to promote the development of trade and investment links between Ireland and South Africa.  The mission included representatives from a number of semi-State bodies and private companies.  During the mission, I accompanied a number of the participants in their meetings with private sector companies.  I also met with IDA and ABT target companies and organisations.</P>
      <P>I discussed ways of increasing and expanding bilateral economic relations and exchanged views on general trade issues such as the European Community Internal Market and GATT with Dr. Marais, the Minister for Trade and Industry and with his Deputy Minister, Mr. Graaff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I had meetings with the State President, Mr. F.W. De Klerk, as well as the Foreign Minister, Mr. R. F. Botha.  The President briefed me on the current economic and political situation in South Africa and in particular on the start of the multi-party talks, which had begun before I left.  I was able to brief <Col N="2189" /> the President on the objectives of my mission.  Trade and investment possibilities between our two countries were raised as well as significant European Community developments.  We noted that the Community was taking steps to remove all trade related restrictions on South Africa and I informed him that Ireland had removed the ban on the import of fruit and vegetables from South Africa.</P>
    <P>I was also very pleased to have had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Walter Sisulu, Deputy President of the African National Congress, as well as representatives of the Inkatha Freedom Party.  This gave me the opportunity to hear the fullest range of views on the political and economic prospects for South Africa.  In my talks with the leaders of the black community, I offered training in Ireland in Government administration for six graduates.</P>
    <P>As part of my schedule, I also had the opportunity of seeing the conditions in the townships of Mamalodi near Pretoria and Soweto near Johannesburg.  In Soweto, I visited a convent and school run by the Irish Mercy Sisters and saw the very great contribution they are making there in difficult conditions.</P>
    <P>The visit to South Africa enabled me to see at first hand the tremendous changes which have been initiated there and the prospects which exist for stronger economic relations between both countries. Overall, I came away convinced that there are some worthwhile opportunities for developing our trade and business links, over time.  Specifically, in the investment area, I feel that the best hope of attracting South African investment lies in the financial service sector &mdash; especially insurance and banking &mdash; while on the trade side I would see our immediate prospects to be in the consultancy and technical assistance areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister had a wide range of meetings while in South Africa and that he met specifically with the ANC.  I would ask him to comment on the criticism of his <Col N="2190" /> visit by the Irish anti-apartheid movement to the effect that they considered it premature, especially in the signal it may give to the Pretoria Government.  Does the Minister accept that there is a necessity to balance the interests of our country in terms of trade with any action that could be taken to impede progress towards democracy in South Africa? Finally, may I ask him if the provision of training facilities for six graduates &mdash; I do not know whether these six places will be reserved in Carysfort &mdash; amounts to the full extent of our commitment to training arising from the visit or does the Minister envisage a greater commitment in the year ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The offer of training of six graduates in public administration was a gratuituous offer on the part of the Irish Government, but of course the Deputy will be aware that the Government make available aid of different kinds to people in different parts of South Africa and places close to South Africa.  Training will form an important part of our contact with South Africa, particularly in the immediate future, and that is borne out by the fact that several of the State bodies and private companies who accompanied me had in mind training programmes of one kind or the other.  These would be usually provided on a commercial basis but in the circumstances they will probably be paid for not necessarily by the recipients of the training but by bodies such as the European Community, the World Bank, the IMF and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it the Minister was accompanied on this trip to South Africa by representatives of the IDA and An Bord Tráchtála.  Does he see the possibility of opening permanent offices in South Africa &mdash; I understand that neither organisation has an office on the Continent of Africa &mdash; given the world changes that are taking place, the elimination of competition between the east and west for trade in Africa and the possibilities for exports and for investment in Europe from these countries? Would the Minister consider South <Col N="2191" /> Africa as a suitable location for these offices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would indeed, because South Africa is of enormous importance not just in its potential market, which is very big, but also because it is economically and otherwise by far the most advanced country on the Continent of Africa.  It is used as a base in the planning of infrastructural and other developments of many of the countries on the African Continent, particularly those south of the Equator.  I believe that our interests in time would be served by having a trade office in Johannesburg.  I have discussed this matter with An Bord Tráchtála and their view is that they do not wish to open an office there within the next six or nine months but they are taking steps immediately to appoint a representative there and they will review the position as trade develops.  At present trade is not at a high level and our exports to South Africa are inhibited by the very high level of tariffs which exist in the South African market.  It was indicated to me by members of the Government and other people that it can be expected that those tariffs will be greatly reduced in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Minister's enthusiasm for the trade possibilities that such a mission would open up not only in South Africa itself but on the African Continent.  However, would the Minister not agree that we ought to make haste slowly and that while all the conditions laid down by the United Nations for negotiations have not been <Col N="2192" /> observed there is a necessity to balance that political consideration against our vested interest as a trading nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of that and that is why my visit there in November of this year was the first ever official visit by an Irish Minister &mdash; Irish Ministers visited South Africa in their EC capacity but not in their Irish capacity during our Presidency of the EC.  We have hastened slowly and the question may well arise as to whether we may have hastened a little too slowly because I found that every European country had been there ahead of me.</P>

It will be for the director to decide what further action, if any, he can take in the light of his investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also point out that, with the coming into force in October 1991 of the Competition Act, 1991, it is now open to the IFA or their members, if they consider themselves to be aggrieved, to take action against any party involved in an <Col N="2193" /> anti-competitive concerted action or abuse prohibited by the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 18, 20, 30, 31, and 36 together.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations agreed by Minister in Punta Del Este in 1986, includes, among 15 specific negotiating objectives, the aim of formulating modalities which would permit the eventual integration of trade in clothing and textiles into GATT on the basis of strengthened GATT rules and disciplines. After the initial four years of negotiations, during which all parties, including the EC, brought forward proposals, the chairman of the GATT Textiles Negotiating Group submitted a draft compromise for negotiation at the GATT ministerial meeting in December 1990 which left a number of key issues open. As the GATT negotiations broke down this proposal is still on the table.</P>
      <P>The main elements of the EC position, which was fully supported by Ireland, which were included in the chairman's compromise proposal, can be summarised as follows: (i) the MFA would be integrated into GATT or phased out over a period of time to be negotiated; (ii) the integration would be in three phases with a percentage, to be negotiated, of trade in textile integrated in each phase; (iii) the starting point would be existing restrictions, to be defined; and extent to which GATT rules and disciplines have been strengthened would be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously the important issues as far as Ireland is concerned are the duration of the integration or phase out, and the way in which restrictions are phased out. It is important that as far as possible the less sensitive products are liberalised at the beginning and the very sensitive products towards the end.  As negotiations are on-going it is not possible to be specific about the effect on employment in the sector at this stage.  If the phase out were undertaken too rapidly the impact on employment would be significant both here and in the Community generally.  I <Col N="2195" /> can assure Deputies that I will be making every effort to ensure that this is not the case.</P>
    <P>My Department have had ongoing contacts with both the Apparel Industries Federation and the Irish Textiles Federation as well as with trade union interests in relations to the negotiations. Their views have been taken into account in the formulation of both industrial policy and of our input into EC trade policy for the sector.  I have also received the most recent AIF submission, to which Deputy Taylor refers, and I am currently examining it in the context of the on-going developments at both EC and GATT levels in relation to the future of the sector in Ireland and the EC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister bear in mind the importance of employment in the textile industry, although it has been declining greatly in the past 20 years? After agriculture, textiles is the second largest employer in the country.  I hope the Minister will bear this in mind during the negotiations.</P>

I visited him in Lisbon about a month ago to discuss that matter among other matters.  That matter is, of course, of special importance to the Portuguese.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Confederation of Irish Industry's proposal to draw up a code of business ethics. Limited liability companies are the primary medium through which commercial activities are conducted in Ireland and over the years a detailed and comprehensive company law framework has been put in place.  The most recent addition to the framework, the Companies Act, 1990, represents the culmination of the most fundamental review of Irish company law for decades.  The Bill that preceded it received lengthy and painstaking consideration in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this expanded body of company legislation, breach of which is subject to appropriate sanctions, goes as far as it is necessary in statute law.  I see no objection, however, to the CII promoting a code of business ethics where they feel such a development will benefit their members and the public. However, I do not consider specific legislation in this regard to be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to ask the Minister if he considers that the incarceration of Ministers should be precluded under the code of ethics.  More specifically, does the Minister accept that there is widespread public concern about the recent revelations of business ethics as practised by a section of Irish business? <Col N="2197" /> Is the Minister intent on ruling out the introduction of a code of ethics on a statutory basis?  The existing company legislation&mdash;admittedly some of it has been put on the Statute Book very recently&mdash;does not seem to have acted as a deterrent in certain cases that we know about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to matters that happened before the enactment of the recent legislation but which are being inquired into under the legislation.  By and large it seems to me that it has not been demonstrated that there are any significant shortcomings. I have no doubt that as time passes shortcomings will come to light. Some minor shortcomings have already come to light with regard to investigations and I will make certain minor amendments to make things easier.  I have no doubt that as time passes further shortcomings will come to light and I hope that amendments of company law in the future will be more frequent and shorter than the very major amendment which finally culminated in the passing of the Act in December 1990.  I hope we will see a great many small amendments and by the end of 1992 one might bring forward initial updates.  There will be company law being made anyway, usually outside this House, through the adoption of various EC Directives on company law.  In addition, I think it advisable that Bills be brought forward from time to time dealing with specific points, or a small number of specific points, rather than major blockbusters every quarter of a century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that what has happened recently in the Irish business community is quite exceptional and that the vast majority of Irish businessmen create employment and pay their taxes and are a considerable asset to this country.  The business community <Col N="2198" /> as a whole should not be labelled as dishonest tax avoiders or tax evaders, as they have been in some sections of the media and in this House over the past three months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to avail of the opportunity to agree with the Deputy.  In so agreeing let me say that I am a little surprised that the CII thought it appropriate to say and do what they did.  I think they were implying that ethics is a widespread problem in Irish business, but I believe it is not.  I believe that only a small minority of people are in breach of the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister whether he would have the agreement in relation to the £30 million investment lodged in the Labour Court. The Minister did not reply to that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not going to make a further contribution if a vote carried over into the sos time, but I do have one point to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made certain remarks about my support for amendment No.3. He said that the new philosophy in which I was indulging would come home to haunt me and so forth.  All I can say is that by the same logic if I am seen having a drink in the Dáil bar I hope that I shall <Col N="2255" /> not be accused of being an alcoholic.  The Minister is very quick to seize on a minor point and exaggerate it beyond all proportion in the debate.</P>
    <P>I wish to say to the Minister &mdash; this privateer, marketeer Minister who has an ideological bent &mdash; that his footprints are all over decisions taken in relation to air routes between Ryanair and Aer Lingus.  I would ask the Minister, please do not lecture me about State interference in relation to strategic decisions in the national interest, some of which I would support, because of the retention of certain routes.  Those same arguments apply equally to shipping.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael Members will support amendment No.3 because we want to ensure, in relation to the central corridor and the southern corridor, that both those depending on the tourism sector and those depending on the industrial sector to get their freight cargo in and out of this country can rely on the provision of future services.  The Minister has acknowledged that he can give no such guarantee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, I think that when there is a discussion on matters connected with the water I would discourage the Minister from following you into the sky.  I hope that he is not going to talk about aeronautics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not, except to say that a different concept is involved. Amendment No.3, on which we are now proposing to vote, asks that the Minister have the power to order that a particular route be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Order the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, to maintain a route.  The Deputy's analogy with airlines is not accurate.  There is no legislation that allows me to order an airline to maintain a particular route.  I do not have that authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What legislation do I have?  There is no legislation.</P>
      <P>I do have another point to make.  I want to be fair to the Deputy and respond to questions.  The Deputy asked about the auditors of Stokes Kennedy Crowley. I have here a letter that Stokes Kennedy Crowley have suggested I put on the record.  They point out that they are somewhat concerned about references made in the Dáil to potential conflict of interest on their part as auditors of B &amp; I and also Stokes Kennedy Crowley Corporate Finance as advisers to the Minister on the sale of B &amp; I.  Stokes Kennedy Crowley would like me to put the following points on the record on their behalf:</P>
      <P>Although Stokes Kennedy Crowley Corporate Finance Limited is wholly owned by Stokes Kennedy Crowley, it operates, to all intents and purposes, as an autonomous business.</P>
      <P>We have very strict ethical guidelines in relation to the work which we undertake and this ensures that Chinese walls exist whenever there is any potential conflict situation.</P>
      <P>The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland produce a comprehensive Ethical Guideline for its members.  This guideline does not see any conflict in a situation of this nature.</P>
      <P>It should be pointed out that the responsibility of the auditors is to the shareholders of the company to whom they make their annual report.  In acting in the sale of B &amp; I we were also acting on behalf of the shareholder of the company i.e. the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The letter goes on to state that the company understand that the reference to their position was based on some comment or briefings supplied by the board of B &amp; I to a particular Deputy and that <Col N="2257" /> if that is the case they would like to put the record straight &mdash; some of the language used is not helpful.</P>

    <P>This amendment is of key importance.  It attempts to give to the workforce of B &amp; I, some security for the future and guarantees in the area of jobs, rates of pay and terms and conditions of employment. It is an attempt to give recognition for the excellence of the input made, particularly since 1987, by the workforce.</P>
    <P>By way of preamble to my contribution on this amendment, I wish to put on record the very important observations made by Mr. Alex Spain, chairman of the B &amp; I Line, in a letter to his staff, who had been so badly let down by the <Col N="2262" /> Minister, informing them that the line was to be sold.  He stated in this letter as follows:</P>
    <P>In the first place, the Board would like to record its appreciation to all members of staff for the outstanding efforts made to secure the future of the Company.  The remarkable progress made under the Five Year Viability Plan is in no small part due to the dedication and commitment of management and staff.  The commitment and sacrifice made by those within the Company over recent years had turned B &amp; I into a profitable company with the ability to develop into a strong Irish ferry group.  The fact that many of the key elements which will ensure future growth and success have already been achieved is a matter that must be recorded at this time.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications announced the Government's intention to end support for the Viability Plan and sell the Company the primary concern of the Board has been to seek to ensure a satisfactory future for the Company and its staff.</P>
    <P>I do not know Mr. Alex Spain.  Deputy Rabbitte does, because he negotiated that five-year plan.  One can clearly see in that letter a heartfelt appreciation and recognition of the credit due to the staff and management for having achieved in a five-year period a turnabout in the company which was unthinkable some years ago.  Those sentiments have also been expressed by the chief executive of the B &amp; I, Mr. Jim Kennedy.  It is important to refer to what Mr. Kennedy had to say in the context of guaranteeing jobs and providing proper terms and conditions of employment for the workers. He said that freight to the continent had doubled.  The number of cars carried was up by 50 per cent and the ro-ro freight was up by 75 per cent.  The article continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The amount of things which came together in just five weeks was amazing&rdquo;, he said of his involvement in the consortium preparing the offer which <Col N="2263" /> included some of the group's trade unions, FAS, AIB Capital Markets, two Danish shipping companies and Unity Trust, a merchant bank established by the Trade Union Congress in the UK.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately this is now history.  The Minister ruthlessly rejected the management-staff buy-out proposal and they felt angry and betrayed.  I want to pay tribute to the excellent work done by Mr. Alex Spain, Mr. Jim Kennedy and the staff and management of the B &amp; I Line. It was with those sentiments in mind that we put down our amendment which seeks to ensure the Minister gives due recognition to the workers of B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>I should like to pose a few questions to the Minister.  I am not too sure of the intent of the Minister's amendment No. 15.  Does his amendment contain a clause which will extend the provisions of Statutory Instrument 306/80 &mdash; European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations, 1980 &mdash; to cover seamen who are specifically excluded at present?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister's amendment contain a clause which provides that the B &amp; I pension scheme cannot be used for any purpose other than to provide and enhance pension benefits for members and that no surplus may be taken out of the fund or the funds dissolved or merged, save with the agreement of 75 per cent of the workers of the respective funds?  Does the amendment provide that trade union representatives shall be appointed to the board of ICG as they were appointed to the board of the B &amp; I Line?  This kind of industrial democracy between workers and management has been praised by Alex Spain among others.  I hope all these issues which are covered by our amendment are also covered by the Minister's amendment No. 15.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that the Minister's amendment No. 15 is identical to a section in the Sugar Company Act. <Col N="2264" /> However, a number of points require clarification.  This amendment, which is the only amendment put down by the Minister in relation to the pension scheme, seems to go only as far as ensuring the continuity of benefits to present and future pensioners of B &amp; I. As we know, the pension fund has a very substantial surplus.  Indeed I understand the surplus is so substantial that the pension fund may lose its tax exemption status in the UK where many of these funds are invested.  Therefore, this gives rise to the question of whether this surplus can be used for purposes required by ICG?  ICG's view is that if a pension fund is in deficit the employer is responsible for filling that deficit and if it is in surplus they get the benefits.</P>
      <P>Opposition parties have put down amendments in regard to pension funds which will not now be debated as we have less than half an hour left.  We need to ensure that the surplus funds will not be used for, say, the purpose of buying off, in terms of severance pay, a few hundred workers in the B &amp; I.  That would be wrong.  Therefore, it is absolutely vital that the Minister amends his amendment to the extent that it provides there must be a ballot of 75 per cent of the beneficiaries of the pension fund so that they will have a say over the use of their funds in the future.  It is simply not enough to say that employees will have the same benefits because there is a surplus and there will be an increasing surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second question which arises is whether Irish Ferries will continue the same pension scheme &mdash; the 7 per cent employee contribution and the 7 per cent employer contribution &mdash; or will they seek to renegotiate it?  I understand it is proposed to merge the pension fund with the pension fund for the existing employees of Irish Ferries.  Will there be a cross subsidy from one worker to another to the benefit of the employees of Irish Ferries?  Such a move would be wrong.  I should like the Minister to clarify these points.  Does he not agree that his amendment No. 15 deals only with the benefits and does not refer to the protection of surplus funds.  I should <Col N="2265" /> point out that the recent Maxwell controversy in the motherland which we slavishly follow, Britain, has shown that its laws in relation to pension funds have been wholly defective in that pension funds were openly raided by the management of that company for questionable purposes.  I should like the Minister to answer those questions which relate to the inadequacy of his amendment in terms of the pension fund and its surplus.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the effect of amendment No. 15 and what we are seeking to achieve.  The amendment states that every person who immediately before the disposal date of the shares was an employee of the company shall, on the disposal date, enjoy the same rights and be subject to the same obligations as he enjoyed and was subject to immediately before the disposal date.  Can the Minister clarify in those circumstances what will happen to the material I have and which was circulated in the negotiations between the FIE, who represented Irish Ferris, and the B &amp; I workers this summer?  I want to give a brutal example of what may happen to clerical staff.  As I said, the Minister's amendment proposes that on the disposal date of the shares the staff shall enjoy the same obligations as they enjoyed and were subject to immediately before the disposal date.</P>
    <P>What happens to those in the groupage, planning, claims and pensions and printing departments and the regional office in the UK which will be transferred to Holyhead?  The ICG proposal is simply to close all these departments as well as the customs clearance section and to reorganise a number of aspects in relation to computerisation.  What will happen to passenger and freight reservations, invoicing and ticketing?  What will happen to the staff who are doing the work manually at present?  There will also be computerisation for container movement and catering control, office automation and management information. What does the amendment mean to people who are faced with getting their P45?</P>
    <P>Throughout the documentation from <Col N="2266" /> the ICG is the classic phrase: &ldquo;rates of pay and allowances will be revised to reflect a competitive rate for the job done.&rdquo;  It applies to all sectors.  What is a competitive rate for the job done?  What if the competitive rate for the job is a lesser rate than the rate which applied before the disposal date?  In other words, a series of grades of workers will have their increments and grades reduced or will be dismissed.  What is their protection? This did not happen in relation to Greencore; I may be wrong but I am not aware of wholesale rationalisation proposals in relation to that company and the Thurles closure had already gone through.  This is wholesale butchering of jobs.</P>
    <P>Arising from the &ldquo;due diligence&rdquo; proposal of ICG, there is a whole reorganisation of labour which seems to be totally contradictory of what the Minister and Members are trying to do.  What about Dublin Port and its operation?  At present there are ten people working in the car ferry ticket checking section in the B &amp; I, it is now proposed that there will not be anybody in that section, that the work will be carried out by administrative staff.</P>
    <P>The groupage unit will also be closed and will not require checkers.  How can their rights be protected?  In relation to the jobs of Dublin terminal port workers, the rates of pay will be revised to reflect the competitive rate for the job to be done.  There are also statements about terms and conditions, manning levels to complete all work, full availability to work 39 hours before additional payment, flexibility to work on any number of vessels, rates of pay to include flexible working hours to cover lunch, tea and dinner breaks and flexible manning levels for overtime.  There is also a reference to flexibility on work assignments during working days, the present ro-ro customs production to be covered by ro-ro producers and general store terms and conditions to apply.  There is also a whole series of conditions in relation to shore staff.  However, I cannot see how there is any protection for the workers under these proposals.  There is a dichotomy <Col N="2267" /> here which I cannot reconcile with the facts and perhaps the Minister will clarify the matter.</P>
    <P>It is significant that when the Minister sent this Bill to the printers it did not contain the proposal that is now in amendment No. 15, he was not prepared to give the B &amp; I workers a Christmas present of any protection.  This is a reflection on his neglect, disregard and lack of interest in the rights of workers of the B &amp; I and their families.  He had to have his arm twisted to include the amendment.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give an assurance to the House that all redundancies will be voluntary, either on an early retirement scheme or a voluntary redundancy scheme?  It would be a very positive gesture if the Minister could give a solemn undertaking to the House, as these people are moving out of the public sector, that he has extracted a commitment for ICG that they will all be voluntary redundancies.  Like Deputy Byrne, I should like Statutory Instrument 306 to include seamen.  Will the pension fund surplus, as opposed to the pensioners' rights, be controlled by way of ballot?  How can the Minister reconcile his alleged protection for staff with the wholesale butchery of not only personnel but whole sections in Dublin Port?  Will the Minister give an undertaking that the terms of Statutory Instrument 306 will apply to all staff and that any redundancies are on a voluntary basis?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are a classic example of why we should not rush legislation.  Very shortly the Bill will come into law and we will not be able to do any more about it.  I opposed the guillotining of this Bill because it concerns people.  The Minister's amendment is welcome but I also tabled a substantial amendment which I should like to read to the House but I have no intention of wasting any more time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points outlined by Deputy Byrne and Deputy Yates are very important and they must be clarified.  The Minister said yesterday he intended to introduce an <Col N="2268" /> amendment to the Bill on the rights of employees as agreed with ICTU and the B &amp; I group of unions.  He did not mention workers' representation on the board and I assume that option is no longer available to the workforce.  If it is not, the same conditions do not apply but the same conditions should apply even though they are being taken over.  I am also very concerned about pension funds because the ordinary people in the B &amp; I are well aware of the situation and are very worried about it.  They feel it is their money in the sense that they have contributed to the scheme and built it up substantially over the years.  They are fearful that the surplus will be utilised by the new company to spend as they wish. They feel they have not been given specific guarantees in the Bill or in the agreement. Perhaps pensions will be guaranteed for present and future employees but we are talking about a surplus which, apparently, is in a very healthy state.  In the event of a takeover or a buy-out there are always redundancies, changes in work practices and reorganisation.  I know that redundancies have been allowed for but I am talking about the people who will be left to keep the flag of the new company flying.</P>
    <P>I voice my concern to the Minister on behalf of those people this evening.  I would ask the Minister to look again at his amendment because it is vague and does not really get into the nitty gritty.  I appreciate everything cannot be written into an amendment.  In any case this agreement was rushed and probably it bought time and industrial peace for the time being.  As the company develops, we will see practices developing which never existed previously.  There will obviously be a response from the workforce and the arguments and agreements of unions will be bandied about.  We should have specifics in regard to the pension surplus, which is very important, and the right of workers to be represented on the board and other matters with which Deputy Yates dealt in detail and of which present employees are not aware.  At present B &amp; I employees do not know what conditions will exist when <Col N="2269" /> the company is taken over.  I have received many telephone calls to this effect from people who are in the dark and they rely on their representatives to do the job for them.  We have a duty in this House to look after the workers of B &amp; I.  This is one of the reasons we felt there should not be a guillotine on this important legislation.  In this legislation we are talking about the livelihoods of many workers who have contributed enormously to the turn around in this company and which now has a future over which there is a big question mark.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that an agreement was signed yesterday, will the B &amp; I have representatives on the board?  Will their conditions be exactly the same as before? Will their pensions be safeguarded?  I would request the Minister to respond to those queries.  I fear this legislation has bought peace for the period between now and the new year.  I hope it will be lasting because otherwise there will a major upheaval in labour relations and in relation to the management buy out. When responding perhaps the Minister would clarify those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister read into the record of this House the requests to him by the trade unions yesterday &mdash; and I welcome that &mdash; but the fact remains that trade unions representing up to 1,000 staff in B &amp; I had no alternative.  Given the views expressed in this House by the Minister and the Bill introduced by the Government, which incorporated none of the amendments about which we are talking and went no way towards dealing with the needs, aspirations and future job security and conditions of employment of the staff, they were left with no alternative. The trade unions did what they felt had to be done for their staff.  We in this House are asked how, as legislators, we can incorporate into that legislation some control and safeguards.  On the basis of the amendments before us many safeguards are required by the staff who over three years have changed the fortunes of the B &amp; I into a most attractive proposition.  Those guarantees cannot <Col N="2270" /> and will not be enshrined in the legislation.</P>
      <P>I mentioned on Second Stage that I had seen a viable semi-State organisation moved out of the semi-State sector into private enterprise.  We were told in great documents &mdash; the same kind of documents as we are talking about now &mdash; that the conditions of employment, job security and pension rights of the staff would be maintained.  When the hive-off took place of the Spa Road works to Van Hool McArdle their conditions were not preserved.  The people in B &amp; I are going into a new environment.  We are talking about ICG and their document, where it is stated that there will be a phased reduction of permanent staff by 253.  How does this document and the Minister's amendment deal with this scenario?  They say in their document they will give a commitment that there will be no involuntary redundancy provided they can get sufficient people to leave on a voluntary basis.  On the basis of this legislation can the Minister give a commitment to this House that there will be no involuntary redundancy?</P>
      <P>What is the position of maintenance staff in B &amp; I?  What will be their status and their role?  I have no doubt as soon as this legislation is passed that a section of the staff will be hived off into another section.  Can the Minister give those commitments in relation to staffing arrangements and also to pensions?  It is important when we are talking about a general pension fund that he gives a commitment &mdash; other Deputies have referred to this &mdash; in regard to the surplus of assets, that it would require a 75 per cent majority vote of the members of that pension fund before it could be used for any purpose.  I do not think that is an unreasonable suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board structure includes representatives of the staff.  An area of great concern relates to the admission of new employees to membership of the fund. Rule 2 deals with that matter.  Membership is confined to full time permanent outdoor staff, employees of B &amp; I Line plc, who fulfil certain age and service conditions, although these conditions <Col N="2271" /> may be waived by the committee at their discretion.  A new owner of B &amp; I Line plc could transfer some of its employees into the employment of B &amp; I Line plc. Under the provisions of rule 17 the committee, with the consent of the board of the B &amp; I Line, may augment the pension payable to any member of the fund.  In fact, the admission of new members into the fund requires the consent of the board.  Can the Minister give a commitment that we will have members on the board?</P>
    <P>There are many queries concerning how the Bill refers to the admission of new employees.  The Bill also deals very clearly with the funding of early retirement benefits.  There is a number of grey areas which concern the staff.  The Bill and the proposed ministerial amendments cannot generate any confidence in the people who are being affected by this transfer into the private sector.  It is scandalous that the Minister and the Government are putting this detailed legislation through the House without enabling the House to deal adequately with this delicate but important legislation.  At the end of the day the new owners of B &amp; I will point to the commitments in the legislation and will adhere to them.  This is bad legislation which does nothing to enhance the future of the employees of B &amp; I who have done their utmost over the last three years to make this a viable organisation.  Because of their efforts and achievements other people want to get their hands on the company.  I am sorry to say that this is a bad day for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree completely. This Bill gives the company and their employees a real opportunity in the future.  Statutory Instrument 306 applies, but we have gone beyond that in our agreement with the unions.  Statutory Instrument 306 does not apply to seamen, and as we cannot amend EC regulations unilaterally our amendments cover all of the staff, including seamen.  The unions <Col N="2272" /> were satisfied that the arrangement negotiated is better than using Statutory Instrument 306.</P>
      <P>Most Deputies have welcomed amendment No. 15, which we have put forward. I pay tribute to the ICTU and to the B &amp; I group of unions and to my officials who worked extremely hard to secure this agreement.  I thank them for their patience.  While holding to their disagreements with me they were able to meet us all half way and we have secured industrial peace and a better future.</P>
      <P>With regard to pension funds, I worked with the ICTU in this matter and we laid out exactly where we stood and that the ICG would have to abide by that.  I do not want to be provocative, but the question of pension funds surpluses has been mentioned.  The management-staff buy out consortium offer hinged on the use of £6 million for the B &amp; I pension funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The B &amp; I pension funds are subject to general pension legislation. It is neither necessary nor appropriate to start tinkering with that in this Bill.  Under my amendment the continuity of existing pension rights is preserved and the agreement signed with ICTU and the B &amp; I unions enshrine a commitment to obtain from ICG an undertaking that ICG will fully abide by the current trust deeds and rules of the B &amp; I pension fund, as disclosed to the ICG during their due diligence exercise. There are very tight controls on the use of pension funds in these rules and in the deeds of trust of pension funds, and ICG have agreed to fully abide by these rules in the deeds of trust of pension funds. They will have to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Ryan's point about 75 per cent, in general terms the <Col N="2273" /> legal advice emphasises the need to satisfy the trustees and actuaries but that any action taken in relation to the surplus on the funds would not adversely affect the interests of the existing members.  In addition, in some cases the approval of the committee of management and 75 per cent of the members of the relevant fund are required to approve changes and that any alteration of B &amp; I terms and conditions of superannuation currently requires ministerial approval.  The 75 per cent is there in some cases, but I take the Deputy's point.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of workers participation, ICG have indicated that, subject to successful negotiations on other issues, they would be prepared to give positive consideration to the proposals which they have received on the whole question of worker democracy.  It is recognised by ICG that there is a wealth of experience in the B &amp; I which should be tapped.  It is simply a matter of finding the best mechanism for doing that.  The Workers Participation Act will not apply once this legislation is enacted. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> contains some suggestions in this area.  Once the ICG take charge, they have undertaken to give very serious consideration to the proposals on worker democracy.  I would be surprised if the ICTU and the group of unions were not a bit more comforted on that issue in view of the fact that they have signed this agreement with me.</P>
    <P>The whole question of rationalisation is a matter for negotiations between the ICG and the trade union movement.  The same conditions applied to the management and staff buy out.  Everybody who looked at the company with a view to buying it sought substantial redundancies in all departments.  The MSBO consortium this time last year sent me a figure of 300 redundancies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that. This year the management-staff buy-out in their revised bid put the figure at 150 but commented that it could go up by another 100 to the same level proposed by ICG.  It is not fair to pretend that the workers would have a magic wand which could keep them over and above the number Irish Ferries could keep.  It was much of a muchness in terms of numbers at the end of the day.  Irish Ferries have undertaken to make every effort to ensure that all the redundancies are voluntarily undertaken.  That is as far as I can go.  I cannot absolutely guarantee that all redundancies would be voluntary but every effort will be made to make sure that redundancies are voluntary.  I hope that will be the case.  With the kind of goodwill with which we put together this agreement, B &amp; I and ICG will be able to ensure that at the end of the day all redundancies will be voluntary.  I look forward to that being the case.</P>
      <P>I join with Deputies who paid tribute to the staff of B &amp; I.  I said here on the very first day that they had been through a rough and difficult time.  I appreciate the work they have put into the company.</P>
      <P>Now that we are concluding this debate, I express the hope that, when all the heat is behind us, this new firm will set sail in the knowledge that they have a great future, with optimism and that everybody involved will try to make the company work now that we have taken this decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £2,393,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1991, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is first, to provide an additional £7.75 million to the IDA, in respect of their capital grants expenditure; and <Col N="2279" /> second, to provide an additional £260,000 for the Department's consultancy subhead. The total additional funding required, £8.01 million, is offset by savings on a number of subheads, which, together with increased appropriations in aid, result in a net funding requirement of £2.393 million as detailed in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>For the year ending 31 December 1991, the IDA were approved a grant-in-aid of £106 million or capital grants.  In addition IDA were permitted to avail of £12 million of their own resources made up of grant repayments and reimbursements from the European Social Fund.  The IDA's approved expenditure, therefore, for capital grants in 1991 was £118 million.</P>
    <P>The IDA require additional funding of £16 million for capital grants in 1991.  This has arisen because of the increased level of grant claims in relation to the main grant programmes.  The £16 million shortfall on capital grants will be partly met &mdash; to the tune of £8.25 million &mdash; as follows:</P>
    <P>The transfer of £2.75 million additional own resources from building operations to capital grants;</P>
    <P>The retention of £3.5 million proceeds from the sale of IDA property which was part of £4.5 million due to be remitted to the Exchequer and which will now be transferred to capital grants;</P>
    <P>The realisation of £2 million additional own resources on capital grants from the European Social Fund and from grant repayments.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, there has been a substantially increased level of IDA backed job creation, which has included the attraction to Ireland of a number of major flagship projects in sectors and geographic regions of strategic significance for the IDA's inward investment efforts.  These factors combined with an accelerated rate of project development in a number of instances have given rise to the need for increased funding in 1991.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2280" /> The three-year period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery, 1988-1990,</i> saw an increased activity level, resulting in over 36,000 sustained first time jobs being created with IDA assistance. This represented an increase of 40 per cent over the previous three-year period.  At the same time, over the past number of years, there has been a greater focus on achieving greater value for State expenditure.  In project negotiation maximum emphasis has been put on achieving sustained long term performance at least cost to the Exchequer. As a result the cost of IDA-backed jobs which have been sustained over a seven-year period fell from £20,097 per job in 1986 to £14,271 in 1990 &mdash; measured in constant 1990 prices.</P>
    <P>Over the same period &mdash; 1986-90 &mdash; this allowed the Exchequer capital grant-in-aid to IDA to be reduced from £166.1 million to £110.1 million in constant 1990 prices.  Notwithstanding the substantial effort on the part of the IDA in relation to the achievement of value for money, the significantly increased job creation activity since 1988 has led to a short term real increase in IDA capital grant-in-aid requirements.  In the medium-term, as the balance between activity levels and the reduction in support for individual projects levels off, the overall funding requirement will recommence its real decline.</P>
    <P>The shortfall in grant-in-aid has occurred now because, since 1987, it has been the policy to include a performance clause in every grant agreement, tying payment of grants to fulfilment of job creation targets by companies.  Because of the very strong job performance of companies approved for grant support since the introduction of performance clauses, substantial tranches of grants approved to these companies have now become due for payment.  In negotiations with companies, IDA always stress that they see the grant agreement as a two-way contract between the company and the Government.  Just as companies must fulfil their job commitments, it is, of course, equally important that IDA be in a position to meet their grant payment <Col N="2281" /> obligations promptly if they are to maintain credibility with companies.</P>
    <P>Since 1988 a number of flagship projects have been approved in sectors of strategic significance for the IDA's inward investment effort.  Some of these projects have been significantly large and in a number of cases their investment programme is ahead of schedule.  One example of this is the large development at Leixlip for Intel Corporation, the first ever dedicated wafer fabrication plant in Ireland.  This investment has been brought forward by one year, and construction of the new 400,000 sq. ft. facility commenced in 1991.  The success in attracting this type of facility is invaluable to IDA's marketing efforts in the electronics sector.</P>
    <P>The continued efforts to reduce the costs of industrial development in the future are reflected in the implementation of the recommendations of the Triennial Review of Industrial Performance, which my Department published last year.  Since 1988, substantial progress has been made in introducing repayable grants in medium-large Irish industry. At the end of 1991, nearly one-third of all financial support approved to this sector was in repayable form.  The IDA are confident that, in line with the objective set out in the triennial review, they will be in a position to move by the end of 1993 to a position where 50 per cent of all financial support to medium-large indigenous industry is in the form of repayable, or other remunerating, forms of aid.</P>
    <P>The reductions in grant levels recommended in the triennial review in respect of small business and expansions in overseas industry are also being implemented by the IDA.  IDA backed companies have made a substantial contribution to job creation in the economy in recent years. Over the three years 1988-90, these firms contributed 18,000 jobs per annum on average towards the national objective of 20,000 jobs a year, which was set down in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>Despite the difficult environment in 1991, the IDA's target for new first time jobs in manufacturing and international <Col N="2282" /> services has been substantially met.  In addition, the manufacturing sector as a whole is expected to hold its own and, while other countries are experiencing a decline in the employment contribution of the manufacturing sector, the outlook in Ireland is promising.</P>
    <P>The key priority at present must be to address the unemployment problem. Through a combination of prudent Government policy aimed at creating the appropriate fiscal and macro-economic environment and focusing on the achievement and maintenance of international competitiveness at company level, the Irish industrial scene is now in a strong position to move forward.  I believe very firmly that, assuming the international economic climate becomes more favourable, we should be able to return to the levels of manufacturing job creation achieved in the 1988-90 period.</P>
    <P>However, while the success of that period was built to a significant extent on strong gains in macro-economic competitiveness in our major export markets, in future we are unlikely to be able to rely as much on macro-economic effects. Further gains in competitiveness must, therefore, come from improved performance at industry segment and company level through the more focused development policies being pursued by the IDA.</P>
    <P>The projected excess on the consultancy subhead arises primarily because of assignments related to the work of the industrial policy review group which was set up in June, 1991 and the section 14 inquiries which I commissioned into certain aspects of the Greencore and Telecom affairs.  While there are some offsetting savings on other elements of the consultancy subhead, an overall excess of £260,000 is projected.</P>
    <P>With regard to the industrial policy review group, Deputies will be aware that, last June, I asked a group of leading people from the worlds of industry, business, economic research and trade union affairs to advise on the full range of policies and measures that bear on or influence the development of industry and services here.  They had to undertake a <Col N="2283" /> fundamental review of a large number of areas of public policy and for that they required independent advice.</P>
    <P>The group are now finalising their report and I look forward to receiving it and considering its contents, in the new year.</P>
    <P>The first section 14 inquiry relates to Siúicre éireann cpt and certain other named companies forming part of the Greencore Group.  I have already made reference to this inquiry, in dealing with questions earlier this afternoon.  As Deputies will be aware, the inspector furnished a final report to me on 4 December 1991, which I published on 5 December 1991.  On foot of the final report, I decided to continue the restrictions imposed on the Talmino loan note following the interim report and to refer this report also to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration of possible action.  Further possible breaches of company law and fiduciary duties were identified in the report.</P>
    <P>The second inquiry relates to Hoddle Investments Ltd. and Chestvale Properties Ltd.  I appointed an inspector, under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990, on 14 October 1991 &mdash; replacing an inspector appointed on 1 October 1991 &mdash; to investigate and report on the persons who have been financially interested in the success or failure of Hoddle Investments Ltd. and Chestvale Properties Ltd. The appointment arose from concerns which arose from the purchase by Telecom éireann of the former Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien site at Ballsbridge, Dublin, and the recommendations on 1 October 1991 by an inquiry established by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications.  The fact that there have been so many attempts to disrupt the proceedings of the inspector is a matter of concern.  All these actions have been strongly defended, in the public interest, and no effort will be spared to seek to ensure a proper conclusion to this inquiry.</P>
    <P>Since these remarks were prepared, the House may be aware that apparently I have to appear before the High Court <Col N="2284" /> on Friday, arising out of the last named inquiry, at the instance of Mr. Dermot Desmond to show reasons why I should not be sent to prison.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not opposing this Estimate.  I welcome the Minister's remarks.  In the course of his script he emphasised the necessity for competitiveness in Irish industry which he suggested may come about through the more focused development policies being pursued by the IDA and also by being more competitive in our export markets. Last week I put down a Priority Question to be answered by the Minister today. The question asked whether the Minister's Department had conducted an investigation into the possible damage to the competitive position of Irish industry <i>vis-à-vis</i> industries in the United Kingdom following the British Government's decision not to take part in the Social Charter outlined at the Maastricht Summit last week.  Some clever person in the Minister's office &mdash; I presume that the Minister had nothing to do with it himself &mdash; decided that that was a matter for the Minister for Labour and passed it on.  I do not think that is very helpful, and I should like the Minister to convey that to his officials.  It is clear that the issue of concern is the competitive position of Irish industry, which is the <Col N="2285" /> responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The criticisms voiced by federations of industrialists were made because of a genuine concern that the Irish position will be damaged because Britain has decided not to agree the Social Charter.</P>
      <P>The British Prime Minister on his return from the Maastricht Summit said that he had not signed the Social Charter because it would give British industry a competitive advantage in attracting industry and in exporting to other EC countries.  That point has been emphasised by the British delegations for the past six weeks because of their concern about what might come out of the Maastricht Summit.  If that were true, then I should have expected the Minister's Department to carry out a study for the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Finance and whoever else accompanied him to Maastricht, so that the argument could be rebutted or, if it could not be rebutted, Ireland &mdash; whose structures of industrial relations are the same as those of the British &mdash; could be put on a level footing with Britain and not sign on for the charter at Maastricht.</P>
      <P>This is a very serious problem that should have been addressed by the Taoiseach before he went to Maastricht.  The Minister's Department should not have availed him of the opportunity to sidestep the issue at Question Time today.</P>
      <P>If what the British Government are saying is true, that the Social Charter agreed at Maastricht will put Britain in an advantageous competitive position, then by definition Ireland will be put at more of a disadvantage than will any of the remaining ten EC countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Precisely what is the Minister and his Department doing to redress the balance in our favour?  Of all countries in Europe, Ireland must be competitive &mdash; we do not have a population base from which to export, some of our costs are higher than those in other European countries, we are an island, we have peripheral disadvantages and we have a poor transport <Col N="2286" /> structure.  If Ireland cannot achieve competitiveness within each individual industry, more jobs will be lost.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether the Minister will be able to do so at this stage, but I should have expected him to carry out a study so that the Government would be able to assure Irish industry that the claims made by the British authorities are not correct or, if Britain will have the competitive advantage, the Minister should outline to the House &mdash; or to at least bring in different industry sectors and tell them &mdash; what he proposes to do to redress the imbalance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is doing his job against the background of one of the highest ever levels of reported growth in GNP. Obviously, such growth is welcome but a great deal of the growth we have already experienced and are likely to experience is in very restricted areas.  There has been substantial growth in multinational profits and in profits in the financial services sector.  A great deal of that growth has already drained out of the economy.  A continuation of the policy of wealthy Irish companies investing the bulk of their profits abroad will deny us the opportunity of benefiting from that growth.</P>
      <P>From the figures available it is clear that the Government have no coherent industrial policy aimed at translating growth into wealth retained in Ireland and into jobs for Irish workers.  We need radical changes in industrial policy to secure the concept of value added in the Irish economy and to maximise investment in the Irish economy.  Without change our economic growth will continue to have more impact on job creation in America, Japan and Germany than here.  The improvements in recent years in efficiency, wage moderation and the public finances have all been achieved on the backs of working people.  It is time they got their fair share of the benefits. One of the most important, even if medium-term, ways in which the benefits can be shared would be through a radical revamping of industrial policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential failure of the Minister <Col N="2287" /> for Industry and Commerce is that he is content to tinker with industrial policy and has avoided any fundamental consideration of the ways in which we create and share wealth.  No doubt the Minister is arguing in Cabinet for yet another cut in the top tax rate but the fact that so many people in Ireland are on low or moderate incomes yet are in the higher tax brackets does not seem to be of the same concern.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had ample time since 1989 to produce a coherent industrial policy suited to the needs of Ireland in the nineties but, as was illustrated in his speech again today, he goes back to the old cliches.  The Minister talks about a policy aimed at creating the appropriate fiscal and macro-economic environment and states that with that the Irish industrial scene is now in a strong position to move forward.  If Irish industry were in such a strong position to move forward then the Government would hardly be making provision for social welfare payments for an extra 20,000 or more people during 1992.</P>
    <P>The philosophy of the Minister and the Government will not meet the needs of Ireland in this decade.  As I have said, a radical revamp is essential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party will not be opposing this Estimate either.</P>
      <P>Although the Minister has talked about the enhanced efficiency of the IDA and its improved performance in terms of cost per job created and so forth, the fact remains that unemployment is worsening.  It has been a singular achievement of the Minister that in the public mind he seems to be preoccupied with protecting what little virtue there is in Government rather than with tackling the unemployment crisis.  He has escaped remarkably unscathed from the extent of the crisis that opens in front of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certainly interested in the section of the Minister's contribution dealing with the review body and the report, conclusions and recommendations that will derive from that review.  I look forward to them.  The review is overdue.  It <Col N="2288" /> is one straw at which we can grasp in these circumstances.  However, I am aware that the Minister has relied on a very orthodox approach to industrial policy and to economic policy generally in the composition and the terms of reference to the review body.  He said that expert advice had to be availed of and one would expect that. To my knowledge, however, some of those who have been recruited to assist the review group hold a very traditionalist and orthodox view about the changes needed in industrial policy.  I, for one, will certainly be very interested in the work and the findings of the review group.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Garland is going to speak I shall have to be very brief but I do have a comment to make about the final chapter of the Minister's contribution, which relates to the efficacy of section 14 of the new Companies Act in so far as it has been applied to the two cases that he instanced.  If I heard the Minister correctly, at Question Time today he said that in future he would probably be more inclined, when necessary, to lean towards the invocation of the powers under section 8 of the Act.</P>

      <P>In the case of <i>Hoddle Investments Limited and Chestvale Properties Limited,</i> without the capacity to follow the money trail we will not get behind that particular scam.  It appears to me that the appointment, <i>ab initio,</i> ought to have been under the section of the Act that allowed access to bank accounts.  Otherwise we will continue to have the obstruction and arrogance we <Col N="2289" /> have experienced in the investigation being conducted.  The public demand that this matter be clarified conclusively and satisfactorily.  I do not question the Minister's will or commitment, indeed I welcome the last sentence of his introductory remarks to the effect that the public can be assured a proper conclusion to the inquiry but I am honestly very dubious about his ability to provide that if we cannot follow the money trail through bank accounts.

      <P>Well, that is the way.  I thought Deputy Barry was going to oppose it.  I feel I must do so by way of protest at the way the IDA have operated here in recent years.  There are signs of a Pauline conversion here.  I hope the industrial policy review group will make some recommendations such as that emphasis should be laid now on indigenous industry, preferably with a very high labour content, in an endeavour to solve our unemployment problems.  It is generally recognised that the policies of the IDA have not been successful in reducing our levels of unemployment.</P>

      <P>I might deal first with <Col N="2290" /> the point Deputy Peter Barry made in regard to the Maastricht Summit, the fear that we might become less competitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> the United Kingdom. Obviously, that is a fear up to a point but I think we can overcome it.  Particularly in terms of the attraction of overseas industry, I will not be shy, if the Lord spares me, about going around the United States and Japan telling them that they should look to Ireland, a full and committed member of the European Community, rather than look elsewhere at a country that is half in and half out of the EC, that not alone has not signed on for its social obligations within the Community but has not signed on for its monetary commitments within the Community. In my humble opinion the British have not strengthened their position either within the Community or in relation to third countries by their less than complete commitment to the EC.</P>

      <P>I suppose I can deal with one other point only in the very short time available to me.  I do not think that the problem raised by Deputy Rabbitte about bank accounts is, in practice as large as he might imagine.  The right to have access to the accounts &mdash; I am now speaking from memory without having notes or the Act before me &mdash; comes from section 10, not from either sections 8 or 14.  I think section 10 does refer to section 8.  A small amendment could make section 10 refer to section 14 as well if it was shown to be necessary. There are some other small amendments we would make also.  For example, I would omit the reference in section 8 to the Minister for Justice.  I do not know why it is there because it does not seem appropriate.  It would be better that one Minister would deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I really do not have time now to go into the matters arising out of this section 14 inquiry.  As I mentioned earlier, apparently I am now before the courts for my efforts.  I want to maintain the right of a Minister who is criticised &mdash; perhaps rightly or wrongly; I do not <Col N="2291" /> know, but criticised anyway by a person who is subject to investigation &mdash; to reply, whether in this House or outside it.  I exercised that right and propose to continue to exercise it.  I would have thought that my right, as a Minister, to answer such criticism was a matter about which the courts would not concern themselves, that they would see it in the proper sphere.  Obviously I cannot pre-judge what will happen on Friday but I want to say here and now that I will continue to exercise my constitutional right, as I think should every Minister and indeed every Member of this House.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1991. - Vote 25: Environment.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £6,000,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1991, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses <Col N="2292" /> in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes, subsidies and grants including certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate arises from increased expenditure on Subhead K.3 of my Department's Vote, i.e. grants in respect of non-national roads.  It is required for technical reasons only, as the increased roads expenditure is offset by corresponding savings on lottery-funded services elsewhere in the Vote. However, as these savings cannot be applied directly to other services, a Supplementary Estimate is technically needed to cover the increased expenditure on roads.  The original voted expenditure total of £598.482 million will not be exceeded.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, many issues within my Department's overall sphere of responsibility which I and other Members would be happy to debate in the House but on this occasion we are all governed by Standing Order No. 128 which provides that the debate must be confined to the items contained in the Estimate.  I am, proceeding, therefore, on the basis that I am precluded from dealing substantively with issues other than non-national roads.</P>
    <P>The provision of £6 million in the Supplementary Estimate is for the construction/improvement of public roads other than national roads, that is the network of regional, county and urban roads.  It has always been the case that primary responsibility for the funding of works on these roads rests with the individual local authorities.  Traditionally, works on these roads were financed from local resources, with limited grant assistance which, since the early 1970's, was almost exclusively provided through a block grant mechanism. In exceptional cases, special grants were provided for specifically identified improvement works.</P>
    <P>In the period up to and including 1988, block grants could be used to supplement expenditure from local authorities' own resources, including the rate support grants, for: (a) maintenance and improvement of regional roads; (b) <Col N="2293" /> improvement of county roads (but not maintenance); (c) improvement and maintenance of urban roads; and (d) traffic management measures.</P>
    <P>These block grants, together with smaller amounts in western package areas and for road strengthening, came to be referred to as &ldquo;discretionary grants&rdquo;, as each local authority was free to decide, within general guidelines issued by my Department, the individual works to be undertaken.  In 1989 it was decided to combine the old block grant with the funds available for county road strengthening into a single new system involving a block grant for regional and county roads generally.  This was the first time that State road grant assistance was made available for maintenance work on county roads.</P>
    <P>Also in 1989 the Government, recognising the deterioration in the condition of non-national roads, especially the regional and county roads, made a commitment that £150 million would be provided over three years in discretionary grants to county councils for these roads. The House is aware that this commitment was more than fulfilled.  In fact, total discretionary grants over the period 1989 to 1991 amount to £182.4 million.  When account is taken of other grants for non-national roads &mdash; special grants and grants to urban authorities &mdash; over £220 million will have been provided by the Exchequer for non-national roads in the three years 1989-91.  This is an increase of 60 per cent, or over £85 million on the preceding three years.</P>
    <P>A good indication of the increased level of funding which has been made available in discretionary grants to county councils can be obtained by comparing the total amount of £23 million paid in 1986 with the £68.13 million being paid this year.  This substantial level of funding is a measure of the Government's commitment to the ongoing requirements of the agriculture, forestry and tourism industries in addition to the requirements of rural communities generally. In line with the increased funding every attempt has been made to maximise the extent to which the grants for <Col N="2294" /> regional and country roads have been available for spending at the discretion of local authorities themselves.</P>
    <P>As an innovation, in 1990 part of the funds available for discretionary grants was used to provide supplementary grants for improvement works by certain authorities which had special road needs in their areas.  This approach was continued in 1991.</P>
    <P>The operational programme on peripherality maps out the Government's transport strategy for the period 1989-93.  Reflecting the vital importance of the national road network to overland transport, the programme provides £511 million for investment in national primary roads.  In addition the programme provides for significant investment in non-national roads which are of importance to industry or tourism development. Overall the programme provides just over £60 million for investment in these roads with an EC aid rate of 50 per cent. Local authorities have been afforded considerable discretion in the selection of projects under this sub-programme. Guidelines have been issued by my Department as to the criteria for project selection.  It is vital that local authorities respect these since failure to select projects which satisfy the criteria will make it possible to draw down the EC aid available for this purpose.  While the aid available for non-national roads is far less than that for national roads, reflecting the greater economic importance of the strategic national road network, it nonetheless has made an important contribution to the increase in resources for such roads in recent years.</P>
    <P>The 1991 provision for non-national road improvement grants in subhead K.3 of my Department's Estimate was £61 million.  The additional funding of £6 million represents an increase of almost 10 per cent and brings the total to £67 million, all of which has been allocated to local authorities and will be paid out in full by the end of the year, subject to approval by the House of the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Government's determination steadily to improve the fabric of the vast <Col N="2295" /> network of regional and county roads cannot be questioned in the light of the increased provision for grants in the last few years.  But county road maintenance and improvement is a huge undertaking because of the length of road involved &mdash; over 87,000 kilometres &mdash; the neglect of earlier years and the scale of investment required.  Further massive increases in total expenditure, even if we could afford them, are not the answer.  Instead we must first ensure that the greatest possible value for money is achieved from the existing expenditure.</P>
    <P>None of us can be unaware of the criticisms which have been levelled from time to time at investment in the county road network.  For the future we must ensure that to the greatest extent possible Exchequer and local authority investment in these roads is reflected in visible and quantifiable improvements in the network.  This may require a new approach to such works and I will be in touch with local authorities about this in the new year.</P>
    <P>The abridged Estimates, which were published yesterday, provide for State grants for public roads of £261.48 million in 1992.  This is an increase of almost 9 per cent on the already high level of State investment in roads, £240 million, in 1991.  It will ensure that sufficient Exchequer capital is provided to draw down all available EC aid.  The precise allocation between different types of grants remains to be determined, with the objective of ensuring that expenditure is directed to the areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I reiterate that the additional expenditure on roads provided for in the Supplementary Estimate is matched by equivalent savings elsewhere in the Environment Vote.  The overall expenditure of close on £600 million in the Vote will be in line with the budget estimate, a fact which reflects prudent management of the resources made available to my Department by this House. On this basis I can commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not oppose this <Col N="2296" /> Estimate.  We welcome any opportunity to improve our non-national roads, which are a source of some dissatisfaction among motorists, tourists and those depending on county roads to get around, people who have broken up their vehicles and have suffered a constant deterioration in county roads due to under-investment.</P>
      <P>The figures outlined by the Minister in relation to discretionary grants are correct, but we should not assume that the total amounts of money are increasing. Local authorities are being starved of resources within their own budgets. Because of the cutback in the rate support grant and other changes they are not able to find the necessary resources. While the Minister is giving with one hand, he is taking away with the other. The situation is deteriorating.</P>
      <P>As a member of two local authorities and one county council, I can fairly say that the average resurfacing cycle has moved from an acceptable 12 to 14 years to between 27 and 35 years for proper resurfacing.  If we continue on these lines, by the end of this period roads will have to be abandoned.</P>
      <P>The point has been made that the total amount for the Department is not increasing because of the utilisation of lottery funds.  Last Sunday I attended a function organised by the Irish Wheelchair Association who are dependent on the likes of national lottery funding.  The Minister is well aware that such voluntary organisations have had their funding decimated by the success of the national lottery.  Here we see mainline core funding being substituted by lottery funding. It is taking the bread out of the mouths of people in voluntary organisations.  As a general point of principle we are totally opposed to the substitution of lottery funding for mainline Exchequer funding to shore up a shabby, mismanaged budget.  That is not what the lottery was instituted for.  It was to help provide new services and facilities.  It is particularly shameful to see the disabled done down in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Referring to value for money, the Minister said a new approach might be <Col N="2297" /> required by local authorities and that he would be in touch with them about it in the new year.  If that is anything like the contact he had with health boards in relation to value for money, it will raise shudders.  Our party support a road audit. There is a variation between county councils as regards value for money.  A unit in the Minister's Department or the National Roads Authority should examine this question and pursue it on the basis of getting uniformity of costings for each local authority in respect of road surfacing, restrengthening and so on. Competitive costings should be provided to the Department on an annual basis as part of a road audit and there should be a check-up every two years.  There must be a performance element in it.  At present local authorities and county councils do not know what is happening in the jurisdiction of other councils and what type of value for money they are obtaining.  Only the Department can perform that role.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the 1991 roads programmes as it relates to national roads. On 6 March, the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Flynn, outlined a very detailed list of projects which would be included in the operational programme for this year. However, it can now be seen that the element in regard to new starts will not be honoured and no work will take place on the Northern Cross route linking the N1 and the N3, that is, the western tollbridge to the airport, no work will take place on the Portlaoise by-pass and no work will take place on the Kilpeddar-Glen o' the Downs route.  In the run up to the local elections the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, repeatedly gave solemn assurances both inside and outside this House that work would commence on all these projects. This will not now be the case.  The Minister's predecessor owes this House, and, in particular me, an apology.  The Construction Industry Federation and the Association of National Road Users know only too well what is happening.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to non-national roads. As the Minister is aware, the problem <Col N="2298" /> has got so severe that pothole candidates are being elected to public office.  Such is their state of derision that county roads have now become an issue on which parties are based.  Of course, this is no reflection on the members of Cavan or Monaghan County Councils; it is a reflection on the Government and their failure since 1987 to provide adequate resources.  The chickens are now simply coming home to roost.  I understand that &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; held a pothole competition.  The show was inundated with phone calls from people throughout the country saying the potholes in their area were the worst.  This has gone beyond a joke.  Legal claims are now being made against local authorities and, as we have heard, litigation liability insurance is becoming a major problem for them.</P>
    <P>We have a total road network of approximately 57,000 miles, of which approximately 3,000 miles are non-national roads.  The Government need to allocate adequate resources for the upkeep of these roads.  This needs to be put in the proper context.  The present funding system is not working and local authorities are not able to meet the demands.  If the Minister did a trawl of the number of local authority outdoor staff working on roads now and ten years ago he would see that the number would be substantially reduced, even though the mileage with which they have to deal has probably increased.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the facts.  They are quite clear cut.  Nobody has a better case than the road user for State support.  The Department of Finance have advised me that the total amount received by way of motor taxation, VAT, excise duties, duties on fuel, etc. was £1,061 million in 1988, £1,221 in 1989 and £1,280 million in 1990.  Put simply, this amounts to £3.5 million per day for every day of the year. That is a lot of money.  The Exchequer is getting a good deal from the motorist. That is the penalty people who drive a vehicle in this country have to pay.  I strongly believe that we need to reorganise the financing of local authority roads.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2299" /> If the Minister added up the moneys for non-national roads outlined in this Supplementary Estimate they would amount to approximately £131 million. Approximately £80 million will be given in discretionary grants and local authorities will put in approximately £50 million.  This comes to a total of £130 million for the maintenance and upgrading of non-national roads.  Instead of depending on the road grants system the proceeds from motor taxation &mdash; this would be progressive because there is a higher rate of tax for bigger cars &mdash; should be put into a fund which would be used for the maintenance of non-national roads.  In this way the amount of motor taxation could be increased or reduced in accordance with the national requirement to maintain roads.  I want to make it clear that local authorities would have access to this fund on the basis of the road mileage in their area.  I understand the proceeds from motor taxation in 1991 will amount to £161 million.  This additional £30 million would go a long way towards resolving the problem of potholes.  Most of this money could be allocated to local authorities on the basis of mileage and there could be an additional amount for counties Cavan and Clare, which I think have the worst roads in the country.  I believe this is the way to proceed.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the appointment of a Minister with responsibility for all transport matters.  The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications has no responsibility for ports or shipping.  That is the responsibility of the Department of the Marine.  This Supplementary Estimate deals with another vital transport issue from the point of view of our economy.  We need to take all these matters out of the various Departments and put them into a Department of Transport.  Similarly the National Roads Authority should be a national transport authority or a national roads and rail authority.  Until we tackle this problem on a piecemeal, <i>ad hoc</i> basis we will not succeed.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long the Minister <Col N="2300" /> will be in this Ministry &mdash; according to some political reports the lifetime of the Government is getting shorter by the day. It is fortunate that someone from the Cavan-Monaghan constituency has taken over as Minister for the Environment. The problem of non-national roads has gone way beyond a joke.  I believe this problem will only be resolved in the main by resource allocation, which in turn can only be achieved by a restructuring of the finances.  If the Minister has to deal with competing demands such as sanitary services, housing and so on the issue of non-national roads will simply get lost and only the EC element will be looked after.  Local authorities will be on the hind tit in trying to carry out their functions in this regard.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment to the House that he will make the upgrading of county roads a priority and provide motorists with a proper county road network.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the few minutes available to me I will be mindful of Standing Order 128.  However, since this is the last opportunity we will have to comment on the Department of the Environment Estimate for 1991 I want to make one point in relation to housing.  The Department of the Environment's performance in relation to housing in 1991 has been nothing short of a disgrace.  I described the programme for social housing published in February as a smokescreen to cover the disgraceful lack of a public house building programme.  The legislation to give legal effect to elements of that programme such as the shared equity has yet to see the light of day although it was promised to be the law of the land by now.  I want to mark the end of this term and the end of the financial year for the Department of the Environment with that cold disgraceful fact.  In so far as the primary responsibility for providing shelter is concerned, the Department of the Environment and the Minister have been clearly negligent and have performed abysmally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal specifically with the Supplementary Estimate before us. Obviously, like other Members of the <Col N="2301" /> House, I welcome any additional expenditure on county roads.  Those of us who are members of local authorities will know that scarcely a single meeting goes by without a litany of the condition of county roads coming from other members in various counties.</P>
    <P>Our national road system has been vastly improved, thank God; I suppose we should more properly thank the EC. Significant regional and structural moneys have been expended to upgrade our national roads and very significant progress has been made in relation to roads with which I am most familiar; for example, in the last six weeks or so the Bray-Shankill by-pass opened and has alleviated one of the worst bottle-necks from south County Dublin into Wicklow. There have also been a number of significant improvements on the N11, the N25 and many other important national link roads.</P>
    <P>The national roads amount to some 6 per cent of the total roads network and, for most people living in rural areas, the county and regional road system is of equal &mdash; if not of paramount &mdash; importance. It links them to their place of business, their local shopping centre and provides the lifeline for many isolated towns.  If the county road system is inadequate it simply cuts off some of our towns.  As Deputy Yates said, we are not saying anything new to the Minister or to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in relation to the counties which they represent.  In many counties the road system is facing collapse; I know that since the savage cutbacks of 1987 there have been very significant cutbacks in the domestic input to the roads system because, as was pointed out, county roads have been traditionally funded by a mix of contribution from the local authorities' resources &mdash; rates money, in other words &mdash; and central Exchequer top-up.  Unfortunately, there has been a savage cutback in the rate support grant since 1987.</P>
    <P>I produced figures to show the Minister a <i>de facto</i> cut of 50 per cent in the rate support grants over the past four years. I will produce the figures again if there is any need to verify them.  However, taking <Col N="2302" /> inflation into account they are correct. Every local authority are struggling to balance their books and to maintain some semblance of services to people.  Many important services have been cut, including refuse collections in rural areas, cutbacks in library and fire brigade services, in essential maintenance repairs and in development works.  When it comes to the crunch even services like the county roads must be pared, which has happened. I should like the Minister to produce statistics &mdash; it would be a good parliamentary question for the new session &mdash; regarding the level of own resources being put into the county road system, county by county, on a comparative basis, for the last five years.  In my own county the figures as a percentage of the total have been cut back.</P>
    <P>Many counties have tried to maintain a significant local input to the county road system to keep it operable.  In a way it seems that the more effort you make the more you are punished in relation to the support grant you get.  My county, I have said this in the House before, on the tabulated figures produced this year have the lowest level of support for county roads, pounds per kilometre, of any county in the country.  That certainly does not encourage us to continue putting our own resources into it.  I hope the Minister is aware of that and will do something about it; he should not punish counties which try to help themselves.  One would imagine that the Minister would try to assist those who are struggling, in the face of great adversity, to put some element of their own resources into county roads.</P>
    <P>To put the Estimate in context, we are talking about an additional £6 million which, of course, is welcome.  However, it is estimated that, to bring roads in my own county up to standard, would cost £8 million, £2 million per year over four years.  I am sure that figure could be repeated, probably increased, all over the country.  Therefore, the amount of money we are providing tonight would not bring one single county of the 26 up to acceptable standards, which is a dreadful reality.</P>
    <P>A number of elements must be <Col N="2303" /> addressed.  In the national roads plan the element of money to be allocated to non-national roads was signalled to decrease in 1992 and 1993.  If that is the case the current bad condition of roads will deteriorate even further.  A number of different practices must be carried out on our county roads; the one with which we are most familiar is surface dressing although the Department prefer to call it surface restoration.  The surface dressing cycle varies across the country, from 25 to 35 years, which means that if some county roads are black-topped this year they may be expected to get a fresh black-top in 35 years' time.  I do not believe that we can expect any road system, particularly as there is increased and growing heavy traffic, to withstand that level of neglect.  Most county roads now require extensive patching before we get on to surface dressing which gobbles up scarce resources as well.  An even greater resurfacing cycle in years will be evidenced next year unless we put proper resources into them.  The notion of surface strengthening is an extremely important element because it is no use putting black-top on roads which are disintegrating underneath.  It is an expensive process, costing between £20,000 and £30,000 per kilometre.  The reality is that very few kilometres can be strengthened in each county and we are only trying to hold together the fabric of our county roads system in the face of the grants and supports available to us either from our own rates resources or from central Government.</P>
    <P>Important work used to be carried out under the heading of special improvement works.  They included minor junctions, straightening of bends, clearing of ditches, installation of traffic lights, new footpaths and emergency repairs.  Most of these have taken a knock in recent years and the resources which were there, by collective agreement in most councils, to do important small works have now been put on the long finger and precious little important minor improvement works have been carried out.</P>
    <P>The total provision for county roads is <Col N="2304" /> inadequate.  We have said that there are political ramifications as a result; one is the emergence of single issue candidates. There are people seeking public office and focusing exclusively on the issue of county roads.  I am not sure that is good for democracy but it is a clear sign of public disquiet at the performance to date of the Government &mdash; and the previous Fianna Fáil administration &mdash; over the past years in relation to their neglect of county roads.  The only way to approach that will be to provide adequate funding. I should like to put a few questions to the Minister because I am a little confused. The Minister informs us that the net £6 million being sought is made up of savings. Perhaps he can indicate to us where those savings were made in his Department in precise terms?  Although he informs us in his script that the total net expenditure will be £598.482 million, which was the original adopted figure last year, the Estimate circulated states that the net total figure will be £604.482 million, including the net additional sums. Can the Minister explain?  It is probable that the £6 million of expenditure money is simply being absorbed from the national lottery into the Estimate.  If that is the case, where was the national lottery fund intended to go?  What funding has been sidelined to provide this money tonight?</P>
    <P>Lastly, in regard to this additional £6 million, can the Minister specify whether it is a top-up grant to local authorities in addition to the road funding already notified to them for 1991?  Can he specify which local authorities will receive the money and the amounts in each case.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I signal that the Labour Party will not oppose this net additional expenditure on roads, as they say, a locht a laghad.</P>

      <P>I would like to echo Deputy Howlin's first observation on the Supplementary Estimate when he referred to the biggest problem in the Environment brief at present, which is the appalling situation with regard to housing.  The Minister's predecessor was a master of public relations.  His greatest <Col N="2305" /> public relations achievement was the publication of the so-called plan for social housing which managed to convince many people in the general public that the Government intended to do something to tackle the serious housing problem that now exists.  Eleven months later that plan for social housing has been exposed as a fraud and a con on the people on the housing lists, particularly in the run up to the local elections in June.  The year 1992 will be one when we will see the social housing problem explode onto the Irish political stage.  The build up of frustration relating to housing lists going back to 1987, when the then Fianna Fáil Government effectively ended house building and the provision for social housing will eventually come home to roost next year.</P>
      <P>As we are now approaching the break, I would like to ask the Minister to make it his new year resolution to seriously address the social housing problem and to have the promised Housing Bill circulated to us without further delay.  I would ask him to give a commitment that he will apply more resources to tackle it than is apparent in the Estimates which were circulated to us this week which, as I read them, provide for nothing more than an as you were situation, essentially the same amount of money as in previous years.  There is no carry forward of the unspent amounts from the social housing plan.  That will have to be seriously tackled.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate before us concerns non-national roads.  It is probably a good time for us to look at that, particularly as we had the commencement of a debate in relation to national roads in the context of a Bill to establish a national roads authority.  That Bill will have the effect of making the national roads the cream of our road network and relegating the non-national roads to some kind of a subsidiary limbo situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be churlish not to welcome any additional resources for the improvement and maintenance of non-national roads and for that reason The Workers' <Col N="2306" /> Party will not be opposing the Supplementary Estimate before us.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his contribution that the traditional way of funding the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads has been through a combination of funding from the local authorities and special grants from his Department.  Previous speakers referred to the fact that there has been a decline in the resources which have been available through the local authorities over the past number of years.  This is reflected in the reduction of outdoor staff in local authorities &mdash; employees are not there any more to do the normal ordinary maintenance work which is so necessary to keep roads in shape.  Neither are the resources available in some local authorities to provide materials for staff when they go out to do their work.</P>
    <P>Shakespeare stated that the Devil can quote scripture for his purpose and in this case the Minister is quoting statistics for his purpose.  He is conveying an impression in his script that there are percentage increases here, there and everywhere for roads.  I am afraid the evidence of this largesse is not to be seen on our roads.  As we all know, the physical condition of the non-national roads is deteriorating to the point where it is now one of the standing national jokes.  We are rapidly becoming a country of potholed boreens.  Road surfaces are disintegrating, the road structure is disintegrating, roads which were built initially for very minimal traffic, which were no more than tarred sheep tracks, are now expected to take much heavier traffic without significant improvement. In many suburban areas of the large urban conurbations roads which were originally country laneways are now meant to serve large urban areas with all of the traffic now generated.</P>
    <P>We are now coming into the pothole season.  What happens in the pothole season is that the road surface breaks in frosty weather and is then washed away by the showers of rain that follow.  Last year, because local authorities did not have the resources to continue to repair <Col N="2307" /> those potholes, they were left unrepaired, as a matter of deliberate policy, until the weather improved.  There was a view in local authorities that there was no point in repairing a pothole in January because it would have to be repaired again in March.  A deliberate policy was adopted that potholes would simply be left unrepaired.  The Minister's predecessor capitalised on it last year.  In the spring he summoned before him the county engineers and made great public play of the fact that he was instructing them to address the pothole problem, when both he and they knew very well that they would repair the potholes in any case.  It was a matter of coincidence that his public instruction to them coincided with the onset of the local elections. We had this marvellous public relations exercise where the county engineers were summoned before the Minister and told to repair the potholes. When it came to the local elections and the fine weather the potholes were repaired.  It would appear that they did not do so successfully or that the public relations exercise did not have as much impact in the Minister's own constituency as it would appear to have had in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of road improvements.  I would echo Deputy Howlin's question as to where the £6 million is going.  It was not clear from the Minister's contribution.  The Minister conveyed in general terms that it was going to certain local authorities in the form of additional grants.  When replying, will the Minister identify the local authorities who will benefit from this and the projects and road improvements to which this extra £6 million will be applied?  I do not know if it is the case in relation to my two colleagues, but as a member of two local authorities I do not see any evidence of additional resources being made available.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I would draw the Minister's attention to three roads in my constituency for which the Dún Laoghaire Corporation have applied to the Department for funding road improvements <Col N="2308" /> over the past couple of years.  Wyattville Road has been identified as being the worst road in the local authority area. Wyattville Road, Barnhill Road and Ballinclea Road were formerly rural roads serving small populations but they now have to serve large populations and more traffic due to a large amount of development. Those roads are simply withering away.  We have made repeated calls to the Minister and his predecessor to provide resources to enable us to go ahead with improvement schemes on these roads.  If my colleague can forgive me for being slightly parochial, I would like the Minister to address this point when he is replying to the debate and to give us some indication that perhaps in 1992 we might be given the resources to carry out the improvement works on these roads.</P>
    <P>An area which has been neglected is road safety, particularly the safety of pedestrians. The conditions of footpaths, or the absence of footpaths in many areas, is exposing many people to road injury, particularly the elderly, the disabled and children.  In many cases it is preventing citizens from moving about freely.  The condition of footpaths is now so bad in many areas that it is simply not safe to walk on them.  It is certainly not safe to use them at night, especially if a poor footpath is combined with inadequate lighting.  This effectively means that people, particularly elderly people, cannot move about with freedom.  I am sure every Member of the House is familiar with footpaths with two inch gaps in them.  This is positively dangerous. Because of the reduction in funding the local authorities have not been in a position to repair footpaths, to provide traffic lights or to take other road safety measures.  This is something to which the Minister might address himself.  Perhaps the time has come for him to provide special grants or to earmark assistance for local authorities to improve footpaths and to provide for pedestrian safety.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the rate of casualties on our roads, many casualties are related to the condition of roadways.  In the past number of years there has been an average of 500 people a year killed on our <Col N="2309" /> roads and 10,000 people a year have been injured &mdash; four times the rate of casualties in Northern Ireland.  Much of this is due to the appalling condition of the roads. We need to pay a great deal of attention to this.  When replying, I would like the Minister to identify where the £6 million is to go and perhaps he would circulate to Members of the House a list of projects which are being funded from this money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in his portfolio.  I am sure the Minister will concede that he has a daunting challenge ahead of him.</P>
      <P>Many of the previous speakers dealt with many of the points I would make. As a member of county council for the last six years, it would be remiss of me if I did not point out some of the difficulties and frustrations which county councils are experiencing.  The greatest complaint in any county relates to the condition of the roads, particularly the county roads. One would question whether or not we are even getting value for money.  Many of the roadworks undertaken are fire fighting exercises &mdash; for instance, what is called tar patching.  Engineering staff would point out that quite often filling in potholes with a few shovelfulls of filling is not very successful because when it rains the filling is washed away.  I often wonder about the economics of that and whether or not it is a worthwhile exercise at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past few years most county councils have not got around to addressing the problem of defective footpaths in most towns.  That is unfortunate because it leads to a lot of extra public liability claims for councils.  One of the most progressive steps taken in recent times has been to use the social employment scheme to maintain footpaths in towns and villages.  I hope that county councils will be able to continue to use social employment schemes in future as it is possibly the only solution to the problem unless more local authority finance is provided for this work.  We need to do a <Col N="2310" /> lot more work in the areas of footpaths because, as Deputy Gilmore pointed out, many footpaths are a hazard to old people, especially in the winter.</P>
    <P>Housing is best described as the waiting game, because people who apply for local authority housing have to wait and wait.  This has happened because there has been a dramatic cutback in local authority housing over the last few years.  The difficult situation was possibly compounded by the withdrawal of the successful reconstruction grants which were available and which were used by many people, particularly younger people, who wished to house themselves.  They took over old, often derelict buildings and upgraded them with a certain amount of expenditure topped up by the grant.  This took pressure off the local authority. That mechanism is no longer available.</P>
    <P>In February we had a sham marketing exercise in relation to the social plan for housing in which there were supposed to be many imaginative proposals to alleviate some of the housing problems. Although the social plan seemed imaginative and appeared in a nice glossy brochure, with booklets being circulated by council offices, at this stage it seems to have been a bit of a smokescreen in order to divert attention from the housing problem. It is ironic for a Minister at the end of the year to state that two transactions have been completed in relation to this whole exercise.  I hope the Minister will instruct county councils to proceed with great haste to implement most aspects of what is incorporated in that social plan for housing, because we have a critical housing problem which we will have to address sooner or later.  There are many frustrated people who are relying on the local authorities for housing and there is very little incentive for them to try to house themselves.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Deputies who have contributed to this debate.  In the <Col N="2311" /> short space of time available to me I will try to respond to a number of the comments which have been made.  The condition of our roads, in particular our non-national roads, impacts daily on everybody who uses them, be it on foot, on a bicycle or in a motor vehicle.  As I said in my opening contribution to this debate, the Government are conscious of the state of non-national roads which is evident from their response during the past three years.</P>
      <P>In the years 1989-91 a sum of £220 million was spent as against a figure of £85 million during the preceding three year period.  In 1986, before we entered Government, £23 million was spent while £68 million has been spent this year.  This represents an increase of 196 per cent over that five year period.</P>
      <P>It is important that I remind Deputies that responsibility for non-national roads rests with the local authorities who receive a State road grant, which includes the block grant, the road strengthening grant and, sometimes, a special improvements grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the eight major road schemes scheduled to begin, under the national primary road network building programme, in the current year. Deputy Howlin gave due recognition to the Minister and the Government for the work which has been done in improving our roads.  The Deputy referred specifically to the Shankill by-pass.  Work was due to begin on the Dunleer by-pass, the Sweep in Waterford, the Clonee by-pass, the Lucan-Kilcock by-pass, the Mullingar by-pass, the Portlaoise by-pass, phase 1 of the Bray-Shankill road to the Glen of the Downs and the northern cross route in Dublin.  Construction is under way at Dunleer, the Sweep, Clonee, Portlaoise and on phase 1 of the Bray-Shankill road to the Glen of the Downs.  The Department have approved the acceptance of the tenders for the Mullingar by-pass and for the first of the two main contracts for the Lucan-Kilcock project.  The local authorities involved are now finalising the arrangements to get the contractors <Col N="2312" /> involved on site.  A delay was encountered in the case of the northern cross route but I now expect tenders to be invited for the first main contract early in the New Year.  I am satisfied that reasonable progress has been made on these schemes.  I have already referred to the fact that there will be a substantial increase in the funding that will be available in 1992.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates suggested that motor tax receipts should be used in maintaining non-national roads.  However, he did not say how the Exchequer could make up the difference of £30 million which he suggested should be spent on our non-national roads.  As Deputies realise, the Exchequer would have to make up this difference by way of extra taxation, borrowing or cuts in services.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the local authorities are under-funded.  I should point out that local authority current spending is roughly £1,120 million, £503 million of which is met by the Exchequer by way of grants, including the rates support grant.  The balance is made up by way of commercial rates &mdash; £257 million approximately and other local income &mdash; £360 million approximately. There is a limit to the State grants available to local authorities.  A balance has to be struck between what the local authorities need and what the country as a whole can afford.</P>
    <P>The extra £6 million has already been allocated to the local authorities.  In response to Deputy Howlin, I should say that there will not be any supplementary allocation this year over and above that £6 million.</P>

      <P>In relation to the block grant for improvement and maintenance works, Wexford County Council received exactly the same amount, per kilometre, for non-national roads as every other county, except Dublin where special circumstances exist.  However, County Wexford did not receive funds to meet the cost of flood damage to roads as no abnormal damage arose under that heading.

      <P>The Deputy's calculation must have been based on the gross amount of discretionary grants, including supplementary grants, and the cost of flood damage.  This is not a fair comparison.  Deputy Howlin also referred to the net saving.  As I explained at the outset this Supplementary Estimate is required for technical reasons. The saving arises as a result of expenditure being less than anticipated on <Col N="2314" /> amenity and recreational facilities and on the library service.  The funds for these services not spent in the current year will be provided next year.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Carysfort College: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy O'Shea on Tuesday, 17 December 1991:</P>
    <P>That Dáil éireann condemns the failure of the Taoiseach to provide full and candid information in relation to the purchase of Carysfort College by UCD, a transaction which secured a profit of £1.5 million for a private individual at the expense of the taxpayer; in particular, Dáil éireann condemns the Taoiseach for:</P>
    <P>failing to ensure an &ldquo;arm's length&rdquo; and independent position in relation to his part in the transaction, particularly having regard to his relationship with the vendor;</P>
    <P>holding secret meetings with key persons involved in the transactions; <Col N="2317" /> failing to ensure that the transaction was accompanied by proper independent valuations;</P>
    <P>failing to follow proper procedures in relation to the provisions of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971;</P>
    <P>failing to ensure that proper Cabinet procedures were followed in respect of the transaction;</P>
    <P>failing to ensure that the reservations of the Department of Finance were properly addressed in Cabinet;</P>
    <P>agreeing in an <i>ultra vires</i> manner to an on-going commitment of public funds to the detriment of students attending colleges in the Higher Education Authority sector;</P>
    <P>demands that the Taoiseach clarify the contradictions inherent in his position, and finally make a frank statement on his role and influence in the transaction.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. a1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>Dáil éireann notes that the acquisition by UCD of the Carysfort College premises and 20 acres for development as its Graduate School of Business has the following advantages:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the development of such a business school is essential for educational purposes and the efficient management of Irish business in the future,</P>
    <P>&mdash; the development at Carysfort will provide places for 600-900 graduate students and will release accomodation at Belfield,</P>
    <P>&mdash; the decision by UCD represents a welcome response to the widespread concern, that Carysfort and its lands should continue to be used for educational purposes; <Col N="2318" /> decides that further consideration of this matter by Dáil éireann must await the outcome of the examination being made by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

      <P>As I was saying last evening this is not the Fianna Fáil Party of de Valera, Ryan, Childers, MacEntee and Lemass.  The culture of the party has become contaminated by the ingrained acceptance of wheeling and dealing, the nod, the nudge and the wink.  This is Deputy Haughey's Fianna Fáil Party, but it is also that of the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Rourke.  Too many have lived with this for far too long.</P>
      <P>The Carysfort scandal will not go away. It is extraordinary what can be done for a friend in need and the lengths one will go to secure public moneys, in some cases, dispensing with the safeguards in the process.  We established a task force to try to catch people who do nixers and draw the dole at the same time.  Old age pensioners who have given a life time of service to the country are awarded an increase of £1.50 which is being deferred until July.  The Garda Síochána who have to deal with terror on the streets of this city nightly, the nurses who have the toughest profession of all, and the teachers are all being told that they cannot have their wage increases, because the public finances cannot afford them.  Yet, we can afford to pay £10 million at the drop of a hat to rescue a friend of Fianna Fáil and in the process consign to the rubbish bin the time honoured procedures, safeguards rules and regulations for the spending of public money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There used to be a principle in the Civil Service that if a junior civil servant stamped an envelope upside down, the Minister was responsible for it to the Dáil.  It is quite obvious there is no ministerial responsibility now to the Dáil. and that misleading the Dáil is quite an acceptable principle of the Government. It is quite obvious that democracy, which <Col N="2319" /> ultimately is answerability and accountability to this House, no longer exists. Thankfully, at least, we still have the Constitution.  I believe, however, that all the present scandals are challenges to the system and that the various inquiries and tribunals are a trial as to whether one can get away with doing it.  I shudder to think of the consequences if the system does not stand up to the test.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts have done a good job so far within the limits imposed on them.  However, it is quite clear there is a conflict of evidence between the bulk of that put before the committee by the reputable officials and numerous important questions of public accountability remain to be answered. The only way this will happen is that the Taoiseach, and the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, and the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, come before the Committee of Public Accounts and tell the truth once and for all.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael support the Labour Party motion, but we believe our amendment is essential if we are to bring this sordid matter to finality.  The Progressive Democrats entered Government on the basis that they would act as a watchdog in the public interest.  Where was the watchdog on this occasion?  Their support of the Government's amendment cannot be commended.  To laud the additional graduate places being provided in Carysfort is to miss the point.  If the development on campus in Belfield had been allowed to go ahead, then the Dr. Smurfit business graduate school would have provided, without any charge to the taxpayer, 600 additional places.  If Mr. Harris had not been relieved of Carysfort College, he would have gone ahead with his plans for a high tech institution which would be provided from private resources and would have provided 600 additional places.  A vote for the Government amendment by the Progressive Democrats is a vote for corruption.  It gives me great pleasure, therefore, to thank the Labour Party sincerely for <Col N="2320" /> accepting our amendment to the motion because it strengthens it and gives it teeth.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Higgins pointed out, we are debating the purchase of Carysfort College despite the fact that the Committee of Public Accounts is also dealing with the issue.  I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and we are examining this issue and calling witnesses to appear before us. The purpose of this is to get a clear, concise picture of the dealings of the transfer of Carysfort College.  We do not engage in political attacks, as we have heard Deputy Higgins do in the past few minutes.  Should the public analyse his contribution of the past few minutes they would get a very good idea from his tone what has been attempted here in the past few months: character assassinations and attempts being made to link anything at all to certain Ministers, with the workings of Government being forgotten totally.  I hope the Committee of Public Accounts examination will be more fruitful than this muck-raking.  I have been told it was reported that the public have asked why Members do not get on with the business of legislation and why they are wasting so much time with this carry-on.  In fact last night Deputy Higgins listed and moved a number of various time wasting tactics which they had indulged in and that only four Bills went through the House, since 16 October 1991.  We have engaged in a great deal of wasting time. We have lost a half hour each morning this week and on several other mornings, on useless activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have his chance later on.  This is exactly the type of tactic I am describing.  Indeed, these people would lecture us about the <Col N="2321" /> positive use of it, but time wasting can be laid squarely at the feet of the Opposition. Even if we are debating this during Private Members' time, the time could be spent in a far more productive fashion, as we have seen on one or two occasions in the past.  Indeed, it is they, the Opposition, who are arguing in favour of committee system for dealing with Bills.  We would not waste time on non-legislative matters, if they were dealt with by a cross-party committee system.  We all agree with that but what are they doing with the existing committees?  I am told that the Committee of Public Accounts is the major committee but at the same time as the committee are examining a proposal the members now drag it into the Chamber. Is that the way the committee system is going to work in the future?  I question the Opposition's commitment to the committee system, particularlty in the context of the present debate where it is applicable.  There is no point in duplication. They will certainly not gain any Dáil time.  The suggestion is pure hypocrisy.</P>
      <P>I have had the opportunity to study the issue of Carysfort.  Perhaps I would not before have had much interest in the issue, even though I had heard it raised in the House many times by Deputy Gilmore and other Deputies who have insisted that Carysfort should be kept for educational purposes and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that I have studied the matter I understand that the real scandal in relation to Carysfort College was the unplanned closing down of the college in 1986.  There was no consultation with trade unions or anyone else about that closure.  That stupid, unprepared closure cost the State an enormous amount of money.  That is clearly recorded.  It is also known that the Labour Party and Fine Gael carried out the closure, resulting in a loss of State funding and other losses.  As I mentioned last week, there were a few St. Pauls involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tried to analyse the reasons for <Col N="2322" /> the developments of the past few weeks. One reason that I came up with for the posturing and the manure raking that is going on is that Carysfort has turned out to be a very successful project from the educationalist point of view.  The bottom line is that it has been very successful.  Not alone has there been established what is forecast to be a top-class business school but 600 extra third level positions have also been created.  Deputy Higgins, who is supposed to be an Education spokesman, said that those factors were not of importance and should not be discussed in the debate on Carysfort.  I wonder why not.</P>
    <P>The present success story must be contrasted with the position pertaining in 1985 and 1986.  One must contrast the approach of two different Administrations, two different Governments and two different Ministers, as has been clearly pointed out to us.  The contrast is between a Government that held discussion with no one and decided: &ldquo;Let us go in, close it up, knock it down and to hell with the run-on consequences to staff and anyone else&rdquo; and the present Government, which has presided over the success story now apparent at Carysfort.</P>
    <P>The initial issue raised, which has now been forgotten, was value for money. Every competent witness to come before the Committee of Public Accounts and everyone else going public has agreed that the project at Carysfort is extremely good value for money.  In the educational area, it is probably the best value for money ever.  The attack is shifted &mdash; the project is successful, the business is going and there are an extra 60 places.</P>
    <P>In relation to the contrast between the different Administrations and different individuals, I studied the approach of the Taoiseach of 1985 and that of the present Taoiseach.  There are similarities in the way in which they behaved towards similar projects.  There are also contrasts in that the former Taoiseach went on television lecturing people about the way in which things should be done, apparently not having done them that way himself. One thing that they had in common and <Col N="2323" /> for different reasons &mdash; although possibly they both graduated from the college &mdash; was very obvious interest in UCD and its betterment.  I know that Professor Dooge and others were involved in UCD in 1985.  Bearing in mind that both Taoiseachs had a certain knowledge of the affairs of UCD, the Labour Party wish to condemn the Taoiseach for not maintaining what they described as an &ldquo;arm's length position&rdquo; in relation to Carysfort and the desire of Deputy Higgins to drag the Taoiseach before the Committee of Public Accounts because of his involvement in ensuring the completion of the project, the House must examine precedent. We should examine the way in which the Labour/Fine Gael Coalition Government of 1985 and the way in which the present Progressive Democrat/Fianna Fáil Coalition Government behaved in what really amount to similar situations.  Probably we should also explain the way in which they carried on to the public, because the public are a little confused at this stage.</P>
    <P>I did not actually see the broadcast of the lecture about hand-delivered memos but I mention it because the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts opened by describing the way in which a very eminent person, a former Taoiseach, had stated that in Government memos to Ministers should be hand delivered. When the subject was mentioned it raised a bit of a laugh.  It was thought of as a practice that went on in the 1920s and thereabouts but has not been used very often since.</P>
    <P>There are many other similarities also. Last night in the House some Deputies mentioned the 1985 transfer of the School of Engineering to UCD.  That issue does not seem to have attracted the attention of the news media &mdash; why not I do not know.  I want to put on the record similarities between the two incidents.  Both were involved with UCD, both concerned third level or more senior educational facilities and controversy surrounded both transactions.  In fact, Deputy Higgins used the word &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; in relation to the Carysfort transaction. <Col N="2324" /> Also common to both transfers was the non-involvement of the Higher Education Authority.  The role of the Higher Education Authority needs to be examined. There is also the allegation that proper Cabinet procedures were not followed in the Carysfort transaction, and that allegation is made by individuals who were big players with prominent roles in 1985.</P>

      <P>Possibly the Deputy was there himself, I am not sure.  I shall not lay the blame for anything that I cannot pin on the Deputy.</P>
      <P>A suggestion has been made that in 1985 the Department of Finance had reservations that were not addressed.  We are told that the same position applies now.  There is also the suggestion that no proper valuation was carried out.</P>
      <P>The issue of UCD involvement is straightforward.  Both Taoiseachs had a great deal of interest.  I was aware of that interest and I asked at the committee whether in 1985 Deputy Garrett FitzGerald had taken an interest in the transfer to UCD because it seems that the present Taoiseach is being indicted for taking an interest and not maintaining an arm's length position.</P>
      <P>One of the more senior witnesses, a person who would have been acquainted with both cases, was asked whether Deputy FitzGerald, the Taoiseach of the day, was interested in the negotiations. The answer given was:</P>
      <P>One thing that you can be absolutely certain of is that the Taoiseach of the day was extremely interested, extremely concerned and extremely involved in the question of the move of the Engineering School.</P>
      <P>He also said:</P>
      <P>I can assure you categorically that the Taoiseach of the day was very well involved and acquainted with that particular project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make those quotations in an attempt to <Col N="2325" /> be fair to everyone.  I believe that in 1985 the incident referred to constituted an almost daily inquiry, with consultations with Ministers and other about what was happening.</P>
    <P>I consider that a Taoiseach should make sure that as many major State projects as possible do move along.  I know that is the responsibility of a particular Minister, but to a large extent the Taoiseach is the overall controller and should co-ordinate.  The Taoiseach should show an interest in such projects. I have just tried to contrast the two incidents. Deputy Higgins has made a charge, but did anyone challenge Deputy FitzGerald in 1985?</P>
    <P>In relation to the illegality of the non-involvement of the Higher Education Authority, Deputy Higgins knows well that a legal judgment was previously given down by Judge Declan Costello. The Minister may in fact act independently. That issue has been taken to court, challenged and dealth with, and Deputy Higgins is well aware of that judgment.  Even if the position were not so, the Chairman of the Higher Education Authority was actually the person who chaired the committee dealing with Carysfort College to determine its future role and what could be done.  The chairman of the Higher Education Authority was on that committee since 1987.  To say that the Higher Education Authority had no involvement is, at the minimum, stretching the truth and is an attempt to again rake up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>If that issue is taken out a little there is also a question about finance.  It has been explained to us that it is when the direct budget of the Higher Education Authority is affected that they become operative.  In other words, if one wanted to exclude them from a Supplementary Estimate it could be done, as was done in this case.  But in 1985 the position was that they were not asked anything whatsoever about it and £20 million of their operating moneys was eaten up.  If it is now illegal to introduce <Col N="2326" /> a Supplementary Estimate to top up their budget &mdash; and we are contending they should have been included in discussions and so on &mdash; what about 1985 when their budget was milked for three years to the tune of £20 million?  Nobody said boo.  It was a great idea.  Let us get additional space for TDs and everybody else. Deputy Dr. FitzGerald is exempt from any responsibility, badness or anything else &mdash; a nice man.</P>
      <P>One cannot blame the public for being confused when they witness that kind of reaction to two different but in many ways similar sets of circumstances.  If my information is correct &mdash; I cannot really prove this &mdash; but again from the transcript of the hearing of the Committee of Public Accounts it is confirmed that not alone were there no hand delivered memoranda &mdash; hand-delivered memoranda were what Deputy Dr. FitzGerald referred to when he lectured us about what should be done &mdash; but there were no memoranda at all, none.  Therefore, there is difficulty with that in another part of the Labour Party amendment.  Deputy Jim Higgins may be privy to information I have not and may argue that point.</P>
      <P>If we are going to abuse or misuse the Committee of Public Accounts, I, for one, will be demanding that we revert to 1985 and examine what happened in 1973.  I should like to pay tribute to the chairman of that committee, who happens to be a colleague of Deputy Jim Higgins, who in my experience has been totally impartial in conducting the business of that committee in a fair, positive and productive manner.  But if Deputy Higgins thinks he can rake up that committee he might get more than he bargains for.  I do not believe their chairman will allow himself to be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very first thing the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts did was to invite members of the committee to visit Carysfort College.  Every single person to whom I spoke on that occasion was full of praise for the project, contending it constituted great value for money, was a great project and so on. Everybody was happy after that visit. There has been a follow-up to that visit <Col N="2327" /> with Dr. Masterson.  Many other people who are in a position to know whether or not this project constitutes value for money confirmed &mdash; again much to the disappointment of some Members of this House &mdash; that it constituted great value for money.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Higgins, or perhaps it was Deputy O'Shea, told us that UCD would have got a business school in Roebuck Castle for half the price, they would have got it so much cheaper, that they had read something to that effect.  We were told that what they would have obtained was a business school without a lecture theatre, for which they had no money, and without the top floor of the building.  What they would have had was a mickey mouse, mini business school.  If that is what those Members want in the educational sense, so be it.  That is their standard.</P>
    <P>Any fair-minded person reading the 200 pages of the transcript of the hearings of the Committee of Public Accounts must agree that the project constituted excellent value for money, that the Taoiseach, displaying the enthusiastic approach to the project he did, interfered no more, and possibly somewhat less, than did Deputy Dr. FitzGerald back in 1986.</P>
    <P>We should discontinue this practice of wasting the time of this House, whether in Private Members' Time or any other. Let us not play with semantics.  It is a waste of the time of this House which the public will not tolerate.  Rather we should permit the Committee of Public Accounts to get on with their task of looking after taxpayers money.  I would appeal to Deputy Higgins to stop playing games with the Committee of Public Accounts but rather let their members, of whom there are a number present, get on with their task, because they are quite capable of handling this issue.</P>

      <P>I support amendment No, a1. in the name of the Government Chief Whip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2328" /> In 1986 the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition Government decided to close Carysfort College without prior notice to or any consultation with the staff or students.  In itself that thoughtless, cavalier behaviour was unacceptable.  Added to that, it has also become clear that the then Coalition Government had no idea how that college could be converted to alternative usage.  The decision to close Carysfort College was typical of the mismanagement for which that Coalition Government became notorious.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach indicated last evening, Fianna Fáil sought to reverse that decision and to formulate a policy of ensuring that Carysfort College was kept in educational usage.  I am glad that UCD were not in a position to become involved, all the more so since UCD have been developing a number of special schools in recent years.  In these times, especially for what is our largest university, it makes sense that UCD should have a business school.  It makes educational sense and national sense.  It also makes sense to have such a school located in a self-contained unit that is both fully serviced and accessible to the main campus.</P>
    <P>I visited Carysfort College recently with other members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  By any standard it is a fine complex, with plenty of space and potential for future development.  When the Committee of Public Accounts meets tomorrow I and my colleagues will be seeking a full investigation by that committee of the decision to spend over £20 million on the Engineering School at UCD by Fine Gael/Labour Coalition Government in the light of the Taoiseach's revelations last evening.  There are several aspects of the matter that merit investigation.  First, why was so much public money spent on a single project in one university at a time of serious shortage of funds for higher education? Why was it given the fast track treatment when practically everything else in education had to wait?  Second, why, given its size, did the project never go to Cabinet when smaller third level projects, such as the establishment of the <Col N="2329" /> new RTCs, were all required to do so? Third, why were the Higher Education Authority by-passed, not consulted, when they had to provide the funds out of their annual capital allocation?  This is quite unlike the Carysfort Graduate Business School where additional funds were provided for the purpose on a once-off basis.</P>
    <P>There are potentially far more serious questions of public accountability in relation to the approval of that project than there are in relation to Carysfort. Indeed the whole of the Carysfort saga was aptly described by a senior trade union leader, Mr. Phil Flynn, last week when he said it was much ado about nothing.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt anybody on the Opposition benches and would expect that the same facility would be afforded me.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael have made no attempt to explain why their attitude to Carysfort is dramatically opposed to that of the Fine Gael spokesperson on Education 12 months ago.  The Opposition have failed utterly to substantiate accusations of political scandal.  To call on the Taoiseach to resign as he left for the Maastricht Summit, as did the Labour Party, was a gratuitous stab in the back to our nation's representative at that important Summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation in congratulating the Government and the Taoiseach on ensuring that Carysfort College is retained for educational use and developed as the UCD Business School with a capacity for 2,200 university places.  Roebuck Castle, the alternative site, would have cost £1,500 per square metre in contrast to £300 per square metre at Carysfort.  In addition, Carysfort is a much larger building comprising several areas newly built and added within the past 20 years or so.  Roebuck is not in that league.  When all is said and done, even after refurbishment, Roebuck could provide only 20 per cent of the places that Carysfort can provide.  Whatever the Opposition would have us believe, the <Col N="2330" /> facts indicate that the development of Carysfort by UCD makes sound financial sense and the Government were correct to support the project on that basis, leaving aside educational considerations and the desirability of increasing third level places.</P>
    <P>It will be some years before Carysfort can achieve the high status which I know awaits it, but even during its first year it has already attracted 633 students.  The courses provided are of an exceptionally high quality and are fundamentally important to the development of business acumen.  Carysfort offers courses leading to qualifications such as master of business studies, master of economic science and master of accountancy.  It also offers graduate diplomas in business studies. All these are vital to the continued expansion of Irish business acumen.</P>
    <P>The prospectus for the master of businesss administration course outlines the thinking behind the setting up of this school.  The mission of the graduate school of business is &ldquo;to be among the leaders of Europe in business education by providing a quality learning and research environment directed to students and the business community&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>During this debate the Labour Party have done immense damage to the prospect of making this one of the finest institutions in the State.  I feel very aggrieved that they have put naked political ambition before the well-being of our young people.  We need graduates who will be innovative and set up the projects that will lead to job creation.  We could have another Harvard, but the Labour Party have undermined the potential of this school.  I hope the general public and those involved in business will ignore the naked political ambition of the Labour Party which I very much regret.</P>
    <P>Our universities should offer specific courses to provide graduates with a well-rounded knowledge and understanding of management and business theories, practices and disciplines.  They must provide opportunities for students who want to take on management responsibilities in business and industry.  Courses should also be designed to assist graduates to <Col N="2331" /> make the transition from university to professional work in the market place, to move from the academic setting to acquire the professional skills and experience necessary to perform successfully in the woRk environment.  That is exactly what we have at the graduate business school in the Carysfort complex.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Labour Party in the interests of the vast numbers of unemployed to give this college a boost and to start it off on the right footing by withdrawing this motion and wishing those involved in the business school success in he future.</P>

      <P>Last night the Taoiseach described the debate on Carysfort as part of a campaign of vilification against him. As has now become his custom, he fought back by making counter-allegations against the Opposition and by questioning our motives.  The tactic seems to be that if you muddy the water enough you cannot see the shark and that tactic has been in evidence again tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated that Fine Gael and The Workers' Party had enthusiastically supported the Government decision to buy Carysfort and that we had now taken a politically opportunist U-turn. I reject this completely.  The Workers' Party position on Carysfort has been absolutely consistent.  When the Estimate for the purchase of Carysfort was presented to this House exactly 12 months ago, I welcomed the decision by the State to purchase it.  I welcomed its use by UCD as an educational facility and the consequential release of additional student places in UCD.  I still hold that view because I have always believed and argued that Carysfort should be kept in education.  A point the Taoiseach has chosen to ignore is that I also questioned why the State had not purchased Carysfort when it first came on the market 18 <Col N="2332" /> months previously, as I had been pressing them to do.  On 18 December last year in this House I stated: &ldquo;Had that opportunity been availed of the State would have got better value for money than it is now getting for £10 million&rdquo;.  Nothing could be clearer.  I pointed out that because of negligence by the Department of Education the State was paying £10 million to buy back a facility which had been provided by taxpayers' money in the first place.  Finally I queried the quasi-private nature of the education for which the college was to be used, a concern I still have and to which I will return.</P>
    <P>From an educational point of view there is no dispute about the desirability of keeping Carysfort in educational use and of allowing UCD to use its facilities. I have never questioned that and it is disingenuous of the Taoiseach and the former Minister for Education to continually make the educational case when the questions being addressed to them concern the political and business aspects of the affair.  We are having this debate not because Carysfort was bought for UCD but because of what we now know of the political and business history of the Carysfort purchase.  It does not hang credibly together.</P>
    <P>We now know that the State paid more for Carysfort than it needed to.  We know that initiative for UCD to purchase Carysfort came from the former Minister for Education and not from UCD, as both she and the Taoiseach previously claimed.  We know that UCD were less than enthusiastic about Carysfort and were made an offer they could hardly refuse.  The vendor, Mr. Pino Harris, was offering Carysfort to UCD within days of having purchased it himself, even though it had been on the market for six months previously.  Why did he buy it?  We know that prior to the purchase of Carysfort by Mr. Harris, neither the Taoiseach nor the former Minister for Education had shown any interest in buying it.  We know that the normal procedures for a purchase of this kind, that is the routing of the request through the Higher Education Authority, were not followed.  That was at a time when nobody else was bidding for it <Col N="2333" /> and the owner was desperate to get it off his hands and property prices were falling.  The Government gave Mr. Harris a profit of at least £1.5 million and paid him twice as much as the official valuation of the property.  We know that up to the publication of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the evidence given at the Public Accounts Committee the Taoiseach and the former Minister for Education used every parliamentary trick in the book to avoid answering direct questions about the affair in this House and they have repeatedly given a bum steer to journalists who ask genuine questions about the inconsistencies of their story.</P>
    <P>This debate is taking place because there is now a strong suspicion that the Taoiseach actively involved himself in the decision to purchase Carysfort in order at least to help out a political or personal friend and to net him a large profit at the taxpayers' expense or, at worst, that the Taoiseach was in some way involved in setting up a mezzanine arrangement whereby Mr. Harris was virtually guaranteed the profitable resale of the property before he even bought it.  This is a most serious matter.</P>
    <P>In any democaracy the public needs to have confidence in the integrity if not the politics of its Prime Minister.  What is at the core of the Carysfort issue is the integrity of the Taoiseach.  Many questions have already been asked, but the central question is whether the Taoiseach acted improperly in relation to Carysfort? Did he misuse taxpayers money? These are the questions which are being asked by people in their sitting rooms and they must be explored in this House. These are not allegations, innuendos or statements of villification, as the Taoiseach may wish to interpret them.  The Taoiseach has had ample opportunity to respond to them, to explain what happened in relation to Carysfort and to assure us and the public that everything is in order.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the Taoiseach's story. In summary, it goes like this.  We are told that the possible involvement of UCD in Carysfort had been on the cards for four <Col N="2334" /> years, that the Taoiseach found some extra money in the kitty in late 1990 and that at about the same time UCD's plans to build a graduate business school at Roebuck ran into trouble.  Therefore, there emerged a convergence of interest between all concerned &mdash;UCD get their business school, the Taoiseach can spend his surplus cash and there are extra third level places to impress the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> partners. We are told that the deal was outstanding value for money.  We are told by the Taoiseach that he had always been very interested in Carysfort and that the idea of buying it for the UCD Smurfit Business School was such a good one that he had two meetings with Laurence Crowley, a further meeting with the UCD President and that he rang the UCD President again to assure him that, despite the refusal by the Department of Finance, there would be money for the ongoing costs of the school.  He and the former Minister for Education were so enthusiastic about buying Carysfort that they bypassed the Higher Education Authority, did not submit any memorandum to Cabinet and had it all signed, sealed and delivered in a matter of weeks. Paddy Masterson must be the envy of every college principal, semi-State chief executive, health board and vocational education committee chief executive officer and county manager.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's case is that he is a go getter, who when he sees a good idea will get stuck in, sweep aside the red tape and get action.  As for the vendor of the property, the Taoiseach says he had no meetings with him and he is not a friend of his.  Indeed, in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 29 September last the former Minister for Education is reputed as saying that she was unaware that the vendor was Mr. Pino Harris.  I shall return to this point later.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's story would be plausible if it did not have to be dragged out of him.  One would expect that if the Carysfort purchase was such a great idea, and the deal was such good value the Taoiseach would have been more than anxious to share the good news with us <Col N="2335" /> and to tell us of his own leading role in landing such a bargain for the taxpayer. Bashfulness is not one of the Taoiseach's better known qualities.  Yet, until the past couple of weeks the Taoiseach has seemed most reluctant to say anything about Carysfort.  The first public mention of his involvement in the sale appeared in an article last February by John Walsh and Christina Murphy in <i>The Irish Times.</i> Following that article I tabled, in February, a Dáil question to the Taoiseach asking him to make a statement about the report.  He transferred the question to the Minister for Education and it was subsequently ruled out of order as it &ldquo;impinged on the collective reponsibility of the Government&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Again, in October the Taoiseach transferred five specific questions which I put to him regarding Carysfort and as recently as last week he transferred a question to the Minister for Finance concerning his discussions with officials from the Department of Finance.  He had an opportunity to tell his story on radio in September but he did not do so.  He had a further opportunity to tell his story during the confidence debate in this House in October; but, again, far from seeking to claim credit for what is now described as an outstanding bargain, he seemed most anxious to distance himself from what he now calls &ldquo;the transaction&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Education was no more forthcoming.  She too started out by saying that the initiative came from UCD.  On 12 February 1991 she took my question about Carysfort together with a Priority Question from Deputy O'Shea and she did not reply at all to the specific questions I asked about the role of the Higher Education Authority.  She too was less then forthcoming in response to various questions put to her by journalists. At very least both the Taoiseach and the former Minister for Education showed a remarkable and untypical reticence in publicising what they now describe as an outstanding bargain for the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2336" /> Carysfort is located in my constituency. Its closure as a teachers training college was a tragedy for this country and for the Blackrock area in which it is situated.  The advertising for sale of Carysfort coincided with my election to this House and the very first thing I did in this House was to request the former Minister for Education to intervene and to prevent its sale.  I argued then that because of the State's investment in the Carysfort buildings the Government should make an effort to keep it in public hands and for public education.</P>
    <P>Although the former Minister for Education publicly declared her wish to keep Carysfort in education, she showed no inclination whatever to buy the property or do a deal with the Sisters of Mercy between July 1989, when it first came on the market, and July 1990 when it was bought by Mr. Pino Harris.  I asked her specifically in August 1989, following a letter which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> from the former principal, to enter into discussions with the Sisters of Mercy in order to secure the college for public educational use.  What the former Minister did was negotiate the repayment of £1.75 million in respect of the State's previous investment.  This indicates clearly that she was more concerned about securing some cash return from the initial sale than in buying the college on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>The college buildings and the surrounding 20 acres of land came back on the market in February 1990 and I immediately wrote to both the Taoiseach and Deputy O'Rourke arguing that the State should purchase it.  The Taoiseach, who now professes a long standing interest in the purchase of Carysfort, did not reply at all to my letter and the former Minister merely acknowledged it.  I again raised the matter here on the adjournment on 17 May 1990 and any reading of the Minister's reply to me will show that there was no intention whatever to purchase Carysfort.  What happened between 17 May 1990 and early September when she approached UCD to encourage them to buy Carysfort?</P>
    <P>The only significant event was that Mr. <Col N="2337" /> Pino Harris purchased the college and the 20 acres for a reported £6.5 million. According to the documents lodged in the Registry of Deeds office, Mr. Harris' agreement to purchase the property was concluded on 26 July 1990.  According to newspaper reports, the estate agents acting for Mr. Harris approached UCD about their interest in purchasing the property on 12 July 1990, two weeks before the formal conclusion of the sale.</P>
    <P>One has to ask why Mr. Harris purchased this property in the first place. Dún Laoghaire Corporation in an area action plan had placed a planning restriction on the property that the building and the surrounding 15 acres could only be used for educational purposes.  There was, therefore, no prospect of developing the lands.  Mr. Harris would either have to use it as an educational institution or sell it onto somebody else who would.  It is a known fact that there was not a great deal of interest by educational establishments in the purchase of Carysfort.  A letter from Fenton Simons, Planning and Development Consultants, addressed to Dún Laoghaire Corporation on 8 February 1990 states that 190 United States universities had been circulated with an attractive brochure advertising Carysfort and that the same brochure had been sent to many London agents and educational institutions in the UK, Europe and Japan.  Despite this extensive advertising, little or no interest was shown in the college.  It was a buyers market then and it was a buyers market when Mr. Harris sold the college to UCD for a profit of £1.5 million in circumstances in which there was no other bidder.</P>
    <P>How can anybody claim that this was outstanding value and a bargain for the taxpayer, particularly when the official valuation placed on the property was £3.8 million in August 1989 and when the former Minister for Education was able to secure the repayments from the Sisters of Mercy of only £1.75 million for the buildings which had been provided by the State in 1979 at a cost of over £2 million?</P>
    <P>Before Mr. Pino Harris bought Carysfort there is no evidence whatever to show that either the Taoiseach or the <Col N="2338" /> former Minister for Education had any enthusiasm or interest in buying the property. All the evidence is to the contrary. There is no evidence to show that at the time the Government agreed to pay £8 million for it there was anybody else who was remotely interested in it.  Therefore, what is the justification for paying £1.5 million extra to somebody who owned the property for only five months?</P>
    <P>What of the alleged continuing interest in UCD by Carysfort?  We heard about this again tonight and the Higher Education Authority's apparent continuing interest.  It is true that attempts were made between 1987 and 1988 to link Carysfort to UCD but these efforts stopped in 1988.  Why were they not revived?  If they were real why were they not reactivated when Carysfort came on the market in July 1989 and again in February 1990?  Why, during that time, when the Sisters of Mercy and the agents acting on their behalf repeatedly asked the Department of Education to buy it, was the UCD link not reactivated?  I suggest it was not reactivated because it was dead and that until Carysfort came into the ownership of Mr. Harris, the Government showed no interest in buying it.</P>
    <P>The story which the Taoiseach presented to us &mdash; and to which he is sticking &mdash; is simply not credible.  There was no continuing interest by UCD; there was no intention by the Government to buy it before Mr. Harris got it and it is simply not credible to tell us that the decision to buy it was taken because surplus money was found in the kitty.  We now know that the Taoiseach was involved in the discussions which led to the Government decision for UCD to buy it.  What we do not know is whether there was any involvement between the Taoiseach and the sellers of the property. I am glad that the Taoiseach responded voluntarily to the question which I tabled &mdash; and which had been ruled out of order &mdash; asking if he had any meetings with the owners of the property or agents acting on their behalf.  He was very specific and categoric, stating that he had no contact or any discussion with any of these companies or persons concerning the sale of <Col N="2339" /> Carysfort College at the time.  He did not mention people acting on their behalf; I do not know whether there is any sigificance in that but he clearly put on the record that there was no contact between them.  Therefore, it will not be possible at some future date to misinterpret that, should the circumstances arise, or in any way to be ambiguous about it.  This is not a repeat of the Bernie Cahill episode, this is quite categoric.</P>
    <P>There have been several inconsistencies in this whole affair.  The Minister for Education initially stated that the project was initiated by UCD, not by her, although we now know it was initiated by her.  The Taoiseach initially stated that he had no involvement and now it transpires there was an involvement.  Commitments were given to UCD about funding for the ongoing costs of the college.  The Minister for Education, in a newspaper report, stated that she did not even know who owned the property.  That hangs very uneasily with the comments she made in this House on 17 May 1990, when she talked about the resale of Carysfort, as it was then.  She said:</P>
    <P>Currently talks are in progress, I understand, between the owner of the whole property and sub-sets who wish to purchase the school properties, the training properties and the surrounding 20 acres for use as education-training development.  I assure the Deputy and the House that, while I am not formally involved in those talks, I am informally kept informed about what is happening and it might be said I have my eye very much on the matter.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to belive that somebody would agree to pay £10 million to a vendor of whom they were not aware, in the light of the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>Finally I want to refer to two extraordinary matters in relation to the Department of Education.  The first is that, following the publication of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, they issued a statement saying that the Valuation Office valued only the land and not the building.  That has been <Col N="2340" /> contradicted by the Comptroller and Auditor General, by the fact that the property on offer included the buildings and it has been implicitly contradicted by subsequent statements in this House.  It has never been explained (a) why the Department should take the extraordinary step of issuing a statement and (b) why it transpired that the statement was not accurate.  Secondly, the Department of Education have never explained why between 1979 and 1989 they failed to conclude an agreement with the Sisters of Mercy which would have protected the State's investment of over £2 million in Carysfort.  If that agreement had been concluded the question of Carysfort being sold might not have arisen because it would have reverted to the State.  The negligence of the Department of Education in not concluding an agreement over a ten-year period, particularly during the time when it was widely known that Carysfort would be closed, exposed this State to the loss of Carysfort as a facility and to the ridiculous situation of having to spend £10 million to buy back a property which had been provided ten years previously by taxpayers' money. That is an aspect of this whole affair which has not been sufficiently addressed and I hope it is one to which we will be returning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wonderful to have this college of business studies; we need it like we need a hole in the head. It was all right for UCD to get private capital to build their college of business studies in Roebuck but it is not all right for the Government to pay £10 million to provide one.  There are private third level colleges all over the place; every Mickey Mouse group promote business studies and management.  We do not want this business culture which has been built up and which has created all the scandals over the last six months.  It is the kind of thinking that wants to make the fast buck as quickly as possible and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need more places for engineering, science, design research and education of that kind which a regional technical <Col N="2341" /> college could provide.  The moneys spent on Carysfort would have provided third level places for 1,500 students in a regional technical college which could provide these courses whereas, as a result of a discussion with an educationalist, I understand that Carysfort will only provide 200 extra third level places.</P>
    <P>The other point I wish to make specifically relates to the Taoiseach's speech in the Dáil.  There was quite a hubbub about whether UCD approached the Minister for Education or <i>vice versa</i> and how it all started.  The Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>In July 1990, UCD were approached by the then proprietor and the property was visited by the appropriate authorities and staff within UCD.  According to the UCD President they were very impressed by both the quality of the buildings and the potential they offered.  The merits of Carysfort as a possible graduate school of business were clearly recognised.</P>
    <P>Incidentially the name of the &ldquo;then proprietor&rdquo; was not mentioned but we now know it was Mr. Harris who has just acquired the property.  However, UCD did nothing about acquiring the building in August or September until the Minister for Education approached them to give them a little nudge.  I should like to know who suggested to the Minister for Education, who was not in the slightest bit interested in the project, that she should give this little nudge to UCD to again approach the then proprietor.  We must remember that the Taoiseach said he was not involved in any way in the negotiations.  However, later in his speech, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>I arranged these meetings because I wished to discuss with the chairman the different aspects of the establishment of the graduate school in Carysfort, my support for the project, its importance from the point of view of improving Irish business management and the provision of additional places in third level education in accordance with the commitments being negotiated in the <i>Programme for Economic <Col N="2342" /> and Social Progress.</i>  I also wished to discuss with the chairman the financial position of the graduate school and the prospects of raising funds from the private sector.</P>
    <P>Naturally the Taoiseach is saying he spoke with Laurence Crowley and pointed out to him that he would have great difficulty in raising money from the private sector for the graduate school and pointed out also the great value of the establishment of the business school at Carysfort.  The Taoiseach supported that project.  That means the Taoiseach said to Laurence Crowley: you cannot get the money for your business school in Roebuck. I will see that you will get the money if you put your business school in Carysfort.  Those are the Taoiseach's words and yet the Taoiseach says he was not involved.  The Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>I was stating quite truthfully that I was not involved in the transaction.  I had absolutely no involvement in the negotiations over the sale of the property which were conducted ....</P>
    <P>Surely if the Taoiseach made it clear to the chairman of the business school that he would be able to provide the funds for the purchase of Carysfort he did not have to do any more.  They were in trouble in Roebuck but now the money was coming and that was all the Taoiseach had to do. That is the first stage of negotiation.  It is clear from the Taoiseach's own words that while he was not involved in the actual transaction, which he left to UCD to work out with Mr. Pino Harris, he was involved in the negotiations, through Laurence Crowley, by making it clear to him that he would see to it that the money was made available by the Government.</P>
    <P>I asked the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, on 30 October 1991, &mdash; column 1898 of the Official Report &mdash; if she herself was solely and totally responsible for the whole issue or whether the Taoiseach was involved.  The following is the Exchange:</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the purchase? No.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just repeat exactly what I said?</P>
      <P>She went on to repeat something which had nothing at all to do with the Taoiseach. I again asked her the same question and she repeated precisely the same statement which she had made before. She refused to say that the Taoiseach was not involved.  In fact, she accused me of machinations when she said:</P>
      <P>.... he will certainly not involve me in any of his machinations.</P>
      <P>I merely asked her to confirm that the Taoiseach was not involved and that she was solely responsible.  She did not do that.  It is very clear, both from the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, and from the Taoiseach's own statement, that he was involved in the negotiations for the purchase of Carysfort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about the Taoiseach that day was that he told us he knew nothing whatever about the Valuation Office estimate of £3.8 million. That came as a total surprise to him. Apparently he just heard about it here in the Dáil later on and yet he was discussing with Laurence Crowley why he should be interested in Carysfort and was ready to hand out £10 million and yet never heard of the Valuation Office estimate.  Apparently, also he did not know who the then proprietor was and certainly the then proprietor, who was Mr. Pino Harris, was no friend of his.  I think this is extraordinary. I accept he was no friend of his; he was probably a friend of somebody else in the Fianna Fáil Party or may be a friend of one of the club of 22 with whom he disagrees.  That is fair enough, but did he know that Mr. Pino Harris owned the property?  Had he ever heard of him before?  Did he know that only a few days before he had purchased the property for £6.5 million?  If the Taoiseach did not know that and did not know about the Valuatin Office estimate of £3.8 million <Col N="2344" /> and was still involved in pushing this business and forcing it on to Laurence Crowley, in pushing the Minister for Education into negotiations, in pushing Dr. Masterson &mdash; whom he greatly admires and who handed him an honorary degree about which he was delighted &mdash; into negotiations on the issue, yet he was unaware of the value of the property either in the actual market place at £6.5 million in July; and, as has just been pointed out, there was no other taker on the market despite all the pressure.  It is clear from the Taoiseach's own words that his involvement was much more and much clearer than simply the manner in which he put it.  It is clear that he was actually involved in the negotiations and his Minister for Education refused to absolve him from that when I asked her that question on 30 October 1991.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Davern) Noel Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>For a long time, since 1987 particularly, it has been and will be the Government's policy to increase third level places up to the year 2000 when pressure will continue to build up.  In the year 1991-92 alone 26,000 people transferred into third level in that period.  In 1980 the transfer rate was 20 per cent and in 1986 the transfer rate was 25 per cent.  Because of the Government's commitment we have now achieved in 1990 a 40 per cent transfer from second level to third level in the RTC areas.  That is a fantastic achievement by any standard, but it also demands that there be space available for these people.  Space is continually demanded and supplied in Tallaght, Bishop Street and other areas.  The continuation of this policy is tied in very closely with Carysfort.  Mary Immaculate College and Thomond College are now linked to the University of Limerick and discussions on a similar proposal are at an advanced stage with St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra, and Dublin City University.  It is hoped that another 500 places will be made available because of the linking of training colleges. When all these linkages are in place an extra 1,500 places will be available at third level institutions.  This, is a very <Col N="2345" /> enlightened and strong policy, one that is needed to deal in the socio economic sphere with what is happening in the universities. Many more second level students, who would never have contemplated going to university and whose parents never had that ambition for them are now being provided with a third level education.</P>
      <P>That compares starkly with the policy of the previous Government who closed Carysfort without warning, without precedent and without discussion.  The reality is that the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government left us with a bill for that period, which is continuing even today, of £1.7 million for staff who could not be redeployed.  At present there are nine staff members for whom we are trying to get places and who are costing an additional £150,000 annually.</P>

With regard to value for money, Carysfort cost about £300 per square foot and Roebuck would have cost £1,500 a square foot.  That has not been considered at all and neither was the £1.7 million spent on staff who were not redeployed for a number of years.  We had to find a use for the college.

      <P>The Minister has called into question the valuation of £3.8 million by the Valuation Office and says that valuation was too low.  Perhaps it was, but it was acquired by Mr. Pino Harris for £6.25 million a matter of months before he sold it for £8 million.  That is the answer to that question.  What does it matter if the valuation of £3.8 million was too low?  Facts are facts.  That happened and it is a clear enough indicator of values at that time.  The differential between £1.5 million or £1.75 million does not add up whether one takes stamp duty, legal fees or whatever into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night in his contribution to this debate the Taoiseach launched a vicious <Col N="2350" /> personal attack on the Labour Party and its Leader, Deputy Dick Spring.  There is a great temptation to use this opportunity to reply in kind to such an attack, but I do not intend to do so.  I interpret the Taoiseach's remarks last night as an indication of just how close to the mark the Labour Party have come in their criticism of the Taoiseach's involvement in the Carysfort affair.  Besides, it is often said that a dying bee is the most likely to sting and unless one is allergic to it the sting of the dying bee carries very little venom. As the lawyers put it, &ldquo;When you have a hopeless case, attack the witness for the prosecution&rdquo;.  That was the tactic adopted by the Taoiseach last night in this House.  All who were present last night noted the reluctance of the Taoiseach's backbenchers to support him.  This was one instance where the queen bee was without the usual swarm of drones.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Labour Party has nothing to fear from the flailing personal abuse delivered by the Taoiseach last night.  Throughout this period of scandal and trauma one of the clear and unequivocal messages that have emerged is that the Leader of the Labour Party is respected and trusted throughout the country.  There are two reasons for that. The Leader of the Labour Party has been entirely viligant in seeking to ensure that the public interest is fully protected and in demanding transparency and accountability in all of these grave issues.  Secondly, he has never made any charge that he was not prepared to stand over or sought to indulge in personality attacks. The trenchant political criticisms he has made of the Taoiseach and others reflect a widely held and accurate view that the politics of this country have been debased and diminished by the culture of strokes and deals which have pervaded the business scene here for years past now, with the encouragement of the Government in general and of the Taoiseach in particular. Despite the Taoiseach's efforts it is not Deputy Spring who has questions to answer in this debate, it is the Taoiseach; and so far the Taoiseach has failed dismally to answer them.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I <Col N="2351" /> established from Professor Masterson of UCD that the college was in a position to raise £5.5 million towards the cost of establishing the graduate business school.  He agreed with me when I put it to him that he could not build his ideal business school with all the facilities that he desired and on campus, as he wanted it, for a total of £7 million.  In other words, the amount of public money that he needed to build his ideal school on campus was an extra £1.5 million.  That was all he required, yet the college was force fed with £8 million, voted by the Dáil, paid by taxpayers, one year ago today.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lindsay, the Secretary of the Department of Education, recently gave a performance before the Committee of Public Accounts that could only be described as Sir Humphrey at his very best.  There was no problem with the valuation &mdash; Carysfort was &ldquo;a pearl of great price&rdquo;, to quote the Taoiseach's description of another deal that went sour.  I put to Mr. Lindsay at the meeting the point that Professor Masterson had agreed with, namely, that UCD were in a position to raise £5.5 million themselves. Mr. Lindsay expressed great surprise at this, and I quote from the transcript what he said:</P>
    <P>That would surprise me.  If it is true, it is a matter that would need to be pursued further.  I would like to stress that one of the objectives of the Higher Education Authority and ourselves always is to maximise contributions towards property acquisition or towards any development from private sources.  That is a philosophy we are implemening.  If there were more available than £2 million we would be most anxious to pursue that.</P>
    <P>They must have known from the very beginning that there was more than £2 million available.  The Taoiseach must have known this; the Minister and the Department knew it.  How could they fail to know?</P>
    <P>The governing body of UCD were told from the start, in minute after minute, <Col N="2352" /> that the university were in a position to develop a self-financing graduate school of business on the basis of a capital outlay of £7 million originally and of £5.5 million for a scaled-down version.  Therefore there was never a reason for the Government to put up £8 million of taxpayers' money to buy Carysfort.  The only possible logical explanation is that the Government were inducing a reluctant UCD to buy Carysfort against the better judgment of the university.  UCD took the view that it was no longer necessary for them to go to the trouble of raising the £5.5. million.</P>
    <P>In many ways what is most puzzling about this controversy is the refusal of the principals to come clean.  It took almost a year to get Professor Masterson to say anything, other than one carefully worded and very flowery public statement. The former Minister for Education has yet to admit that it was she who took the initiative in the matter, although in his fairly typical way the Taoiseach made that admission on her behalf in his speech last night.  Mr. Crowley has yet to describe what happened between him and the Taoiseach, while Mr. Harris has yet to make any public utterance whatever. Even the Sisters of Mercy have, it appears, taken a vow of silence despite the rumours that they desperately needed the money at the time because of the financial difficulties of the Mater Private Hospital.</P>
    <P>If this transaction was so simple and so straightforward, the conspiracy of silence on the part of those who know what went on should be enough to alert us.  As it is, I do not suppose a smoking gun will ever be produced in this case.  I do not suppose the Taoiseach will ever admit that he organised and orchestrated the transaction for the benefit of Mr. Harris, but as long as the conspiracy of silence lasts the suspicion will remain.  No amount of denials by the Taoiseach, no amount of bluster, no appeals to end what he wrongly believes to be a personal campaign against him will remove that suspicion.</P>
    <P>Let us face up to the fact that the Progressive Democrats do not accept the <Col N="2353" /> Taoiseach's account.  We know that they are going to vote for the Government amendment tonight only because failure to do so would precipitate a general election. We know that the former Minister for Finance does not believe the Taoiseach's account.  We know that none of the journalists who have studied the Carysfort saga in depth accept the Taoiseach's account.  We know, irrespective of the outcome of the vote tonight, that a significant majority of this House do not in their hearts of hearts accept the Taoiseach's account.</P>
    <P>Carysfort will remain a stain on this Government's record.  It will always be remembered that at a time of limited resources, when national schools could not replace fallen slates or rotting windows, when university professors were forced into resignation by the absence of adequate staffing, when stress in the teaching profession was of epidemic proportions it was possible to find nearly £10 million, much of which went to the enrichment of one individual.</P>
    <P>No valuation was obtained.  Is it not incredible and remarkable that £8 million was expended without a valuation being obtained to see what the market value of this property was at the time?  When I questioned Mr. Lindsay about this matter he said that they had left it to the technical officers in UCD to determine that question.  I asked him who these technical officers were, to which he replied, a quantity surveyor, an architect and an engineer. When I asked him was he not leaving out one essential technical person he asked, &ldquo;who is that?&rdquo;, to which I replied, a valuer.  He said no, that it represented great value.  This myth has been repeated again tonight by the Minister.  He said it was wonderful value&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>They got it cheap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it was got cheap. How does the Minister know this unless a valuation was obtained.  Everybody involved in the transaction obtained a valuation.  We can be quite sure that the Sisters of Mercy, Mr. Pino Harris and Davmac obtained valuations.  Anybody <Col N="2354" /> in their right mind who is going to expend a good deal less than £8 million would look for a valuation.  It may be, having obtained a valuation to see what the open market value is that one can say that a property has a special value and therefore one is prepared to pay more than the market value for it.  There is nothing wrong with that because at least one is going into the transaction with one's eyes open.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister left it to UCD to conduct the negotiations. That is very unusual.  The Minister and the Taoiseach told one party to the negotiations, who at the end of the day were not putting up the purchase money: &ldquo;Negotiate and get the property at the best price possible and we will pay.&rdquo; Many people believe, as I do, that they came back with a figure of £8 million and the Minister agreed.  If it had been £9 million or £10 million it would have been agreed.  One could be forgiven for coming to the conclusion that the degree of pressure applied was not as great as it might have been if they had to get the money or provide a major proportion of it.</P>
      <P>Ten million pounds might not seem a lot of money in the global scheme of things but even a once-off payment of £10 million would build 250 houses.  It would go some way towards eradicating the shame of our miserly contribution to Third World aid.  It would fund the Combat Poverty Agency, the free legal aid centres and the Rape Crisis Centre combined for four years.  That is the scale of money that has been poured by the State into a project that was conceived, designed and developed as a self-financing project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority, at the request of the Committee of Public Accounts, furnished a list of their priority projects on hands in 1990.  About ten important projects in all are listed and the graduate business school of UCD is not one of them.  That is the scale of money that has been given away to a college that did not want or need it.  That is the scale of money that has highlighted the cavalier, wilful disregard of every rule in the book by the Taoiseach and his <Col N="2355" /> supine Cabinet.  That is the scale of money that illustrates the shameful way <Col N="2356" /> in which the Carysfort scandal will be remembered for many years to come.</P>

      <P>That Dáil éireann takes note of the 1992 Estimates for the Public Services (Abridged Version) and of the 1992 Summary Public Capital Programme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The publication of the Abridged Estimates Volume and Summary Public Capital Programme for 1992, marks the completion of the first stage of preparations for the 1992 budget.  The Estimates give a partial but important view of one side of the budget.  The revenue side will be made known when the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure is published towards the end of January.  It is then, also, that the position on Central Fund services will be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing this general debate on the 1992 Estimates it is my intention to take stock of developments over the past year, to review performance against <Col N="2361" /> expectations and to chart, in a preliminary way pending my Budget Statement, the course for the year ahead.  As my predecessor said, his 1991 budget was prepared at a time of exceptional uncertainty about prospects for the world economy. The extent of that volatility became apparent during the year.  The year 1991 was one of great political change, uncertainty and turmoil internationally especially in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.  This resulted in economic turbulence on a scale which had not been anticipated either by economic forecasters or political commentators and which has affected the 1991 budget out-turn.</P>
    <P>I will deal first with the Government's general economic strategy.  A primary objective of the Government is to foster output and employment growth in the economy.  Everything else depends on that.  The Government, and their predecessor, have worked towards this by adopting a policy mix which is clear, credible and consistent geared to maintaining a low inflation economy where social harmony, born out of shared concern and shared responsibility, prevails.  We are creating an economy which can compete in an increasingly more integrated Europe.  That is the road to the jobs and incomes growth which all of us want.  It is also the only secure basis for the level of public services to which we aspire.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy rests on a few key elements.  First, a determination to foster economic confidence, and minimise inflation by an unequivocal commitment to the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS. Second, an equal determination to reduce the overhang of debt which had been holding back confidence and economic performance.  Third, the fact that moderate income increases and harmonious industrial relations are vital, and to that end to bring the main social partners together in a consensus approach for the good of all.</P>
    <P>The budget targets for 1991 were, as I have already said, set against a background of considerable international economic uncertainty.  Growth in output <Col N="2362" />&mdash; GDP &mdash; and national product &mdash; GNP &mdash; were both projected at 2.25 per cent, well down on growth rates over the previous two years, which had averaged more than 6 per cent per annum.  These 1991 projections were also rather less buoyant than had been anticipated towards the end of 1990, when the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was being negotiated.  In the event, GNP and GDP are now expected to grow by about 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively.  While this is slower growth than we achieved earlier, it compares well with the picture in other economies.</P>
    <P>The end-June Exchequer returns showed that problems were emerging on both sides of the Exchequer account.  On the receipts side, a downturn in consumer spending, reflecting, <i>inter alia,</i> the pattern of rising unemployment, led to significant shortfalls in indirect tax revenues this year.  On this expenditure side, the economic slowdown was increasing unemployment costs due mainly to the virtual cessation of emigration.  These factors, together with some slippage emerging on other fronts, especially health, left the Government facing an overrun of at least £200 million.  Clearly, some of these factors could not be reversed and would have to be absorbed. Nevertheless, action was called for to limit the size of the budgetary overrun in 1991 and to reduce the adverse knock-on effects for the 1992 opening budgetary position.</P>
    <P>Resolute action, backed up by a firm resolve to see it through, was called for. Ministers reviewed priorities within their expenditure programmes right across the spectrum of Government spending, so as to contain slippage and, where possible, to offer savings to offset unavoidable slippages on other expenditure programmes. As a result, the mid-July corrective package held the budgetary overrun well below the excess of £200 million which then threatened.  I now expect that the outturn EBR &mdash; Exchequer Borrowing Requirement &mdash; will be about 2.5 per cent of GNP against a target of under 2 per cent of GNP.  The exact outturn will <Col N="2363" /> not, of course, be known until the new year.</P>
    <P>The actual EBR this year will be more than 1 percentage point below the budget target when the proceeds of the flotation of Irish Life are taken into account.  Taking account of these proceeds, Exchequer borrowing is set to decline in 1991 for the fifth consecutive year.</P>
    <P>The burden of debt and its servicing still remain a major problem.  The debt/GNP ratio, which had increased rapidly over the early to mid-eighties to reach 129.4 per cent at the end of 1987, has since been dramatically reduced.  By the end of last year the ratio was under 110 per cent, and it will fall again this year.  The Government are committed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> and in the revised Programme for Government, to the further reduction of the debt/GNP ratio towards 100 per cent by 1993.</P>
    <P>Debt service costs as a percentage of GNP have fallen from 11.9 per cent in 1986 to 10.2 per cent in 1990.  They, too, are set to fall again in 1991.  But they continue to pre-empt too much of our resources.  We must maintain our progress in reducing the debt burden.</P>
    <P>In March 1987 Irish interests rates were considerably higher than those of many of our European partners.  For example, the key three-month interbank rate in Ireland was about 9 percentage points higher than the corresponding German rate.  These differentials have been considerably reduced.  By the end of last year Irish three-month rates were only 2.25 percentage points above the German levels.  At present the differential is down to about 1 percentage point.</P>
    <P>It is clear that overseas investors have made a very positive reassessment of our position.  This is evident not only from the improvement in our relative interest rate performance which I have just noted, but also from developments on the market for domestic Government securities.  Non-resident investors now hold about one-third of the total outstanding compared to about 10 per cent <Col N="2364" /> at end-1986.  This is a significant advance for what is, by international standards, a small market.  The involvement of these investors in Irish markets makes for stronger, more liquid markets and helps Irish borrowers, especially the State, to get the best possible deal.</P>
    <P>In a situation of increasing openness of international financial markets and greater freedom of capital movements, it is essential that the Irish economy be in a position to capture and hold its full share of available foreign investment. The continued maintenance of responsible fiscal policies and of a firm exchange rate within the EMS is crucial in this respect.  While the debt/GNP ratio has fallen sharply it remains a huge burden on the public finances.  It is vital that we achieve our target of reducing this ratio towards 100 per cent by 1993.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the public finances over the past four years has not been achieved at the expense of those least able to afford it.  Social Welfare spending has been increased, and targeted more closely on those most in need, while improving the controls against fraud.</P>
    <P>In recent years, increases in the basic rates of payment have matched and in many cases exceeded the level of inflation.  In fact, all long term rates are now at or above the priority rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Short-term rates have also been increased significantly.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that, despite the budgetary difficulties this year, arrangements have been made to pay a Christmas bonus to all long term social welfare beneficiaries, at a cost of some £28 million.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the policies followed by this Government and their predecessor has been a concern to ease the overall level of taxation and at the same time to bring about real tax reform &mdash; in the interest of economic growth, job-creation and social equity.</P>
    <P>A large part of the increase in the tax burden through the early and mid-eighties came from income tax.  The proportion of taxpayers paying at more than <Col N="2365" /> the standard rate increased from 11.5 per cent in 1980-81 to 44.1 per cent in 1987-88. In the current year, that proportion is down to less than 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Tax reduction and reform requires prudent control of expenditure.  That is the only substainable policy.  That is the policy that has been followed by this Government and that has allowed reform to be achieved simultaneously with the reduction in the Exchequer deficit.  That is how we intend to proceed, so that we can continue to move steadily towards a more equitable, simpler and more economically efficient tax system through a widening of the tax base and lower rates of tax.</P>
    <P>Since 1987, both the standard and top income tax rates have been cut by six points.  The top VAT rate has been cut by four points.  Income tax allowances and rate bands have been increased and tax reliefs for low-paid families have been dramatically improved.</P>
    <P>Far-reaching reforms and improvements have also been made in the tax administration system.  These include self-assessment, current year assessment for the self-employed, power of attachment on tax defaulters and a radically improved system of tax enforcement.</P>
    <P>The international slowdown with recession in some major economies has dragged on longer than most experts were predicting earlier this year.  But the view of the main economic agencies is that 1992 will see a modest recovery after this year's poor international performance. The EC Commission's recent annual economic report forecasts that growth in the Community will pick up from 1.25 per cent to 2.25 per cent in 1992.  The forecast for the United Kingdom is particularly encouraging from an Irish viewpoint.  The UK economy is expected to expand by 2 per cent, in contrast with a decline of almost the same order this year.  Growth in world trade is expected to improve.</P>
    <P>But continuing fiscal responsibility at home is one of the essential preconditions. The 1992 Estimates have sent a clear message to all that we are determined to keep firm control of public <Col N="2366" /> spending in 1992.  A responsible approach to spending is crucial to our success.  More borrowing to finance increased spending would jeopardise the lower interest rates we have already achieved and impose a bigger future debt burden.  This would inevitably lead on to higher taxes than would otherwise be necessary &mdash; pushing up prices, cutting take-home pay or diminishing profitability and the capacity for future investment.  Advocates of higher expenditure cannot evade these consequences.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that our low inflation, our firm commitment to a stable exchange rate policy within the EMS, our improved competitive position and our continuing adherence to a responsible fiscal stance gives us, with a recovering international economy, the basis for improved growth in output and jobs over the year ahead.</P>
    <P>We cannot, however, expect unusually fast growth next year.  That would be an unreal expectation against the background of modest recovery in the international economy.  Growth in jobs too is unlikely to be as strong as in recent years. Given the growth of our labour force, the prospect is that unemployment will rise further, though at a much slower pace than in 1991.  In framing the Estimates accordingly I have provided for an average level of unemployment next year of 275,000.  I should emphasise that this figure does not take account of the proposed employment and training initiatives recently discussed with the Commission, and announced last week by the Taoiseach.  The impact of these schemes and of prevailing labour market conditions will be taken into account by the Government in formulating the budget.</P>
    <P>In summary, then, the timing and extent of the international recovery remain uncertain.  Nevertheless we can look forward to an improvement in the course of the year and this should enable the Irish economy, in line with the EC as a whole, to grow more rapidly than in 1991.  However, it seems clear that the domestic growth rate, in the short term at least, will be more modest than that <Col N="2367" /> experienced before the current slowdown began.  The budget will have to be framed against this background.</P>
    <P>The move to Economic and Monetary Union will play a increasingly important role in shaping our economic and budgetry policy over the coming years.  While most attention may have focused recently on the monetary aspects of European Monetary Union, the economic and budgetary implications of the European Monetary Union Treaty agreed at Maastricht are no less significant.</P>
    <P>The impact on Government policy will be seen in a number of ways.  The member states of the Community have agreed that greater economic convergence is necessary if the future European Monetary Union is to have a solid foundation.  For that reason the criteria which member states must fulfil to enable them to move to full European Monetary Union are strict.  Government economic policy will be directed towards ensuring that Ireland will be in a position to move to the final stage of European Monetary Union along with the front rank of member states.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the budgetary prospect for 1992 is extremely difficult. Growth and domestic consumption will remain subdued and, as I have already indicated, there is no prospect of a return in 1992 to the buoyancy achieved in 1989 and 1990.  Similarly, the position in the UK labour market will maintain social spending at a very high level.</P>
    <P>The opening budgetary position remains well above the level which would be consistent with staying on course for the 1993 targets set in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and recently re-affirmed.  Given the restrictions on borrowing which are implicit in these targets, a considerable amount of tightening has yet to be done to ensure a satisfactory budget in 1992.</P>
    <P>We have won the confidence of investors and consumers at home and of capital markets internationally.  We have to keep that confidence if economic progress is to continue as it should.</P>
    <P>That is why we must adhere to our <Col N="2368" /> fiscal objectives, why we must continue to reduce the national debt/GNP ratio, why we must keep working towards broad balance on the current budget.  It is not really a matter of choice.  No responsible person should advocate change in these fundamentals of our strategy.  Departure from this stance would very quickly undo the progress of the last few years and would undoubtedly damage our longer-term prospects in the more integrated new Europe which is emerging.</P>
    <P>The Government had no option but to look at public service pay in continuing restraint on public expenditure.  There are two reasons for this &mdash; firstly, the fact that public service pay now accounts for such a large slice of voted non-capital expenditure &mdash; 54 per cent in 1991 &mdash; and secondly the size of the cost facing us in respect of further pay increases.</P>
    <P>If all liabilities on the pay front were to be met in full, the total increase in the exchequer pay and pensions bill in 1992 would be £354 million.  That would have brought the total bill to £3.8 billion, an increase of more than 10 per cent over the projected outturn of £3,444 million in 1991.  This would be about three times the anticipated rate of inflation in 1992. Of the £354 million increase, some £187 million would arise from increases in rates of pay, both the general increase due under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the remaining phases of special increases due to be paid from dates in 1992.</P>
    <P>Given our budgetary strategy, the Government simply could not meet this increase in pay costs without imposing severe cuts in levels of services in big-spending areas like Social Welfare, Education and Health.  Were that to happen, not alone would it have unacceptable social consequences but public service employment in those sectors would have to be reduced.</P>
    <P>I explained the seriousness of our situation to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions when I met them some three weeks ago.  I pointed out that we had no choice but to look hard at our options on pay and I asked that they reflect on this <Col N="2369" /> situation and meet me again in a few days to discuss the matter.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, this meeting did not take place.  Given the timetable to the budget and the deadlines for putting changes into effect, this left the Government in a situation where we had no realistic alternative but to take decisions on the provisions to be made for public service pay in the light of the prevailing constraints.</P>
    <P>The package of measures announced by the Taoiseach on Friday last were carefully drawn to strike a balance between what can be afforded in 1992 in the context of keeping the Exchequer finances on course, and dealing with issues of major concern to staff &mdash; namely protection of those on lower rates of pay to the greatest extent possible, and honouring payments still due in respect of special increases.  The package provides for</P>
    <P>Payment of the 3 per cent general increase due on 1 January next subject to the minimum increase of £4.25 in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and an upper limit or ceiling of £5 a week;</P>
    <P>payment in full of the remaining phases of the special increases on 1 January 1993, with full retrospection to the due dates also payable on that date; and</P>
    <P>having regard to the very high cost of meeting this commitment in full, payment of the 3.75 per cent general increase due on 1 January 1993 subject to the minimum payment due of £5.75 per week and an upper limit or ceiling of £6.50 per week.</P>
    <P>The published Estimates are based on rates of pay in force today.  The effect of the Government's decision is that a further £70 million will be added on budget day to today's Estimates volume figure of £3,611 million for the Exchequer pay and pensions Bill.  This will bring the total provision for 1992 to £3,681 million. This represents an increase of £237 million &mdash; or 7 per cent &mdash; over the projected outturn for 1991.  This is as much as can be afforded in 1992.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2370" /> At this point I would like to make a comment on the issue of tax collection. In much of the coverage of the public service pay issue in 1992 the suggestion is repeated that the problem would disappear if only tax collection were geared up, that there is some £200 million extra tax out there just waiting to be collected and that this is the solution to the problem. There has in some instances been the implication that if only the Government took tax collection as seriously as they should there would be no difficulty.</P>
    <P>If only things were as easy as that.  I can assure the House that if such an easy source of revenue were available the Government would jump at it.</P>
    <P>We are committed to improving tax collection and tackling tax evasion and avoidance and we will push ahead urgently with measures on those fronts. However, the proposition that there is an additional £200 million of tax out there which could be realistically collected in 1992 does not stand up.  Given co-operation by various staff groups, Revenue plan, however, through additional audits, to collect not less than £30 million in 1992 in addition to a repetition in that year of the £30 million yield being pursued in 1991 on foot of an initiative in the 1991 budget.  These figures are already in the budget arithmetic, but the problem of public service pay I have outlined still stands.</P>
    <P>I fully understand the feelings of public servants and their unions on the aspects of public service pay that we have had to grapple with and their reaction to the decisions which the Government have had to take.  I hope, nonetheless, that they will on reflection appreciate the serious budgetary situation in which the Government find themselves and come to accept what has had to be done.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, I am available to meet with representatives of public service staff to discuss the overall situation with them and, within the scope of the decision taken, to enter into dialogue with them on any issues of concern to them.</P>
    <P>I now propose to make some general comments on the 1992 Estimates for the <Col N="2371" /> Public Services and the summary public capital programme.  Other Government Ministers in their contributions to this debate will deal in more detail with the spending allocations for which they are responsible.</P>
    <P>Total net voted services for 1992 amount to £7,419 million, an increase of £276 million on the latest 1991 projected outturn of £7,143 million.  Given the upward pressures on public expenditure, the Government's firm resolve to contain spending is reflected in this relatively modest increase of 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>In arriving at this figure, we have had to reduce departmental demands for Exchequer funds by about £600 million. These cuts include savings on public service pay.  On the non-pay side, spending levels have been held down to minimum but adequate levels.  Of the £500 million of non-pay savings, £300 million are on the current side and the balance on the capital side.</P>
    <P>For many Votes, 1992 expenditure has been held very close to or even below the 1991 allocation.  For example, the Vote for the Office of Public Works is, at almost £99 million, slightly down on 1991.  The votes for the Department of the Taoiseach is down by 5 per cent and the Vote for my own Department is down by 24 per cent.  These represents significant reductions in real terms.</P>
    <P>In many other cases, allocations have been kept very close to the expected rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>The main components of the £276 million in net-voted services increase mentioned above are:</P>
    <P>Social Welfare, up by £57 million.</P>
    <P>Health, an increase of £66 million; and</P>
    <P>Education, up by £90 million.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the published Estimates, spending on the Social Welfare Vote is expected to reach £1,773 million in 1992.  This is about £57 million or some 3 per cent higher than the 1991 provisional outturn.  A number of factors account for this increase, principally the <Col N="2372" /> increase in the live register.  This is expected to cost some £66 million more in 1992.  This is a significant additional cost which highlights just how sensitive social welfare expenditure and indeed the overall budgetary arithmetic is to changes in the unemployment situation.  Another factor pushing up expenditure in 1992 is the carry-over costs of the Social Welfare improvements made in this year's budget.  These amount to £81 million approximately.  However, there is the projected increase in PRSI income which is helping to moderate these cost increases.  The extra yield from PRSI reflects expected growth in incomes and employment in 1992.</P>
    <P>Social welfare spending constitutes a major component of total public expenditure. In recent years, it has averaged over 25 per cent of total non-capital supply services.  This means that even relatively small changes in social welfare rates have important implications for total public expenditure and for the Government's room for manoeuvre at budget time.  For example, a 3 per cent increase in basic social welfare rates in line with the expected increase in inflation would cost over £38 million in 1992 and some £86 million in a full year. In the context of the very tight budgetary situation facing the Government, amounts of this magnitude will not be easy to accommodate.  The Government, nevertheless, remain committed to protecting social welfare payments against inflation.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to providing for the continuation of the approved health service levels.  A satisfactory and effective public hospital service will be available to those who require and opt for it.  The less well off members of our community &mdash; those with medical cards &mdash; will of course continue to benefit from the totally free medical service.  The 1992 Health Estimate also allows for a continued improvement in areas such as services for the mentally handicapped and for those suffering from AIDS.  It also allows for some limited development of critical services in the acute hospital sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2373" /> The 1991 Budget net provision for Health was £1,348 million.  Developments in 1991 gave rise to further presures for additional funding which, after the effects of the mid-year corrective package, resulted in a Supplementary Estimate of £50 million.  The final out-turn, including the provision from the Remuneration Vote, £64 million, is expected to be £1,462 million.</P>
    <P>The total net provision for 1992 is £1,529 million, an increase of £181 million, up 13 per cent on the 1991 Budget allocation.  This reflects the Government's resolve to maintain a satisfactory level of service.  All governments are faced with the increasing costs of advancing medical technologies and the ever-rising costs of more sophisticated drugs. These factors are under constant review by the Government in order to ensure that optimum use is made of the available resources.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to preserving and improving the quality of our educational system and the allocation proposed for the education sector in these Estimates reflects that determination. Nonetheless, we have to balance this priority with the recognition that, in the financial circumstances confronting us in 1992, it will not be possible to fund further initiatives over and above the significant improvements already introduced in 1991.  Measures have accordingly been taken to contain the costs of expansion and improvements in the education sector, while accommodating the thrust of Government policy in this area.</P>
    <P>The Vote for the Office of the Minister for Education is to fall by 1 per cent. Relevant measures here include tight control of the provision for school transport services and of the current cost of youth and sport services, which will fall by 3 per cent.  On the capital side, there will be a 37 per cent reduction in the allocation for major sports facilities, although the amount provided will cover the cost of all projects maturing in 1992. There is no provision for the national sports centre as the Government have <Col N="2374" /> decided that this project will not now go ahead.</P>
    <P>The allocation for first level education is to rise by nearly £46 million, or 9 per cent.  About £19 million of this total is attributable to the cost of an extra pay day for primary teachers in 1992, which arises because, for technical reasons, the first pay day of 1993 is brought forward into 1992.  The balance of the increase is accounted for by the full year cost of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> measures introduced in 1991, a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio and the appointment of significant numbers of remedial teachers and teachers for disadvantaged areas &mdash; by the carry-over costs of the 1991 pay round and specials and by increments and other miscellaneous pay related costs.</P>
    <P>The net increase at second level is of 2 per cent, but the gross increase is 5 per cent.  This is a measure of the challenge confronting the management of the public finances: without any change in policy, without any provision for pay increases, without any of the further improvements in educational facilities &mdash; over and above those we introduced in 1991 &mdash; the cost of this Vote will rise by a gross £26 million.  This increase will be partially offset by higher Appropriations-in-Aid arising from the carry-over into 1992 of certain ESF receipts which are not now expected to arrive in 1991.  The gross increase is attributable by and large to the same factors that give rise to the increase at first level: pay carry-overs and the full costs of improvements &mdash; pupil-teacher ratio and others &mdash; introduced in 1991.</P>
    <P>At third level there is an increase of nearly £37 million or 16 per cent.  The cost-increasing elements include the same factors that apply at other levels of education, but the increase here reflects another significant element of Government policy: the determination to provide extra student places at third level. This has consequences in regard to both current and capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>There will be further growth in the Public Capital Programme in 1992.  The 1992 programme, at £1,869 million, is 8 <Col N="2375" /> per cent up on 1991.  Exchequer financed expenditure is up by £23 million, while non-Exchequer financed spending, which consists for the most part of spending by the commercial State-sponsored body sector, will grow by £120 million.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see from Table 1 of the Public Capital Programme booklet how expenditure is set to change between 1991 and 1992, broken down by sector.  I will now outline some of the main elements of the Public Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>The sectoral economic investment category is set to fall by 5 per cent to £538 million.  The allocation for industry falls by 15 per cent to £272 million.  Capital expenditure by the IDA at £125 million is down £21 million on 1991 levels, reflecting in the main the direction of policy on the reduction of grant percentages payable to individual projects. Since we have greatly improved the economic climate, we do not need to spend as much to attract industry.  Údarás na Gaeltachta expenditure falls from £21 million to £16 million and reflects the fact that over £5.5 million of the 1991 allocation was in respect of a once-off project.</P>
    <P>The allocation for agriculture is up by 12 per cent to £139 million.  This increase reflects, in the main, spending under the Integrated Rural Development and LEADER Programmes, which are operational programmes under the Community support framework.  The expansion of investment in forestry will continue in 1992 under the Community support framework.  Grants for private afforestation will increase by 58 per cent from £10 million to over £15 million while there will be a slight reduction in the total allocation for Coilte Teoranta, down £3 million to £35 million.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;productive infrastructure&rdquo; category is up by £131 million, or 15 per cent and covers investment in energy, roads, transport, sanitary services and telecommunications. The increase in investment in energy is particularly significant &mdash; up by £67 million, or 39 per cent, on this year.  The ESB plans to spend £138 <Col N="2376" /> million next year on improving and upgrading the transmission and distribution networks for electricity, the reconditioning of mothballed generating stations and developments of ESB information systems.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis will invest £90 million in upgrading their gas distribution network. The proposed gas interconnector pipeline, which will link Ireland to North Sea gas, will also require £54 million in investment in 1992, while phase III of the North Eastern project to extend the gas pipeline from Dundalk will cost £5.4 million in 1992.</P>
    <P>Investment on roads, all Exchequer funded, will increase from £207 million this year to £228 million next year, under the Peripherality Operation Programme.</P>
    <P>The social infrastructure category, which include housing, schools, hospitals and Government construction, will grow by 13 per cent from £307 million to £346 million.  While there will be no overall increase in the level of investment in housing, the number of housing units to be provided in 1992 will increase by 23 per cent due to expanded activity under the new measures launched under the social housing programme earlier this year.  There will also be increased provision for house purchase and improvement loans reflecting an expected increase in loan activity by the HFA on foot of the new measures.</P>
    <P>Expenditure affecting the construction sector, at £1,120 million in 1992, will account for 60 per cent of total Public Capital Programme expenditure.  The Department of the Environment expect that this will generate up to 2,000 jobs directly in the construction industry.  In addition employment in the areas providing related services to the industry &mdash; for example, the professions, suppliers, etc. &mdash; is also expected to increase.</P>
    <P>My outline of the 1992 Estimates and the economic context in which they must be assessed here tonight has been deliberately wide-ranging with a view, I hope, to contributing towards an informed and constructive debate by Deputies on both sides of the House.  I commend the Estimates to the House accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Government are presenting this Book of Estimates in a bogus fashion.  They are increasing current expenditure by over 6 per cent in 1992 and capital expenditure is being increased by 8 per cent.  Public expenditure rose this year by 9 per cent, or more than three times the rate of inflation.  When we allow for the pay commitments made by the Minister for Finance last Friday and the normal increase in the rate of social welfare payments from mid-1992, the increases planned for 1992 are about 6 per cent or more than twice the rate of inflation.  Six per cent and not 4 per cent is the Minister's opening position on current expenditure as he faces into the 1992 Budget.</P>
      <P>The Government's presentation, and in particular that of the Minister, is bogus.  An attempt is being made to give the impression, at a time when they are increasing public expenditure by more than twice the rate of inflation, that public expenditure is actually being cut by £600 million.  Of course, these cuts are notional cuts; they are cuts on the departmental demands.  Departments make extravagant demands.  To pretend that by not giving into these demands, and only increasing expenditure by twice the rate of inflation rather than by some other multiple which corresponds to what the Departments demand, is an exercise in propaganda which is worthy of Dr. Goebbels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public expenditure went out of control over the last two years and attempts to rein it in next year &mdash; or the year after &mdash; will be very difficult indeed.  It is not possible in the long term to increase public expenditure each year by more than the rate of inflation unless the economy is growing at a rate sufficient to fund the increased expenditure.  If the economy is not growing at a rate sufficient to fund the increased expenditure then the Government must resort to either borrowing or taxation; there is no other way of making ends meet, balancing the books or running the country. This Book of Estimates shows that we <Col N="2378" /> have now arrived at that point.  Our economy is in decline and the Minister, to make ends meet, must borrow or tax.</P>
    <P>The Government are striving to maintain their commitment to reduce borrowing, I understand that commitment is an Exchequer borrowing requirement of not more than 2.5 per cent in 1992 and that the Minister is committed to this target.  However, that means when expenditure is increased by twice the rate of inflation his only alternative is to tax. The Government are doing that; for example, increases in PRSI are tax increases.  Increases in hospital charges and commercial rates are also tax.  The same applies to the whole range of charges on local authorities round the country.  A rose by any other name would smell as sweet but a tax increase by any other name will always be a tax increase and will be seen for what it is.  The Government, having failed to cut expenditure equal to the rate of inflation and deciding after their discussions internally in Government to peg borrowing to a level which will throw up an EBR of 2.5 per cent of GNP, have been forced into a position of increasing taxes.  We have been there before and have seen what happened in the early eighties when an increased taxation policy was resorted to.</P>
    <P>The Government notified local authorities that the block grant in lieu of domestic rates would not be increased and, of course, that is reflected in the Environmental Vote in the Book of Estimates which shows a very modest increase.  However, this has forced local authorities all over the country to increase commercial rates, rents and other charges.  These are all forms of increased taxation.</P>
    <P>The fact that the decisions are made locally as a result of Government action, rather than centrally, directly by the Government, does not lessen the impact on those who have to pay.  For example, in Limerick and Cork cities the commercial rate is being increased by almost 12 per cent, four times the rate of inflation.  In Dublin the increases in percentage terms are more modest but they are being put on a rate base which is being <Col N="2379" /> extensively revalued and the income in liability for some business people, especially in places like Swords, is as high as 400 per cent.</P>
    <P>We know that there is now a new base for valuation purposes based on the equalisation of valuations in Grafton Street.  This new base has increased the rateable valuation of shops and small business &mdash; and public houses in particular &mdash; by 300 per cent, 350 per cent and 400 per cent.  I am not surprised that Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council did not have to increase the commercial rate by the extravagant amounts which were necessary in Limerick and Cork cities, that is because the valuation base has already been increased anyway so there is a very significant extra take in taxation.  As I said, the major revaluation commenced in Dublin but it is spreading throughout the country.  I am sure that the new Minister for Social Welfare is aware of the situation in Ennis, for example, where there has been a significant revaluation of small businesses. They will now attract an increase in commercial rates which will put an extra strain on them.</P>
    <P>I am not principally making the case for the business community but increasing rates on small businesses by amounts in excess of inflation and increasing rates on industry by amounts significantly in excess of inflation is a very peculiar job creation strategy.  If, by Government decision, the amount of taxation directly applied to those who provide jobs, industrialists and business people, is excessive, it is a very peculiar job creation policy.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Social Welfare in the Book of Estimates, in so far as it applies to the Social Insurance Fund, shows a decrease of £50 million.  That is obviously as a result of an expected increase in PRSI receipts.  The decrease in the amount applying to the Social Insurance Fund derives from the carry-over effect of the 1.25 per cent levy which, in the last budget, was made applicable to all incomes.  There was only a nine month effect this year and there will be a 12 month effect next year.  That is part of it <Col N="2380" /> but it is also achieved by raising the ceilings for PRSI for employee and employer contributions, which is implicit in the Book of Estimates.  The ceilings for employees are being raised to £19,000 which is a 5.5 per cent increase; the ceilings on employer contributions is going to £20,300, a 6.8 per cent increase. Consequently, a further £50 million is being imposed directly on jobs.  I fail to see the job strategy when an extra £50 million is being taken dirctly by a tax on jobs, which is what PRSI is.  It is probably the only direct tax on jobs.  It is a peculiar strategy in relation to job creation, especially at a time when the Government agree that the lack of jobs is the greatest problem facing the country, when the live register is at its highest level since the foundation of the State and when the Government in the Book of Estimates are making provision for an average of 275,000 persons on the live register for 1992.  We should remember that the provision is an average and I have no doubt that in the worst month of the year the figure of 300,000 will be reached.</P>
    <P>These two decisions on taxation underpin the Book of Estimates and the Government, through commercial rates, will impose huge increases in taxation on industry and business, on the very people who are supposed to create jobs.  They are also putting additional taxation on PRSI of £50 million on employers and employees.  They are doing this at a time when even small children can tell you that there are no jobs.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Government do not really have a policy on job creation and the link made by Government Ministers, especially by members of the Progressive Democrats between taxation and job creation, was not taken into account when the Book of Estimates was framed.  The recent renegotiated Programme for Government between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil stated on page 4 (2):</P>
    <P>The Government are agreed on the necessity for a programme of pro jobs tax reform.  The constrained budgetary <Col N="2381" /> prospects for the next few years do not take from the urgency of progressing towards such reforms.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 7 states:</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Government are committed to restructuring employee PRSI with the health and employment levies on an Exchequer neutral basis so as to make it more progressive and to consolidate it into a single main rate of 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>How do these aspects of the new programme, which is about six weeks old, relate to the decisions in relation to PRSI in the Book of Estimates?  The extra revenue from raising the ceilings might be called progressive, if that is your definition of progressive taxation, but it is being absorbed by extra expenditure right through the Book of Estimates. There are no resources available from the increase in the ceilings to dedicate to the consolidation of PRSI rates at a lower level than at present.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Progressive Democrats in this House for four years arguing the tax wedge theory of employment. They have argued it <i>ad nauseam</i> and have said: &ldquo;If only we could get the tax wedge reduced lots of jobs would be created, the whole unemployment problem is about the tax wedge.&rdquo;  I do not believe in that simplistic theory of the tax wedge; tax wedge plays its part but it is much less than the rhetorical claims made by the Progressive Democrats.  I fail to see how they can, with a straight face, turn the rhetoric on its head and actually participate in a Book of Estimates which increases the tax revenue in the way I have described.  They know, because they are ideologically based, that whether it is commercial rates, charges, direct or indirect taxation of PRSI that are increased they all contribute to the widening of the tax wedge.</P>
    <P>There are other increases implicit in the Book of Estimates also; for example, the daily charge for public wards in hospitals is being increased from £12 to £15.  I presume there are other decisions which are now rolled into large sums of money which will involve increased charges of one kind or another and which will emerge when questions are asked <Col N="2382" /> in the course of the Estimates' debate. These charges, and especially those in the hospitals, are directed by and large at the poor.  That will put increased pressure on the Minister at budget time when various people will seek social welfare increases.  The Minister has already written into the text of his speech that he expects increases of 3 per cent next year to cost £38 million, but if costs are only £38 million the Minister must have a date in mind which is very late in the year &mdash; because that is not the half year figure &mdash; for introducing the social welfare increases from 1 August or, perhaps, from mid-August but he is certainly not thinking of increasing the rates from 1 July.  Whether it is 1 July, 1 August or mid-August which is implicit in this figure &mdash; and I think it is 1 August &mdash; the pressure will be on in social welfare next year, not only on the level, because of the increased numbers unemployed, but on the rates also.  If the Minister says 3 per cent is all he can afford, it will still add another two-thirds of 1 per cent to his opening position on budget day.  That brings me to the figure of 6 per cent which I talked about earlier.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government have absolutely no strategy on job creation.  The rhetoric of the Progressive Democrats on the tax wedge is contradicted by the decisions in the Book of Estimates because the tax wedge is being increased in a manner which is clear.  Unemployment is a haemorrhage which is bleeding the country to death.  When the head of household on the average industrial wage losses his or her job the Exchequer loses about £13,000 in loss of income tax, PRSI contributions and also in welfare payments for which they become liable.  People must be put back to work.  A country cannot survive when 25 per cent of the labour force cannot get work.  The Government have no job creation strategy and in so far as they have a stated job creation strategy, every time they take decisions their actions contradict their theory.  Frankly, I do not know where this Government are going in terms of job creation and that is revealed clearly in the Book of Estimates. There is no doubt there are decisions in the Book of Estimates which <Col N="2383" /> will effectively cause extra unemployment and there is nothing that will provide extra employment.</P>
    <P>A prerequisite to job creation is confidence in the economy.  Confidence in the business community and in the country at large is directly linked to confidence in the Government and at present there is no confidence in the Government.  The instability and the scandals of the last four months, in particular, have led to a situation where those who make decisions about investment, which ultimately will lead to jobs, are deferring them.  That instability in Government is due to external factors and scandals in the business community.  I have said before that the only charge I ever made in relation to the scandals in the business community is that Ministers did not do their job.  I never made a charge that Ministers were involved, I just do not think they carried out their&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister can read the record but I have always charged that Ministers have been grossly negligent.  Those responsible for Greencore, Telecom and so on have been grossly negligent.  The negligence of Ministers has undermined confidence in the political system.  Secondly, the instability between the Government parties has undermined business confidence in the country.  There is also the constant playacting in which the Progressive Democrats engage where every week there is crisis and they are about to pull out and every Monday morning they are back in with a new deal.</P>
      <P>While preparing my notes for this debate I read again the Programme for Government which is now a redundant document, even though it is only six weeks old, and so also is the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which is less than 12 months old.  The theory expounded there is not being practised in the first set of major decisions in the Book of Estimates.  The fundamental decisions are running counter to the rhetoric of the Programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2384" /> The third area where confidence is being undermined is within the main Government party.  We on this side of the House or anybody else in the Opposition benches did not attempt to remove the Taoiseach from leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party and consequently from his position as Taoiseach.  I say to the members of Fianna Fáil that they have unfinished political business to sort out in which we all have an interest.  As long as the instability goes on the investment decisions will not be made by the business community.  I am sure Fianna Fáil members of the Government are receiving the same feedback from the business community as I am.  At present we are looking at an economy which is in decline, month by month it is slipping further back; some of the decline is due to international circumstances, some to lack of domestic demand but much of it is due to the political instability which derives directly from the composition of the Government.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like to make one remark on Government pay policy before I finish.  Our party voted against the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> last year and we explained in detail the reason we did so.  We agree that once the programme is agreed, it is a solemn agreement.  Once an agreement such as that is freely entered into I do not think the Government can depart unilaterally from it.  The Fine Gael Party believe that all pay issues should be settled in constructive discussions between those involved.  These discussions must be carried out in the light of the prevailing financial position facing the nation.  To move unilaterally, to seek by diktat to depart from what was agreed by free negotiations, is not the way to proceed.  We would also acknowledge there is a special obligation in regard to special pay increases which are already postponed from 1987.  We are very reluctant to see those special increases postponed further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised last Friday when the <Col N="2385" /> Minister for Finance, announced unilaterally that he was breaking the pay agreement, that the figures were fixed by diktat and that there would be no further discussion.  Yet, on Tuesday, no pay figure is included in the Book of Estimates, even though a pay figure is included in the press statement which accompanies the Book of Estimates.  I appeal to the Minister to go back again to the social partners, to the trade union movement and, in particular, to the public sector unions, to reopen talks and try to negotiate rather than to impose his will and that of the Government on a reluctant set of public service unions.  I fear the industrial chaos which could be caused if he proceeds as he commenced on Friday. I appeal to the Minister to reopen discussions during the Christmas period. The Minister does not need to know the figure for the Estimates until two days before the budget and there is much time for negotiation yet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start where Deputy Noonan left off on the question of pay in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The Labour Party voted for the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> last year because we believed the approach in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to social dialogue is the correct approach and that it cannot be taken on a very narrow basis, that it has to be taken over a period of time in which trust grows on all sides and the benefits can be shared and in difficult times the difficulties can be confronted. In European countries the same size as ours where such an approach has been applied over a period it has been remarkably successful.  The Minister for Finance is well aware of this because he has frequently referred to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that this very tired and divided Government should have within less than 12 months not only abandoned some of the formal commitments of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> but even the ideological philosophy that underpins it.  They have abandoned some of the claims for which they made such strong paeans of praise in the early part of last year.  These Estimates reflect a divided and confused <Col N="2386" /> Government.  The Minister in his speech referred to how upon becoming Minister for Finance he had a meeting with the trade union leaders at which he presented his analysis of the situation, asking them to reflect upon it and come back to him. Since they did not come back to him he then had no option but to go ahead and unilaterally break the terms of the pay deal.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is a well respected former Minister for Labour with good connections with the trade union movement, connections which are frequently trotted out as being among the major assets of the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Administration. Nobody in his right mind would think that a one off meeting with the trade union movement in which a particular analysis of an economic situation was presented, upon which they were supposed to reflect and then come back and capitulate, was a serious piece of negotiation.  Whoever is writing the Minister's speeches in the Department of Finance does not seem to have referred to the considerable expertise the Minister has acquired in his four years in the Department of Labour.  The speeches do not reflect the Minister's knowledge or expertise.  It is trite to the point of being insulting.  It is insulting to this House to think that that is the way in which the Minister did his business and it is insulting to the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>As a result, we are now on the edge of an uncertainty in relation to industrial relations in 1992, at a time when one of the few things over which we have full control is industrial relations.  If industrial relations deteriorate &mdash; and all the indications are that they will &mdash; in certain key areas the manner in which the social consensus that underpins the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was arbitrarily thrown overboard will have been one of the major causes of industrial unrest.  The Minister along with his Cabinet colleagues will have to take responsibility for this.  The die was well set.  The Department of Finance had decided a long way back when the Minister's predecessor. Deputy Albert Reynolds, announced unilaterally over the airwaves one Sunday morning that he was not <Col N="2387" /> going to meet the pay commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  All that the Minister, Deputy Ahern, has inherited is a position that was pretty well set in stone in Merrion Street.</P>
    <P>Last year according to official statistics, national wealth in Ireland grew by 7½ per cent to almost £23 billion.  National income was more than £5,000 per head of population, an increase of 11½ per cent. Gross disposable income rose in real terms by 5½ per cent.  The balance of payments showed a surplus of £864 million, more than double the previous year's.  These are good figures, even great ones.  The last time the whole set of national income and expenditure figures was that good was in 1969, when our present Taoiseach was Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Everybody in the real world, as distinct from those in the corridors of commentary and the economic experts, are asking the simple question: what has gone wrong and why are the figures so utterly meaningless?  In 1969 the Minister for Finance was able to use growth to introduce a range of benefits for pensioners, children and single parents. Now, in the Estimates published yesterday, programmes affecting all these categories of people and a great many more are being cut back.  In 1969, the Minister for Finance was able to introduce concessions to attract international artists in a number of disciplines to our shores, a much lauded initiative for which he got legitimate praise.  Today the Taoiseach, with responsibility for the Arts is presiding over the most dramatic reduction in the subvention for arts in over 20 years.</P>
    <P>In 1969 the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, who has been written out of history on one side of the House but who still remains in the history of the House, was able to say that if unemployment went over 100,000 he should not be re-elected and that the Government of which he was Taoiseach would not have been worthy to have been re-elected. Now his successor &mdash; a Taoiseach surrounded by the highest level of unemployment in the history of the State, <Col N="2388" /> surrounded by the most scandalous atmosphere we have ever experienced &mdash; cannot even be removed when a majority of his own party would, it appears, heartily want to see the back of him if they could.</P>
    <P>Something drastic has gone wrong and tragically the people to whom we have a responsibility do not understand the gap between reality and the figures I have just put on the record.  The problem is as follows.  In 1969 we had an economy which existed to serve the people.  Now, it is people who serve the economy, or so it would appear.  The truth is that it is pointless to talk about indicators as if the economy was somehow different to the people who live in it, who try to raise their families in it and who desperately want to work in it.  It is pointless to talk about the economy doing well if the people who are supposed to be the backbone of that economy are suffering.  It is pointless to talk about young people as our greatest asset if it is the asset that we export in the largest quantities.</P>
    <P>With each day that passes people are making choices.  This week they are deciding what they must do without in order to put meat on the table.  Next week thousands of families will face the agonising choice of telling their children that Santa Claus might not come this year.  Still this Government say the economy is doing well.  But the Estimates they have published are Estimates more appropriate to an economy in deep recession.  It is as if the last few years of belt-tightening and sacrifice had never happened.</P>
    <P>When the Estimates were published yesterday I pointed out that they provided an extra £276 million for the entire range of public services for next year.  I said that £100 million was accounted for by the extra pay and increments to which the Government are already committed. Another £100 million-£120 million was accounted for by extra spending on unemployment caused by the failure of Government policy to translate extra wealth in the economy into enough extra jobs in the economy.  I went on to point out that what that means is that across a whole range of essential social services &mdash; health, social welfare, education, <Col N="2389" /> environment &mdash; the actual position is that not nearly enough money has been provided to even begin to address the fundamental shortfalls that have bedevilled social policy in Ireland for the last five years.</P>
    <P>It appears that I was understanding the position.  More detailed analysis shows that virtually every penny of the extra money in the Estimates is already spent on the commitments I have mentioned. What that means is that there is not one extra penny for necessary, indeed vital, social reconstruction.</P>
    <P>The Book of Estimates is very short on specific policy decisions.  However, on the capital side, it is clear that, for example, there will be no new hospital building next year, which puts Deputy Flood, the Minister of State, into a uniquely difficult position.  There is something vindictive and cruel in a Taoiseach of the day appointing a Minister of State from a constituency to a particular Department with the unique responsibility to deliver the one thing which that constituency wants and then tells him that there is not any money for it.  It is an extraordinary way in which to make Government appointments.  That is just one example.  There will not be any new hospital building next year.  We will see little in the way of additional housing while the allocation for transport infrastructure has been cut.  Sanitary services are also going to suffer.</P>
    <P>On the current side, one has to highlight a range of the more important cuts. So far as the Department of the Environment are concerned the most significant of all is the cut in the rates relief grant to local authorities of 3 per cent in real terms.  The local authorities are already facing a crisis and the position can only get worse.  As Deputy Noonan has already pointed out, many marginal businesses and small enterprises, which are increasingly being recognised by most economists as having most potential to create sustainable jobs, are going to be squeezed further.  Local authority members around the country agonised over the increase they had to make in commercial rates because of the consequences this would have for the small but fragile services sector in their <Col N="2390" /> functional areas.  However, were it not for the significant increase made in the valuation base in Dublin city the local authority would have been in considerable difficulty this year.</P>
    <P>The allocation for social housing has, effectively, been frozen despite the fact that the Minister has a report available to him and the Department.  He has so far refused to make that report public.  It shows that the number of homeless has grown by over 40 per cent during the past two years.  Some local authorities have now been reduced to hiring rooms in bed and breakfast establishments to meet the needs of those who urgently need housing. Those of us who debated the Housing Bill in this Chamber a few years ago were anxious to avoid the disastrous experience and mistakes made in parts of the United Kingdom and the United States.  Given that the Department of the Environment have adopted a shorthanded policy this is the only option open to a local authority.</P>
    <P>There are significant cuts in the allocations for water and sewerage schemes.

      <P>However, in less than two years we are reducing the allocations for these critical components in the area of the environment, water and sewerage schemes.  In the area of education the irony is, despite the Minister's denials, provision has been made for ongoing funding in the Estimates for Carysfort in spite of the reservations expressed by the Progressive Democrats.  This story has not stopped running.  This is going to be paid for through the use of a range of cheese paring cutbacks in other more vulnerable areas throughout the Education Estimates.  For example, the allocation for childcare assistance in national schools for the handicapped will be cut. <Col N="2391" /> Youth services and sporting organisations will also help to pay the bill for Carysfort.  In this speech the Minister referred to the reduction in the grants for youth services and sporting organisations.</P>
      <P>It is no coincidence that the political profile of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has disappeared almost underground. This is the man who was going to build sports centres all over the country and who delivered cheques on a Wednesday and took them back on a Friday to make sure that he received a mention in <i>The Sligo Champion</i> with the same cheque which was probably presented more frequently than any other piece of currency.  That Minister of State and the policy he enunciated have disappeared over the political horizon.</P>

      <P>The crisis facing the health boards will continue unabated.  As Deputy Noonan has already said, the increases in the charges at the point of entry will hit the most vulnerable and those least able to pay.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that more than £100 million will be needed to meet extra unemployment payments the total allocation for social welfare has only been increased by £60 million.  The colleague of the Minister for Finance will have to answer the question very quickly: when will the increases take effect in 1992?  Will they take effect from 1 September?  From our analysis of the figures, it seems that the increases will be either minimal or non-existent or alternatively presented in such a way as to satisfy the spend doctors in the present administration who will argue that they should only be paid from 1 September onwards.  We will listen with interest to the explanation the Minister for Social Welfare will give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we start with the Minister's analysis of the performance of the economy and where we stand in relation to Economic and Monetary Union, one could reasonably ask the question what is the economy for if it is not for the people?  What is the purpose in having a Government to try <Col N="2392" /> to manage the affairs of the State, to attract industry, to create employment, to invest in education, health services and so on, if it is not for the people?  There is something wrong with a society which fails to create the number of jobs that the people require.  We are unique in contrast with any of the other member states of the European Community.  I would not for one moment profess to say that the Labour Party have the answer to the unemployment crisis but it is inexplicable that this Coalition Government, who are extraordinarily arrogant &mdash; there is no other word for it &mdash; refuse to enter dialogue with anybody else in the Chamber to find a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>They are able to say with indifference &mdash; perhaps this is an attempt to conceal the enormity of the problem &mdash; that the Minister for Finance and the Department now project that the unemployment figure, on average, in 1992 will stand at 275,000.  This was inconceivable up to five years ago.  If our roles were reversed and the Fianna Fáil Party, under the united leadership of Deputy Haughey, were in Opposition on this side of the House on this night and Deputy Noonan and I were sitting on the other side of the House the screams, devoid of any policy content, would be unbelievable as was the case in the period 1982-87.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have consistently during the past few years invited others to join with them to jointly look for a solution in those areas where there were possibilities to be explored.  The Government have, however, refused to establish a European affairs committee, who could discuss the issue of Economic and Monetary Union to see what the consequences of this would be &mdash; the Government face a very difficult referendum on this issue &mdash; to respond to the invitation from the Fine Gael Party to establish a national jobs forum or to our own proposal to set up an economic and social affairs committee who could analyse what has gone wrong and see what we can do together to get it right.</P>
    <P>The Government's refusal to enter into constructive dialogue, when they would listen, will sound the death knell for this Administration.  Is it any wonder therefore that the trade unions did not come <Col N="2393" /> back to the Minister?  Does the Minister think that the Central Review Committee are an alternative democratic forum to steer this nation through difficult times? This is part of the mysticism which surrounds the Taj Mahal next door where there is a belief that if one talks to enough mirrors the same answer will come back all the time and everybody is in unison.</P>
    <P>These Estimates and the figures which underpin them and the framework in which they have been formulated &mdash; the Minister has no control over some factors but there are others over which he has considerable control &mdash; are an indictment of our failure to carry out our most fundamental task which is to create employment. There has been no indication since the House returned in October that the Government are capable of gathering their ranks together, let alone the ranks within the Chamber, to deal with this problem.  It would not be too bad if they were on automatic pilot since October because the permanent administration would at least know that we were going somewhere, but this Government have been grounded, like aeroplanes at Dublin Airport when the air traffic control computer goes off line.</P>
    <P>However, we in this Chamber will not suffer.  The people who are going to suffer are those who are going to be deprived of things they thought they were going to get if they tightened their belts and withdrew their demands for a larger slice of the cake.  The labour force have done everything that they have been asked to do by the economists, the commentators and everyone else &mdash; to show more flexibility, to increase productivity, moderate their wage demands, to guarantee harmony in industrial relations with regard to stoppages and to co-operate with the other side of industry.  They were told that if they did that, in marked contrast to what had gone on in the past, the climate would be ripe for the private sector to produce the jobs they, and their children, require.  That has not happened and as a result the Government have lost the trust of the people and they will lose more and more of that trust as a result of these Estimates.</P>

      <P>This debate is an <Col N="2394" /> opportunity not just to discuss the Estimates for 1992 but also to assess the Government's performance during the course of this session.  When the Government returned after the summer recess it was an administration rocked by scandal and with major question marks hanging over the conduct and performance of the Taoiseach and several of his Ministers on a number of issues.  They finish the session with their credibility even more damaged, with most of the questions still unanswered and with the reputation of the Taoiseach at an all time low.</P>
      <P>We have had ten extraordinary weeks since 16 October.  The Government faced a motion of no-confidence in the first week of this Dáil session.  We saw the Government go to the brink as Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats engaged in a phoney war over the renegotiation of the Programme for Government. We saw the Taoiseach dismiss his Ministers for Finance and the Environment as he successfully fought off a leadership challenge within Fianna Fáil. We saw 22 members of Fianna Fáil vote no confidence in Deputy Haughey, which means that he is a Taoiseach who enjoys the support of only about one-third of the Members of the Dáil.  We then saw him, in a characteristic gross error of judgement, totally botch the subsequent Cabinet reshuffle as the Dáil forced him, in an unprecedented move, to withdraw his nomination for the position of Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>With each new week &mdash; sometimes on a daily basis &mdash; there were new shocks, new disclosures, new scandals, new questions about the competence and accountability of Government Ministers.  We saw all the usual public agonising by the Progressive Democrats followed by the private compromises.  This is now a Government who are battered, bleeding and quite probably approaching their death throes.  Public confidence in the Taoiseach and in his Government is at an all time low.  The whole political process has been further damaged and political cynicism increased by the questionable performance of the Government.  There will be no hope of restoring confidence or undoing the damage until the Taoiseach is forced to resign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2395" /> The legislative record of the Government in this session has been as abysmal as their performance in most other areas. Little legislation of significance has been passed in these past ten weeks.  My figures suggest that the Dáil completed nine Bills during the session; several of these have been around for a long time and in regard to a number of them it was simply the final stages that were taken.  Several important Bills, like the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, remain uncompleted, while other important items like the Family Planning (Amendment), Bill seem to have been shelved.  The two most important Bills in this session, the B &amp; I Line Bill and the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Bill, were rushed through in a shameful manner with the Dáil denied a proper opportunity to discuss them as a result of the shameful use by the Government of the guillotine.</P>
    <P>The pattern of this session has been similar to many others, with short sittings at the beginning and little legislation being taken, while in the final weeks the Government demand that the Dáil sits all hours and rams legislation through without proper consideration.  This is no way to run a democratic Parliament.</P>
    <P>The original Programme for Government, agreed in July 1989, promised substantial Oireachtas reform by the end of that year, but we are still waiting.  The review of the Programme for Government agreed by the two parties at the outset of this session, included further commitments on Dáil reform but not one reform proposal has yet been brought forward.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness and credibility of the Oireachtas depend on procedures striking the proper balance between the right of the Government to get on with the business of Government and the right of Opposition parties to question, to query, to raise matters, to challenge, to contribute alternative views, to initiate new proposals and, where necessary, to oppose Government proposals.  The Standing Orders and the rules of procedure, as presently constituted, do not strike the right balance and are unfairly <Col N="2396" /> tilted in favour of whatever Government are in power.  We must face up to the high degree of public cynicism out there in the real world about the effectiveness of the Dáil and the performance of Deputies.  Unless we set about modernising our procedures and ensuring that the Dáil is relevant to the lives of our citizens and is seen to be relevant, the degree of public cynicism will grow and grow.</P>
    <P>The publication of these Estimates mark what I believe is a very significant development in the economic approach of this Government.  Since Deputy Haughey was returned as Taoiseach in 1987, he proclaimed that the cornerstone of his economic policy was to seek and secure consensus with what are generally known as the social partners.  First, we had the Programme for National Recovery and this was followed by the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> agreed earlier this year.</P>
    <P>When the Government announced their decision on Friday last to unilaterally breach the pay terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> they effectively reversed the Taoiseach's approach on economic policy.  We warned that it could sound the death-knell for national pay agreements generally.  We pointed out that public sector workers were not the cause of the budgetary difficulties and that they should not be asked to carry the can for the Government's economic miscalculations. We also pointed out that had the situation been reversed, and had the trade unions been approaching the Government to up the pay increases agreed for its members, they would not have even got a hearing from the Government.</P>
    <P>In my statement last Friday I posed the following specific question: if the Government are allowed to wriggle out of the pay commitments which were the most detailed and specific elements of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> what prospect is there of forcing them to meet the many vague and aspirational elements in so many other areas of the agreement?  I did not have long to wait to have my question answered.  It is in these Estimates.  It is now quite clear that the Government <Col N="2397" /> have not just reneged on their pay commitments but have welshed on many other solemn undertakings given on health, education, and agriculture among others.  In fact, the Estimates take no account of commitments made in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  It was as if the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was not there when the Estimates were being drawn up.  These might be described as the new disimproved <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>-free Estimates.</P>
    <P>Promise after promise made in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has been ignored and it seems to me that the Government have not just abandoned their pay commitments but are abandoning the entire principle of the agreement.  No provision has been made for the improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio, for an increase in capitation grants, for the additional vice-principals, guidance counsellors, secretaries or caretakers or for other non-pay elements promised under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> included a commitment to a seven year programme for the development of community-based health and associated services.  It promised that funding would be provided in each subsequent budget but not a single penny has been allocated for this purpose in these Estimates.  Instead we have had the announcement of a mean and petty decision to increase the daily hospital charges for patients to £15.  The charges were also increased last December and this means they have now been increased by 50 per cent within 12 months.  These charges constitute a form of double taxation, as workers are already paying substantial health contributions.  A person on the average industrial wage now pays more than £150 per year in respect of the health element of PRSI.  The Government are clearly using the health services as a source of raising revenue.  Such a large increase in the hospital in-patient charge is particularly unjustified.  The 50 per cent increase is more than five times the level of inflation since the charge was first introduced in 1987.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2398" /> Overseas development aid is another area where <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commitments have been abruptly discarded.  Despite the promise of the Government to reach the United Nations' target figure of 0.7 per cent of GNP, the Estimates allocation for ODA actually represents a drop from 0.19 per cent last year to 0.17 per cent this year.  This is surely one of the meanest cuts of all and will ensure that Ireland will remain in its shameful position at the bottom of the OECD list of ODA donors.</P>
    <P>Farmers are angry over the denial of promised headage payments and over the further cutbacks in funding for Teagasc. The further cuts in the Teagasc budget are indefensible at a time when there was never such a need for research and training to help farmers adapt to the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>It is the same with almost every section of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress:</i> promises made at the beginning of the year now being ignored. The workers are disillusioned, the trade unions are disillusioned, the farmers are disillusioned.  The only ones endorsing what is left of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> at this stage are the Government and the employers.  But the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, will find that an agreement backed by the Government and the bosses but without the support of workers and farmers will be of little value in solving this country's economic and social problems.</P>
    <P>Our lack of confidence in these Estimates goes much deeper than their failure to honour <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commitments.  It is clear that while the overall Estimates are up, a number of crucial areas of social importance has been subjected to severe cutbacks.  Public Capital Programme spending on housing has declined from £365 million in 1983 to £122 million in 1991.  Local authority housing starts have reached an all time low, with money being provided for only about 1,000 next year.  The inevitable result of this will be longer waiting lists for applicants and poorer housing maintenance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2399" /> The whole collapse of local government services has been one of the most alarming features of Irish life in recent years.  Councils are being forced to operate on budgets which represent just a fraction of what they should be getting if their grants had been index linked for inflation, as was promised when domestic rates were abolished in 1977 by Fianna Fáil.  The result of this has been not just service charges in many areas but also a virtual ending of local authority house building, the deterioration of existing housing stocks, miles and miles of potholed roads, cutbacks in a whole range of local authority services and a general deterioration in the environment.  The consequent environmental decay has a knock on impact in many other areas of life.  The deterioration of local authority housing estates, the withdrawal of facilities and services and the general neglect of communities feeds the sort of violence and vandalism which we saw in severe form in the west of Dublin just a few weeks ago and which is found to a lesser extent in many other communities.</P>
    <P>Against this background the decision of the Government to freeze the local authority rates support grant at its 1991 level almost defies comprehension.  This will represent a decrease of at least 3 per cent in real terms, possibly more if inflation is higher than expected.  Local authorities have gone to the brink in many areas this year and major cities like Cork and Limerick have been able to approve their estimates only at the eleventh hour.  Because of the effective reduction in the rates support grant for next year they are likely to face an even more difficult task in 1992.  We will see a further deterioration in services and the probable abolition of several local authorities as a result of their inability to balance the books.</P>
    <P>Another incredible cut is the reduction of 15 per cent in the allocation for the building and equipping of primary schools.  Yet there are primary schools all over the country where teachers and pupils must endure dreadful conditions. My colleague, Deputy Sherlock, told the Dáil on 4 December of one such school in his area, Baltydaniel national school, <Col N="2400" /> where 115 pupils are attending a school built in 1884, a school which has been condemned by the fire officer and where conditions are so bad that the local medical officer has described it as a potential source of salmonella and hepatitis.  There are many other schools in similar situations; yet this Government consider that they can afford to cut back on spending on primary schools.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the single most disappointing aspect of the Estimates is the failure of the Government to come up with even a single new initiative for job creation.  The Government seem to have thrown in the towel and opted out of the struggle against unemployment.  This Government appear to consider an average unemployment level for 1992 of 275,000 to be politically acceptable.  Apart from the moral and social arguments as to why we should combat unemployment, it is also very clear that there is an unanswerable economic argument for urgent action to deal with the problem.  Unemployment is penalising not just the unemployed but every citizen of the State. The burden on the economy arising from unemployment is now so great that there does not seem to be any way in which the economy can be restored to full health until the majority of those on the dole queues are put to productive work.  It is clear from these Estimates that the major factor contributing to the Government's budget figures being so off target is the growth in unemployment.</P>
    <P>The full cost to the Exchequer of unemployment is notoriously hard to compute, but from official figures it is possible to establish that the direct cost in terms of additional social welfare payments and income tax foregone is at least £2,500 million per year.  To this must be added indirect losses to the State such as lower VAT and excise returns arising from the reduced purchasing power of the unemployed, lower rent returns to local authorities, extra health costs, supplementary welfare payments and so on. We can only speculate as to the cost of these elements, but when they are taken into account the total cost of unemployment is likely to be closer to £3,000 million.</P>
    <P>Shocking as these figures are, they are <Col N="2401" /> only part of the picture.  Of even more significance is the human and social cost &mdash; the families broken, the lives destroyed and talents wasted by the scourge of unemployment.  The abandonment by successive Governments of the unemployed is reaping a bitter harvest of poverty, crime, vandalism and social alienation.  This is especially so in urban areas, where unemployment is demoralising and destroying entire communities.</P>
    <P>The utter failure on unemployment has been the greatest possible indictment of the record of all recent Governments.  It is an appalling reflection on our values as a society that unemployment has not been below 100,000 since 1980 and has never been below 200,000 since 1984. With unemployment being such an overwhelming problem one would have expected that it would have dominated the recent discussions on the review of the Programme for Government and the preparations of these Estimates.  Instead it hardly seems to have figured at all. Have this Government no sense of values, no sense of what our priorities as a society should be?  We cannot turn a blind eye to the problem of unemployment and simply hope that it will go away, or simply wheedle £100 million from Brussels to be spent on short term cheap labour schemes.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party reject the notion that such a level of unemployment can ever become the norm in our society. Unemployment must be treated as the national disaster it is.  We must force whatever Government are in power to give it the priority it merits.  For their failure to offer any hope to the unemployed and for the other reason I have outlined, The Worker's Party will be voting against this Book of Estimates. Indeed, I am about to move an amendment seeking the rejection of these Estimates.</P>
    <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after `Dáil éireann' and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;noting that the 1992 Estimates for the Public Service and the 1991 Summary Public Capital Programme:</P>
    <P>(a)  fail to provide for a number of <Col N="2402" /> commitments freely entered into by the Government including those on public service pay, the reduction of the pupil/teacher ratio at primary level, and an increase in Overseas Development Aid;</P>
    <P>(b)  provide for an increase in the daily charges for hospital patients of 25 per cent, representing a total increase of 50 per cent in 12 months, but do not include any specific commitments to assist the plight of the mentally handicapped and their families, despite the clearly established need in this area;</P>
    <P>(c)  will result in further reduction in capital expenditure on areas like public housing and the construction and equipping of primary schools;</P>
    <P>(d)  include no new initiatives to deal with unemployment, despite the fact that the Government estimates that the average jobless level in 1992 will reach 275,000,</P>
    <P>calls on the Government to withdraw the Estimates and to redraft them in such a manner as will ensure that essential public services are re-established on a sound basis and to enable employment to be tackled by stimulating a more rapid rate of job creation.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion gives me the opportunity to do two things: first, to set down the broad direction of policy which I propose to follow in 1992 and, second, to indicate the financial provisions which will in effect ensure that the sick, the handicapped, the old and the unemployed will be better catered for in 1992.  The size of the financial provision graphically illustrates the enormous task we are faced with.  By any standards the provision which has been allocated for the social welfare budget is significant against a background of severe financial constraints and a difficult budgetary situation. The Social Welfare Estimate for 1992 is a major achievement on the Government's part and should ensure that our commitment to the maintenance <Col N="2403" /> of the living standards of the less well off sections in our community are fully protected at this difficult time.  The net Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare for 1992 is almost £1,773 million. This is the amount provided by the general taxpayer, it is the Exchequer's contribution to social welfare services and is nearly £57 million more than the provision allowed for in 1991.</P>
      <P>It is important to make the point that at this time of the year the 1991 provisional out-turn and the 1992 Estimates are not strictly comparable.  The Estimates for 1992 provide for the carry-over costs of the increases given in the 1991 budget. They amount to about £81 million.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for affording me this opportunity to give expression to this problem. I am very pleased that the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, is here.  I am quite sure that he in his own area is very conversant with the problem to which I shall relate in my appeal to him.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to have a revision of the criteria currently governing the reclassification of farms from disadvantaged to more severely handicapped undertaken without further delay.  Under the present criteria a farmer seeking reclassification to that category cannot exceed 40 per cent of the national farm income, which would mean at present levels an income of £3,000 per annum.  Such income is, of course, totally unrealistic.</P>
      <P>Currently there is a very large number of appeals under investigation but unless the revision I am seeking is completed and new guidelines are adopted very few of the appeals will be successful.</P>
      <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> a firm commitment was given that the criteria would be revised in advance of the appeals.  I quote from the programme:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In negotiations with the Commission <Col N="2404" /> on the current headage proposal, the Government will examine the extent to which marginal areas which were not included for classification and reclassification could subsequently be included and in addition the appeal body will be asked to take particular account of this issue.  As regards reclassification, the criteria will be reviewed in advance to enable the case of marginal areas to be considered.</P>
    <P>That is the basis of my appeal to the Minister today; to have the revision undertaken and replaced before any decisions are made on any of the appeals submitted to his Department, the termination date for appeals being 6 December 1991.</P>
    <P>Any decision to proceed with the investigation of appeals on the existing criteria would cause massive dissatisfaction among the farming communities concerned. These communities are looking forward to the increased benefit from EC payments applicable to the more severely handicapped areas as the only hope of avoiding extreme hardship on many small farms consequent to the reduction in milk prices, in milk quotas and in cattle prices in recent years.</P>
    <P>Decisions to extend disadvantaged areas and to extend the reclassification by 1.5 million acres were welcomed in the Government's programme. However, unless what I am seeking here tonight, the revision of the criteria, is forthcoming there is no possibility that a very substantial volume of that acreage will be admitted to the reclassified category within the existing criteria.  That criteria set out very clearly that to be successful farmers must have less than 40 per cent of the national farm income.  At the moment that figure is £3,000.</P>
    <P>I wish to point out that neither £3,000, £5,000 nor £7,000 would be sufficient today.  Therefore I appeal to the Minister tonight to have the revision undertaken and completed before the decisions on reclassification appeals commence.  By doing so, he will earn the gratitude and confidence of a large number of small farmers.</P>

      <P>Deputies may be interested to know that not one hectare was reclassified in west Cork under the recent review.  I am hoping that we will do a little better under the appeal.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, to be reclassified from less to more severely handicapped status an area must be homogeneous, consist of poor land and have the characteristics of low farm incomes, heavy dependence on agriculture and satisfy the following criteria: (1) less than 7.8 per cent of ploughed land; (2) less than one livestock unit per forage hectare; (3) less than 40 per cent of the national average family farm income per male farm worker; (4) population density less than 27 per square kilometre; (5) more than 40 per cent of the working population engaged in farming.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy has pointed out, it is most difficult to meet those criteria. Therefore, in line with the commitment made in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> my Department are at present reviewing the criteria, particularly criteria Nos. 3 and 5, those relating to family farm income and the percentage of the working population engaged in agriculture.  That is to enable the case of marginal areas under appeal to be considered for reclassification in association with the appeals panel.</P>
      <P>The Department's proposals to modify those criteria will be discussed with the appeals panel and the outcome will be announced in the new year.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for selecting my question and I thank the Minister of State for coming in to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2406" /> The lady who is the subject of this question lives in Ballina, County Mayo. She is 48, married and has a young dependent family.  She has a medical card.  Her husband is a small farmer in receipt of social welfare.</P>
    <P>The woman has a chronic heart condition. She was referred by her doctor to University College Hospital, Galway where the specialist attending to her said that a heart by-pass operation is an absolute necessity in her case.  The patient was put on the waiting list for the Mater Hospital in Dublin.  That was 18 months ago and she is still on the waiting list.</P>
    <P>There is no sign as of now of her being called for the operation.  Certainly neither she, her husband nor her GP seem to have any indication as to when she is likely to be called or, more important, when she is likely to be operated on.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, this woman's condition has deteriorated rapidly.  She is in considerable pain and is on very strong painkillers and additional medication as well.  Her painkillers have been increased to the maximum sustainable level.  The position is that she cannot do even the most basic, simple or mundane household chores.</P>
    <P>The raw reality for this patient is that if she is not operated on soon &mdash; and I mean very soon &mdash; she will literally be gone beyond the point of anything being done for her, it will be too late and she will be too weak.  I am talking about a relatively young woman.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the former Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, for his replies to my various representations, in particular for his reply to my letter in September, his reply of 26 September 1991, a reply to my plea that this woman be treated as a priority.  Unfortunately, nothing has happened since and the woman's condition has now deteriorated to such an extent that, unless something happens within the next few weeks, she may die.  I must reiterate my special plea to the Minister to see this case for what it is, for the priority it is, to see it as a matter of life and death so that this relatively young woman can be returned to normal health and play a full role as a wife, a mother and a member of the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would first like to remind the Deputy that the success of new surgical procedures, such as by-pass operations, has resulted in an ever-increasing demand worldwide for these procedures.  As a result waiting lists remain a problem despite the increase in facilities available.  Even with the development of services hospitals worldwide are finding it difficult to keep up with the increasing demand for cardiac surgery and a wide range of other surgical and medical procedures.</P>
      <P>I understand that the person referred to by the Deputy was put on the Mater Hospital waiting list for by-pass operations in November, 1990.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that cardiac surgery is performed in two units, one at Cork Regional Hospital and one in the Mater Hospital, Dublin.  Patients from the Western Health Board area are generally referred to the facilities at the Mater Hospital.</P>
      <P>The facts of the present situation regarding cardiac surgery have already been spelled out on a number of occasions previously.  Briefly, my Department have an agreement with the Mater Hospital going back to 1987 that an annual target of 750 by-pass operations should be aimed at and the hospital receives funding for these operations on that basis.</P>
      <P>In January 1990 cardiac surgeons at the Mater Hospital advised the hospital that they would have to retain their cardiac patients there for the full duration of their post-operative stay.  This change in practice had knock-on effects, it created a longer length of stay for cardiac patients than previously obtained and a consequent reduction in the number of patients being operated upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to this situation, the former Minister for Health instructed his officials to look urgently at ways and means of improving this situation with the authorities of the Mater Hospital with a view to restoring the activity of the cardiac surgery unit to the previously agreed levels.  Special additional funding was approved for the provision of ten additional cardiac surgery beds, which came into operation on 2 April 1991.  The <Col N="2408" /> total costs involved in the project were quite significant.  The total capital cost was £421,000 made up of £235,000 for renovation and upgrading works and £186,000 for equipment.  Furthermore, £400,000 additional annual staffing costs were approved which is, of course, a cost which must be provided on an on-going basis each year.</P>
    <P>The chief medical officer of my Department was also requested to review cardiac surgery waiting lists in consultation with the cardiac surgeons and cardiologists. A number of discussions took place with a view to identifying how best to further increase the throughput of by-pass operations.  Subsequently, the Mater Hospital and St. James's Hospital were invited to submit a proposal regarding their hospitals' ability to meet an increase from 750 to 1,000 by-pass operations per annum.  An option appraisal of their proposals is currently being undertaken by my Department.  Proposals for the extension of cardiac surgery in Cork have also been submitted to my Department.</P>
    <P>As I have already outlined, significant additional resources have been allocated to cardiac surgery over the last two years in spite of the overall financial restrictions. However, the Minister and I are conscious, that more remains to be done. It is intended to allocate additional resources during 1992 to enable a start to be made on expanding services in Cork and Dublin.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise to the Deputy that if the patient to whom he refers is concerned about her condition, as would appear to be the case certainly from Deputy Higgins' plea this evening &mdash; she should, as is normal practice, contact her family doctor, or her cardiologist, directly who will be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of her case to a consultant at the cardiac surgery unit.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  I appreciate your giving me the opportunity of raising this issue this evening.  While it relates primarily to a specific child it has wider implications.  I raise the matter on the Adjournment this evening because, for <Col N="2409" /> more than three years, the child referred to in my question effectively has received no formal schooling because of a lack of specialised facilities and co-ordination in our health and education services.  This position has continued despite a number of parliamentary questions having been tabled by me on the matter.</P>
      <P>The child involved is at present 12 years old.  Due to a combination of serious home circumstances and severe emotional disturbance he has been unable to adapt to normal school life and, in his present condition, is unsuited to the normal classroom situation.  He is not a delinquent and has not been in trouble with the law in any formal sense.  Due to the extent of his educational and emotional difficulties it is now clear that he requires residential care and education. I have sought, through numerous parliamentary questions, to draw this problem to the attention of the Ministers for Education and Health, to ensure co-ordination of their response and prevent the buck being passed.</P>
      <P>Eighteen months ago, on 12 June 1990, in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 144 the Minister for Education stated:</P>
      <P>All assessments on the child ... indicate a requirement for residential placement in a special school.</P>
      <P>The Minister added that the Eastern Health Board were endeavouring to secure such a placement.</P>
      <P>A year ago, on 4 December 1990, the Minister for Education again stated:</P>
      <P>My Department's school inspector is continuing to liaise closely with the Eastern Health Board on this matter with a view to securing such a placement as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Two months ago, on 24 October 1991, the Minister for Health had this to say:</P>
      <P>Pending the provision of suitable residential care, the health board provided a child care worker in the home to relieve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, the care worker was not provided in the child's home but rather in a local public facility.  That response, however welcome, according to three separate Ministerial replies, is <Col N="2410" /> inadequate and can be a temporary solution only.  What is required is residential care.</P>
    <P>In reply to a letter of mine to the director of community care I received a reply on 14 October last stating: &ldquo;We are continuing our search for a suitable placement for this boy, to date without success&rdquo;.  As of today they have still had no success.</P>
    <P>I might refer the Minister also to the child abuse guidelines of the Department of Health, section 4.4, stating that action must be taken by the community care social worker in cases where a child is at serious/immediate risk.  Why has the required action not been taken in this case, a number of years after it came to the full attention of the health authorities?</P>
    <P>I might also refer the Minister to page 25 of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> under the heading &ldquo;Development of Community-based and Associated Services&rdquo;, which states that there will be major developments in child care and family support services.  When will these be effected?  When will the relevant provisions of the Child Care Act be implemented to ensure the requisite number of social workers, psychologists and home support services are provided? If the health authorities cannot provide the requisite care now what will be the position when new, expanded child care legislation is implemented providing for additional regulations and requirements in this whole area?</P>
    <P>I know that this whole matter has been of considerable concern to those working directly with the health authorities in the child care area.  However, I understand that all efforts to provide adequate services are being frustrated by lack of resources.  For instance, I am informed that plans exist to develop a special unit, based in Wicklow, for children with emotional disturbance, that a project leader has been selected but that the project cannot proceed due to lack of staff. Perhaps the Minister would confirm whether that is the case.</P>
    <P>Again, from people working directly in the health care area, I understand there may be up to an additional ten to 15 children in a similar plight throughout <Col N="2411" /> the Dublin area alone.  It is now imperative for the Government to take whatever action is necessary to provide the funding and resources necessary to ensure that the child to whom I refer specifically, and other similarly affected, receive the requisite attention.  The time for exploring every option is past.  The necessary action must now be taken.  There is a child in grave risk.  The Minister must take action to ensure that that risk is abated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to say that the Minister for Health and I recognise the difficulties which exist in our mental handicap services at present, particularly in the eastern region.</P>
      <P>I have great sympathy for the person referred to by the Deputy.  The Eastern Health Board are very much aware of this person's special needs.  The board have assigned a case worker to him during the day who also works in the home to relieve the situation.  The board have arranged that he attend a resource centre during the day.  The board accept his need for specialised residential care. They are in continuous contact with each service-providing-agency seeking to have this person placed.  I understand that a further case conference will be held tomorrow.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the health board are exploring every option to find an appropriate service to meet the special needs of this person.  However, problems do exist.  The fundamental problem which we face is that the number of people requiring services has been growing faster than the capacity of services to meet their needs. The nub of the challenge is to develop services for people with mental handicap in the way that matches their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Health explained in the House on 11 December the Government are committed to the provision of adequate and appropriate services as recommended in the report, <i>Needs and Abilities.</i>  Both the Minister and I intend to make progress towards implementing this commitment in 1992. The ideal to which we aspire is the provision of a residential and a day place for people with mental handicap who have <Col N="2412" /> been assessed by professionals as in need of such places.</P>
    <P>We recognise the need to accelerate the provision of additional residential and day places to meet the backlog of need for services.  Additional places will be developed in 1992.  The Minister for Health will be making specific announcements in this regard during the lead up to the budget.  These places will be offered to people on the priority lists in each health board area.  Respite care will be provided to families caring for a person with mental handicap at home.</P>
    <P>We also recognise the need to provide, as a matter of urgency, additional support to families caring for a person with mental handicap where that person is waiting for a day or residential place. These families will receive greater assistance with the burden of caring.</P>
    <P>It is also our intention in 1992 to improve services for people with mental handicap who are also disturbed. Because of the scale of the problem in the Eastern Health Board region it is the Minister's intention to make special provision for this region in 1992.</P>
    <P>I remind the Deputy that the regulations to give effect to the Child Care Act are being drawn up in the Department. We have assigned people with specific responsibility to expedite the drawing up of the regulations so that we may implement them as quickly as possible.  We have already implemented one of the regulations effective from 1 December 1991 which relates to solvent abuse.  Arising out of an allocation of resources in 1991 to allow for the phased implementation of the Child Care Act, we found ourselves able to approve up to 40 additional social workers nationally, ten of whom were assigned for specific purposes in the Eastern Health Board region.</P>
    <P>With regard to the facility in Wicklow, the Deputy pointed out that there are difficulties with staff, but the difficulties do not arise from lack of resources but rather the inability of the health board to recruit suitably qualified personnel.  The facility is being developed by the health board and they hope to bring it into operation in the early part of 1992.  This may <Col N="2413" /> well be the place most suitable for the person whose case the Deputy has raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for affording me this opportunity. It is more than a year since a deputation from Burtonport met the Minister for the Marine when the planned development of Burtonport Harbour was discussed.  There are two dimensions to the development, namely dredging and an extension to the pier. Of the two, the most important is the dredging.  The position has reached a critical point.  Only small vessels and craft can gain access to the harbour.  Many local fishermen can no longer operate out of their home port and they have to travel to Killybegs and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The mackerel and herring processing industry in Burtonport is being slowly strangled due to the fact that fish have to be transported by lorry to the processing locations at Burtonport.</P>
      <P>In the recent past Burtonport Harbour was used by the Gweedore Industrial Estate to import raw material such as steel from Europe.  That tradition has been discontinued due to inaccessibility by sea.</P>
      <P>Burtonport also serves as a port of departure for the biggest island off the Donegal coast &mdash; Arranmore.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for the island ferry boat <i>Misneach</i> to provide and maintain the excellent standard of service to which we have become accustomed.</P>
      <P>The dredging aspect of the development was given the green light in 1986 and was to commence in 1987.  Due to economic and financial constraints this has been postponed every year since then and today the situation has reached crisis proportions.  Further development of the fishing and processing industry in this part of the Donegal Gaeltacht will be impossible unless immediate dredging of the harbour is carried out.  Existing jobs could be in jeopardy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the meeting with the Minister in November 1990 we all understood that work would commence not later than 1992.  I am requesting the Minister of <Col N="2414" /> State to convey my request to the Minister for the Marine, who is in Brussels negotiating on behalf of fishermen, to stand by the undertaking given at that meeting.  Work should at least commence on the dredging in 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West) Michael J. (Limerick West) Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> The Fishery Harbours Development Programme sets out my Department's priorities to the end of 1993.  The programme provides for substantial investment in the development of the fishery harbour centres which are owned by my Department and of other strategically located fishing ports around the country which are the responsibility of the relevant local authorities.  The Deputy will be aware of some of the important projects which have been advanced under the programme in County Donegal.  I am referring in particular to the works completed at Cladnageeragh and the ongoing works at Greencastle, each of which is of considerable benefit to local fishermen and, by extension, the local economy.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to Burtonport is that in the first instance the harbour is the responsibility of Donegal County Council.  The Fishery Harbours Development Programme makes provision for the dredging of the approach channel at an estimated cost of £1 million.  This work when completed will allow Burtonport to handle the larger vessels which are increasingly becoming a feature of the fishing fleet.  The project will attract grant aid from my Department to the tune of 75 per cent, the balance will fall to be paid by Donegal County Council.  There is no provision in the programme for extending the pier nor do my Department have any plans to do so at present.</P>
      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question from the Deputy on 6 November last, the Minister set out the up to date position regarding the Burtonport project.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position with regard to the dredging work proposed for Burtonport is that a hydrographic survey has been undertaken to determine the bed level and a probing survey has been recently completed to establish the <Col N="2415" /> extent of the rock which is present. The results of these investigations are currently being evaluated.  Work on the actual dredging will proceed as resources permit.</P>
    <P>The situation has not changed materially in the interim.</P>
    <P>A programme of harbour works for 1992 is being finalised by my Department at the moment.  The programme must take account of the level of ongoing works; the priority attaching to the many investment proposals being considered; and, most importantly, the amount of funding available for fishery harbour <Col N="2416" /> developments in 1992.  With regard to this latter criterion, the Deputy will be aware that the Government have allocated £3.5 million for the development of fishery harbours in 1992 &mdash; testimony to our commitment to the development of the infrastructure on which the fishing industry is based.  Pending the finalisation of the programme for 1992, I am unable to say when the dredging at Burtonport will commence.  The Deputy can, however, be assured of my commitment to seeing that this worthy project is advanced as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 19 December 1991.</P>

      <P>As I informed the House in a comprehensive reply on 12 March last, the Government entrusted the task of organising the celebration of Dublin as European City of Culture in 1991 to Dublin Promotions Organisations Limited (DPOL).  My Department provided a grant of £1.25 million to DPOL to facilitate their work, and also assisted the national cultural agencies in playing a full role in this context.</P>
      <P>Dublin's year as European City of Culture has left behind it, as we had hoped, a number of permanent contributions to the cultural life of our capital city.  These included: the revival of Temple Bar; the new Irish Museum of Modern Art; a restored Custom House and the Dublin Writers' Museum.</P>
      <P>Any special function or event to conclude Dublin's year as European City of Culture is entirely one for DPOL.  I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate DPOL on the work they did to organise what is generally regarded as a highly successful programme of cultural events of broad appeal to all citizens.</P>
      <P>The year has also won international recognition.  As an illustration of this I would like to quote from <i>Le Monde</i> of 6 December which states: &ldquo;Dublin, the city of the three Nobel prizes for literature, ends its year as European Cultural Capital after an innumerable quantity of events, crowned in the autumn by a great theatrical season of 19 plays by Samuel Beckett at the Gate, and by the proclamation of European literature and translation prizes, at a banquet at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, the Invalides of old Soldiers, transformed into a superb centre of culture and modern art.</P>

      <P>The IDA carry out an employment survey on 1 November each year which covers manufacturing and internationally traded services only.  The survey is based on locations of individual production units of campanies.  In this regard the Deputy will no doubt be aware that some companies can have a number of production units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on the surveys carried out in 1990 and 1991, the following is the information requested by the Deputy: Of 6,702 production units surveyed in 1990, 403 ceased operation during the year.  Of these 257 received grant payments from IDA amounting to £32.15 million in total in their life span.  Of 6,582 production <Col N="2204" /> units surveyed in 1991, 441 ceased operation during the year.  Of these 441 received grant payments from IDA amounting to £33.78 million in total in their life span.</P>
    <P>I would stress that the 1991 information is based on preliminary results.  It does not follow that all grant payments made are necessarily lost on such cessers of productions.</P>

      <P>By continuing and deepening the development of the European Community, the agreement at Maastricht on draft Treaties for Economic and Monetary Union and Political Union will support the development of Irish industry and services through the open, competitive trading stance we have adopted since joining the Community.  Economic and monetary union in particular has potential benefits for manufacturers and exporters through providing price stability and the basis for further economic growth in Europe.  The success of the economic measures will, of course, depend on many factors, including the speed and effectiveness of the transitional arrangements, the contribution to cohesion, and the economic disciplines exercised by the member states, including in our own case controls on the public finances.</P>
      <P>Following the Maastricht Summit, the member states have agreed a number of measures to promote economic convergence and cohesion, with the over-riding consideration that these measures do not bring about distortions in competition. These will underpin our own national efforts to develop our industry and create the basis for the generation of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>At the outset I wish to stress that my role in relation to the insurance sector is primarily a regulatory one which seeks in the first instance to ensure that it operates in a prudent fashion in the interest of its obligations to policy holders.  In addition, I am also concerned to ensure that it operates in a framework which promotes competition in the areas of policy conditions and premium rates, which improves the availability of insurance overall to the benefit of insurance consumers, and which allows insurers here to expand and develop on both the home and European markets.  I have no function with respect to the allocation of employee resources within the industry.</P>
      <P>The completion of the internal market in the insurance sector is, in my view, manifestly conducive to the achievement of the policy objectives which I have outlined. In the context of the question raised by Deputy Quinn, no specific assessment of job losses in the industry has been carried out because I do not accept the premise underlying his question. I would however refer the Deputies to, for example, the Indecon study published in 1990 into the implications of the Single Market for the financial services sector, including the insurance area.  That study concluded that employment levels in general, as well as insurance earnings, should increase as a result of the completion of the internal market, and that it would create expanded opportunities for institutions to develop their businesses with consequent employment spin-off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insurance sector is regularly consulted on, and kept informed of, developments in the negotiations on insurance <Col N="2208" /> internal market measures and their corresponding implementing measures. That applied in particular to the decision not to avail of the special transitional periods for implementation of the Second Non-life Insurance Services Directive where, in addition, account was taken of the views of the main union concerned, the CII and the relevant Oireachtas Joint Committee.  While there was not unanimity on the matter, my own conclusion was that the overall balance of advantage, having regard to the policy objectives which I have just outlined, lay in not adopting those measures.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to presume that job losses will occur as a result of the dropping of the special transitional measures.  On the contrary, employee levels in the insurance industry have shown a steady increase since the advent of the right of freedom of establishment for foreign insurance companies since 1976 for non-life insurance and 1984 in the life sector.  Furthermore it is expected that the opening up of the market and consequent increased competitiveness among insurance companies should allow other industrial sectors here to avail of cheaper insurance with consequent savings in costs.</P>

      <P>The European Communities (Safety of Toys) Regulations, 1990 (S.I. No. 32 of 1990) prohibit the placing of toys on the market unless they are safe.  Under the regulations all toys placed on the market after 13 February 1990 must carry a <i>CE</i> mark indicating that they conform to the relevant harmonised EC standards and/or that they have been approved by an approved body.  Responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations lies with the director of consumer affairs, who is independent in the exercise of his functions, and the additional information sought by the Deputies should be addressed to the director.</P>

    <P>The development is being accomplished in two stages.  Phase I was completed in 1990 and Phase II is scheduled for completion in early 1992.</P>
    <P>The details of the works involved in each of these phases are as follows:</P>
    <P>Phase I</P>
    <P>1.  Dredging approach channel and creating inner basin to facilitate landings from the current fleet.</P>
    <P>2.  The building of a quay wall to alleviate congestion and improve access for off-loading of fish catches, etc.</P>
    <P>3.  The building of a breakwater to protect the inner basin.</P>
    <P>4.  Land reclamation.</P>
    <P>Phase II</P>
    <P>5.  The building of a quay wall providing a berthing depth of 5.0m.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2216" /> 6.  The building of a breakwater to provide a sheltered basin.</P>
    <P>7.  The building of a new slipway.</P>
    <P>8.  A public marina infrastructure at the new harbour development.</P>
    <P>In addition to these works moneys were also expended on site investigations and design studies.  The main consultants employed were Hydraulics Research Laboratory, University College Cork, Irish Geotechnical Services Limited, EOLAS &mdash; The Irish Science and Technology Agency, Survey Management and Design, ESB International Consulting Engineers, Office of Public Works, Posford Duvivier Consulting Engineers and Irish Sub-Sea Industries Diving Consultants.</P>
    <P>The project was carried out by a combination of contract and direct labour. The works executed by contract consisted of one large dredging and reclamation contract carried out by Holland Dredging Co. (Ireland) Limited and a number of small subcontractors (paving, etc.).  The rest of the work was carried out by direct labour which can be categorised under the headings of plant, materials and labour.</P>
    <P>The approximate breakdown for each year of the way the funds were spent is given under various headings in Table 2 below:</P>

      <P>The current format of the Irish passport dates from 1 January 1985, the date set by a resolution of 23 June 1981 under which the member states of the European Community agreed to issue national passports in a uniform format. This resolution required that, in the case of those member states which issue family passports, details of the spouse of holder should be set out on a specified page of the passport and that provision should be made for entry of details of children of the holder on the same page as the spouse.</P>
      <P>In its present form, the family passport issued in Ireland includes a photograph of the spouse of the holder.  Because of this, the space remaining on that page of the passport is insufficient to allow details of more than six children to be entered. However, if a passport holder wishes to include more than six children on a passport, an extra passport booklet setting out the names of the additional children is issued free of charge.</P>
      <P>This arrangement has worked reasonably well to date.  However, I will keep it under review and if there are improvements which can be made to the format of the passport within the terms of the relevant EC resolution, I would be willing to have them considered.</P>

Along with the claim for repayment he submitted a copy of the employer's portion of his P45.  Instead he should have submitted parts two and three of his P45 and consequently the inspector wrote to him on 28 November 1990 requesting these.  As no reply had been received by 17 December 1991 the inspector wrote again requesting details of employment and any periods of unemployment from July 1990 to date.  Upon receipt of this information his claim for repayment will be processed.</P>

      <P>The joint Ireland Northern Ireland INTERREG programme, involving total expenditure of over £100 million of which £58 million is expected to come from the EC Structural Funds, finances actions under five sub-programmes.  These five sub-programmes are tourism, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, human resources, environmental protection and regional development.  All of these sub-programmes by encouraging economic development in the Border regions, support industry in one way or another in the areas concerned.</P>
      <P>The main EC co-financed support for industry in Ireland is provided under the Operational Programme for Industrial Development 1989-1993 (Industry OP) which encompasses assistance for a broad range of measures including capital grants, research and development, marketing, training and employment grants. This OP covers all of Ireland including the Border counties and provides the main thrust for support for small and medium-sized industries in the internationally traded good and service sector.</P>
      <P>As regards small and medium-sized industries, INTERREG is intended to support and complement the measures taking place under the Industry OP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic development measures under INTERREG has as one of its objectives the development of SMEs in the Border areas.  In Ireland projects with a genuine cross-Border content which provide a development impact in the INTERREG area and which meet the standard criteria of the appropriate development agency, e.g. IDA, FáS, <Col N="2221" /> CTT etc. may be considered for support in the form of, for example, grants for joint marketing or for the sharing of R &amp; D facilities.  Aid rates to such projects will vary depending on the recipient body and the nature of the project and upon the availability of resources under the programme.  For private sector firms the aid rate will be below 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>As regards Northern Ireland only, INTERREG will part finance Selective Financial Assistance Packages to SMEs in the Border areas.  There is no provision on the Southern side of the Border for capital and employment grants of this <Col N="2222" /> nature as such assistance is already provided for under the Industry OP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>According to information supplied by the Central Statistics Office the number of persons employed in the baking industry at the end of March 1991, the last date for which figures are available, was 5,200. The number employed in the industry at the end of March 1986 was 7,000.</P>
      <P>As these figures indicate there has been a reduction of 1,800 in the numbers employed in the industry since 1986. There has also been a reduction in the number of bakeries.  This is in line with the trend envisaged in the report on the bakery industry which was published by the Sectoral Development Committee in 1990.</P>
      <P>This has resulted from the need to reduce over-capacity and improve efficiency in the industry and, in the longer term, the rationalisation should result in a better and more market-led industry.  This will help to provide more secure employment in the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 to 65, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The questions relate to elements of the proposals for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy submitted by the EC Commission to the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  I am fully aware of the implications of the proposals for Irish cereal producers.</P>
      <P>Discussions at the Council of Agriculture Ministers regarding these proposals are only at a preliminary stage.  I have made it very clear that the following are of particular concern: the extent of price reductions and the timescale of implementation; and the maintenance of adequate Community preference.</P>
      <P>I am also pursuing a number of other points, including some of a technical nature such as the setting of base years and the position regarding rented land in the context of set-aside arrangements. These and other elements of the proposals will be discussed fully.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to ensure that the measures finally agreed will protect the interests of small producers while at the same time ensuring the continued viability of more commercially orientated producers.</P>

In this way a free travel service is available in all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I am aware that bus service provisions are under general review by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications.

      <P>No other member state of the EC operates a free travel scheme on similar lines to the Irish free travel scheme.  A number of countries operate concessionary arrangements which vary from country to country.  The introduction of similar arrangements in other countries would be of major advantage to senior citizens and I would be in favour of arrangements of this kind.</P>
      <P>The Commission of the European Community has issued a recommendation concerning the introduction of a European over-sixties card which might serve as evidence of age in respect of advantages in the field of public transport and cultural activities.

      <P>A total of 15 persons &mdash; 11 males and four females &mdash; were committed to Mountjoy Prison in the period 17 September 1991-16 December 1991 for non-payment of fines imposed on conviction of offences arising from the non-payment of their TV licences.</P>
      <P>The estimated annual cost of the operation of the prison system per head of the prisoner population in 1990 was approximately £31,000, which includes all infrastructural and staffing costs.  However, the basic additional cost for any individual new prisoner coming into the system can be taken as merely the cost of maintaining him/her and this works out at approximately £10 per day for food, bedding, medical supplies, laundry etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There appears to be an implication in the question that the appropriateness of the imposition of a term of imprisonment by the courts in the event of non-payment of a fine is in some way to be assessed purely on economic grounds, that is, by comparison of the cost of imprisonment <Col N="2231" /> with the &ldquo;cost&rdquo; of the offence in question. If any such implication is intended, I would not accept it.  There are, of course, much wider issues involved, not least the question of what effective sanction is to be applied to persons who refuse to comply with non-custodial sentences, such as fines, imposed by the courts.  In this regard the provisions of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1964, must be borne in mind, which relate to the court being satisfied, before a warrant committing a person to prison in respect of non-payment of a fine is issued, that he is possessed of sufficient means to enable him to pay and to time being allowed for payment if the person so desires.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to a similar question put down by him on 17 April of this year.  As I stated at that time, there is no specific provision under the road <Col N="2233" /> traffic laws prohibiting the use of car telephone units by drivers of moving vehicles although the use of these devices in moving vehicles may on occasion give rise to breaches of the law, such as dangerous driving and driving without care and attention.  Where such breaches are detected by the Garda, the individuals concerned are prosecuted in accordance with normal procedures.  Because of the way statistics are maintained it is not possible to indicate the number of prosecutions which resulted from the use of car telephone units in moving vehicles.</P>

I am aware that the council have, over the last two years, carried out a number of measures at Littleton to improve road safety.

      <P>It is considered that the open road situation at Littleton does not offer a suitable location for the use of &ldquo;rumble strips&rdquo; and the council were advised accordingly in October 1990.  No further proposals for remedial works have been received from the council to date.</P>

      <P>The review of the general medical services scheme carried out earlier this year considered the issue of the increased cost of prescribing to the State in some detail. The report of the review group included a number of recommendations in this area which have formed the basis of an integrated strategy adopted by the Government with a view to rationalising the cost and use of prescription drugs and medicines within the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This strategy consists of a number of elements, including the use of indicative drug targets, the introduction of a national formulary, the commencement of educational programmes for GPs and the public and the establishment of a <Col N="2248" /> national therapeutics advisory committee with responsibility for examining current prescribing practice within the State.  This committee is currently considering a range of issues, including the impact of hospital prescribing on costs in the community and the potential for greater co-ordination in this regard.</P>

      <P>Stranorlar post-primary centre has two co-educational schools, the vocational school and St. Columba's College, which together have an enrolment of 1,260 pupils.  However, in line with demographic trends significant reductions in enrolments are expected in the coming years.</P>
      <P>It is considered therefore that the long term post primary needs of the centre would best be met by a single post primary schools which would have a comprehensive curriculum and which would cater for the needs of all post primary pupils in the area.</P>
