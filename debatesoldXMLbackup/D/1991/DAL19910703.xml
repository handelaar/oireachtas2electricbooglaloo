      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 10, 11 and 12.  It is also proposed that Private Members' Business, which shall be Item No. 22, shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Order of Business is agreed let me say my party in particular feel that the time allocated for Item No. 11, the Competition Bill, in view of the fact that Committee Stage of that Bill was severely restricted and guillotined, is quite insufficient.  I know the Taoiseach himself was not entirely happy with that situation.  While I am not proposing to oppose the Order of Business on that score, I feel it is bad that legislation of this complexity and novelty should be put through both Committee Stage and Report Stage under a guillotine.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business proper, in view of the fact that there are reports that some announcements may be made today in the House of Commons in Westminster in regard to the Brooke talks process, can the Taoiseach indicate if there will be any statements made today and discussions here today in Dail Éireann in regard to that matter?</P>

      <P>Sir, may I submit to you respectfully that it is important to this House?  The Order of Business and the orders of the House are intended to facilitate the House, not to obstruct it.  I think the House would wish us to have the same opportunity of discussing anything of this kind as is being afforded in Westminster.  I am sure the Taoiseach would wish to respond to that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to two matters on the Order of Business.  I wonder if the Taoiseach has given any further consideration to the matter raised, or attempted to be raised yesterday, by way of a Standing Order 30 motion.  As it is now common knowledge, I am sure the Minister for Finance will agree, that there will be cutbacks in public expenditure announced by the Government some time in the next few days, it would be worth while for the announcements to be made before the Estimates are discussed on Friday.  I wonder if the Taoiseach has given that any further consideration?</P>
      <P>Secondly, I seek some clarification from the Taoiseach in relation to his reporting to the House next week on his meeting with Prime Minister Major.  Will that report include an up-to-date statement on the position of the talks in Northern Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the Estimates, as I have already indicated and I think, Sir, it is your own view, the Estimates will give plenty of opportunity for Deputies to discuss the financial situation. It is not likely that the Government will be making anything in the nature of a comprehensive statement about the budgetary situation for some time.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to Deputy Bruton's protest in regard to the guillotine on the Competition Bill.  In fact, on every Bill this week there is a guillotine, something we find very difficult to understand when <Col N="480" /> there is plenty to time available during the course of the summer to debate these Bills.</P>
      <P>In the area of promised legislation, I wish to raise the question of the colleges Bills which were promised last November. I raised this issue in every session on two or three occasions and each session I was told the Bills would be taken in that session.  The week before last the Minister said they would be taken on Tuesday, which was yesterday.  There is no evidence that they will be taken now. I ask the Taoiseach what has happened? Why suddenly is a Bill which was very urgent last November of no concern now? Can the Taoiseach give an indication of what is going to happen in regard to the colleges Bills now?</P>

      <P>Nothing dramatic or conspiratorial has happened.  It is simply that the parliamentary programme is pretty crowded at present.  The Deputies opposite have been asking for debates on all sorts of things.  I have agreed to debates on the agricultural situation and on European affairs next Wednesday. We cannot do everything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that a great deal of time is taken up on the Order of Business quite regularly on complex matters, including Slovenia and Croatia and Africa, may I ask the Taoiseach, through you, Sir, to again consider the appropriateness of establishing a foreign affairs committee which could include, if he so wished, an element of overseas development aid or aid in general so that as we face into the recess we would know that this committee would be in existence to discuss, for example, developments on famine in Africa.  I am not going to waste the time of the Order of Business but I am suggesting to the Taoiseach, given the complexity and the speed with which matters are changing in foreign affairs, that he consider yet again the appropriateness of having a foreign affairs committee.</P>

      <P>There was quite a good ventilation of all these matters during Question Time yesterday to which the Deputy himself contributed with great sagacity.  If the Deputy for one moment believes that the establishment of a foreign affairs or any other committee would stop or bring to an end this constant hassle on the Order of Business every morning &mdash; most of which is totally out of order &mdash; he is far more naive than I think he is.</P>

    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a good many words about section 2.  What I have to say will relate also to some of the later sections.  With regard to the figures which are mentioned in section 2, the Minister in the course of his Second Stage contribution, did not refer to the background to the decision which went into the production of these figures.  It seems to me that he has produced arbitrary figures. For example, he has chosen a figure of £30,000 which was very convenient because it is a multiple by two of the <Col N="484" /> original figure of £15,000.  Throughout the Bill all the figures are multiples of two in each case.  What is the logic and the reasoning behind the production of these figures?  I am worried that no consideration has been given to the likely effect on the lower courts of this legislation. It seems to me that the effect could be enormous and I am worried that this legislation may be legislation for chaos.</P>
      <P>In his Second Stage contribution the Minister did not give any indication of the likely outcome and what the increase in business might be in the lower courts. He has an opportunity today as we go through the various sections to remedy that matter.  I hope he takes that opportunity because we need to know the basis for a particular decision.  In section 2 how did he arrive at the figure of £30,000? Did he just think of a number?  Did he increase the original figure by inflation over the ten-year period since 1981?  Was it a case of doubling the money?  It seems to me that it is an arbitrary decision and that there is no basis in it for logic and fact.  It certainly did not appear like that on Second Stage.  The Minister did not justify in any way whatsoever the insertion of a figure of £30,000 and why a figure of £29,000 or £35,000 was not put in place.  I am worried about the effects of this decision as I am about the effects of section 3 and other sections also.  I want to know if there is any analysis available and, if so, I want to hear it before I accept section 2 and the following sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us deal with section 2 at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter:</NameTxt>
      <P>What evaluation was used?  The Minister said on Second Stage that the Government, after careful consideration, have decided to increase the Circuit Court's jurisdiction in contract and tort to £30,000.  I have no evidence of the careful consideration that went into the production of that figure.  The Minister produced only one figure in the section dealing with the delivery of summonses, namely, that the number of <Col N="485" /> gardaí released would be 60 as a result of the changes in the legislation.  That was the only analysis I saw in his Second Stage contribution.  I want to see that analysis now.  For example, what was the situation in 1983 as a result of the changes made in 1981?  Does the Minister have facts and figures to show us what the effects were then?  This Bill brings about new changes which did not exist in 1981.  What are the likely effects?  Will we have overcrowding? Will we have chaos in the lower courts?  We did not hear the answer to those questions on Second Stage but we must hear the answers today.  I leave it to the Minister to respond to that very central and crucial question before we move on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to comment very briefly on the principles behind section 2.  The same issues will arise in respect of subsequent sections because they deal with the same principle, basically that of increasing the jurisdiction of the lower courts.  Questions have been raised by Deputy Cotter and I would like to add my voice to some of his concerns. There was a very wide-ranging debate on Second Stage about the inadequate administrative back-up facilities for all of our courts, not just the Circuit Court but more particularly the District and the High Courts.  Section 2 deals specifically with the Circuit Court.  In addition, we talked at length about the poor standard of accommodation, the physical facilities available in many of the courthouses throughout the country and the multiple structures of responsibility that exist in some areas particularly in Dublin where &mdash; if I remember correctly &mdash; there are three separate areas of responsibility for even the maintenance of the physical condition and facilities at the various courthouses in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic proposition here is that the Minister is seeking to address a problem that exists and is perhaps most often exposed because of the scale of work done in the High Court by shifting down the court structure a sizeable proportion of the workload of the various courts. The proportion of the work-load is not <Col N="486" /> yet clear.  The proposition is to double the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court under section 2 to £30,000 from the existing £15,000 and we have had no indication as to the likely impact of that decision.</P>
    <P>In principle, I welcome the fact that the jurisdiction of the lower courts is being increased.  It is proper and fair and will lead in time to more actions being taken in the more accessible courts with, I hope, a consequence that litigation generally will become cheaper.  The District Court is an easier court to deal with, a quicker court to gain access to and a far less expensive court than the higher courts.  The same arguments apply to the Circuit Court as opposed to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Law Society made a submission dated 2 July which the Minister probably only received yesterday.  I received the submission this morning and I am not surprised at the points in it.  They made the point &mdash; made here on Second Stage &mdash; that simply passing the work-load is not enough, it must be coupled with a programme of enhancing the administrative back-up of the lower courts.  I understand, although I do not know whether there has been a public announcement, that a new, young and vibrant county registrar will be appointed in Dublin.  I welcome the appointment and I have no doubt that the person in question will introduce a dynamic to the Dublin Circuit Court which is needed. His appointment, coupled with that of the new President of the Circuit Court, both of which are welcome, will introduce a much needed dynamic into that court.</P>
    <P>The problem that arises with these appointments is that of accommodation. In the Dublin area we are pretty well served at Circuit Court level although not so well served at District Court level. Some of the Circuit courthouses in the country are certainly not up to standard necessary to accommodate the work-load envisaged and which will result directly from the provisions now contained in section 2.  To take it at its crudest, by doubling the jurisdiction as proposed we <Col N="487" /> would, by definition, double the work-load although I do not necessarily accept that will be the result.  However, if it is, the court structures and existing accommodation will not carry that amount of work.</P>
    <P>The Law Society, in their submission, said that as well as doubling the jurisdiction of the courts, we should contract the area which a judge on circuit is obliged to deal with.  That would, of necessity, involve the appointment of a far greater number of judges to the Circuit Court than is provided for under this legislation in later sections.  The Minister must assure the House that the implications in terms of the work-load which will be imposed on the Circuit court by the increase in jurisdiction will be matched by his Department in assigning additional administrative and judicial staff to the courts which will lead to &mdash; sooner rather than later &mdash; a programme of administrative reform in the practices of the courts and in the facilities available in terms of computerisation and other processes which are essential in terms of efficient administration at any level of Government, in the courts or elsewhere. I hope the Minister is in a position to assure the House in relation to these two very real concerns.</P>
    <P>The final point dealt with by the Law Society in their submission is one which they regret has not been addressed by this legislation.  It is that the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission with regard to extending the qualifications of those who can be appointed to the Circuit Court has not been taken on board, namely, the inclusion and consideration of solicitors.  We should go beyond what the Fair Trade Commission report said and look to other professions for suitably qualified people who could be considered for appointment to the senior benches of our courts.  I am thinking of in particular accountants in the area of tax litigation and other matters, architects would be able to deal with litigation in regard to building and other contract issues.  We should not confine ourselves to the legal profession in looking for people to serve <Col N="488" /> on the benches of our courts.  I hope the Minister will give an indication that this matter, although not to be dealt with in this legislation, will be addressed in the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill or other suitable legislation in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions.  I am at a loss to understand the point made by Deputy Cotter as to why the increase was not touched on by me in my speech on Second Stage I said on that occasion:</P>
      <P>The limits of the civil jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Court were fixed originally by the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, and were increased first in 1953, mainly to compensate for the fall in the value of money.  They were again increased by the Courts Act, 1971.  The limits were last increased by the Courts Act, 1981, and on that occasion the civil jurisdiction in contract, tort and related jurisdictions was fixed at £15,000 for the Circuit Court and £2,500 for the District Court.</P>
      <P>The Fair Trade Commission in their recent report into restrictive practices in the legal profession suggested that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court should be increased to £25,000 and that the jurisdiction of the District Court should be increased to £5,000.</P>
      <P>The Government, after careful consideration, have decided to increase the Circuit Court's jurisdiction in contract and tort to £30,000 and the District Court's jurisdiction in these matters to £5,000.  Other jurisdictions of the Circuit Court which have been traditionally linked with the contract and tort limit, will also be similarly increased.</P>
      <P>I was asked why I did not accept the figure of £25,000 suggested by the Fair Trade Commission.  Since the last increase the inflation figure would have been about 85 per cent and the Government, on my recommendation, rounded the figure up to £30,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1988 the District Court had 125,916 civil cases which dropped to 111,000 in <Col N="489" /> 1989 and 101,000 in 1990.  The jurisdiction limits were not effective and it was a question which had to be tackled.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the accessibility of our courts to the general public and making our court procedures cheaper.  It is preferable to have an action heard in a Circuit Court or a District Court instead of the High Court.  This is far better than forcing everything up to the highest level of the court; we should be forcing cases down so that the general public will have greater access to lower courts.</P>
    <P>I can give the Deputies the assurance requested by Deputy McCartan in relation to assistance for the courts.  I think my good faith in that regard can be judged by this Bill.  When we discussed the rape legislation last year I promised to review how it was working and said that if it was found that extra judges were needed in the High Court I would appoint them.  I am coming before the House now requesting two extra judges to deal with the heavy workload of the High Court in relation to rape cases.  Due to the complex nature of those cases they go on for days on end, and there is a demand for extra judges.  Deputies can judge my good faith in relation to court reform by the fact that I am proposing to appoint two extra High Court judges with the agreement of the House.</P>
    <P>This legislation is one piece of an overall jigsaw of court reform.  The aim of that reform is to make our courts more accessible, to make litigation cheaper, to increase the jurisdiction limits and to set up a small claims procedure, a process which is already under way.  There will be three or four pilot projects around the country.  Later in the year we will introduce legislation to establish a new court of civil appeal.  All these measures are geared towards making our courts more efficient and more effective.  Rather than clogging the system, as is the suggestion of Deputy Cotter and the concern of Deputy McCartan, I can assure the Deputies that the opposite is my aim and that of the Government.  We want to make the courts procedure much more <Col N="490" /> effective and efficient, and I believe we are heading in the right direction.  That is the reason for the figures of £15,000 and £30,000, to come back to the initial point raised by Deputy Cotter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have succeeded in getting some figures from the Minister to back up his case.  These are the first figures we have been given.  The Minister's speech offered no justification for the changes proposed.  It was simply a set of aspirations and platitudes.  We have now received figures which give some indication of the position over a period of ten years.  Surely the Minister is in a position to forecast, from all the information available to his Department, the likely increase in business as a result of all the proposals &mdash; not just those in section 2 &mdash; dealing with the Circuit Court.  I would like to hear the Minister's projections for next year and the year after, based on experience and the experience immediately after 1981 when the previous changes were made.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to appoint extra judges and justices.  The information we have now is likely to shed light on whether that is a wise or arbitrary decision.  I am still not happy with this section and I would like the Minister to concentrate a little more on projections for the future.  I want to be satisfied that this is not, as I said earlier, legislation for chaos in the system that operates in the Circuit Court particularly and also in the District Court.  The Minister said on Second Stage that the main objective of the Bill is to make litigation in the court cheaper and speedier.  That aspiration has been the centrepiece of every ministerial speech I have read with regard to the introduction of a Courts Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1981 Deputy Collins had the same aspiration for the legislation he introduced at that time, which was similar to a large degree to the legislation before us today, but it remained an aspiration and was not translated into fact.  It did not result in cheaper and speedier access to the court.  I would like to know whether the Minister can give fairly accurate projections based on all the information his <Col N="491" /> Department have gathered over the years.  I would like to know whether his aspiration in the summing up of the Second Stage debate is based on all the figures his Department can collate and put before us.  That is central to this whole matter.</P>
    <P>There is no point in producing legislation just for the record.  There are all sorts of isolated Bills coming before the House at the moment and there is concern that there is no overview whatsoever, that the Government are trying to bring in legislation so that they can say to the public: &ldquo;We are great lads.  Look what we have done.  We have processed 14 Bills since Easter&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Not very long ago the Minister proposed to close down many courthouses. That suggests that this legislation was put together in a hurry and was an afterthought. I assume it is part of a set of proposals the Government are bringing forward to overcome their embarrassment with regard to the extremely high and unfair cost of insurance.  The Minister is projecting that as a result of this legislation, particularly section 2 with which we are dealing now, the cost of litigation will decrease, but I am not convinced of that.  I will be continually pressing the Minister to produce factual information, or at least projected information, based on facts to justify the statements and claims he has made.</P>
    <P>The decrease in business in the Circuit Court over a ten year period could well be related to the fact that there was no change in the jurisdiction over that period and the number of cases taken decreased from 125,916 to 101,000.  It could be interpreted that the decrease resulted from the fact that the fall in the value of money put about 25,000 cases out of the range of the Circuit Court and into a higher court.  Can the Minister project what the likely outcome of section 2 and the later sections will be over the next three to seven year period?  He must be in a position to do that and I want that information before we leave section 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the suggestion <Col N="492" /> that this is rushed legislation, I would tell the Deputy that we have been working on this legislation for many months.  As I have mentioned in my earlier reply, it is part of an overall package of reform in the courts area which will involve a small claims procedure, changes in the jurisdiction level in the District Court and Circuit Court, an increase in the number of judges and justices in the District Court, Circuit Court and High Court, the establishment of a court of civil appeal and general reform within the courts area. Reform is also taking place under a solicitor's Bill, which will be circulated during the summer, and voluntary changes are being made by the Bar Council in their fee structure for juniors and in other areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have read the reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission in relation to legal education are also being considered. There is to be an overall package of reform for the courts and the legal profession generally.</P>
      <P>The Fair Trade Commission recommended a limit of £25,000 and I have given my reason for thinking that that figure was too low and for increasing the limit to £30,000.  The matter has been reviewed by the President of the Circuit Court, who agrees with the figure of £30,000.  The Fair Trade Commission report estimates that about 35.8 per cent of the overall cost in insurance claims generally is for legal costs.  I am trying to take cases from the higher courts into the lower courts, where the costs are lower. Instead of an insurance claim involving £25,000 or £30,000 having to go automatically to the High Court, where costs are more expensive, the idea is to take the claim to the Circuit Court or the District Court, where the costs are lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent change occurred in 1981.  Deputies will note from the Bill that in future jurisdiction limits will be changed by order confirmed by the House rather than by legislation.  In reply to the Deputy's question of the experience since <Col N="493" /> 1981, I note that there was an initial increase in the amount of business and then matters levelled off.  I cannot give numbers on the amount of business.  I am sorry that I cannot do that for the Deputy, but I would be misleading the Deputy and the House if I tried to do so. However, the matter has been discussed with the President of the Circuit Court and recommendations have been made by the Fair Trade Commission.  The Government and I believe that in order to reduce costs and make the courts more accessible it is better to make the lower courts available to the public than to force people to go to the High Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the extra information he has provided, although I am not satisfied that the Government considered the matter carefully before making certain decisions.  It is evident that certain arbitrary positions were adopted, justification for which was not based on fact but on aspiration.  The Minister said he was not able to project the likely effect of these changes on Circuit Court business in the next few years. That is unsatisfactory.  Surely the changes being made under the Bill are being made in the light of good, solid decision making rather than in the hope that the end result will be manageable.  Logic should be a requirement, but the Bill does not deal in the realm of logic.  Changes have been made in a cosmetic way.</P>
      <P>The Minister described the Bill as part of a jigsaw of reform in the courts.  I am not sure whether his choice of words was good &mdash; a jigsaw, indeed.  The Government's approach shows no unity of thinking. The Government are rushing about in 40 different directions at once with small Bills that it is hoped will come together to form something manageable that will improve the situation for everybody. Such an approach is completely aspirational.  I am not satisfied with the Minister's response.  Decisions must be based on a likely outcome, but the Minister had told me he cannot possibly give an indication of the likely outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are making itsy-bitsy legislation.  As I said the House could <Col N="494" /> well be legislating for chaos.  I shall be pressing the Minister through debate on the Bill for an explanation of the Bill's logic.  The House is entitled to an explanation. I want more answers before the debate on section 2 is finished and when we reach section 3, and subsequent sections, I shall look for the same basis of logic.  The Minister looks very unhappy at that prospect, but he will have to bear with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that, far from being unhappy, I welcome the teasing out of the Bill section by section. The Deputy should not be under any illusion about my state of happiness or otherwise in relation to his contributions. Deputy Cotter said the Bill was in some way rushed and badly thought out as far as the change in the jurisdiction limit of the Circuit Court was concerned.  I told the Deputy that that change was made after the Fair Trade Commission considered the legal profession for three years.  One of the commission's recommendations was to increase the limit to £25,000.  I have explained why I felt a limit of £30,000 was more appropriate and that the matter was discussed with the President of the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>I should like to give the Deputy some idea of the number of cases heard by the Circuit Court.  In 1984 there were 45,900 cases heard; in 1985 there were 47,400; in 1986 there were 49,000; in 1987 there were 49,500 and in 1988 there were 50,148.  Those figures show that the number of cases heard in the Circuit Court has been increasing.  Cases have been pushed up from the District Court, where they should have been dealt with, to the Circuit Court.  If those cases had been heard in the District Court there would not be so many in the Circuit Court.  The same push has been occurring from the Circuit Court to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the most recent occasion the limit for the Circuit Court was increased it went from £2,500 to £15,000.  In this change it is going from £15,000 to £30,000.  The scale of the increase previously was much greater than it will be this year.  This time the limit is being <Col N="495" /> doubled on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission, following discussions with the staff associations and the President of the Circuit Court, reviews made by my Department and taking into account moves in inflation since the previous increase.  The change is part of a well thought out procedure, and it has been thought out not just by myself and my Department but also by outside groups such as the Fair Trade Commission, who took three years to consider the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the principle of increasing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to the extent indicated in the Bill.  The doubling of the limit will not lead to the chaos that has been predicted, provided the Minister stands by his commitment to keep under close and constant review the adequacy of the staffing levels and the backup services needed to administer the courts.  The principle of increasing the capacity of the jurisdiction of the lower courts is a good one and is supported by the Law Society.  We should not lose sight of the fact that in civil cases the vast majòrity of cases are settled.  The difficulty is in getting to the point where settlement can be achieved.  The vast majority of cases are settled at the court door and very few actually go to hearing. These provisions will enable cases to move with greater rapidity to the court door and they will be accommodated.</P>
      <P>Having said that, there are serious concerns. The provisions of section 16 enable the Minister to bring back by way of order to the courts a variation in court jurisdictions.  Can the Minister assure us that that would be availed of in cases where the courts were unable to deal with the workload?  I do not think that will arise, but if it did for reasons that are not apparent at the moment, I would like that assurance from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that should be borne in mind.  The courts share with us here the facility for long vacations.  We here have been unable to address this and certainly the courts have looked at it from a distance with some dismay.  It has never <Col N="496" /> been clearly explained why our Circuit Court rises for the entire months of August and September each year, why there is a need for a summer recess of two whole months.  They sit in vacation for emergency matters.  However at Christmas, at Easter and at one other term, Whit, they can accumulate anything up to six weeks vacation period.  I wonder if the Circuit Court have been asked to look at the necessity for having such long breaks in the working year, given the proposed increase in their workload.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by the Law Society which the Minister might comment on is the areas of each of the Circuit Courts.  This point will be made about the District Court later.  The judge of any circuit is now sitting a four day week from very early in the morning to very late in the evening simply because of the geographical size of the area the circuit is built upon.  I am open to correction on this, but I understand that the Circuit and District Court areas were established about 1926 very shortly after the founding of this State and have not been substantially altered since.  The only change in the District Court areas was in respect of the Dublin Metropolitan Area when it was extended to bring in Dún Laoghaire, Kilmainham, Rathfarnham and other places.  Outside of that the geographic areas of the Circuit Court have remained the same while the workload of the judges has increased dramatically.  It has meant that judges sit very long hours and are very busy when they are in session.  That must be looked at in terms of a radical reorganisation of the resources of the courts in an overall package.  I hope that will be borne in mind.  In principle, it is right that we should try to spread the work downwards rather than leaving it hanging as it is.</P>
    <P>On the question of accessibility, we must not forget the appalling state of our legal aid system.  We must not begin to suggest that extending the jurisdictions is a panacea, that it will resolve all matters. The Circuit Court is not a cheap court by the standards of the ordinary man or woman.  The cost of a day in the Circuit <Col N="497" /> Court is now very substantial.  The whole question of fairness and accessibility can only be properly addressed in a comprehensive and adequate civil legal aid scheme.  I wanted to make that point lest we all got lost in this idea of welcoming the increase in the jurisdictions of the Circuit and District Courts thinking that it resolves all the difficulties.  It does not do that.</P>
    <P>We will talk later about the increase in the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to deal with family law matters.  The issue really rears its head in that regard, as does the problem of inadequate facilities for private consultation rooms and other matters that are utterly absence from most of our Circuit Court buildings around the country.</P>

Otherwise, we shall make no progress on an issue to which there applies a rigid time limit in respect of completion of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House. Let me reply to a couple of the points made.  The areas of the Circuit Court have not been changed since the foundation of the State.  However, I will take note of the point that has been made.  It is not a matter for me but for the President of the Circuit Court and I will draw his attention to it.</P>
      <P>The District Courts are changed regularly, I am informed.  On the question of the sittings of the Circuit Court, a number of the Circuit Courts are sitting on a fifth day now, on Mondays, to deal with family law matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of upgrading facilities, a computer network is being installed in the Dublin Circuit Court at present and this will speed up the office procedures there.  Preliminary work has commenced on the computerisation of the Central <Col N="498" /> Office in the High Court which will, again, speed up the operations and procedures of the office.  I strongly recommend section 2 to the House.  There is little else that I can, with benefit, add to what has already been said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, paragraph (c), line 41, to delete &ldquo;justice&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;judge&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises because of the substantive change being proposed in amendment No. 7 in the style of address of judges of the District Court.  I am proposing in amendment No. 7 to change the mode or style of address from justice to judge by the insertion of a new section 21 in the Bill.  Although under the Constitution district justices are judges they have been styled as justices since the foundation of the State.  Existing statutory provisions are contained in section 5 (2) of the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act, 1961 which provides that each judge of the District Court shall be styled &ldquo;Justice of the District Court&rdquo;. There have been recommendations previously to change the style of address of a judge of the District Court, including one by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, and the opportunity is being taken in this Bill to make the change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) (a) and (1) (b) in the proposed new section 21 make the necessary amendments in sections 5 and 6 of the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act, 1961.  Subsection (2) provides for consequential changes in the <Col N="499" /> case of all other legislation.  As a result of amendment No. 7 there will be a consequential change in section 15 and in the long title of the Bill.  A change is also proposed in section 22 of the Bill.  These are the subject of amendments Nos. 4, 8 and 9.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 will amend the commencement provision in section 22 and will mean that the change in the style of address of judges in the District Court will come into effect three months after the date of the passing of the Bill.  This will allow for the passing of other Bills before the Oireachtas which contain references to justices of the District Court, without having to amend them.  As and from the commencement date all references to justices contained in any Statute or Statutory Instrument in operation on that date will be construed as a reference to a judge of the District Court by virtue of the proposed new section 21 of the Bill.  As the provision of section 4 (c) of the Bill will not come into effect for three months, amendment No. 1 is needed to clarify the correct title that will apply in that section to judges of the District Court when the proposed change in the style of addressing judges comes into effect.  Amendment No. 4 is necessary for the same reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I received great satisfaction from the fact that the Minister had taken this matter on board.  I raised this issue on 12 June in the House in the context of another Bill.  The issue unfortunately got lost in a controversy dealing with the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1990, which dealt with the question of pensions of judges.  That Bill attracted a great deal of controversy in another direction.  On that day I moved amendments to delete references to justices of the District Court and to include them as judges.  We spent a short time on that before the more substantial controversy was taken up.  I withdrew my amendment when the Minister of State indicated that this was something that would be looked at and fairly considered.  I welcome the <Col N="500" /> decision of the Minister and the Government to put this right.  It was wrong to describe members of the Judiciary in the District Court as something other than judges, particularly, as the Minister has pointed out, since our Constitution of 1937 refers only to judges of the various courts being appointed and about justice being administered by judges in the various courts.  A clear explanation was never given.  Even in the 1961 Act to which the Minister referred the Irish text referred to &ldquo;breitheamh&rdquo; in relation to District Courts.  It was in the English translation that &ldquo;breitheamh&rdquo;, for some odd reason, became &ldquo;justice&rdquo;, whereas in the context of the Circuit Court and the High Court the word &ldquo;breitheamh&rdquo; remained as &ldquo;judge&rdquo; in the English version. This was just a peculiarity.</P>
      <P>Over the years it has given rise to concern among members of the District Court Judiciary that they were looked on as something other than judges and that it was a reflection on their work.  I spent 15 years in law practice and the greater portion of my time was in the District Court.  I have the greatest admiration for the judges who sit in the District Court. Three or four years ago we dealt with corrective legislation with regard to a member of the District Court Judiciary whose warrant had not been properly extended and the figures advanced as to how many cases he dealt with on an annual basis was staggering.  That applies to all the judges of the District Court.  The District Courts are vital to our judicial system.  They are the most democratic courts and the most easily accessible courts.  They have perhaps more impact on the everyday lives of people than any other court.  It is important to have the fullest regard for the work of the District Courts and the role played by the judges in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the independence of the Judiciary, the most important function that legislators have in relation to the care of the courts, and the greatest support we can give the courts and the judges, is to provide appropriate facilities in which to work with effective dignity.  Nothing attacks the status of the court more than <Col N="501" /> shabby surroundings and poor facilities and judges sitting on the benches complaining that they have to use buckets to catch the rain water coming through the roof, that they have to use mobile heaters under their benches to keep warm and have had to adjourn courts simply because the facilities were inadequate. We cannot expect the public to have due regard for judges of the District Court and the work they are doing when the people in power are not maintaining proper facilities.  We must not lose sight of that.  This amendment goes towards building up the status of District Court judges in recognising that they are full judges appointed under the Constitution. This amendment will be appreciated by all the judges who work in the District Court.  When I worked in that area many judges privately or publicly made the point that they considered the form of address as being important.  I commend the Minister for taking this point on board.</P>

I should like to know how those plans, if they still exist, fit in with the terms of section 4 and the extension of the jurisdiction of the District Court.  If the plans have been torn up and thrown away, I also want to know.

      <P>This section deals with the extension of jurisdiction of the District Court under the Hire Purchase Acts, 1946 and 1960.  Section 6 (1) proposes that section 19 of the Hire Purchase (Amendment) Act, 1960, be amended by the substitution of £5,000 for £2,500 in subsections (1) and (2), while section 6 (2) proposes that section 33 (4) (a) of the 1961 Act be amended by the substitution of £5,000 for £2,500.  Like most people I think of hire purchase in terms of the purchase of cars.  Most ordinary people have to avail of hire purchase arrangements or some other form of funding to purchase cars.  Has the figure of £5,000 been related to this element of hire purchase? Will the Minister say if any consideration was given to the fact that most of the hire purchase agreements entered into by ordinary people relate to the purchase of motor cars?</P>

      <P>This is the first of three sections dealing with the extension of the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts in regard to maintenance and other related matters in the context of family law.  Section 11 deals with maintenance provisions, section 12 deals with guardianship of infants and section 13 deals generally with family law.  Although there are problems in regard to some Circuit Court courthouses the point I want to raise relates mainly to the inadequate facilities for proper consultation in District Court courthouses and the necessity for cases under the judicial separation legislation to be dealt with in a proper environment.  Can the Minister say if any special regard is being had to this problem, with particular reference to the District Court, at this stage and if he envisages any programme being implemented to ensure that proper facilities are provided over a period in all our courthouses, the district courts in particular, so that consultations can take place in private and family law cases can be heard in the proper way having regard to the fact that we are increasing the jurisdiction and are going to allow these cases to be dealt with increasingly in the lower courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered setting up a family law tribunal, for example, having regard to the considerations mentioned by Deputy McCartan and others?  The judges who operate in the District Court and the Circuit Court have a rag bag of business to carry out.  Most of them would accept that they do not possess any special qualifications in psychology which would give them a greater understanding of family dynamics.  Given that there has been a substantial increase in the number of cases involving family breakdown, which are both complex and complicated, coming before the courts, would the Minister comment briefly on his overview of that situation <i>vis à vis</i> section 11 and <Col N="506" /> following sections which deal with family law?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister share my view that judges who hear family law cases should receive some special training in psychology which would give them a better understanding of family dynamics and a better affinity with the people they deal with having regard to the fact that the break-up of families can have a serious psychological effect on the people involved who find themselves under enormous pressure and are extremely vulnerable? For such people the business of moving around ordinary courts in the ordinary way is a different matter from the case of the person who is not under such desperate strain.  I am of the opinion that a family law tribunal could be tailor made for those who find themselves in this set of circumstances.  As well as this the staff of the tribunal would receive the special training I have referred to.  I would respectfully ask the Minister to respond to that suggestion, to indicate if he has considered it and, if so, if he intends to follow it up and take action in that area or if he has decided to discard it in the belief that the present method is adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that family law business in our courts should be transacted with great delicacy, in private and in confidence and that the best possible facilities for briefings should be provided.  At present at District Court level there is a special courtroom at Dolphin House with waiting and consultation rooms.  In the High Court and Circuit Court, family law courtrooms together with a suite of waiting and consultation rooms and a conference room are now located in purpose built facilities in a new office block at Áras Uí Dhalaigh in the Four Courts complex in the Dublin area. These facilities are considered to be fully adequate to meet the demands likely to be made on them for family law business in the Dublin area in the foreseeable future.  We are reviewing the position at Kilmainham, Green Street and other courthouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most centres outside of Dublin the <Col N="507" /> volume of business transacted is relatively small but I believe that it will increase.  The practice at present is for justices and court staff to use existing facilities but in such a way as to ensure as much privacy and confidentiality as possible.  In many cases the ordinary courtrooms are used outside the times for ordinary court business and in others the justice uses his private chambers or specially provided rooms.  It was mentioned earlier that there are difficulties surrounding the provision of accommodation for the hearing of cases instituted under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act.  Section 32 of that Act provides that the circuit family courts shall sit to hear such proceedings in a different place or at different times or on different days from those on which the ordinary sittings of the Circuit Court are held.  It is a matter for the courts to operate within these options.</P>
    <P>Earlier Deputy Cotter referred to the review of courthouses currently taking place around the country.  I can tell him that one of the things guiding me in carrying out the review is the question of the adequacy of some of the older buildings for the transactions of family law cases. They are totally unsuitable.  The best possible facilities that the nation can afford should be provided for the transaction of family law business.  The Deputies can be assured that this is a matter of concern for me and that I am trying to ensure that the best possible facilities are provided for the transaction of family law business.</P>

However he did not say whether he shared my view that judges who hear such cases should have a different background to the norm or whether they should receive training in psychology which would give them a greater understanding of family dynamics.  He either forgot or avoided commenting on that matter.  I want to draw his attention to it <Col N="508" /> again as it is a very important matter for the reasons I have mentioned already.

    <P>This is a technical amendment and it is needed to take account of the fact that the provisions of subsection (5) (a) will apply also to cases heard and determined in the circuit court, in addition to the High Court.  Where a defendant in a Circuit Court case is awarded costs against a successful plaintiff under that provision, and the judge granting those costs decides to apply the mechanism in paragraph (a) (ii) of the subsection to determine what the amount of the costs should be, then the appropriate taxation authority will be the appropriate county registrar and not the taxing master of the High Court. Under the Rules of the Circuit Court &mdash; by Order 58, Rule 6 &mdash; all costs directed to be taxed in the Circuit Court must be taxed by the county registrar, who is invested with all the powers of the High Court for that purpose. <Col N="509" /> Amendment No. 3 is a technical amendment also and is needed for the reasons I have just outlined in amendment No. 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan:</NameTxt>
      <P>This section could be described as a stick to ensure that the practitioners do not ignore the trend that the jurisdiction of the lower courts has been increased and start off their proceedings in the higher courts available to them in the hope that perhaps they will cover their professional responsibilities on the one hand and have a stronger bargaining level on behalf of the clients. Those who think less of the professions might suggest that the lawyer tries to enhance his or her potential to earn costs from litigation.  This section provides a mechanism or formula to ensure that such attractions do not lead to an overloading of cases in the higher courts that should properly be taken in the Circuit and District Courts.  For that reason I support in general terms the thrust of the section and the efforts being made by the Minister to have practitioners apply their minds to bringing the case in the proper court at the outset so that the higher courts do not become clogged up with cases that should not properly be there in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section is not dissimilar to an earlier provision in the law in relation to the transfer of cases from one jurisdiction to another and the penalty that can be visited upon the lawyer for having commenced proceedings in the wrong jurisdiction. We have no great difficulty with <Col N="510" /> it.  However the Law Society in their submission have raised a number of points on the section.  I have just received their submission which was dated 2 July 1991, which is yesterday.  They should not necessarily be criticised for the late arrival of their submission.  The Bill was published on 10 June, just a short time ago, and like all legislation that is technical and has an important impact on situations it needed a little time to be considered and reviewed.  It takes time for an organisation as large as the Law Society to bring their committee together and to agree a final position.  In any event their submission has arrived at the eleventh hour.  We have ordered our business to deal with all Stages of the Bill in the next 25 minutes and we are not going to have a Report Stage in effect and for that reason I would request that, before the Minister brings this legislation to Seanad Éireann, he take the opportunity in the interim period to look at the points raised in the Law Society's submission to see if it is possible to introduce a fairer and more simple formula.  The reasons advanced by the Law Society for considering a simpler formula to deal with the same idea is that it is not easy to decide in the initial stages in what jurisdiction the action should be commenced. They say, and I support them on this point, that often when a client comes in with a medical complaint it is difficult to know how quickly the person will recover.  For example a person could make a very good recovery and therefore have a much lower expectation of compensation; alternatively a person may make a poor recovery and what might have seemed on the first flush not to have been a severe injury might escalate into something much greater.  The consideration might be to delay the institution of proceedings on the one hand or to start at the highest possible jurisdiction to cover all eventualities and in time to consider the jurisdiction in accordance with the facts as they emerge.  The problem with that is that in time the lawyer and the client can be penalised for taking what could be a very good decision initially in the interests of the client. <Col N="511" /> Their second point is on the apportionment of blame.  For example, in the initial consultation one side of the case is explained to the practitioner and he may decide that the case merits being taken in the High Court or the Circuit Court, but as the pleadings develop and the issues emerge and as the positions crystalise it could well be that the lawyer realises that there is a strong probability that there will be an apportionment of damage or of liability and what was initially a High Court or Circuit Court action could on apportionment be reduced to an award properly within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court or District Court.  Under the formula contained in section 14 at present there are inbuilt penalties for the litigant and the lawyer in terms of the costs that can be recovered from the other side.  There are very real considerations required of the lawyer and very difficult decisions have to be taken at an early stage of the proceedings.  The Law Society are making a very reasonable case that the Minister should look at this again to see whether a more general formula could be arrived at, and I quote:</P>
    <P>We would submit that the entire section should be replaced by a simpler section that will hold the scales fairly between the parties.  We have in mind a section that would simply give the higher court power or discretion to deal with costs in such manner as the court thought most appropriate having regard to all the circumstances including the power to restrict the plaintiff to the costs that would follow an award in the lower court or to allow costs to a defendant for the additional expenses of defending in a higher court.</P>
    <P>They are merely asking that the Minister take a second look at the provision in the section.  I support this concept in principle because I believe there is need for a certain amount of stick to require the litigant and the lawyer to apply their minds carefully to what is the proper jurisdiction to commence their case and not to be shooting off flyers to higher courts in the hope that it will deliver either a higher <Col N="512" /> and probably an unwarranted award or a better bargaining counter for settlements on the steps of the court or, as suggested in some quarters, the potential for earning higher costs.  The Law Society are making a fair case that this is not as straightforward as the section suggests it can be.  As I have said for the practical reasons of the way we have ordered the debate we cannot press this amendment but we can ask the Minister to have fair regard to what has been suggested in the Law Society's submission before the Seanad debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because of the time constraints.  In the narrow confines of the Bill section 14 brings about a completeness which is necessary in order to balance the Bill.  In so far as that is the case I am quite happy with it.  I will accept section 14 in its entirely when the question is put.  I am happy that it brings about a completeness in the sense that it limits the amount of costs that can be recovered by a plaintiff who takes an action in a higher court than is necessary.  I have not had time to examine this in all its detail but it seems, on the face of it, to be a fairly good section which adds an element of completeness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would use the word &ldquo;disincentive&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;stick&rdquo; in relation to this section.  The existing section 17 allows wide latitude to a court hearing a case to allow higher costs.  The general effect of my proposed substitute section will be to reduce the discretion of the court to allow such higher costs and to introduce a new disincentive to taking an action in a higher court than necessary by making it incumbent to pay to the defendant the equivalent of the additional costs incurred in having to defend the action in a higher court than necessary.  That is eminently fair and reasonable.  There is a procedure at present where by certificate a court can decide as to the cost.  It is only right and proper that we should write into our law that we want to encourage the greatest possible use of the lower courts. <Col N="513" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>

It does not come within the ambit of this Bill but the Minister might give some indication as to his intentions. Will it be dealt with under a solicitors Bill or is he moving in that direction at all? He should not confine appointments to the Bench to members of the legal profession.

He is appointing judges to various courts but has he considered the total requirement in support <Col N="514" /> staff in order to make the system properly functional and to ensure that we do not have any more problems than currently? We should be minimising any difficulties apparent in the system.  Is there any restriction on the appointment of support staff of whatever grade might be necessary? I want an assurance that the staff, particularly in the lower courts which are not dealt with in this section, will be made available and that we will not have a number of judges appointed who will be unable to operate efficiently because the required support staff will not be there to ensure that cases are brought before the courts, processed and finalised with the utmost speed and efficiency.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister has discussed the terms of section 21 with the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Brennan.  The implications of sending something by post these days would be rather emotive, to say the least.  The results of the local elections in certain areas would have reflected that and I am sure the Government and the Minister will have taken note of these matters.  I wonder about sending a registered prepaid letter to an individual and how it might be delivered these days.  I understand that at one stage in the last 12 months quite a number of letters went to Hong Kong or Honolulu and places like that before being delivered to their intended address.</P>
      <P>My experience is that unless the address is very specific, delivery is not effected any more.  I had an unusual case recently where a letter addressed to an individual in a household &mdash; there being two individuals in that household with the same name was returned to me as not being capable of being delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has looked at all the implications of posting registered letters, for example in the context of the situation which may evolve in rural Ireland now the elections are behind us where we will have post boxes sticking up out of the ground all over the place, and how the delivery will be effected. Will it be necessary to get the person's signature that the delivery has been effected or will it be enough to have the letter delivered through the front door? Will it be enough to have it dropped into the postbox which might be two miles down the road or at the end of a very long lane or whatever?  I want to hear the Minister's views on that because there is little point in the Minister for Justice introducing a section which will be torn up and thrown away by the Minister for <Col N="518" /> Tourism, Transport and Communications in a month's time.  I reserve the right to respond to the Minister when he has responded to the points I have raised.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with the point raised by the Law Society in their submission at paragraph 6, page 2, where they argue for a comparable order of service of documents as applies in the High Court.  I support that argument. In addition to the provision of prepaid registered post or other record of post, the rules and regulations under section 21 should also provide for, as they put it succinctly, &ldquo;a provision facilitating personal service or service by leaving a document at a defendant's residence of a person over 16 years of age as in the case of the service of High Court documents&rdquo;. They say it would be a simple matter to provide this.  I ask the Minister again if he will undertake to look at this matter before the Bill is completed in the Seanad.  It is a fair point.  Practitioners in the field have argued that because we have very few summonses service remaining in the country the majority of service will be by post now that we are providing for it, but there should also be follow on provisions available so that in the event of registered post not being possible to effect because of the absence of an address or other difficulty, there are facilities in the rules to enable the court to order that service be by personal delivery to the last known residence or to a person over the age of 16 years at that address.  I ask the Minister to consider these matters.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the point raised by the Law Society. Service of a summons by delivery to the person to whom it is addressed or by leaving it at his residence in the manner suggested is already possible in the case of all summonses to which the provision of section 21 of the Bill apply.  The system has been retained under the Bill and can be used wherever necessary to serve summonses that cannot be served under the new system of service by registered post <Col N="519" /> proposed in the Bill.  It is not just by registered post; it can be recorded post. I have much more faith in the postal service than Deputy Cotter and members of the Fine Gael party apparently have.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `service' includes all manner and type of service including such services as professional services, rights of access to land and buildings and public services save where the latter practices and activities have been given statutory recognition in existing legislation;&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill the Minister seems to indicate that there is a difference between the private and public sector.  It was pointed out on Committee Stage by Deputy Barry that &ldquo;service&rdquo; should include, in the widest possible sense, the public sector as well as the private sector.  Indeed, we argued that the words &ldquo;engaged for gain&rdquo; should have been deleted but this was not accepted.  By re-entering this amendment we are seeking to level the playing field between the private and public sector so that public services, unless specifically excluded in other legislation, should be deemed to be part of this Bill.  I see no reason why State companies such as the ESB and Telecom Éireann should not be included in this section.  Why do we not include refuse collection services and road maintenance?  They should be the subject of discussion on competition.  If there is a monopoly or an abuse of a <Col N="521" /> dominant position and the consumer is not getting proper value we should be permitted to raise questions.</P>

      <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Hogan, on amendments Nos. 2 and 3.  On Committee Stage the Minister stated that all services were included, professional, public and private. It seems that the public service are being given an advantage over the private sector.  As my colleague said, I do not see why companies such as the ESB and Telecom Éireann and local authority services such as road maintenance and refuse collection are not included in the Bill.  What is the Minister's view on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley):</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Barry seeks to ensure that the scope of the Bill includes professional services, local authorities and rights of access to land and buildings. Deputy Barry also appears to require that public services be excluded from the terms of the Bill where there is a statutory basis for their activities.  This seems self-contradictory on the face of it.  The latter aspect to the amendment is, in fact, the object to amendment No. 4 in the name of Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
      <P>Professional services are included in the Bill by virtue of the definition of the word &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo;.  Section 3 states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; means a person being an individual,... engaged for gain in the... provision of a service.</P>
      <P>That is very clear and, obviously, comprises all professional services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities are not included as they are not engaged for gain.  Although there may be charges for services in some places it is not a commercial activity.  The key point to be made is that it is not the description of the &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; which is the determining factor, it is the nature of the activities engaged in.  The words, &ldquo;for gain&rdquo;, do not mean simply for payment, it must be for what is reasonably considered for commercial gain.  As I suggested, I believe correctly, during Committee Stage the problems of rights of <Col N="522" /> access to land and buildings are more proper to land law and to landlord and tenant law.  The problem referred to by Deputy Barry, such as a restrictive covenant in a lease, relates to the right-of-way appurtenant to the land or premises.  It would not, therefore, fall for consideration under competition law.</P>
    <P>Finally, it might also be useful, by way of clarification, to remind Deputies that unless the undertaking or association of undertakings is capable of preventing, restricting or distorting competition in trade, it would not come under the scope of the Bill.  It is very difficult to see how an undertaking not engaged for gain would be able to do any of these things.</P>
    <P>A point was raised by Deputy Hogan in regard to the public sector.  He seemed to suggest that the public sector was, by and large, excluded from the Bill.  That is not so.  There is no distinction in the Bill, or in any of the definitions, between the public and private sectors except for local authorities.  All commercial activities are included, whether public or private. I would remind Deputy Hogan that in amendment No. 2, for some reason that I cannot understand, Deputy Barry sought to exclude public bodies or public corporations, generally State companies, because the last words of the amendment are:</P>
    <P>...save where the latter practices and activities have been given statutory recognition in existing legislation;</P>
    <P>That would appear to exclude companies such as the ESB, Bord na Móna, Telecom Éireann and a whole range of companies who are given statutory recognition in legislation.  I do not think that would be advisable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment seeks to expressly include professional services in an effort to tackle the current position where professional bodies can and do engage in price fixing.  The scaled fees system does not operate in the interest of the consumer.  Apparently, it has been legal for the various professional bodies to engage in this practice in the past.  I do not know if it was challenged and I <Col N="523" /> understand that the opinion is that it could not have been challenged successfully. Therefore, where price fixing of that manner operates it cannot have been in the interest of the consumer.  I want the Minister to confirm, if he considers there is no necessity to expressly include this specific reference, that as he understands the Bill it can tackle this situation.  I would like to hear his comments on the arrangements that have been taken on board recently, for example, in the Law Library.  Does he consider that the changes suggested there are of any import, that the consumer is likely to benefit and that the changes promised are more cosmetic than real.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's clarification.  However, there is concern about the words &ldquo;engaged for gain&rdquo; in the legislation which was indicated by Deputy Barry.  There should be a right of veto on access to land and buildings, although I know the Minister said it appertains really to landlords and tenants. These are the aspects of the Bill which must be threshed out because there has been very little consultation.  A competition Bill should cover all aspects of landlords and tenants, mergers and monopolies, etc., but that is not the case here.</P>
      <P>Local authority services &mdash; or indeed any services offered to the public &mdash; should be subject to competition.  If the Minister agrees in that regard they should be covered by this section.  If there is to be genuine competition anti-competitive practices should be outlawed.  Even though at present local authorities do not provide the services for gain, that might not always be the case as there might be sub-contracting of services, which applies at the moment in refuse collections, which has a mixture of private and public competition.  I cannot understand why we cannot be more specific and include all services which should be subject to competition in this Bill.  However, I will not press the matter.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <Col N="524" /> Amendment No. 3 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page, 5, line 9, after &ldquo;services&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;serves to create a temporary environment to nurture and develop new areas of economic endeavour, compensates State companies for social obligations which are imposed,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment on Committee Stage was misunderstood.  Far from arguing for any form of protectionism, I am doing the contrary.  I have explained that my philosophy in approaching this Bill is the same as I would bring to bear on any industrial legislation, which is that the purpose of the Bill should be, where possible, to assist retention of employment in the economy and to contribute to the creation of new employment.  In the context of the present crisis in job creation, it is incumbent on all of us to look very closely at any legislation to see if it attempts to meet the twin objectives of retention of employment and creation of jobs in new areas.  For that reason, I have been arguing for a very long time for the necessity for a total root and branch review of industrial policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's announcement last week showed that he had come round to that view himself.  Our industrial policy is seriously failing us, we are not getting value for money, there is a crisis and with the impending falling apart of the CAP and the overrun on budgetary targets in terms of the Exchequer, unemployment is likely to get worse in the years ahead. This legislation is designed to facilitate economic growth for which the Minister has made somewhat extravagant claims in terms of what its impact or contribution will be.  I am merely seeking to allow our options to be kept open in the critical area of import substitution, for example.  I am saying that, for a temporary period, it may be necessary that the normal prohibition rules should not apply where we are seeking growth in <Col N="525" /> domestic industries which might otherwise be snuffed out by force of international competition.</P>
    <P>It is one thing for the Minister to strive to create ideal competition in so far as that can ever be realised between existing companies, but I argued on Committee Stage that perhaps a more reliable yardstick of true competition would be ease of entry to the market-place.  Quite frankly, in the world of transnational corporations, aggregation of capital and so on, it is very difficult to see where new interests can come into the market-place in many segments of the economy.  The notion of import substitution is simply not on in a number of areas because we could not compete.  I am not seeking to throw up tariff barriers or to go back to old style protectionism.  I am merely seeking a temporary period where, if in conjunction, say, with a State company we want to nurture an industry from a basic nucleus to where it can thrive and compete, there should be particular arrangements.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of the amendment specifically deals with the question of whether State companies should be compensated for the social obligations imposed on them by the mandate given to them by this House.  I do not wish to dwell on the arguments I made on Committee Stage but it is a fact that some of the commercial State companies are given a very definite social mandate to deliver services which are manifestly unprofitable in certain areas.  If we accept &mdash; as I think all sides in this House do &mdash; that even if you live in a wild and remote part of the country you are entitled to certain essential public services which are available to those living in a populous or urban environment, then regard must be had to the cost on the commercial State company of providing that service, otherwise they are not operating in a truly competitive environment.  The system we have adopted up to now does not have regard to that.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to provide a telecommunications service in a populous eastern region of the country but it is not as cheap to do so along the western <Col N="526" /> seaboard, for example.  The same applies to transport and postal services.  There should be some method of identifying the cost of that social imposition, otherwise one is militating against some of the leading State companies being permitted to operate on a level playing pitch.</P>
    <P>The Minister on the last occasion promised I would have an opportunity in the near future to debate in a comprehensive sense industrial policy.  It may be that the Minister and I approach this matter from a different ideological point of view but I suspect there are major areas of convergence also.  I hope the Minister will acknowledge that, having regard to the crisis in unemployment which all economists agree will get worse, the Government are floundering about, they do not know the answers.  Whatever about claims from the Opposition, which can be made without having to put them into effect, that we know the answers it is at least clear that the Government do not know them.  In those circumstances I would have thought the minister would acknowledge that there is, must be and should continue to be a role for the commercial State companies.  They are essentially the two limbs of the argument for this amendment.</P>
    <P>In terms of the first aspect of the amendment, I would not like to see us enacting legislation that shuts off a possibility that the new review group established by the Minister may want to examine.  I am very gloomy about the prospects of us tackling in any substantial way the objective of import substitution. I do not believe that, in terms of using the yardstick of ease of entry into the marketplace here, there are areas of the economy where it is not realistic in modern commercial market trading conditions to expect somebody to come into the market a new and be able to survive to the point where they can compete. Some temporary respite and, perhaps, other aid, ought to be targeted on developing that area of the economy. After all we are spending enormous amounts of money on industrial policy. Why should there be an argument that <Col N="527" /> the money ought to be spent in the traditional way?  Why can we not re-examine how that vast amount of money &mdash; £800 million or £1 billion per annum &mdash; is being spent and refocus it in a different fashion?</P>
    <P>We should keep our options open.  I do not think it is essential to the Minister's Bill that this element is kept intact until such time as this House has an opportunity to consider the conclusions of the new review group and make decisions accordingly in the hope of job creation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte's amendment seeks to give immunity to State companies.  This is contrary to the spirit and the underlying thrust of the Bill, and for that reason it is not acceptable. It is the opposite to what some Fine Gael Deputies said on the last group of amendments.  Indeed, it is contrary to an amendment tabled this morning specifically saying the direct opposite to what Deputy Rabbitte is suggesting.</P>
      <P>In this Bill there are no derogations or allowances made for any company, private or public, whether new to the market or not.  It would not only be wrong to have one set of rules for the public sector and another for the private sector but it would be a false comfort to shield the public sector from the stimulus of open competition.  Deputy Rabbitte made the point that we should look after State companies and that they perform various services which should be recognised. He feels I do not sufficiently support State companies, but he is wrong in that.  I entirely support State companies on the basis that they compete on equal terms and operate commercially.  What I am opposed to is the way commercial State companies were often looked after in the past.  They were heavily cosseted and subsidised and were allowed to continue to lose large sums of money each year while the Exchequer, through Votes in this House, put large sums of money into them.  One has only to look at the accumulated losses, for example, of some companies to realise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> In recent years many of these companies improved their performance enormously, and that was after they were told that the good old days were over, that large sums of money would no longer be pumped into them and that they would have to operate commercially if they were to survive.  Some of them, happily, have been able to respond to that challenge with some success.  It would be wrong to reverse that policy and go back to a situation where these companies would get special protection, whether through this Bill, this amendment or by any other means.  There cannot be what Deputy Rabbitte describes as a temporary shelter for anyone.  The lack of success of protectionism has to be learned.  The world economy, as much as the Irish economy, has no future if it is going to relapse into protectionism.  That lesson was learned, I would have thought the hard way, over the last 20 years here, and we should not now turn our back on it and go back to the economic policies of the thirties which are no longer relevant today.</P>
    <P>I would point out in particular that the Competition Authority, as proposed under section 4 (2), may licence activity &ldquo;which contributes to the production or distribution of goods or the provision of services or to promoting technical or economic progress&rdquo;.  This possibility exists equally for the public and the private sector.  I suggest to Deputy Rabbitte that it covers at least some of the instances he gave in arguing for this amendment.  It is furthermore open to the authority to invite any Minister concerned to offer observations.  In this way the authority will be aware of public policy in the formulation of their decisions on the question of the granting of licences or certificates and they can take that policy into account before they make their decision.  For those reasons I ask the House not to accept amendment No. 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister says semi-State companies should compete on an equal basis and be open to the winds of competition I entirely agree but the <Col N="529" /> point being made by Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; I agree with him &mdash; is that in many cases that does not apply.  In some aspects of the activities of semi-State companies the playing fields are equal.  They are free to carry on their activities where, how and to the extent they wish, but the point being made is that in many instances that does not apply.  Constraints and directives are imposed on semi-State companies by Ministers or the Government to do certain things which are not commercial and which they would not do if left to their own devices.</P>
      <P>One example is the bus services.  Independent bus companies who decide to run services between Dublin, Cork, Galway and so on choose the profitable routes they want to operate.  There are routes to rural towns which are not commercial but the Government, or the relevant Minister, may feel it necessary in the social interest that they should be serviced.  Accordingly, the semi-State company concerned are obligated either directly or indirectly, to provide that social service and to suffer that commercial obligation, which is what it is. It is something that in ordinary, basic commercial terms would make no sense. If the criteria of a commercial test were to be applied to it, they would not do it. That is just one typical example.  There are many other examples right across the board.</P>
      <P>Those are the kinds of categories that this amendment seeks to address, very properly.  Recognition has to be given to that because when those social obligations are imposed the semi-State company concerned are not &mdash; in the words of the Minister &mdash; able to compete on an equal basis.  Recognition ought to be given to the semi-State company and measures should be provided to enable them to meet those social obligations. For those reasons the Labour Party support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A separate aspect of the amendment seeks to provide recognition for new areas of economic endeavour.  That is a fair and reasonable proposal.  I agree with the Minister that to some extent section <Col N="530" /> 4 (2) as it now appears goes down that road but it is not sufficient.  It would be better and desirable to spell out the provision in greater detail.</P>
    <P>It is always a hazardous arrangement when a company come to a new era of economic endeavour and produce a new product.  In the beginning the market has to be tested and the company have to try to establish a new product in an environment in which there might be perhaps overwhelming competition from a multinational company.  The development of new products deserves special attention. Protectionism is talked about as if it was a dirty word, which is unwarranted.  Protectionism had a role to play and, it still has some role to play.  I know that there are problems and difficulties associated with protectionism and that it has had its ups and downs, but nonetheless it is very often the exception that proves the rule and there can be instances in which it might be very much in the public and the national interest to give special recognition to a new economic endeavour.  It could provide employment, it could maintain employment and in due course it could lead to something bigger if it was given a chance to get established and grow.  What can happen and what has happened all too often is that something new and exciting in the commercial world is stifled early on; it is squashed before having a chance to attain a sufficient degree of strength to enable it to stand on its own feet and compete on an equal basis with stronger companies, many of them multinational companies, that were previously in the market-place. Recognition should be given to that fact, and that is what the first part of the amendment seeks to do.  It is a good amendment, and the House should support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply.  The Minister acknowledges, as do this side of the House, that the major failure in Irish industrial performance has been our inability to construct an indigenous sector <Col N="531" /> of any dimension or employ any significant number of people.  If one takes the examples of the closure of Nixdorf in Bray, Kingdom Tubes in Tralee or Travenol in Castlebar, it is crazy that whenever a multinational company decide to pull out of a major Irish town the entire town is left destitute of employment. The only reason that the closure of a branch of a multinational company has such severe impacts on towns such as Bray, Castlebar and Tralee is that in the past 60 years we have been unable to develop a significant indigenous manufacturing sector.  In fact, for all of the scorn with which the term `public service&rdquo; is used, were it not for the existence of the public service sector in Castlebar, Tralee or Bray those towns would have scarcely any employment.  That is how grim the position is and that is how badly we have failed to develop an indigenous manufacturing sector.  It is simply not right after 60 years that if a multinational company sneezes in the boardrooms of Tokyo or New York an entire significant provincial Irish town should catch cold. All I seek is that we keep our options open in relation to the development of an indigenous sector in the economy, which we have failed to do up to now.</P>
      <P>The Minister went back to talk about the days of Seán Lemass in the thirties, of protectionism and its inherent failure and so on.  As Deputy Taylor said, there was a great deal to be said for protectionism in that context at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>To say that all we have to do now is clasp the internal market to our bosom and free competition throughout the trading bloc of which we are a member or throughout the rest of the world will solve our employment problems is not correct.  The Minister must recognise the apparent evidence everywhere that we have not managed to create jobs for our people.  I repeat that I am not arguing for a reversion to protectionism. I am arguing for conditions <Col N="532" /> under which we may facilitate the growth of domestic indigenous new areas of economic endeavour within this economy. I merely ask that that opportunity be kept open.</P>
      <P>It is not very helpful for the Minister to point back to the performance of the commercial State companies through the past 20 years.  I would agree with him about a great many of the defects he points to, but I point out that those defects are more due to the political culture in Ireland than to any inherent mistakes made by commercial State companies, which are partly the subject of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The political culture fostered featherbedding in terms of employment, refusal to tackle the debt/equity ratio, political interference and giving mandates that were undesirable, if not impossible, to fulfill.  The Minister himself was part of that political culture.  He has only recently sought to break the mould and get away from that culture.  At one time he was a very prominent exponent of it and a serious prospect to lead it.  I do not stand for that political culture which on a nod and wink basis, got jobs for people in commercial State companies where there was no productive work to be done. I agree with the Minister on that point, but, as he said, that was in the past.  The Minister acknowledged the fine performance of some of those companies in recent years.  Some of them are now our major employers.  They have been slimmed down and are capable of competing with anybody.  I speak of companies such as Bord Telecom and the ESB.  The performance of some of those companies has been so good that they have been privatised.  Some of them have shown the way with joint ventures, which seems to me to suggest one limb of recovery. There is an example in the operation of Aer Lingus on the Naas Road in terms of the joint ventures between Airmotive and Pratt and Whitney.  That seems to me to be the ideal kind of project that we should argue for, and whereas I accept what Deputy Taylor said about <Col N="533" /> section 4 (2) going some way to meet some of the aspirations in this amendment, I still think we should keep our <Col N="534" /> options open in terms of the purpose and thrust of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 18, to delete &ldquo;A licence&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;An exemption&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a simple amendment which was indicated on Committee Stage.  As the Minister is keen to have the wording of the Treaty of Rome followed as closely as possible throughout the legislation, why has he changed the word &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; to &ldquo;licence&rdquo;?  Having regard to case law which might have to be examined, the Minister should think long and hard about changing any wording in Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  In legislative terms, a word can mean many different things and there are different interpretations of one word when it comes to case law.  The Minister's argument does not convince me that he has any grounds for changing the word to &ldquo;licence&rdquo;.  The wording in the Treaty is all right and I cannot understand why the Minister would want to change it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>These two amendments were debated at considerable length in exactly the same form on Committee Stage.  The only reason they are here is that they were not reached so far as voting was concerned, although there was a lengthy debate on them.  Apparently they were allowed to be put down again.  I do not want to go into this at great length because I dealt with it fully on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both amendments seek to substitute the word &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; for &ldquo;licence&rdquo;.  The term &ldquo;licence&rdquo; was carefully chosen after a good deal of thought.  In an ideal world the word &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; would be preferable. However, &ldquo;licence&rdquo; is a term which fits, from an administrative and legal perspective, the activity of the authority. It is a term used to emphasise that the powers of the authority are administrative as distinct from judicial.  It helps dispel doubt about any constitutional critism of the character of the authority's <Col N="536" /> decisions.  For those reasons it is not proposed to change it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply.  One has to apply for a licence but one can be granted an exemption. If the Minister wants to remove administrative bureaucracy from the competition area he is not succeeding. He has not made a strong case to change the wording.  His change brings more regulation into business.  It is something I thought the Minister, with his philosophy, would be trying to remove.  The Minister is wrong to put in the way of business, particularly small businesses, a further obstacle and the extra paper work involved in applying for a licence while an exemption&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady):</NameTxt>
      <P>Emigrants' remittances are, by their nature, difficult to identify and measure for statistical purposes. An estimate of some £50 million has been included in respect of emigrants' remittances in the Balance of Payments statements compiled by the Central Statistics Office for each of the years 1986 to 1990.  A geographical breakdown of the origin of the remittances is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State not agree that the figure of £50 million seems to be somewhat short of the actual mark in view of the fact that 150,000 people left these shores over the past four years and that many of them are married men whose wives and families have remained here and who sent home regular payments on a weekly basis?  Therefore, it should be possible to give a more approximate figure of the actual amount returned to this country by emigrants.  In a book entitled <i>Irish Emigration and the Tenure of Land in Ireland</i> Lord Dufferin estimated that between 1848 and 1861 something in the region of £13 million per annum was sent <Col N="540" /> home by Irish emigrants in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady:</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly could not say that the figure of £50 million is accurate because the system which has been applied for many years is not sufficiently foolproof to identify accurately the amount of money involved.  The figure of £50 million is considered by the Central Statistics Office to be reasonable but not totally accurate.  Under the system used for many years, a voluntary system, the banks endeavoured to identify remittances coming from abroad.  That system was discontinued in the late eighties.  At present an interdepartmental committee are reviewing the situation and seeking to identify with a greater degree of accuracy the extent of the moneys coming into this country.</P>

      <P>It has been confirmed to me by the Department of Social Welfare that £32 million per annum is paid by the Department of Health and Social Security in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne to retired pensioners in this country.  Would the Minister of State not agree that sparsity of population and a lack of strong domestic consumer demand are two of the problems and that there are thousands of Irish emigrants abroad who would dearly like to return here, and would bring with them much valuable foreign revenue?  A special scheme might usefully be looked at with a view to attracting those people back here, bringing with them this foreign revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>The ECOFIN Council have agreed that cars will be subject to the standard VAT rate after 1992, when a minimum rate of 15 per cent will apply.  The Council have also determined that purchases in another member state of vehicles liable for registration will be subject to VAT in the country of destination at that country's rate.  In addition, the agreement reached allows member states generally to introduce or maintain taxation on products, including cars, provided such taxation does not give rise, in respect of trade between member states, to formalities in connection with border crossing.</P>
      <P>I am sure that Deputies are well aware that duty on motor vehicles is a very important source of revenue for the Exchequer and I have made it clear that budgetary realities require that this revenue must be preserved after 1992. However, as the present system of collecting and safeguarding the excise duty on cars depends on checks at the frontier, or at points of entry to the State, it will have to be modified.  Alternative systems for collecting the tax are currently being studied; while I am not yet in a position to indicate the nature of any replacement tax, or to indicate how it would be collected, a registration based system is an obvious possibility.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is it the Minister's intention to recoup the full potential loss to the Exchequer in one way or another in the first year?  Will he give a commitment to reduce the registration fee subsequently over a series of <Col N="543" /> budgets so that the benefits of harmonisation will be passed on to the citizens of this country when they purchase motor cars?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy and the House appreciate, £262 million was raised by way of excise duty in 1990.  Therefore, in present budgetary circumstances, it would not be feasible to forego such revenues.  It would be misleading to pretend that this was a realistic option.  The question of what may happen in a few years time is a matter for the budgetary process at any given time.  It would be misleading for me to create any other expectation at this stage.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is the Minister aware that the motor industry are in a parlous state at present, that the precincts of garages throughout the country are full of unsellable secondhand cars and that certain garages are now refusing to give a quote to customers with a trade-in?  Would he consider that the announcement made and confirmed today will make a bad situation even worse?  Does he have any plans to alleviate the problems confronting the motor industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement was not made today but quite some time ago.  In all my meetings with the motor industry since I was appointed Minister for Finance, I have never held out any unreal expectations to them with regard to what the situation might be post-1992. They asked me to create certainty for the trade as soon as possible because in their view people were holding back trade-ins because of speculation that cars might be cheaper.  The motor industry have always been aware of the level of revenue raised for the Exchequer and I do not think they are under any illusions.  That industry began to recover in recent years and no one in the motor trade, or elsewhere, projected that there would be such a falloff in car sales this year.  This is not a phenomenon peculiar to Ireland.  The Deputy and the House will be aware that <Col N="544" /> this is the position throughout Europe. Indeed, the motor industry in the United Kingdom are going through one of their worst periods ever.  This is a reflection of the economic position and the lack of confidence on the part of the consumer in the aftermath of the Gulf War.  This has not contributed to it one way or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be any misunderstanding, I did not seek permission to introduce any special car registration tax.  I am complying with the arrangements agreed to at European level.  The consumer with an average size family car should have already received the benefits of the reduction in the VAT rate from 25 per cent to 21 per cent, approximately £500.  Consequently, it is not all one way traffic.  There is also a differential in the margins with regard to car sales when compared with figures elsewhere, tax excluded.  I do not accept any responsibility in this matter.  The motor industry are going through a bad time but, as I said, it is not a phenomenon exclusive to the Irish market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>EC Economics and Finance Ministers reached agreement on the broad shape of the post-1992 indirect tax rates at their meeting on 24 June 1991.  The main VAT rating arrangements approved for the community were: a standard rate of not less than 15 per cent; the option of one or two rates below this standard rate, with a minimum of 5 per cent for a restricted list of goods and services; and the possibility of retaining at least for a transitional period extra low rates, including zero rating, in areas where such rates currently apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to observing these general Community requirements, final decisions on the actual rates to apply remain the prerogative of individual member states. The level and scope of VAT rates, both standard and reduced, is a matter for the normal budgetary process and I will be examining this matter in the context of the 1992 budget.  The House will appreciate that such decisions cannot be taken in isolation from wider issues of tax policy.  I must have regard to the cost implications of the total approximation package and to overall budgetary policy.  For these reasons, I am not in a position at this stage to indicate to what extent we can avail of the reduced rate options.  Items currently low rated which will be liable to the standard rate after 1992 include telecommunications, adult clothing and footwear, personal services, repair and <Col N="546" /> maintenance services and construction other than housing.</P>
    <P>I will be consulting my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in regard to ensuring that the benefits of any VAT decreases are passed on in lower prices to the consumer.  The implications of the net price effects of any rate changes arising for those on low incomes will also be borne in mind in the general budgetary context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that benefits to the consumer in the areas of petrol and drink, for example, have received much publicity and accept that the VAT system is not based on ability to pay and that less exposure has been given to those areas where the consumer will suffer as a result of the meetings of European Community Finance Ministers to which he referred?  In particular, I instance the areas of gas and electricity.  Does the Minister have any intention of compensating the tens of thousands of people living at subsistence level in respect of the increased costs which will be passed on to them?  Is the Minister aware that in this city, for example, where&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>The position will be reviewed in 1996 but that is not to say that it will come to an end at that stage. In relation to the question of different rates moving in different directions, I have always said that tax approximation is not an <i>á la carte</i> menu; some rates will be decreased while others will be increased.  That is what happened in the 1991 budget, where some rates were increased while others were decreased. The net effect, however, was that the consumer gained to the tune of £37 million.</P>
      <P>The effects of these changes on people on low pay is a matter to be addressed under the social welfare budget.  While I accept in part what Deputy Rabbitte said that where people suffer disproportionately from a change we should try to compensate those at the lower end but that should not be done by trying to maintain lower rates so that the people who can afford to pay have the benefit of those rates.  It is a matter for compensating those at the lower end.  The final determination is a matter for overall taxation and the social welfare provisions of any budget.</P>

    <P>The operation of the Insurance Act, <Col N="549" /> 1989, in relation to the insurance related business of intermediaries is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce. However, under the proposed European Community investment services directive, I will be introducing legislation to license and regulate, on behalf of the public, those areas of investment activity which are not currently subject to regulation. Under this legislation any person or firm providing such an investment service to the public will be required to be licensed and to meet ongoing supervisory requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I am not going to comment on these allegations but it is probably a reflection on the pressures on investment managers from serious cashflow shortages as a result of the general economic downturn that has taken place.  As I spelled out to the Deputy, supervision of insurance intermediaries is a matter for the supervisory authorities of the other areas.  The issue of supervision in the various financial areas is being sorted out, with the Central Bank being given additional supervisory powers.  There are still certain areas under the Department of Industry and Commerce.  However, the public should always be aware &mdash; this is a fact of life no matter what time we are talking about &mdash; that people are inclined to respond to advertisements for a higher rate of return but time and again it has been proved to be a poor choice.  The public will have to be aware that they make the choice and no matter what supervision is there if they make a foolish choice no legislation can make up for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. V. Brady):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 9, 12 and 16 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In consultation with other Departments and Offices, the extent of accommodation required by the State in Dublin is assessed, on an ongoing basis, by the Office of Public Works in the light of developments such as the embargo on recruitment, early retirement and decentralisation. These assessments have, to <Col N="557" /> date, resulted in the identification and disposal of a substantial amount of accommodation.  This process is continuing.</P>
    <P>It is not the State's policy to negotiate tenancies for vacated accommodation. Disposals are usually effected by availing of lease breaks and expiries or by placing property, owned or leased, on the open market.</P>
    <P>In general, decentralised offices are constructed on sites owned by the State or provided by the relevant local authority. The identification of premises does not normally arise.</P>
    <P>The provision of the offices in the provincial centres does not give rise to an overall additional cost to the Exchequer. The cost of providing the decentralised accommodation, which compares more than favourably with the cost of office accommodation in Dublin, is more than adequately recouped, given the savings arising from consequent disposals of Dublin office space.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the professional incompetence of the Office of Public Works in disposing of the properties across the street, would the Minister not agree that the record of the Office of Public Works in disposing of property of high value is not good?  I make another reference to Beggar's Bush local authority housing area, which is in a similar position.  Is the Minister of State saying publicly, in the light of the Minister's announced review of expenditure, that the election statements announcing the decentralisation of civil servants will not go ahead?  Is he saying that there is no additional cost to the Exchequer attached to decentralising public servants and that the decentralisation plan announced prior to the local elections will not go ahead?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the position regarding the establishment by the EC of a special fund to compensate countries, such as Ireland and other peripheral countries, for entering into economic and monetary union; if his attention has been drawn to the comments made by the President of the EC Commission, Mr. Jacques Delors, that no such fund would be established; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>The creation of a special fund to promote economic and social cohesion is one of a number of proposals with this objective which have been submitted to the Intergovernmental Conferences on Economic and Monetary Union and Political Union. These proposals have been discussed by both conferences and will be subject to further discussion in the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>Specific proposals for a special fund have been put forward by Greece, Spain and Portugal.  While there are points of difference between these proposals, they are all consistent with the framework proposals which Ireland submitted to both conferences in early January.  The aim of this framework was the development of adequate cohesion mechanisms within the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would emphasise to the Deputy that none of these proposals should be seen purely in terms of compensation for <Col N="562" /> entering into economic and monetary union.  Their purpose is more wide ranging, involving as it does a firm commitment on the part of the member states to put in place the mechanisms for promoting economic and social cohesion which are appropriate to the degree of integration achieved by the Community at any particular time.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the comments on the proposals for a special fund attributed to Commission President Jacques Delors.  I would remind the Deputy, however, that these proposals, along with many others, are still the subject of discussion within the intergovernmental conferences.  The results of those discussions cannot be prejudged at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Do I understand him to say the Irish Government are convinced of the necessity for a special development fund for the weaker and peripheral countries and that, notwithstanding the dismissal by the Commission President, that will continue to be the Government's position? Does the Minister agree that Structural Funding alone is inadequate to compensate for this peripheral disadvantage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am already on the record as stating my views and those of the Government that Structural Funds are inadequate to deal with the overall situation of social and economic cohesion for the future development of the Community. We have made that abundantly clear.  The Taoiseach took the opportunity at last weekend's summit to draw the attention of the Heads of Government to that fact.  Nobody in Europe is under any illusions about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see the whole area of social and economic cohesion being dealt with by a commitment in the Treaty that will strengthen social and economic cohesion if EMU does not develop to the benefit of the peripheral States, including Ireland.  We see the necessity for social and economic cohesion throughout all the policies of the EC and not just in <Col N="563" /> relation to Structural Funds.  The effect of the Structural Funds on narrowing the gap between, for instance, Ireland and the other member states will be the subject of review during 1991.  However, we believe it will not provide the total answer to the problem of social and economic cohesion, and we made that abundantly clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me refer the Minister to his statement in London on Monday when he confessed that the greatest disappointment was our inability to generate sufficient jobs having regard to the extent of new entrants to the labour force and so on.  Does this mean the Government are coming round to The Worker's Party view that there is a necessity for a common industrial policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have to wait for The Workers' Party to lecture us on any aspect of future policy.  I was referring to what I mentioned previously, and it is part of the first proposal I made on behalf of the Government to the intergovernmental conference, that I believed the Community should accept as one of their priorities and objectives the creation of full employment throughout the Community and consequently that their policies be geared towards that end.  That is precisely what I was referring to in my statement in London.</P>

      <P>An offer for sale of shares in the company is to be published tomorrow and will be widely available on Friday.  The setting of the share price for inclusion in that document is a complicated process involving the Minister as vendor, the company, their respective financial advisers and the underwriters to the offer.  It will not be possible to disclose <Col N="565" /> the offer price for the shares before publication of this document.  In the light of these considerations the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position at this stage to disclose the expected revenue from the flotation of Irish Life plc.</P>
      <P>The proceeds of the flotation will accrue to the Exchequer in accordance with section 2 of the Insurance Act, 1990. As I indicated to the House when that legislation was under consideration last year, and again in my Budget Statement earlier this year, the proceeds of the sale will be used to ease the burden of the national debt and of debt servicing costs.</P>

Is it not also clear that at the end of the year the Minister will show two figures for EBR: one with the Irish Life money included and one without the Irish Life money?  Do not mind this jiggery pokery talk about financial practices.  We know what the Minister is doing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>First of all, the accountancy practices of the Comptroller and Auditor General decide what way money coming in is treated.  It is enshrined in the Constitution that all Government receipts go in to the Exchequer.  After that it is a matter for Government to decide how they want to spend any portion of that.  There is no shortcircuiting.  It cannot be taken and £50 million given to the IDA or anybody else.  When the receipts come in the Government then decide how it will be spent.  That is all enshrined in the Constitution.  It is not open to any Government or any Minister for Finance to change that situation.</P>

      <P>Significant progress has been made in this area.  A new EC Directive has been agreed which will extend EC public procurement rules to the four major sectors of water, energy, transport and telecommunications, which were previously excluded from EC public procurement Directives.  The Directive is aimed at ensuring competition across national frontiers within the Community when contracts for supplies or works are placed by bodies in these sectors covered by the Directive.  It is expected to result in a very significant increase in the overall coverage of EC public procurement <Col N="572" /> Directives.  The new Directive will come into force in Ireland on 1 January 1993.</P>
      <P>Parallel with this Directive, a second Directive has been proposed to establish a system of remedies for persons who consider one of the contracting authorities covered by the main Directive has not followed its provisions.  A common position on this remedies or compliance Directive was reached by the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg last month.  The aim is that the remedies Directive would also come into effect on 1 January 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 22 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>Total tax revenue in the first six months of 1991, as shown by the end-June Exchequer returns, was 1.3 per cent higher than in the same period of last year.  This compared with the 5.8 per cent increase projected for the full year in the budget.  I have repeatedly pointed out that the revenue trend was expected to improve as the year advanced, having regard to the implications of &ldquo;carry-over&rdquo; costs and other foreseeable factors for the figures in the early months.  Nevertheless, the outturn for the half-year was below the budget profile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I made clear in the statement I issued with the returns, the shortfall in tax revenues was effectively confined to a few specific areas; trends otherwise were fairly satisfactory.  I said that it mainly lay &ldquo;with indirect tax receipts, which are running somewhat behind target &mdash; particularly on account of the decline in car sales &mdash; and with stamp duties, mainly from property transactions&rdquo;.  I also pointed out that &ldquo;payroll taxes, taking into account the effect of income tax reliefs, are well in line with the budget profile which was based on the expectation of continuing employment growth&rdquo;.  In relation to Deputy Taylor's wider question, other Exchequer receipts &mdash; non-tax revenue and capital resources <Col N="575" />&mdash; have performed in line with expectations over the year to date.</P>
    <P>While I remain confident that we will see a distinct improvement in tax revenues in the second half, I have acknowledged that the shortfall to date will not be fully recovered.  I must, of course, point out that, on account of the weekening in international economic activity, very many countries have found that revenue buoyancy this year has been less than anticipated in their budgets.  Nevertheless, the tax returns confirm, as I said in my statement, that &ldquo;the Irish economy is performing very creditably in difficult international circumstances&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The poor performance of consumption taxes, and especially revenue from vehicle sales, must be seen in the light of the impact on consumer confidence of the continuing background of international economic uncertainty.</P>
    <P>The international recession has also had a major impact on spending.  The shift in migration patterns which has occurred because of the lack of employment opportunities in the UK has pushed the numbers on the live register well ahead of budget projections, and this in turn has increased the level of social welfare expenditure.  This single factor is the major component in the expenditure slippage this year.</P>
    <P>The improvement in competitiveness which has been achieved through continuing low inflation and moderate wage agreements has left us well placed domestically to mitigate the effects of the international downturn, and to benefit from any upturn.  Nevertheless, the Government are determined, now that the half-year figures have become available, to take steps to deal with these emerging pressures on the budget targets this year.  In that regard, the scope for taxation adjustments are very limited, and it is quite clear that the burden of adjustment will have to fall on the expenditure side of the budget.  Measures in this area are currently under consideration, so that it is not possible at this stage to indicate to the House what specific steps will be taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="576" /> I can, however, assure the House that the issue is being very actively pursued, and that in accordance with the undertaking I made in my Budget Statement last January, the Government will not be slow to take any action that is needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Will the Minister inform the House of his estimate of the overrun for the year?  Will he categorically state that he is ruling out any tax increase by way of a supplementary budget and that he will confine whatever corrective measures he intends to take to the expenditure side?  Will he also give a commitment to the House that capital expenditure will not be cut and that, if cuts are announced by the Minister on behalf of the Government, they will be real cuts with underpinning policy decisions and not estimating cuts of a cosmetic nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give an undertaking to the House or elsewhere that capital expenditure will be excluded from any examination of the whole area. I clearly said that every element of expenditure, line by line, will be gone through systematically by the Government.  That process already commenced at yesterday's meeting and it will continue at next Friday's meeting.  I have already put a list of proposals before the Government for each member's consideration and, as I said, we will continue that procedure next Friday.  It is not possible, as I am sure the Deputy and the House appreciate, to say what areas may be affected.  There is a problem and it is for the Government to decide in what areas expenditure savings will be made.  I will not speculate on the areas involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pursue that <Col N="577" /> very point with the Minister.  We are heading towards the dismantling of the Common Agricultural Policy and there has been a disastrous decline in consumer spending, which will be confirmed by anyone in the retail trade.  How can the Minister make a further prediction in that regard?  Indeed, it has been challenged by most independent commentators from all sides of the political spectrum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, the OECD report will come out this evening and it will confirm our projections. Indeed, those of the Department of Finance and mine are less than those the OECD will confirm.  Everybody agrees that there will be a recovery but people are not predicting when.  Reports from the United States indicate that it seems to be under way although it is patchy.  The economy is more buoyant on the west coast of the United States than on the east coast.  I was in London on Monday and there is real concern there because of the fact that businesses have been collapsing at the rate of 900 per month for the last six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply stating the facts.  Our economy is closely linked with the economy in the UK and, inevitably, we feel the backlash as 35 per cent of our exports are sold in that market. The question of high interest rates round the world is another factor and I was glad to see that Japan moved to reduce its interest rates this week; I hope that it is preparation for G7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The American view is well known and as international rates begin to come down pressure will be reduced on our interest rates.  Indeed, our market is very liquid at the moment.  There are shortfalls in the areas of unemployment and health. Nobody can foretell the cost at the beginning of the year and, as I said, cars and sales suffered in the first half of the year. Employment is quite clearly holding up because of the additional receipts from <Col N="578" /> PAYE and PRSI, which is very satisfactory at a time when jobs are being lost wholesale in other economies.</P>

Does he propose to augment the economic forecasting section within his own Department in the light of the clear minority position to which he clung right through the first five months of this year and which has now been manifestly shown to be inaccurate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not cling to any minority advice at the time of the January budget.  The budget was based on the economic data available not alone to Irish commentators but to international people also.  The Deputy should not shake his head but should let me finish.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put the facts and the Deputy can then accept or reject them as he wishes.  In the month of December the forecast for the British economy was a 1 per cent growth but by the time the British budget was delivered in March the figure was minus 2 per cent. A month or six weeks after the Irish budget was produced the IMF and the EC came forward with projections which were as close as made no difference to the Irish budgetary position.  As I have said already, today the OECD produced more optimistic forecasts for the Irish economy.  The output growth was forecast in the budget at 2¼ per cent.  At this stage the best information available suggests that it will be 2 per cent or so <Col N="579" /> little less than 2 per cent as makes no difference.  I want to reject totally the suggestion of a minority view at budget time.  The forecasts on which the budget was based were not from the pessimistic or the optimistic end but from the centre. Many economists still say that on the best available advice what was prudent was done.</P>

      <P>I think everyone in the House realises that we must do something about the over-run on the budget deficit.  I am appalled that the Minister seems to be totally excluding the possibility of taxation increases.  He assured everyone in the House that expenditure was pared to its absolute minimum in the budget but now he is going to cut it further.  Would it not be better to at least consider increases in excise duties or VAT on luxuries, or perhaps taxation increases in the corporate sector or on wealthy individuals?  Can the Minister give an assurance that he will at least consider these options?</P>

      <P>As I have already said, this Government will not approach the subject by increasing taxation at this stage.  The philosophy of this Government has been to reduce expenditure and <Col N="580" /> correspondingly reduce taxation, and we have reduced taxation on every front.  We have reduced personal taxation at the top end from 58 to 52 per cent and at the bottom end from 35 to 29 per cent.  We have increased the standard rate band by 40 per cent.  On the indirect side we have reduced VAT from 25 to 21 per cent and we have reduced excise duties also in preparation for the approximation of taxes.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I wish to <Col N="581" /> ask a two part supplementary question. Is the Minister aware of the opinion of many independent economists that the over-run will increase the differential between Irish interest rates and German interest rates?  Would he consider as part of the package tying the Irish pound to the German mark on a fixed basis to reduce that differential?  Secondly, arising from the Minister's previous reply, I would ask him to rule out cuts in capital expenditure.  We all appreciate that cuts in capital expenditure are politically easier than cuts in current expenditure but they have a very adverse effect on employment.</P>

In relation to the quick fix solution of Deputy Noonan, who talked about tying the Irish exchange rate to the Deutsche Mark, I would <Col N="582" /> remind him and the House that, having taken over the disastrous differential of 9 percentage points that existed in March 1987 between the Deutsche Mark and the Irish exchange rate, we have now reduced the differential to 1.1 per cent. That is the differential that exists, and it is not the panacea to the problems that Deputy Noonan or others might suggest. We expect that differential to be eliminated over the next 12 to 18 months as the good economic management of the Irish economy by this Government continues.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the four Private Notice Questions together. The Government regret that it has not <Col N="583" /> proved possible to continue the roundtable talks process at this time.  The dialogue which has begun is potentially of great importance to all the people of this island and there is a shared interest in bringing the process forward to fruition. It is crucial that the commitment on the part of all participants, which has brought the process to this stage, should be sustained.</P>
      <P>The common objective of bringing peace and prosperity to this island transcends any differences in approach among the participants in these talks.  The vast majority of people of both traditions profoundly desire that the process begun in recent weeks should continue.  They want their political leaders to show the maturity and self-confidence that could lead to a transformation of relationship on this island.</P>
      <P>Consistent with our commitment to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, unless and until it is agreed that it be succeeded by new and better arrangements, we have shown our willingness to be flexible in constructing a process which would take account of the sensitivities of all participants. I would like to take this opportunity of underlining our continued flexibility in this regard.</P>
      <P>The present opportunity for progress has not easily come about and cannot lightly be allowed go by.  The Government hope that a discussion on how best to move matters forward will get under way in a positive and constructive spirit in the shortest possible time.  We will work closely with the British Government and the parties involved to this end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider it to be particularly regrettable that the discussions have broken down just before the beginning of what is colloquially known as the marching season, when there is the risk that historical passions will be rekindled and entrenched positions resumed?  Would the Taoiseach agree that in the past week a significant measure of progress had begun to be made?  Could the Taoiseach indicate what strategy he now intends to follow <Col N="584" /> on behalf of the Irish Government to encourage the parties concerned towards either a resumption of the existing talks process, the beginning of a fresh set of discussions or a picking up of the threads of the existing discussions, or whatever phrase may be used to facilitate the resumption of what appeared to be a very hopeful process of talks relating to an environment in which so much suffering has been caused and will continue to be caused so long as politicians are unable to talk together constructively?</P>

      <P>It is mistaken to use words such as &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;, &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; and so on.  I do not think we should see it that way.  I do not think that Secretary of State Brooke sees it that way.  I would like to see it rather as a situation where the talk process has been concluded for the time being.  It was always understood that the gap would end on 16 July.  That is simply all that is happening.  I do not think it would be very helpful for me to spell out anything in detail at this stage, but I assure the Deputy that the Government will be guided by two principles: first, a determination to be flexible in any arrangement that might be proposed and, secondly, to continue to reiterate our commitment to the process.  On that basis, we will work closely, co-operatively and in a generous spirit with the British Government and the parties involved to have the process brought to a successful conclusion.</P>

      <P>I now ask the Taoiseach whether he intends to make time available for a debate on the issues involved or, alternatively, whether he will brief Opposition parties on the position to date.  It is time that Deputies knew precisely what was happening and where the difficulties are arising.  The Taoiseach himself has said that the people in Northern Ireland want a solution to be found and want the political leaders to arrive at a successful conclusion to the talks.  I ask the Taoiseach to let us know what are the main obstacles, whether it is possible that the political leaders themselves are an obstacle in the way of the talks and whether new leadership would be a good thing.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would give a lead in that matter himself.  Is it intended to provide to Opposition parties time for a discussion on this issue or to provide a briefing as regards the main obstacles in the way of the talks?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the regret expresed by the Taoiseach for the position at which the talks have arrived.  I feel that the Government have been particularly flexible in the past 18 months in their approach to the talks.  Regardless of whether we use the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; or any other such phrase, the talks seem to have arrived at an impasse, to say the least.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to inform the House of the steps the Government are now going to pursue to break the deadlock?  Is it now not possible to look towards a resumption of the talks until the autumn?  If the Taoiseach feels that because of the sensitivity, which we all in the House share, in relation to the extremely difficult situation in Northern Ireland, the matter cannot be discussed openly on the floor of the House, will he give a briefing to the leaders of the Opposition parties in the House before the summer recess so that we can share with him the difficulties and complexities of ensuring that the talks are resumed and reach a fruitful conclusion?  In particular, I should like the Taoiseach to confirm whether the Government intend at this stage to take specific steps towards a resumption of the talks and whether it will be the autumn at the earliest before the talks can be resumed.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy any specific information as to when the talks might resume.  The Deputy would have heard me say that so far as this Government are concerned, we do not foresee any difficulty in the resumption of the talks immediately after <Col N="587" /> 16 July, but I do not want to pre-empt anything in that regard.</P>
      <P>In relation to what this Government would do, I assure the Deputy and the House that the Government will stay in the closest possible contact with the situation. We will avail of any avenue open to us to try to ensure that the talks are resumed and we will be as flexible as possible in our approach to that.  The Government will also be as flexible as possible in our approach to any ideas or suggestions for a possible new process to be undertaken.  I cannot say any more than that at this stage.</P>

Given that this process has now come to the end of this phase, do the Government intend to initiate any examination of their own accord and for its own merits of any obstacles that might exists in our Constitution or laws which may make it harder for discussions to be brought to a successful conclusion ultimately?</P>

      <P>Again it is important that none of us involved &mdash; this Government, the British Government or the parties &mdash; should pre-empt anything.  I believe that the best contribution we can all make is to indicate our willingness to get something started up again.  I would hope that I am not mistaken in reading the approach of all the parties to this interlude in the process as being fairly clearly determined not to injure the prospect of them starting up again.  I do not want to try to speak for anyone else in the process, but I think I would be right in reading the situation that way.  All the <Col N="588" /> parties concerned seem to be anxious, in the circumstances of the talks concluding for the present, not to pre-empt the situation any further.</P>

I propose that we have a final round of questions and I am calling Deputy Mac Giolla.  I want to explain to Deputy Bruton that Question Time does not provide for the size of parties.  It provides for the right of a Deputy to table questions.  Otherwise we would have to change it.  The Chair only interprets what is there in the best interests of the House.  That is the rule.

      <P>I want to respond to the last point made by the Taoiseach. I want to assure him and everybody else that it is our intention, and I am sure it is everybody's intention, to show the same restraint as we have done over the past 12 months.  It is for that reason that I have asked if it is possible to have a briefing from the Taoiseach over the next few weeks so that we could gain an idea of the precise difficulties.  Everybody knows about, and the media have indicated, various obstacles but I think it would be important that people be briefed.  Otherwise during the course of the summer various statements will be made which might create difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no particular objection to briefing party leaders on any matter of national interest or, in this case, a matter that concerns the best interests of all the people of this island.  If it seems to me at any stage that there is some aspect of the talks which is not in the public arena and which should properly be brought to the attention of the leaders of the Opposition I will certainly do that. <Col N="589" /> However, I cannot think of anything at the moment.  As far as I can see, every aspect of the talks is not alone in the public arena but analysed and dissected by commentators on all sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure we all share the view that restraint is the order of the day in relation to these matters.  However, I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that the Democratic Unionist Party, in a statement issued this morning, blamed London and Dublin for the collapse of the talks.  They said that the Irish Republic has sabotaged the process.  I would like the Taoiseach to make a comment on that statement, of which I am sure he is aware, from Mr. Paisley's party.  As I said already, I feel very strongly that flexibility has been shown by the Government on all occasions when called for.  These processes are taking place in the context of an international agreement signed between the British and Irish Governments in 1985 and it has been made clear from the outset that until that agreement is replaced it will stay <i>in situ.</i> However, I would like a comment from the Taoiseach in relation to that statement because I feel it should not go unanswered.</P>

      <P>I would prefer not to say anything about it but as the Deputy asked me that question I would have to say that I cannot do otherwise than completely reject any such suggestion.  I am grateful to the Deputy for his statement to the effect that this Government have been flexible because that is true.  I think we can claim quite justifiably, and the record will show in history, that the talks would never have got to the stage they had if it had not been for great flexibility and continuing compromise on our part. That is not to take all the credit for that to ourselves.  We got to a certain stage because of long, careful, protracted discussions and negotiation and indeed a co-operative approach by all the parties concerned.  We could not have got there unless that was present.  Certainly the commitment of this Government and the <Col N="590" /> British Government to the process is complete and absolute.</P>
      <P>We are determined still to do everything we can to make sure that the process is continued and there is no question whatever of our being in any way responsible for any interruption to the process. Far from it.  We have no interest and could not have any interest in that.  We are determined that the process should continue and in so far as any obstacles exist on our side, we are determined to remove them or to find some way around them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment there was an argument put forward by <Col N="628" /> the Minister and others that there was no difference between a licence and an exemption.  If there is no difference, why should we depart from the text of the European Community draft treaty, particularly Articles 85 and 86?  I cannot understand why the word &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; should not stand in the Bill before us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7.</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 28 to 30 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  (a)  The Authority may issue a negative clearance certificate, that in its opinion, on the basis of the facts in its possession, an agreement, decision or concerted practice notified under section 7 does not offend against section 4 (1).</P>
      <P>(b)  A decision on the issue of a negative clearance certificate by the Authority must be made within two months of being notified under section 7.&rdquo;.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is to put a time limit on the decision that will have to be made by the Authority in relation to issuing licences.  We are proposing a two months' time limit. There is plenty of precedent to illustrate why this amendment is necessary.  When there was not a time limit on local authorities in relation to planning applications there were consistent delays in the issuing of planning permissions.  If there is not a time limit on the competition authority within which to issue a licence it could be detrimental to business and perhaps to employment.  Without a time limit the competition authority will not be compelled to make speedy decisions.  In our experience, State and semi-State bodies take a long time to make decisions, perhaps due to lack of staff and facilities. <Col N="629" /> However, we cannot ignore the fact that delays take place in State and semi-State organisations.  We should give adequate staffing and resources to the authority and put a time limit on making decisions. Business would then know that within a definite time they would have a decision on the applications.  This would not unnecessarily hold up business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>In amendment No. 7, I am puzzled about the expression &ldquo;negative clearance certificate&rdquo;.  That is not defined in the Bill and maybe it comes from the Treaty of Rome.  Perhaps Deputy Hogan could clarify that when replying to this amendment.  If that expression is being used it should be defined in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No.10 in my name seeks to bring finality to the period for deliberations of the authority on applications for certificates or licences.  We propose that the authority should have a period of three calendar months to examine applications for certificates and licences and to give a decision on them.  If the authority fail to do anything on the expiration of the three months period, the application should be deemed to have been refused.  I put that in on the basis of a refusal because this relates to a derogation from a general law and the onus therefore should be on the applicant who seeks the derogation.  There is nothing unusual about this suggestion.  Under the Planning Acts a local authority are given two months to make a decision on a planning application and if a decision is not given, the planning permission is deemed to have been granted rather than to have been refused.  I suggest the reverse here because it is a derogation that is being sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was argued on Committee Stage that there was no need for this provision and that the authority could be relied on to deal with these applications expeditiously and to give their decisions within a reasonable period.  Perhaps they would, but there is a regrettable tendency in many judicial or quasi-judicial bodies to take far too long to give decisions.  Even the courts are guilty of that offence all too frequently.  Many of the superior courts <Col N="630" /> hear cases and reserve judgment for months on end.  I have known some cases where people have been waiting for judgments for upwards of 18 months or two years.  A person in that position is helpless.  He has no remedy.  The holding up of a decision by a judicial or quasi-judicial authority could be a denial of justice.  Whether an application is to be granted or refused, the fact of not knowing the outcome could be a denial of justice.  I wish I could have the confidence to say that the authority being set up here will give their decisions within three months but when one looks at the record of other judicial and semi-judicial authorities, one regrettably cannot have the confidence that they will do so.</P>
    <P>The question can be asked whether three months is a reasonable and adequate period for the Authority to examine any application which comes before them with all the care and attention necessary.  Deputy Hogan's amendment suggests a period of two months.  I considered this proposal but thought it would be better to err on the other side so that the Authority would not be rushed or pressured in any way.  For that reason I felt that three months was a very fair and adequate period for any Authority to examine the material submitted to them and to reach a decision.</P>
    <P>Speed and reasonable expedition on any matter of this nature is of the utmost importance.  We are talking here about business and commercial activities.  Companies have to know where they stand, whether they are in business, whether this is a viable proposition and whether they can get on with doing their business. It is most unfair to delay people for an unnecessarily long length of time and it should not be necessary.  Decisions ought to be given within a three month period. These are basic matters for examination and the Authority should have adequate time &mdash; within a few weeks, two months or three months at the outside &mdash; to make their decision.  All too often applications to local authorities are held up and decisions are not given until the very last minute.  This is not a great idea either.</P>
    <P>The Authority should get on with their <Col N="631" /> job.  If they know that this constraint exists it will be a sober reminder to them to get on with their job and give their decisions with reasonable expedition. That is their job, and they should get on with it.  I would be afraid that there could be many cases where the Authority, because they know they have all the time in the world, would not feel pressured to give a decision or may not realise the importance of speed in giving a decision and they may take their time considering an application &mdash; I agree with no malicious intent &mdash; because there is no pressure on them.  They would get around to dealing with the application when they could, not knowing the pressure being put on businessmen and companies who might be hanging on, hour-by-hour or day-by-day, waiting to know what has happened to their application, whether it is being granted or refused. In many cases they would prefer their application to be refused rather than to be left waiting.  Why should they be left waiting?</P>
    <P>A person who submits his application and is left waiting cannot do anything about it; he has no recourse to the law to get a decision from the Authority.  He is helpless.  In many cases people who are adversely affected by a decision can seek court orders but they will not be able to do so under this Bill.  The Authority will be able to say they will let him know when it suits them.  There is no power on earth which would constrain them to get on with their job and make their decision known, whatever it may be.  There should be a time constraint when it comes to making decisions.</P>
    <P>If the Minister or anyone else thinks that the figure of three months is too short &mdash; Deputy Hogan thinks it is too long &mdash; so be it, I do not mind, but there should be some cut-off point.  As I have said, commercial decisions, employment and all sorts of important matters could depend on that decision.  Members of the public, the applicant and the Authority should know that the Authority are operating within a reasonable time limit, within which they have to make up their <Col N="632" /> minds and give their decision one way or the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley):</NameTxt>
      <P>Time limits for particular actions by the Authority in relation to notifications should not be imposed by the Bill.  I fear they would be too inflexible if that was done.  The system envisaged by the Bill is new to Ireland and needs a chance to operate flexibly, particularly in its earlier years.  The Authority will be able to make arrangements in relation to time limits where necessary. If this is appropriate after some experience of the workings of the Bill it can be done by way of ministerial regulation under the terms of the Bill.  It would be best if this were done on the basis of practical experience rather than providing rigidly for it in the Bill in advance.</P>
      <P>There may well be applications of great complexity and some considerable size which could not be dealt with by the Authority within the relatively short periods mentioned by the Deputies.  On the other hand, I would envisage that the vast majority of applications will be decided within a period of months, as is suggested.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 proposes a deadline system which I believe would be dangerous. While every effort will be made by the Authority to deal with notifications as speedily as possible, it is impossible to guarantee that any predetermined deadline will be observed in every case.  For example, what would happen under amendment No.7 if the deadline passes?</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;certificate&rdquo; just like the term &ldquo;licence&rdquo; is being used to distinguish the administrative nature of the Authority's decisions.  Amendment No. 7 refers to negative clearance.  Although that is a well known concept at European Community level, those words are not found in the Treaty or defined in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal in amendment No.10 would result in automatic refusal if a deadline was not observed by the Authority. The approach of automatic grant of a licence if a deadline has passed, as suggested on Committee Stage by, I think, Deputy Barry, is far too lenient. <Col N="633" /> Correspondingly, the suggestion of automatic rejection on the passing of a deadline is far too harsh.  It is obvious that the appropriate way of dealing with this matter is between those two extremes, which is what I proposed in the Bill and which I ask the House to accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I find it hard to accept what the Minister has said.  Those of us who have been members of county councils are fully aware of what An Bord Pléanála can do to individuals and companies because there is no time limit on them when it comes to making decisions.  Very often people have to construct buildings, for which they got clearance from An Bord Pléanála, during the winter months.  This can give rise to financial difficulties for them, and sometimes they have to abandon their plans. In view of this, I do not think we should pass a Bill which does not provide for a time limit in regard to making decisions.</P>
      <P>There is a regulation which provides that if An Bord Pléanála have to write to applicants seeking information the time can be extended.  Perhaps this could get over the rigid time limit envisaged.  We have to remember that these applications can be left for a long time before any decision is given.  Companies who invest a lot of money in the hope that an application will be granted may get into difficulties if it takes too long to make a decision.  I do not see any difficulty in sticking with the three month period. However, I would prefer a period of two months, the period within which county councils have to give their decisions.  If no time limit is provided for in the Bill, people will be left waiting for decisions. Time and money are very important to these people and sometimes they can be driven out of business if there is a delay in making a decision.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this point as I do not think the argument he has put forward stands up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points made by my colleagues in regard to this matter.  This is an important amendment.  As Deputy Taylor said, <Col N="634" /> time is one of the most important factors for commercial businesses.  Time will not be a factor for the Authority, but in the case of many commercial businesses two months is a long time.  Indeed, some concerns may go out of business during that period.  This will have a knock-on effect for consumers.</P>
      <P>If we are not willing in introducing competition legislation to impose a time limit on the Authority we will defeat the whole purpose of the Bill.  In some cases some businesses may go out of business while awaiting a decision from the Authority. It is important, therefore, that a time limit of two months be laid down.  In the case of applications to local authorities for planning permission a local authority can hold up an application pending the receipt of further information, which could delay a decision by up to two months.  That should not be allowed happen in the case of the Competition Authority, given that the time factor in commercial businesses is extremely important.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that the Minister favours the introduction of regulations.  With all due respect, such regulations will not be introduced in one day and a night as the civil service do not motor at great speed on occasions.  The Minister should accept the amendment, which is not unreasonable. If he wants to extend the time limit by one month we will agree.  The Bill will be flawed if it is not amended now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I misunderstood the Minister.  Prompt decisions will be required if a business makes an application for an exemption. This Bill will lead to considerable extra costs on businesses if a decision is delayed.  That runs contrary to what the Minister has in mind.  If a time limit is laid down people will be forced to make decisions quickly.  There is no reason, if the Minister allocates sufficient resources and personnel to the Competition Authority to deal with these matters, there should be a problem in making decisions <Col N="636" /> quickly.  If a time limit is laid down people will be forced to make a decision quickly in the interests of the applicant and consumer. Past experience in the Department of the Environment should tell us that delays in deciding on planning applications lead to substantial extra costs on businesses and job losses when decisions were not made quickly.  We should not allow this Bill through without laying down the necessary time limit.</P>

      <P>Is the Chair saying that amendments Nos. 9 and 12 are related? I do not see any relationship.  They seem to be dealing with two completely different matters.  Amendment No. 9 provides that the Authority may invite any person concerned with the matter to make observations, while amendment No. 12 provides that if an application is refused it must be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> I do not see any relationship between those amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 31 to 34 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Before deciding on an application for an exemption or a negative clearance certificate under this section, the Authority may invite any person concerned with the matter to offer such observations as they may wish to make and may accept and consider such observations or submissions from persons claiming to be interested as it may think proper.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> This amendment seeks to allow people who are concerned with the matter, other than Ministers of the Government, to offer such observations as they may wish to make before the granting of a licence. I cannot understand how any business person or individual concerned with a licence application cannot make a submission or an observation to the Authority as he or she may see fit.  Confining this privilege to a Minister of the Government may not generate all the additional information or bring to attention all the material evidence and information required to make a mature decision on the application.  This is anti-business in that it does not give due consideration to all the facts that might be available before a decision is made.  The widening of this definition to include any individual is important in opening up the application process to as many people as possible who would be directly concerned.  I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>

      <P>This amendment addresses an issue which is purely procedural. If something of this kind is provided for, it should be done either by the Authority adopting procedures as they are free to do under their powers in the Schedule, or, if it proves absolutely necessary, by the Minister prescribing procedures for the Authority.  If procedures are laid down in the Bill and subsequently found to be unnecessary, unduly burdensome or otherwise undesirable, they can be changed only by primary legislation in this House.  If the Authority found them to be burdensome or unnecessary and dispensed with them, it would call into legal doubt their decisions.  As well as the principle involved that the regulations should not be made in the Bill but should be made either by the Authority or by the Minister, amendment No. 9 is, in any event, superfluous in that section 7 (5) permits the Authority to accept observations or submissions from persons claiming to be interested.  This covers what the Deputy wants to achieve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes the point that the question of who the Authority invite to make submissions is a procedural matter and is not appropriate for inclusion in the main Act.  He claims it would be more appropriate to regulations by the Minister or by the Authority. If that concept is only procedural and is inappropriate to the Act, why did the Minister find it necessary to insert subsection (5) of this section, putting into the Bill &mdash; not into any procedural arrangement &mdash; a specific Authority to invite any Minister of the Government.  It goes beyond procedure and is an enabling rather than a procedural provision.  It enables and empowers the Authority to do a certain thing.  The Authority would need power delegated by this Bill to put them in a legal position to take this step.</P>
      <P>The Minister says it could be a burdensome provision on the Authority but that argument does not hold up.  The amendment provides that the Authority may invite any person; it does not provide that they shall invite people.  It is purely a power given to the Authority if they wish to use it.  If they consider it necessary they may invite other persons to make observations or submissions.  If it is appropriate to make this provision in respect of a Minister, why is it not appropriate to make a similar provision in respect of anybody else?  It could be deemed beyond the powers of the Authority to call in other people or beyond the power of the Minister to enable them to do so.  The fact that there is already in the Bill a specific provision dealing with the delegation of power to the Authority to call in the Minister would mean by exclusion that nobody other than a Minister could be invited to make submissions. The argument could run that, if the Oireachtas intended it to be open to the Authority to invite in persons other than Ministers, the power in subsection (5) would not have been confined to a Minister.  The subsection would have provided for them to invite the Minister or any other interested person to make a submission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very modest and reasonable amendment.  What harm could it do?  It <Col N="641" /> does not compel the Authority to do anything. It simply provides that if they feel that another person or group can be helpful to them in their deliberations they can invite that person or group to make a submission.  There could be an application to do with the motor trade and the Authority might decide it would be helpful to have a submission from the motor traders' association and send for their representatives. Maybe they have something to say about this which would be of interest to us.  It would give an invitation to the Authority to proceed along those lines.  It seems quite harmless.  It could not be burdensome as the Minister says because their is no obligation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out to the Deputy, section 7 (5) provides exactly the same thing, so what is the point of putting it twice into the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is quite the same thing.  Section 7 (5) provides: &ldquo;For the purpose of the exercise of its functions in relation to licences under section 4 (2) and certificates under section 4 (4) the Authority may accept such observations....&rdquo; I think there is a distinction between accepting observations, as the subsection provides, and going out to invite people, in other words taking the initiative and seeking people who might be in a position to make helpful submissions on the matter.  I agree it is close to it but not quite the same. Under the amendment the initiative would rest with the Authority and they would be entitled to decide whom they would seek to invite in, whereas section 7 (5) would slimply authorise a person, who had by some unknown means, I do not know who, heard the application was pending, to send in a observation.  I do not know how anybody is going to be in a position to exercise section 7 (5).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How are they to know the application is pending?  I think I have an amendment down on Committee Stage to provide that applications pending were to be advertised so people would know they were pending and consequently would be in a <Col N="642" /> position to make observations as would be possible under section 7 (5), but that was voted down and not accepted by the Minister.  Therefore a member of the public, other than a person concerned with the application, would not know an application was pending, so how could such a person make observations?</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael amendment is different. That gives an initiative position to the Authority.  They say they will on their own initiative go out there and invite people to come in, but the fact that section 7 (5) is there negatives the Minister's suggestion that it is a purely procedural matter that should be dealt with by regulations.  There it is, even in his format, in section 7 (5).</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Taylor made a very valid point on section 7 (5). The difference is that the Authority may accept observations or submissions, while this amendment seeks to insert in the Bill a provision that the Authority would notify people who are directly concerned with an application and invite submissions or observations on it.  It is an automatic notification that such an application exists, that an application has been made. How often do we hear of instances where for one reason or other the publication <i>per se</i> of applications or notification through various official media are not always seen by certain individuals or people directly concerned through no fault of their own?  We have experience of that, particularly in planning applications. In rural areas if newspapers are not in wide circulation, particularly evening papers, on a Saturday evening you might find a planning application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister has rightly pointed out that section 7 (5) is to some extent a modification of the amendment and he goes some way towards the principle of what the Fine Gael amendment is about, nevertheless I feel the onus should be on the Authority to inform people better and invite submissions and observations from interested parties rather than merely accept them <i>per se</i> from organisations. In that way they can just accept them literally and leave them at that, in <Col N="643" /> other words cover themselves in so far as they have asked people to make observations and they can decide to do nothing about them.  Nevertheless, I am not going to make a big issue out of it on amendment No. 9. Section 7 (5) goes someway towards resolving the matter but I feel the Minister is walking a thin line and should understand the difference between inviting and accepting observations.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 35 to 41 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) On granting or refusing an exemption or on issuing or not issuing a negative clearance certificate under this section, the Authority shall forthwith give notice in the prescribed manner to every undertaking to which it relates and to such interested persons as it chooses stating the terms and the date thereof and the reasons therefor and cause the notice to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in at least two separate national circulation daily newspapers published in the State.  In so doing it shall have regard to the legitimate interest of undertakings in the protection of the confidentiality of their business.  The Competition Authority shall prepare and publish on a quarterly basis a report of all decisions to grant or refuse an exemption or to issue or not to issue a negative clearance certificate along with a summary of the reasons for the decisions.  Such report shall also contain information relating to court decisions with respect to matters relating to the <i>Competition Act, 1991.</i> In so doing the Authority shall have regard to the legitimate interest of undertakings in the protection of the confidentiality of their business.  The reports are to be published in January. <Col N="644" /> April, July and October of each year and the report published in a given month shall refer to the preceding three month period.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The point here is confidentiality.  This amendment deals with the publication of the granting or refusing of an exemption in two separate national daily newspapers. There was an argument on Committee Stage about the manner in which this notification was to be circulated.  This amendment also deals with the reporting procedure under the Competition Act, 1991, and states that reports should be published on a regular basis.  The amendment suggests that it be done quarterly and that it not go further than three months after the end of the previous calendar year for discussion.  Often various reports under legislation in this House wait for the annual accounts of a company or an authority.  This should not necessarily be the case.  One should not have to wait for the annual accounts or annual report of any company.  Issuing a report three months after the end of the calendar year and regularly on an intermittent basis in January, April, July and October of each year gives people valuable information on the working of the legislation and provides a mechanism by which businesses can examine the decisions of the Competition Authority and the court decisions so they become familiar with the decisions and the case law.  This will build up a reservoir of experience for companies for future application.</P>
    <P>Confidentiality can be breached by publication of these reports, so it is important to confine the information so that it does not get into the hands of business competitors.  Confidentiality is very important in this matter.  Experience built up is important and can be gained only as a result of publicising the report on a regular basis.  Various reports that are laid before this House are kept under wraps for a considerable time and issued only at the appropriate opportunity. There is no compulsion on the Minister or on authorities to issue reports regularly or under a time limit.  The fair trade <Col N="645" /> report is a perfect example.  It was finalised in December 1989 and was not published until late April 1991.  In relation to this legislation regular reports should be made quarterly and an annual report should be made not later than three months after the end of the calendar year.</P>

      <P>The main part of this amendment was discussed at length on Committee Stage and disposed of then. As far as I can see, the part of it that is new is that relating to quarterly reports. This amendment would require the Authority to carry out administrative actions which in many cases may not be appropriate. It is certainly not appropriate to make these requirements compulsory in the Bill.  They are issues best left to practical experience.  If practical experience showed that any of these were in fact necessary it should be done by ministerial regulation, for which there is a power in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The notion of a quarterly report is an overly bureaucratic approach.  It is ridiculous to expect this body or any other to produce five reports every year.  They would probably need a couple of staff employed full time to do nothing else except produce reports which are of limited value.  The Authority will publish their decisions on a regular basis, so the question of having to produce another quarterly report as well as publishing their decisions every week, every fortnight or whatever it will be, does not make sense.</P>
      <P>Apart from the annual report, which is already provided for in section 12, I think there is no need for these periodic reports.  The weekly publication of decisions and the annual report will give more than enough publicity or information to anyone who requires it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) On refusing an application for a licence or on refusing an application for the issue of a certificate under this section, the Authority shall forthwith give notice of such refusal in the prescribed manner to everybody to which it relates, stating the date thereof and the reasons therefore and shall cause the notice to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in at least two daily newspapers published in the State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that when an application for a licence or a certificate is granted, information about it is published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> That is perfectly right and understandable.  The ideal scenario, as I said earlier, would have been that advance notification of a pending application to the Authority would be published so that people could deal with them and respond to them, but that is not to be.  However, I take the view that the refusal of an application for a licence or a certificate is also a matter that warrants publication.  The public generally are entitled to know that such an application for a licence was made and refused and the outline of the circumstances of the application.  Other people in that trade and in that business should know and are entitled to know what is going on in their trade in regard to competition and applications for derogations under the Bill.  It is not a matter that should be kept secret. There is nothing secretive about it.  It is in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of the fact that if these refusals had to be published that would involve expense.  The publication of a result in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> certainly would involve some small expense &mdash; I am not sure what exactly that expense would be &mdash; but the fact that it was published, while it might result in some expense in some way, would save much <Col N="647" /> expense in another way because other people, firms or individuals who might be minded to make a similar application, would thereby be discouraged from doing so because they would know from having read it that such an application for a licence was made in particular circumstances and was refused.  If it is not published they have no way of knowing that such an application was made and refused; for all they know it is still an open issue, they may very well go to considerable expense in retaining the services of consultants and experts and putting together a substantial application for a derogation, all of which would be a complete and utter waste of time for the simple reason that an identical or similar application has already been refused by the Authority.  That is why I say it is in the public interest that these things should be known.</P>
    <P>When the Authority give a considered decision on a substantive application before them, be it granted or refused, members of the public and people in that trade are entitled to know about it.  The publication of the result of these applications would build up a body of guidelines and knowledge about the trade and that activity that would be available for consultation.  People who specialise in making these applications would know what was going on and would be in a position to advise prospective companies as to the position, just as in legal matters law cases are reported and nobody says when the plaintiff wins it is reported and when the defendant wins it is not reported.  A body of case law is built up and that provides a guideline for people's acts and actions in the future.  I would have thought that was a fair point.  While I accept the point that the publication would involve some small expense, it would be relatively small compared to what might be thrown away in a lot of unnecessary duplicated applications.  The cost of putting in an application and preparing the material would be very substantial and out of all proportion to the cost of one publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and it would save the Authority much <Col N="648" /> time in dealing with duplicate applications which might build up and which would not be submitted in the first place if the people making them knew that a similar application had previously been made and was rejected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with a request for the publication of refusals of licences of certificates.  Since refusals have no effect whatever on third parties it seems that publication is not essential and if it is not essential it should not, therefore, be compulsory.  It will be possible for the Authority to publish a refusal if they consider in individual cases that that might be beneficial.  There is no prohibition on the Authority doing that. My view in all of these matters is that the system should be kept as simple, as inexpensive, as flexible and as reasonable as possible.</P>
      <P>Procedural requirements of the kind being urged on me now in the last four or five amendments should not appear in the Bill unless they are absolutely essential. Such procedures can be carried out by way of regulation if they prove to be necessary.  There is nothing in the section or in the Bill which prohibits the Authority publishing.  I would envisage that in some cases, where a great deal of public interest might be involved or where it might be beneficial to the public at large to know of the refusal, they would publish it but it should not be compulsory because a huge number of these cases would be similar and, of course, a great many of them would be very trivial and would be of no public interest.</P>
      <P>The amendment does not require just a publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>&mdash; which I believe is very expensive &mdash; but also requires publication in two daily newspapers. If notices have to be put in newspapers under the obligation of a statute, they will be charged at the very highest possible rate, so that the question of expense and bureaucracy are not irrelevant here and there would be no public benefit from it.</P>

      <P>I take the point the Minister makes about the expense and I dealt <Col N="649" /> with it when I moved the amendment.  I would say this and I am not asking the Minister to give a reply to it now: I would have thought that some basis should be devised whereby any decision of the Authority should be accessible to members of the public, particularly people who are considering making an application to the Authority.  Maybe the Authority and the Minister could consider dealing with the matter by way of providing a register to be maintained at the offices of the Authority under which all decisions would be recorded, perhaps with a cross-index in relation to subject matters, names of applicants and so on. That register should be open to the public and available for inspection so that intending applicants for a licence could check the register to see what applications had been made and if a decision had been given on a particular matter. At least that would avoid the expense of publication and would mean that there was some public accessibility to the information.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a)  `Below cost selling' which constitutes unfair trading is to be considered an abuse of a dominant position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  In examining `below cost selling' of an `unfair trading' nature the Authority must have regard among other aspects not only to the interests of consumers at the point in time in question, but also to the likely state and development of competition and the future <Col N="650" /> interests of consumers as the consequences of `below cost selling' are experienced over a reasonable time horizon.</P>
    <P>(c)  In examining `below cost selling' activities the Authority must have regard to the following:</P>
    <P> (i)  competition within the sector in which the supplier and/or retailer exists,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the implications for suppliers and/or retailers specialising in the product or product grouping subject to `below cost selling',</P>
    <P>(iii)  the immediate and longer term likely impact of below cost selling activities on prices and service (including hours of opening) across the product and product grouping subject to below cost selling and across the range of products and products groupings supplied and/or retailed by the undertaking engaging in `below cost selling' activities.&rdquo;.   </P>
    <P>This amendment dealing with below cost selling was the subject of considerable debate on Committee Stage.  The Minister will be aware of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, and we believe that this Order should be enshrined in the Bill.  Everybody is aware of the difficulties which pertained before this Order was implemented in 1987. Indeed, one supermarket chain went into liquidation, a considerable number of suppliers lost very heavily financially and many employees lost their jobs, with a consequent loss of pensions.  This was because of below cost selling.  If there were good reasons for introducing the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, surely the same reasons prevail today?  The Order balanced the market in so far as it brought some stability to the grocery trade.  It has ensured that no major supermarket chain which is much stronger financially than another can engage for a period in a price war and drive another supermarket chaim out of <Col N="651" /> business.  That would result in a monopoly which is not in the best interests of the consumer.</P>
    <P>The basis of the amendment is to ensure that the long-term interests of the consumer are protected, that there is a level playing pitch in relation to the sale of grocery products in particular and that there is not an abuse of a dominant position by one individual supermarket chain over another.  We should ensure that the small shopkeepers in our towns and villages are not victimised <i>vis-á-vis</i> large supermarket chains.  The argument will be that the consumer is best served by the large supermarket chain in the nearby town in so far as their prices are lower than the neighbourhood shop.  That might be the case in relation to some products or it could be predatory pricing. However, one must also take social factors into account in small towns.</P>
    <P>As I said, if the reasons for introducing the Order in 1987 were good and valid, why is it not stated in this Bill that we should ban below cost selling?  The knock-on effect of not doing so could be considerable.  While I understand that the Minister is awaiting a report from the Fair Trade Commission on this Order, it is very unusual to introduce legislation in advance of it.  The report will give us some indication of what is happening in the marketplace in relation to that Order, if it has been effective and, if not, what changes could be made or what improvements are necessary in the Bill to ensure that there is not unfair domination by one group over another.  Perhaps this report will not be published for 18 months, as happened to the report by the Fair Trade Commission on competition.  However, I hope that will not be the case.  I would be grateful for the Minister's response to my complaint that below cost selling is not enshrined in this legislation.  What impact does he consider it will have on consumer prices and the abuse of a dominant position? What powers will he subsequently have to reintroduce the ban on below cost selling through this Bill, if necessary, following the publication of the report?</P>

      <P>As Deputy Hogan said, this question was debated at great length on Committee Stage.  This is essentially the same point, I think it is exactly the same amendment, if not, it is certainly within a word or two of it.  It is not the normal purpose of Report Stage to replicate the debate on Committee Stage, particularly in respect of matters which were specifically decided there, as this question was.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Rome does not contain any explicit reference to below cost selling and it does not contain any explicit ban on below cost selling.  It also does not contain any explicit reference or ban on perhaps 200 other practices which are disapproved of an disallowed for different reasons in particular circumstances. However, that does not invalidate the fact that they are not allowed.  Selling below cost is not always necessarily anti-competitive &mdash; I emphasise that &mdash; and to put in a provision like this would have unfair results.  It would mean that fresh produce which was going off, or liable to go off shortly, could not be disposed of by a shop and anything fresh unsold within one day of coming in would have to be thrown out if it could not be disposed of in the normal way.  We cannot have a blanket ban of this kind.  The existing order in force does not create a blanket ban of the kind envisaged in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" /> Predatory pricing has been recognised by the European Court of Justice as being one form of abuse of a dominant position. Below cost selling can often be regarded as predatory pricing but the two terms are not necessarily the same.  One does not necessarily equal the other.  Below cost selling which constitutes predatory pricing is the form that creates the problem. I am satisfied that the Bill will cover it for that reason, when one takes into account the judgments that have been given in the European Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>The amendment seems to intend to deal with difficulties perceived in the grocery trade but this section and this amendment is not the way to address these difficulties; it can be done differently. What I have made clear during Committee Stage and I repeat it now &mdash; I have said this many times in the House and outside it &mdash; is that I have no proposal or intention to repeal the existing grocery Order until I have had the opportunity to see consider fully the report of the Fair Trade Commission into the grocery trade and until I have had the opportunity to see how this Bill will work in practice in relation to the matter concerned.  Until I am satisfied in that regard I do not propose to repeal the order.  The Deputy need have no fears in that regard.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 which I understand is being taken with amendment No. 14 seeks to add a further provision to what effectively are the provisions of Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  The introduction of these terms would mean a significant departure from the wording of the Treaty of Rome.  It would not be a good idea to encumber section 5 of this Bill with a long list of particular practices. If that is done, anything that might arise in the future and which is not included in the list would, by implication, be excluded from the provisions of the section and from the protection that is given by the section, and that would be a pity.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 5 lists particular general examples which are drawn directly from Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  It should be noted that that <Col N="654" /> subsection starts with the words &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of&rdquo; in order not to prejudice the generality of the prohibition.  Thus it will be open to the courts to examine particular practices without their being enumerated separately in the Bill.  If we start enumerating them in the Bill anything that is not enumerated will in practice tend not to be considered by the courts.  Therefore, undesirable practices of a kind that are not engaged in at present but which might start in a year's time or five years' time would be regarded as being outside the scope of the prohibition, and I think everyone in the House would agree that that would be entirely wrong.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 15 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) If a complaint is made to the Authority by any person that an abuse has occurred which is prohibited by this section the Authority shall, unless it considers the complaint to be frivolous, investigate the complaint and shall report its findings to the Minister.  If, in the opinion of the Authority, the findings so warrant, the Authority may proceed with any of the proceedings provided for in this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important amendment.  It proposes to give an important role to the Authority that they otherwise would not have under the terms of the Bill.  It seems that an ordinary individual or consumer would not have the resources available to them to investigate the question of whether a dominant position had been built up in trading goods and whether it was being abused.  That is a very major and complex question and would require resources and expertise that the ordinary citizen in this country would not have.  A person or small company who felt they were being adversely affected and were <Col N="655" /> losing out would not be in a position to retain economists and experts and to make all the exhaustive detailed inquiries necessary to enable them to go to the High Court or Circuit Court, as may now be the case under the Minister's welcome amendment, to try to prove that a particular large company had established a dominant position in a particular trade and that they were abusing that position. One would need the evidence of economists, experts, specialists and so on to establish that.</P>
    <P>What I am seeking to do by way of this amendment is to give a role to the main controlling body in charge, namely the Authority.  The Authority should have at their disposal staff to examine these matters.  After all, they will be dealing with applications and will need expertise at their disposal all the time to enable them to come to informed decisions.  If any individual or small company makes a complaint to the Authority that an abuse of a dominant position has occurred of a type which is prohibited by the Act the Authority, unless they consider the complaint to be a frivolous one not worthy of being followed up, would investigate the complaint.  They would put at the disposal of members of the public and of consumers their staff and resources to investigate the allegation, provided they have first come to the conclusion that the complaint is not a frivolous one.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is to have any real meaning in so far as ordinary people, consumers and small companies are concerned, the Authority must have a role in the enforcement of the protections being granted by this Bill.  The Bill is an important one, and I know the Minister regards it as such.  I would not over-emphasise its importance but it certainly has a very important role to play.  In common with others, I am anxious that the new rules and controls being introduced in this Bill have at least a reasonable prospect of being enforced.  If the enforcement is to be left entirely to the private citizen to carry out from their own resources a <Col N="656" /> major difficulty would arise in many cases.</P>
    <P>There would be no problem in so far as big powerful companies are concerned. They could call in economists and all the expertise they would need to set about a court action to try to stop an abuse of a dominant position, but that would not be the case for the ordinary person.  The only body they could turn to for help would be the Authority set up under this Bill, who would have knowledge of these cases, would have examined them and dealt with applications for exemptions and would have people at their disposal to carry out an investigation.  My amendment states that the Authority shall carry out an investigation, report their findings to the Minister and, if there has been an abuse of a dominant position they may &mdash; may is the word I use &mdash; proceed with any of the actions authorised by the Act. There would be no obligation on them to do so.  It will be noted that they may proceed to do that, and hopefully in an appropriate case they would do so.  I commend amendment No. 16 on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with what Deputy Taylor has said.  The whole purpose of the Bill is weakened by the fact that the Authority will not be able to provide this remedy to the aggrieved person.  It seems that on the one hand the Minister wants to end anti-competitive or concerted practices that disort trade, whether it is an abuse of a dominant position or whatever, but the actual remedy is beyond the scope of the aggrieved person envisaged in this section.  Therefore, since the amendment carefully seeks to provide that frivolous or trivial cases that might be initiated be dismissed out of hand, when a <i>prima facie</i> case is established I do not see why, if we are serious about having sanctions imposed against people who engage in anti-competitive practices, the Authority should not be permitted to take the necessary action.  At the end of the day, it is not much of a sanction if people feel they can engage in anti-competitive practices with impunity because an aggrieved person does not have the financial <Col N="657" /> capacity himself or herself to cause the necessary investigations to be carried out as envisaged under the legislation.  The amendment is eminently reasonable, and I cannot imagine why the Minister would not wish to take it on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment suggests that the Authority carry out investigations on foot of representation received from any member of the public leading to the possibility of proceedings being taken by the Authority.</P>
      <P>The primary work of the Authority is to issue licences and certificates and make judgements on exemptions and matters of that kind.  The amendment would place an obligation on the Authority, unless they could satisfy themselves that a complaint was frivolous, to carry out an investigation. In a country like this, I wonder whether it is right that a particular statutory body &mdash; which would be, certainly in its early years, under great pressure of time and other resources &mdash; could be required to carry out an investigation into every complaint it received other than those that were clearly frivolous.  That would be an obligation placed on the Authority; the Authority are given no discretion.  It would be possible for them to carry out an investigation into every complaint received.</P>
      <P>The amendment puts no restriction on the people who could complain.  For example, a major competitor or a group of major competitors of a particular business could very easily couch a complaint in such a way that the Authority could not discount it as being frivolous.  Such people could, for purely selfish and competitive reasons, cause an investigation into one of their competitors.  If Members reflect on that point, they will agree that such a position would be most unsatisfactory. If the amendment were accepted, the Authority would not have the time to do anything but investigate matters that had been brought to their attention, which is really not their appropriate function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is in many ways similar to the earlier proposal that the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade <Col N="658" /> play an enforcement role.  The idea of the Authority playing a role as is proposed in the amendment is not appropriate.  The same arguments of principle apply with respect to an enforcement role for the Authority as those detailed on Committee Stage when talking about the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  If anything, the arguments would be somewhat stronger, because the Authority have a quasi-judicial function in any event whereas the director had none.</P>
    <P>An additional point that needs to be made is that since the Authority carry out the role of investigation and adjudication on applications for licences and certificates, it would be particularly inappropriate to give them the role of prosecution also.</P>
    <P>One of the Bill's core features is its enforcement mechanism, which has been debated at length on both Second Stage and Committee Stage.  It is not necessary to go into that issue again, but in the very limited competition or anti-restrictive practice law in Ireland until now, emphasis was laid on the State as the primary enforcement agency.  Provision was made for some private enforcement of the legislation, but that was rarely used.  The kind of enforcement provisions under the Bill are the best in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (4) gives the Minister power to take action in the public interest when he considers that it is appropriate to do so.  In other cases it is appropriate that the aggrieved party take the action, particularly when that concerns people whose economic rights have been damaged. It is not appropriate that the Authority should be compelled to hold an investigation on the complaint of &ldquo;any&rdquo; person in the State unless that complaint were shown to be frivolous.  It is easy to put together a complaint and show that it is not entirely frivolous, but the amendment would place an impossible burden on the Authority and would open up avenues for the most serious abuse between competitors in a particular trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not impose any undue burden on the Authority for them <Col N="659" /> to send out an investigator to investigate a complaint when such complaint is genuine and not frivolous.  After all, section 5 takes steps to prohibit certain activities, that is, the abuse of a dominant trading position.  Abuse of a dominant trading position is prohibited by law.  We have an obligation to ensure that that means something, that that will be carried into effect.  I hope it is not intended to convey that abuse of a dominant trading position is prohibited, provided the person adversely affected has substantial money and resources and is able to do something about it.  Is that what is meant when it is said that such activity is prohibited? Is the activity prohibited only provided the company hit by it has substantial resources?  The legislation must mean more than that.  The free legal aid system would be completely inadequate and of no help in such instances.</P>
      <P>People or companies adversely affected by the new right given under the Bill would have to be able to turn to somebody or some Authority for help if they did not have the resources behind them to take the necessary action, and most people will not have the necessary resources.  The Authority would be an appropriate body to do that.  They will know about the business, they will be involved in it; they will have a quasi-judicial function in so far as applications for exemptions are concerned, but that is not at issue here.  What is at issue is abuse of a dominant position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to any citizen to make a complaint to the gardaí about actions prohibited by law, and nobody says that it imposes a terrible burden on the gardaí to investigate things that are prohibited. <Col N="660" /> That is their job.  When something is prohibited by an Act of the Oireachtas a private citizen should be able to turn to someone or some Government institution &mdash; be it the Authority, the Director of Consumer Affairs or someone else &mdash; for help.  That is all I seek to provide in the amendment.  There should be a person or an organisation to whom private citizens can turn, otherwise there is no great merit in prohibiting anti-restrictive activity.  That may be prohibited, but nothing will happen unless there are the means provided to do something about it.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that the matter should be amendable to prosecution in the District Court but the Bill does not provide that.  The Minister considered that, as he told us on Committee Stage, and decided that the civil remedy was the appropriate one.  I am not sure whether that was the correct decision, but that is neither here nor there.  It is the civil remedy that has been decided on, even though the conduct is described as being prohibited rather than as unlawful or anything else.  It must be the Authority and it is a matter for the Minister and the Government to provide whatever resources are reasonably necessary to the Authority to enable them to investigate a genuine complaint made to them, and if they decide that there is something in the complaint when they carry out the investigation and they consider it appropriate, they may &mdash; they do not have to &mdash; bring an application or an injunction. They may do so if they consider the circumstances warrant it.  I believe this amendment is important and I hope the House will support it.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  This section applies to both private and public sector companies and agencies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that public sector companies are covered. Semi-State companies have a tremendous advantage and a monopoly in many cases and it is difficult to justify their exemption from this.  The ESB, for instance, have an effect on traders dealing in television.  By using their offices to sell television sets, and through their use of an unfair hire purchase system, the ESB have a definite advantage.  They also send out advertisements with their bills. It would be grossly unfair if small family firms and private companies who have been giving employment and a service down the years were wiped out.  The figures show that the ESB may have up to 87 per cent of hire purchase sales and that is serious.  If we are talking about a Competition Bill and a level playing pitch we will have to see that the pitch is levelled in favour of private individuals.  I want an assurance from the Minister that my worries are unfounded and that companies such as the ESB will be covered by this Bill.</P>

      <P>This amendment is <Col N="664" /> unnecessary.  We discussed this issue fully this morning and I made it clear that the Bill applies to commercial activities in both the private and the public sector without distinction.  That was made abundantly clear this morning in a debate on an amendment in the names of Deputies Rabbitte and Taylor which would have had the opposite effect, in other words that the Bill should not apply to public sector companies.  I was not prepared to accept that.  It applies to all commercial activities carried on in the private and public sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>This was thrashed out on Committee Stage.  It is important to emphasise the problems with regard to, for instance, the dominant position which the ESB have over small family retailers.  Letters were sent to each Member to the effect that people who work in ESB offices sell white goods for some part of the day and spend the rest of the day accepting payments for bills. This leaves small retailers competing with this semi-State body in an unfair position. It is extremely important that this legislation brings to an end the dominant position enjoyed by the ESB.  If this is not done our efforts to bring in a competition Bill which will enable businesses to compete on an equal footing and consumers to get the best prices on offer will amount to nothing.  If this practice is not brought to an end small companies will go out of business.  This will inevitably lead to a monopoly by the ESB in this area, which will mean that prices will be increased. While consumers may get a better deal in the short term from the ESB they will suffer in the long term.  The ESB are able to give consumers a better deal, which is understandable in view of the amount of State funding they receive, but as I said, consumers will suffer in the long term if small family run enterprises are put out of business and the ESB are allowed to gain a monopoly in the market.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I am glad to note that this issue will be covered by the Bill.  The first duty of the company set up by the State to provide a specific service must be to provide that service at the cheapest rate possible.  The ESB were set up to provide electricity and I do not think they should be in the business of offering hire purchase agreements with no interest charges.  As I said, I am glad the Bill covers this point.</P>
      <P>This Bill will enable smaller companies to compete with the ESB on a level playing pitch.  We must remember that we now have to rely on small employers as the days when foreign companies set up here giving employment to 500 or 600 people are over.  We need to ensure that small businesses are given a fair crack of the whip and do not have to compete with a company who have large offices, in some cases offices much too large for what is required, whose offices are well heated, equipped with computers and so on so that there is no problem in offering hire purchase agreements to people buying televisions.  I welcome the provisions in this Bill to protect small retailers dealing in television sets.</P>

They referred to the need to cover all other eventualities not covered under sections 4 and 5.  This amendment seeks to ensure that other unfair methods of competition will be covered by the Bill.  Some practices which may seen to be pro-competition may, in fact, constitute unfair trading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach adopted in this legislation is to move away from the sector by sector or trade by trade approach of the old restrictive practices legislation.  We have also with this new legislation provided broad general rules to protect competition in the common good.  All anti-competitive practices and abuses of a dominant position are prohibited.  The making of orders in particular cases would be a time wasting exercise.  In a sense, the proposals provide means for the Authority and the Minister to side-step decisions taken by the court in applying sections 4 and 5.  If this were to happen it would be undesirable.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete line 29 and substitute the following:   &ldquo;(2)  (a)  Subject to paragraph (b), an action under this section shall be brought in the High Court.</P>
      <P>(b)  An action under this section may be brought in the Circuit Court in respect of any abuse which is prohibited under section 5 but any relief by way of damages, including exemplary damages, shall not, except by consent of the necessary parties in such form as may be provided for by rules of court, be in excess of the limit of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in an action founded on tort.&rdquo;.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Committee Stage, it has <Col N="668" /> always been my intention to make the law as accessible as possible to all.  There are certain constraints which must direct our decision making in this area.  Principal among these is the jurisdiction of the courts as it stands.  I mentioned that it would not be possible to give power to the District Court as it does not have the jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief as specified in this Bill.  I see no reason the Circuit Court should not have jurisdiction in this area where this is feasible under the new legislation once a body of law has been built up.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to give the Circuit Court jurisdiction in respect of any abuse which is prohibited under section 5.  This would have the effect of reducing the cost to litigants and make the bringing of an action logistically simpler.  I would not propose commencing the subsection immediately.  As I said on Committee Stage, time should be given for the High Court to settle the important points of jurisprudence before extending jurisdiction to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Full and thorough consideration was given to the possibility of conferring jurisdiction on the Circuit Court for actions under section 4.  Several difficulties arose but the pivotal one centred around the right already enshrined in the Bill to appeal decisions of the Authority to grant a licence or certificate.  If jurisdiction were granted to the Circuit Court it would lead to the unsatisfactory situation where proceedings in some cases would be commenced in the High Court and others in the Circuit Court in different counties with the potential for different decisions in different courts at the same time.  This would certainly lead to protracted confusion and uncertainty which would be in nobody's interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment in so far as it goes but I am sorry that the Minister did not see his way to go further with it.  On Committee Stage I moved an amendment which proposed to give the Circuit Court and District Court jurisdiction to entertain claims for damages. I excluded the relief by way of injunction <Col N="669" /> being granted in the District Court because the District Court does not have power at present to grant injunctions. However, it does have the power to award damages up to, I think £2,500, which will shortly be increased to £5,000. I made the point on Committee Stage that it would be inappropriate to require a claimant wishing to enforce his rights under this Bill and seeking no more than £1,000 or £2,000 in damages to go to any court other than the District Court having regard to the high legal costs and risks involved.  I argued it would be unfair and unjust to push a would-be litigant into a higher court, to the High Court or even the Circuit Court, if all he was seeking was small or nominal damages.  The Minister has met us half way in proposing that jurisdiction be given to the Circuit Court which was not proposed in the Bill as published.  That is to be welcomed in so far as it goes.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that there is a need to defer the implementation of that subsection until, as the Minister said, a body of judicial decisions is built up in the High Court.  It will be a long time before a major corpus of court decisions is built up in the High Court for the simple reason that proceedings brought under the subsection will be few and far between having regard to the fact that such proceedings in the High Court will involve enormous expense.  That will be the position initially.  The sooner the subsection is brought into play the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also regret that the Circuit Court jurisdiction, being granted in the Minister's amendment, is confined to remedies under section 5 and that remedies under section 4 are excluded.  This seems to be entirely illogical when the matter is looked at objectively.  The Minister's explanation is that appeals against the grant of licences under section 4 will be heard in the High Court which is correct but I would have thought that the way to rectify the anomaly would be to amend section 4 to provide that appeals against the grant of licences would be heard in the Circuit Court, an adequate court to hear such appeals under that section.  If the Authority are an adequate body to <Col N="670" /> consider applications for licences in the first instance the Circuit Court should be considered to be the appropriate body to hear appeals given that it is the court of appeal for many other quasi-judicial bodies in matters such as taxes, planning and so on.  I say this having regard to the fact that a decision of the Circuit Court may always be appealed to the High Court.  The matter has the capacity in an appropriate case to end up in the High Court.</P>
    <P>The present position is unsatisfactory in this respect: if an appeal is taken to the High Court it has the capacity to end up in the Supreme Court.  That amounts to major, expensive and prolonged litigation.  The level at which the provision has been pitched in so far as court hearings are concerned is too high.  The Minister's amendment represents one modest step in bringing reality to the jurisdiction in which the case is to be heard.  To that extent it is welcome but in all honesty it does not go far enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment as it is important that a person can gain access to justice.  Taking a case to the the High Court can involve considerable compliance costs and delays.  The Minister said this Bill will make a major impact on employment and a proposal which will lead to considerable compliance costs is not a step in the right direction.  This amendment which will allow cases to be heard in the Circuit Court represents an improvement. Allowing for Deputy Taylor's interest in this matter &mdash; the legal profession would prefer to see the matter being dealt with in the District Court &mdash; because of the importance of this legislation to major companies and, in some instances, to small companies the Circuit Court is the appropriate court to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Government to establish a small claims court. Time and again Bills have been enacted without the necessary resources or backup facilities being made available to the Judiciary and the court system.  Once this <Col N="671" /> Bill is enacted extra activity will be generated in the Circuit Court and the High Court.  Indeed it may be necessary to extend the number of sittings in those courts and allocate extra resources to deal with these matters.  Fine Gael have sought by way of amendment to ensure that decisions are not delayed and that action is taken promptly.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill dealing with the powers of enforcement are inadequate.  The Competition Authority will be given great powers of investigation but not the power of enforcement.  I will deal with that issue later.  Access to justice is very important and, accordingly, I welcome the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister in bringing forward the amendment sought to defer its implementation.  As Deputy Taylor said, we will have to wait a long time before a consistent number of judicial decisions is established.  It is my understanding that when jurisdiction lay with the High Court the courts here borrowed very heavily from the corpus of decisions reached in the European context.  I cannot see any reason why we should defer the implementation of the concession the Minister made on Committee Stage.  The Circuit Court is the appropriate court to hear the bulk of cases.  The major players in any event will go to the High Court <i>ab initio.</i></P>
      <P>I fail to see why people with small claims cannot be allowed access to the District Court with the exclusions listed in the amendment tabled originally by Deputy Taylor on Committee Stage concerning either a declaration or injunctive relief.  The amendment represents an improvement and will be welcomed.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Motor Insurance: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Durkan on Tuesday, 2 July 1991:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the cost of car insurance, particularly for young drivers, and asks the Government to adopt the Fine Gael proposals, namely to encourage better driving skills, safer roads, stricter enforcement, tighter cost controls on claims and a better deal from insurance companies.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann,&rdquo; and insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;concerned at the cost and availability of motor insurance, calls on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to institute a commission of inquiry into the motor insurance industry.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy Taylor). </P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>Young drivers are in an absolutely deplorable position as far as getting motor insurance is concerned. Insurance companies pluck figures out of the air when they give a quotation to a young driver and this is widespread. During the local elections no fewer than six young people in a small area raised their predicament with me.  The quotes they received for insurance cover were from £1,750 to £2,250.  I know many of those young people.  They are students from very good families with no claims history, no accidents and no convictions. They were given the brush off by the insurance companies and airily told to <Col N="673" /> take the quote or leave it because the insurance company did not want their business.  Indeed, some companies were not prepared to give a quote, which is unacceptable.  Some young people may be a high risk because of convictions or whatever, but are all young people seeking a licence and insurance cover who act within the law to be treated in that way? Adults too are being priced off the road by insurance companies.  We must remember that for many people a car is not a luxury, it is an absolute necessity. It is a requirement for their livelihood particularly if they live in rural areas where the public transport system has been run down by the Government and goes nowhere towards meeting the needs of them and their families.</P>
      <P>We often wonder why there are so many non-insured drivers.  Part of the reason is that the insurance companies, with the aid and connivance of the Government, pitch their premiums so high that many people are priced off the road, they cannot afford it.  Let us consider the position of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and his Department, on this issue.  The Minister, in reply to a parliamentary question in December, said, and he repeated the same sentiments yesterday, that his:</P>
      <P>... main and indeed statutory authority as the insurance supervisory authority, is to ensure that insurance companies meet their statutory reserve and solvency requirements.  In this regard I must respect the right of insurers to accept or reject risks in the light of their underwriting experience. There is no legal obligation on any insurer to quote in respect of any risk or to quote in any particular manner or at any particular premium and I cannot compel them to do so.  I am not responsible for the day to day operations of insurers or the exercise of business acumen on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That sums up the attitude of the Government to the whole insurance industry. The Government do not want any responsibility for ensuring that the insurance industry operate fairly and in <Col N="674" /> the interests of the community and not just for their own profit margins.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the Government make it compulsory for everyone who drives a car to have third party insurance cover at least.  There is an obvious dichotomy here.  If motor insurance is compulsory, as it ought to be, the Government cannot wash their hands of a situation where motor insurance is not accessible to some people and not affordable by many other people who need a car for their livelihood.</P>
    <P>The first issue that must be addressed is the extent to which the Government are prepared to get involved in the effective control of the industry.  When the Government bring in rules and say, rightly, that insurance cover is compulsory they cannot say, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, it is a matter for individual insurance companies to decide who they will insure and at what premium.  That is not good enough.  As I said last night, and it bears repeating, insurance companies are profit making organisations, they do not operate in the interest of serving the public and they do not purport to do so.  They are not an arm of Government.  They are a business and they aim to make as much profit as they can and pay a dividend to their shareholders.  They have to be controlled by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government say that a citizen must have insurance cover and the profit-making insurance companies are the only companies who can provide cover but the Government must control them. However, there is not anything like the degree of control there should be.  I know there is an arrangement under which a person who can prove he cannot get a quote from five insurance companies can make an application through the Minister for Industry and Commerce to a special committee representative of the insurance industry to get a quote.  That is totaly unacceptable as consumers are not represented on that committee.  It is not an independent body and is made up of insurers.  Many people claim, and I suspect they are right, that they are treated very unfairly, that they do not get <Col N="675" /> a fair or just hearing and that they are given short shrift by the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies adopt the attitude they have all the business they want, do not need certain categories and the person who gets a quotation for £2,000 or £3,000 for motor insurance can take it or leave it.  When people go to other insurance companies they are asked on a form whether they have been refused insurance cover by another company and if they answer truthfully &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, they will not be considered, their application will be thrown out doubly quick.  Their position then becomes desperate.  Many people young and not so young, are forced into breaking the law by driving without insurance.  What are the Government doing about this?  Absolutely nothing.  They put forward the argument for private enterprise.  The Minister tells us insurance companies are not obliged to take on any insurance risk, that it is not for him to say whether the figure they quote is fair and reasonable.  It is his obligation and he should ensure that citizens get a fair crack where insurance is concerned.  Most important of all, we must have an independent appeals procedure.  If a citizen feels he is not given a fair response from an insurance company when he looks for insurance for his car, whether it is turned down altogether or offered insurance at such a prohibitive premium that he cannot afford to take it out, there must be an appeals procedure. I am calling for, for want of a better description, an insurance ombudsman.</P>
    <P>If the Government were concerned they would set up an independent person, and not a representative of the insurance industry, like the Ombudsman to hear complaints and investigate them.  That person should have the power to decide whether a quotation was fair and to direct the insurance company to examine each case and, if necessary, to provide a policy for a person if it is considered fair and reasonable to do so.  There is no appeal. The insurance companies do their own thing in their own way, motivated very often by pettiness and by profit and greed <Col N="676" /> in the interests of their shareholders, not in the interests of the public at large. The insurance companies are the greatest whingers in God's creation.  No matter what one does for them, they are never satisfied.  They wanted juries abolished, so we abolished them.  Were they satisfied?  No.  They claim they are still making losses here and losses there.  Perhaps we should not regard their so-called losses as Gospel truth.  We all know that bookkeeping and accountancy arrangements can be &ldquo;readied up&rdquo; in a variety of ways. They come up with loss figures so that they can come nagging and whingeing to the Minister seeking increases in premiums.</P>
    <P>The insurers are the wealthiest and most powerful of companies.  Look at their buildings and places in O'Connell Street, Dawson Street and Henry Street. The are doing very nicely, thank you. Their constant whingeing cuts no ice with me and should not cut any ice with the Minister.  They complain about the lawyers, the courts and judges, and they used to complain about the juries.  They claim the judges are giving awards which are too large, that the lawyers are creaming off the costs and the doctors are charging too much.  Everybody is at fault, according to the insurance companies, except themselves.</P>
    <P>We should look at how they organise their affairs.  For the most part it is an utter disaster.  They are among the most inefficient of organisations in cutting their own costs and in reducing the compensation and legal cost figures about which they complain so bitterly.  They will not settle cases early when they could do so cheaply, at a fraction of the eventual cost.  They run everything up to the door of the court.  Anyone who goes to the Four Courts on a High Court sitting day will see throngs of barristers, solicitors, doctors, engineers and photographers brought in at enormous expense, which is paid for initially by the insurance companies but ultimately by the citizen by way of increased insurance premiums which are permitted by the Minister.  Why does the Minister not tell them to be more sensible in their <Col N="677" /> approach to claims, thereby saving millions?  The time to settle a case is at the earliest possible moment before a writ is issued.  Instead the matter is allowed to run on for years before being settled at the door of the court.  At that stage there are two large sets of legal costs to meet, those incurred by the plaintiff &mdash; the person who suffered the accident &mdash; and their own.</P>
    <P>Let us talk for a moment about the charges made by the witnesses.  In every case there could be two or three doctors, an orthopaedic surgeon on each side, a GP and perhaps some other specialist. These doctors know how to charge for attendance at court.  It can range from £300 or £400 a day up to £1,500 a day, payable in advance.  Let no one talk about the taxing master cutting it down.  They are not interested in that.  A specialist witness whose presence is required in court on a particular day will agree to be there provided he is paid up front.  The insurance companies pay and they say they need increases in premiums to cover their costs.  The Minister does nothing about it.  People are being priced out of the insurance market while insurance companies whinge about their own affairs but do nothing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce and I met representatives of the Law Society last night and discussed some aspects of this matter.  Members of the Law Society, the president and others, told the Minister that there are cases on record of specialist doctors requiring £1,500 up front to come to court.  That does not apply to all of them but the norm is £300 or £400 upwards.  If the case runs on for a few days, the charge is so much per day.  The engineer who drew the road maps and the photographer must also be paid.  Why do the companies not settle such cases at an early stage?  I have been dealing with them for 40 years and I know it is not their way.  One cannot persuade them to be sensible and settle a case quickly.</P>
    <P>Most people would settle a case for far less if it could be concluded quickly.  They cannot wait two or three years to get the car repaired.  The system is inadequately <Col N="678" /> staffed as a result of the deficiencies of the Minister for Justice in failing to provide adequate staffing.  Most people would willingly settle for a modest but reasonable sum provided they could do so quickly.  The insurance companies will not, however, comply and they insist on dragging the matter to the door of the court.  At the last minute they start negotiations, by which time the costs have gone out of all control.  Then they come complaining that they are losing money. This is a major factor in their losing money but the Minister and the Government condone it.  Instead of complaining about uninsured drivers the Minister should tell the insurance companies to control their premiums and set maximum premiums for different categories of people.  Unless that is done, the whingeing and moaning will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me begin by saying that there is agreement on all sides of the House to the first half of the motion being debated here tonight &mdash; namely that motor insurance costs are too high, particularly for young drivers.  This is a major reason why the Government established an Inter-Ministerial Group on Motor Insurance earlier this year.  I am a member of the inter-ministerial group, together with my colleague, Deputy Ray Burke, the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General.  The group have completed their work and will report to the Government shortly.  I expect that the Government will subsequently approve and announce a package of measures designed to reduce insurance costs for all drivers, including young drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chairman of the inter-ministerial group is my colleague, Deputy Desmond O'Malley, Minister for Industry and Commerce, who last night informed the <Col N="679" /> House of some of the group's recommendations, or endorsements of proposals, relating to my area of responsibility.  To re-cap, the relevant legislative proposals include the following:</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána will be empowered to impound uninsured vehicles; there will be a mandatory driving licence disqualification of one year for a first uninsured driving conviction. There is no mandatory disqualification for a first conviction at present; there will be a mandatory driving licence disqualification of two years for a second or subsequent uninsured driving conviction.  The present disqualification period is one year.</P>
    <P>There will be mandatory driving licence disqualification for two years, with a requirement to repeat the driving test in the case of convictions for either drunk driving or dangerous driving.  The present mandatory disqualification is one year.  The proposed obligation to repeat the driving test is a radical measure, to deter drunk and dangerous driving.  This measure will have widespread support in the community &mdash; particularly from the families of those killed, injured or permanently disabled by reckless or inebriated drivers.</P>
    <P>The blood alcohol limit of 100 milligrammes per 100 millilitres will be reduced to 80 milligrammes per 100 millilitres &mdash; the limit in most other EC member states; a breath alcohol limit will be introduced; certain loopholes in the drunk driving code will be closed.</P>
    <P>My Department are preparing the relevant detailed legislative proposals, as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The inter-ministerial group have endorsed or developed a wide range of measures relating to road safety, enforcement, the operation of the courts, legal costs and so on.  The group broadly agree that the benefits of these measures must be passed on &mdash; and be seen to be passed <Col N="680" /> on &mdash; to motorists, in the form of reduced insurance premiums.</P>
    <P>Improvement in the &ldquo;environment&rdquo; in which Irish insurers operate is clearly a top priority.  Equally important is the need for insurers to review and improve the efficiency of their own operations &mdash; in expediting the processing of claims; in negotiating competitive legal fees; in improving their underwriting systems and marketing strategy; and in cutting their administrative overheads by computerisation and otherwise.  Not all the problems of the motor insurance industry can be laid at the doors of the Government or this House.</P>
    <P>The inter-ministerial group's recommendations include certain proposals, or variations of certain proposals, contained in the Fine Gael policy document &mdash;<i>Motor Insurance for Young Drivers.</i> I do not think I will be accused of stealing Fine Gael policy proposals, as the Government had signalled their intention to, for example, impound uninsured vehicles some time ago.  I have serious reservations on aspects of some Fine Gael proposals.  I would be less than honest if I did not express these reservations in a frank and forthright way. For this reason, I could not support the adoption of the motion now before the House because it calls for the implementation of certain Fine Gael proposals which have serious drawbacks or are on some occasions unworkable.  Labour have moved an amendment proposing yet another commission of inquiry into the insurance industry.  Major inquiries were completed in 1972, 1976 and 1983 and I do not honestly believe another inquiry would serve any useful purpose in present circumstances.  The Government set up the inter-ministerial group to quickly come up with an action plan relating to insurance.  I believe this approach has proved more effective than an inquiry.</P>
    <P>In September 1990 I initiated an intensive campaign on road safety at a national seminar under the auspices of the National Safety Council.  I announced a package of 25 road safety measures which I do not wish to repeat here.  This was <Col N="681" /> followed by a major NSC road safety public awareness campaign, with the assistance of a contribution of £250,000 from the Irish Insurance Federation.  The NSC launched a special video on road safety in March.  The NSC have also commissioned special surveys on attitudes to road safety issues and on compliance with road traffic laws and regulations.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána have intensified the campaign against drunk driving, starting at Christmas but continuing at special periods throughout this year.  I believe that this Garda activity is a major factor &mdash; if not the major factor &mdash; in the reduction of road casualties this year. The provisional road accident statistics show that 116 people were killed on our roads up to end of April this year.  This represented a reduction of 37 or 24 per cent on the fatalities during the corresponding period last year.  Personal injuries declined from 2,710 to 2,378 or by 12 per cent over the same period. I earnestly hope this reduction will be sustained for the rest of the year, and that it will be a spur to further reduce the carnage on our roads in 1992 and future years.</P>
    <P>I would concede that the cost of motor insurance is influenced, to a significant degree, by the frequency of road accidents and the resulting frequency of claims.  The relevant statistics show a steady improvement from the early to mid 1980s.  Unfortunately, there has been some deterioration in the statistics since the mid 1980s.  Nonetheless, the statistics for 1990 still show an improvement on the corresponding statistics of a decade or so ago.  I will cite relevant statistics, for the information of the House: there were 216 road accidents per 10,000 licensed (or taxed) vehicles in 1990 compared with 232 in 1980, a reduction of 7 per cent; there were 4.5 fatalities per 10,000 licensed vehicles in 1990 compared with 6.2 in 1980 &mdash; a reduction of 27 per cent; and there were 83 personal injuries per 10,000 licensed vehicles in 1990, compared with 93 in 1980 &mdash; a reduction of 11 per cent.  I am hopeful that the figures for 1991 will be better than those for last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> In 1989, there were 1.3 road deaths per 10,000 population in Ireland.  This is the most widely accepted and reliable basis for international comparisons, and puts Ireland around the middle of the EC road safety league.  There is no room for complacency &mdash; we all want to see Ireland nearer the top of this league.</P>
    <P>The claims statistics for 1990 are not available.  Insurers received about 1,100 claims per 10,000 licensed vehicles in 1989, a reduction of about 35 per cent on the peak frequency of nearly 1,700 claims per 10,000 vehicles in 1982.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to our roads programme and the planned elimination of accident blackspots.  This Government introduced record levels of State expenditure on roads rising from £166 million in 1986 to £240 million in 1991 with a total of £970.17 million in State road grants provided between 1987 and 1991.  Even to the casual driver, the number of major road improvement projects which have been completed or are under construction are immediately obvious.  The discretionary grants for county and regional roads have increased from £23 million in 1986 to £68.13 million in 1991 with £182.4 million being made available in the period 1989-91.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Value for money&rdquo; is a much bandied term in most economic circles.  While this Government do, indeed, look for value for money in their road programme, the overriding criterion applied is that moneys expended on road improvements or maintenance will lead to safer conditions for all road users &mdash; be they pedestrian or vehicular.  The current Operational Programme on Peripherality commits us to completing the development of the national primary network within 12 to 15 years.  I would submit that this Government are honouring that commitment and are genuinely seeking to ensure that accident black spots become a thing of the past, as quickly as possible.  It is established policy to give priority consideration to requests from road authorities for allocation of funds to schemes which involve the elimination of high accident or black spot locations. In the memorandum accompanying their <Col N="683" /> road grant allocation, road authorities are specifically asked to have regard to the need to eliminate accident black spots when selecting road projects.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Research Unit compile road accident information and issue this to the road authorities.  This includes identifying high accident locations.  The Environmental Research Unit have recently issued cluster diagrams showing the density of accidents on all classes of roads to all road authorities. The Environmental Research Unit, in conjunction with my Department and the local authorities, have made recommendations for low cost remedial measures at high accident locations on national routes.  Proposals were issued to the local authorities for necessary action.  This programme will continue in the current year for some national secondary road locations as well.</P>
    <P>The Government favour a step by step approach to the extension of compulsory road worthiness testing.  At present, about 45,000 heavy goods vehicles, buses and ambulances over one year old are liable to annual testing.  In accordance with a 1988 EC Directive, I will make regulations later this year extending testing to about 50,000 light goods vehicles over four years every two years, on a phased basis from January 1993.</P>
    <P>The EC Council of Transport Ministers on 21 June 1991 agreed on a draft Directive providing for the testing of cars over four years old every two years.  This Directive will be in operation by 1 January 1994 in the case of EC member states with existing car testing regimes, and by 1 January 1998 in the case of Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy and Portugal.  There are almost 540,000 cars over four years old in Ireland.  I propose to consult with interested motoring organisations about the implementation of the EC car testing Directive in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Garda have initiated a vehicle defects rectification scheme in the Dublin area.  About 1,000 motorists were given the option of rectifying defects as an alternative to prosecution and 80 per cent did so.  I am happy <Col N="684" /> to inform the House that the scheme is being extended nationwide, due to the satisfactory response of Dublin motorists.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael document proposes that a minimum number of hours of &ldquo;off the road&rdquo; lessons should be mandatory before a provisional driving licence holder could take to the roads.</P>
    <P>If this means driving in an enclosed area off the public road, it ignores the impracticalities of such a requirement. Facilities for such driving simply do not exist around the country and the cost of providing them would be very high indeed.  In any event, the benefits of driving outside of normal traffic conditions and situations must be questionable.  I do agree however that learner drivers should be professionally taught by qualified instructors.  I have proposed the establishment of a voluntary register of driving instructors to the national associations representing instructors.  I have also proposed the development of an agreed course of tuition, in consultation with the IIF.  Such a course could include classroom tuition on the &ldquo;Rules of the Road&rdquo; and driving skills &mdash; before a learner driver is taken out on a public road.  I hope that learner drivers completing, say, a minimum of 25 hours tuition, at a cost of £250 to £300, would get a special insurance discount.  A minimum discount of 20 per cent would seem a good &ldquo;target&rdquo; to be aimed for.</P>
    <P>No-one suggests that a learner driver can become an expert overnight when he or she has passed a driving test.  International reports indicate that five to six years experience of driving is required to become a good driver.</P>
    <P>Let me now deal with another of the Fine Gael proposals &mdash; that a provisional licence and the first two years of a full licence would require the display of R plates restricting such drivers to a maximum 50 miles per hour.  I understand that New Zealand, has abandoned its &ldquo;P&rdquo; (Probationer) plate scheme.  An &ldquo;R&rdquo; (Restricted) plate scheme does operate in Northern Ireland but has never been extended to Great Britain &mdash; on the grounds that its benefits <Col N="685" /> have not yet been established.  Would it be reasonable to have road traffic laws discriminating against starter drivers? The national speed limit is 55 miles per hour and a reduction of 5 miles per hour or 10 per cent for young drivers hardly seems worthwhile and could make enforcement contentious.  Many accidents happen because somebody is driving at 45 miles per hour in circumstances where they should be driving at a lower speed e.g. in a built-up area where the limit is 30 miles per hour or on a wet or icy road.  Most starter drivers are adults &mdash; not necessarily young adults, where driving is taken up late in life.  I do not consider that it would be fair to say such drivers cannot take any drink at all &mdash; when other drivers would be legally permitted to do so.  I am not aware of any precedent for a zero alcohol limit for young drivers in other EC member states.</P>
    <P>Another Fine Gael proposal suggests that young drivers be encouraged to obtain advanced driving skills, by a special discount on their insurance.  I would support this idea but think it should apply to all drivers of any age.</P>
    <P>I come now to the proposal to increase the number of driver testers in order to clear the backlog.  The backlog has already been reduced by almost a third with a further quarter having been given appointments.  The increased level of testing has exposed a high number of applicants who have no problem with waiting because they are refusing to take the early test offered to them.  The effective backlog at present, therefore, is equivalent to only about three months intake of applications.  The backlog should be totally eliminated by the late autumn.  I wonder, therefore, why this proposal has been included.  I announced, during a debate in the Dáil and in reply to several Dáil Questions, that I had increased the number of testers dramatically &mdash; in fact the level was almost doubled, from 40 last year to 79.</P>
    <P>Enforcement of road traffic law and related regulations is primarily the responsibility of my colleague, Deputy Burke, Minister for Justice.  However I think it appropriate for me to mention <Col N="686" /> some relevant enforcement statistics.  In the four year period to 1989, the Garda brought about 500,000 prosecutions, on average, for driver and vehicle-related offences.  In 1989, there were 77,000 prosecutions for motor insurance offences, 60,000 prosecutions for driving licence offences and 7,000 prosecutions for drunk driving.  About 90 per cent of the District Court is taken up in processing these prosecutions.  No one can say the Garda are not enforcing the law.  At the same time, there is scope for stricter enforcement &mdash; particularly in relation to the more serious road traffic offences.  As I have already mentioned, the Garda are giving a high priority to targeting drunk drivers &mdash; who cause or contribute to an estimated one-third of road accidents.</P>
    <P>Finally, an interdepartmental committee has furnished a report on the improvement and extension of the &ldquo;on-the-spot fine&rdquo; system.  The report recommends improvements in the existing system before it is extended to cover items such as the non wearing of seat belts and obvious vehicle defects.  The relevant improvements involve, <i>inter alia</i>, major upgrading of existing computerised systems.  Accordingly it will be some time before the on-the-spot fine system can be significantly extended.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael apparently propose that any motorist whose car is damaged by a &ldquo;starter driver&rdquo; could not claim any compensation, from the insurer, for the first 10 per cent of damage or £500, whichever is the lesser.  This would contravene both EC and national compulsory third party motor insurance law &mdash; which requires all motorists to have minimum property damage cover of £80,000 &mdash; without any deduction from the claim made by the third party property owner.  If, on the other hand, Fine Gael intend that the &ldquo;starter driver&rdquo; would have to recoup the first 10 per cent or £500 of any third party property damage claim paid by the insurer, this would mean that the young motorist would not be effectively indemnified in many &ldquo;minor&rdquo; road accidents. If a &ldquo;starter driver&rdquo; could not afford to recoup up to £500 paid by an insurer to a third party, the insurer would cancel <Col N="687" /> the policy &mdash; leaving the starter driver with no insurance at all.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, Fine Gael's proposal for &ldquo;starter driver&rdquo; insurance would not represent a &ldquo;better deal from insurers&rdquo; for a significant number of young drivers.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, what we are saying is that the inter-ministerial group have come up with a wide-ranging package of measures which will be going to Government shortly and an announcement will be made.  We think we have got it right and hopefully we will be able to reduce the premiums cost for young drivers and, indeed, all motorists in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there is hardly a person in this House who would not like to see motor insurance premiums reduced not only for young people but for all others also.  This motion before us tonight refers only to young drivers and while they suffer most I believe there must be scope for reductions right across the whole spectrum of people who are insured.  Having said that, young people do suffer most but it is also an irrefutable fact that they are responsible for most claims.  I honestly cannot understand why Fine Gael are wasting their Private Members' Time with such a motion at this time as we are all well aware that this subject has been discussed over and over again, both inside and outside this House. Regarding the call by the Labour Party for a commission of inquiry, I think this is only an exercise in further wasting scarce resources.  Some people feel that an inquiry or a commission being set up is the answer to all our ills right across a range of subjects.  Would it not be lovely if it were that simple?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce informed the House last night that he and other Members of the Cabinet are at present investigating this whole area. Is that not a better way to proceed rather than with an expensive and probably unproductive commission of inquiry. There have been previous reports and <Col N="688" /> inquiries and the Opposition now want us to throw away more money for nothing to come up with the same results again. Some of the steps that the ministerial group intend to take up to improve the situation are already on the record of the House.  Basically, as with all businesses or the running of any enterprises, good housekeeping will ensure that abuses are curbed and that there is a better deal for everybody.  The capping figure or starter premium of £750, as suggested by Fine Gael, is a totally ludicrous suggestion. This is something that obviously we would all like to see but on this side of the House we are realists and we know that it is not possible.  The problems of the motor insurance industry are much more serious and go much deeper and cannot be resolved by an idea which has obviously not been fully thought out. Where, for instance, is the money to come to an insurance company to take up the slack in the reduction in turnover that will obviously be caused by a reduction in premiums?  It would have to be spread across the company's customers.  We must remember that many of these are people who have just come out of the high premium category and perhaps have settled down to lesser premiums now.  It appears that Fine Gael want to penalise them once more and this is what would happen.</P>
    <P>As matters stand, unfortunately no company can afford to drop their premiums at present no matter how much we would desire it because of the large underwriting losses which are being experienced.  Every commercial enterprise has to strive to make a profit and it is no different in this industry.  Having said that, I still feel the insurance companies themselves should take a serious look at their own operations to try to find a better deal for their customers.  Perhaps this will happen as a result of more open competition resulting from the removal of trade barriers within Europe.  The EC is striving to create the environment for greater competition and I hope that the more varied availability of insurance will have the desired effect.</P>
    <P>We have all seen previously in other <Col N="689" /> areas the obvious benefits which accrue as the result of healthy competition.  The basic problem is that there are too many claims and that some compensation awards are too high.  I do not believe that this is because of a lack of driving skill or because the roads are not good enough. We must remember that a significant amount of money has been spent on our national, secondary and county roads over the last few years.  Indeed we are now at the level of expending approximately £65 million per annum on non-national roads, which is a vast improvement on the £8 million being spent a few short years ago.  Extremely large sums of money are also being expended on many projects on most of our main thoroughfares throughout the country.  As a result of the significant amount of Structural Funds obtained from the EC by the Government even if we were not developing an excellent road network there is still no reason for lesser quality roads producing more accidents.  If care is taken, if laws are obeyed and speed limits adhered to, there should be no problem.</P>
    <P>I agree that the strict enforcement of our driving laws is essential.  For instance, what percentage of motorists in this country wear seatbelts?  Quite a significant number do not; I remember that when this law was first introduced a very high number of motorists obeyed it, particularly because it was being strictly enforced at the time.  I suggest that it is not being enforced as rigidly at present and, accordingly, the law is not being observed in the way it should.  In the UK, when this law was introduced originally, a very high percentage of motorists obeyed it and indeed still do.  Perhaps this says something about our make-up in this country; our friends across the water are more likely to obey laws than we are. We seem to have a far more cavalier approach to some of our regulations and do not abide by them if it does not suit us.</P>
    <P>It has been proved that seatbelts reduce the risk of death and serious injury, which would have the knock-on effect of compensation claims being <Col N="690" /> reduced.  Indeed, as the Minister for the Environment outlined, this is happening in the area of drunken driving.  Another major factor in the high number of claims is the poor quality of many of the vehicles on our roads.  You only have to drive across the Border to Northern Ireland to see immediately that the quality of cars on the roads there is of a much higher standard than those in the South.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because they have better roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because cars are subject to MOT tests at a much earlier stage than in this country.  It is a regulation I should like to see brought into force here and an area I should like the Minister to look into.  I urge him to bring in legislation as speedily as possible to enforce the mandatory testing of vehicles after a period of four or five years.  Obviously a more rigid enforcement of the law in this area, even as it stands, would also be of benefit.  However, we cannot expect a cursory glance by a garda at a checkpoint to reveal many of the vehicle's defects.  In this area I should like to see specific garages designated to carry out such tests but they should then be subjected to random testing by Department inspectors.  This would prevent abuses in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings us to the old chestnut of the legal costs and the level of compensation claims.  We were all told a few years ago by the insurance industry that if we abolished the jury system the level of claims would fall dramatically.  We did that, but claims have not been reduced.  Why do claims in this country have to be higher than in the UK?  There can be no valid reason for this; perhaps guidelines should be laid down for the courts in these matters.  The level of legal representation in some court cases is ridiculous.  I would encourage, and should like to see, a tribunal set up whereby some of these claims, particularly the smaller ones, could be settled far more easily and with a significant reduction in legal costs. There is a particular problem in relation to small claims at present.  We can all <Col N="691" /> give examples and we know that when a person goes into a garage to have a car repaired one of the first questions he or she is asked is whether it is an insurance claim.  If it is, we all know that the price goes up and that, if it is not, it is significantly lower.</P>
    <P>Below a certain level of cost we also know that an insurance company will just approve the estimate submitted and will not investigate it further.  While the insured benefits in the short term by perhaps having work carried out which was not really the result of an accident, it is a very short-sighted policy as this practice leads to higher premium rates for every motorist.  I suggest that if insurance companies were faced with lower legal costs in the operation of a new type of tribunal they would be in a position where they could afford to assess all the claims submitted to them, thereby cutting out this practice.  In the long run everybody would benefit from this.  With regard to setting up such a tribunal, I was pleased to hear the Minister for Justice refer to something similar when speaking on the Courts (No. 2) Bill in the House this morning.</P>
    <P>I was also very interested to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce referring last night to a recent article in <i>Business and Finance</i>, which I had also seen, on the insurance industry and the increase in the number of solicitors over a relatively short period of time from 1,500 to 3,500.  What are they all doing? They all appear to be making money.  It must be on, as the magazine called it, &ldquo;compo culture&rdquo;.  This is something we have inherited from the United States, not only in relation to motor insurance claims but also in other claims.  Indeed, a number of people in this country make a living from doubtful insurance claims.</P>

      <P>Because of the manner in which the amendment is framed it should be taken in the event of the first amendment being defeated.  I welcome the motion before the House from Fine Gael which seeks to highlight the widespread dissatisfaction which undoubtedly exists with the insurance industry and specifically with the motor insurance industry.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party seek to delete all words after &ldquo;young drivers&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;that the prohibitive cost is contributing to the number of uninsured cars on our roads, calls on the Government to take all appropriate measures <Col N="693" /> to reduce costs and ensure that all cars and drivers are adequately insured; and urges it in particular to examine the following areas:</P>
    <P> (1)  the need for safer roads,</P>
    <P>(2)  the need for stricter enforcement of the road traffic legislation; especially in regard to drunk driving,</P>
    <P>(3)  the need for improved procedures in regard to the cost of claims and the administrative procedures of insurance companies,</P>
    <P>(4)  the need to reduce legal costs,</P>
    <P>(5)  the possibility of establishing a tribunal for personal injury claims,</P>
    <P>(6)  the possibility of introducing a national `no fault' insurance system, similar to that operating in a number of other countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There can be few service industries that have produced the level of public dissatisfaction and disquiet as the insurance industry.  Very few consumers believe that they are treated fairly or reasonably by their insurance companies; and there is much to suggest that this belief is well founded, especially in the area of motor insurance and most particularly in the treatment doled out to young drivers.</P>
    <P>The cost of insurance premiums for cars in this country is extraordinarily high and there seems to be no end in sight to the continual increases.  The Insurance Industry Federation have been leading the publicity field ensuring that their view on every increase is widely known.  Over the past few years many of the IIF excuses for continuing high insurance costs have been tackled, ranging from the compensation awards made by juries, the three counsel rule, removal of price controls, lack of compulsory seat belt legislation and so on.  Unfortunately for the motorist, insurance premiums continue to rise on an all too frequent basis.</P>
    <P>If one looks back at the parliamentary questions that have been continually raised in the House in recent years one will find two things in particular.  The Government Minister of the day tends to <Col N="694" /> trot out the insurance industry line in terms of defending the <i>status quo</i> and explaining why action cannot be taken. It seems that the Insurance Industry Federation and their members have had an extraordinary impact on the Department in as much as this line is trotted out almost uncritically.  In addition, a great many of the matters that Deputy Kenneally referred to as things that should be done, momentarily forgetting that he is a Government backbench Deputy, have been announced in this House in recent years by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister of State at that Department as being about to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I cannot find any evidence of these things having been done.  The Minister for the Environment, who quite appropriately contributed to the debate having regard to the fact that he is responsible in no mean way for the state of cars on Irish roads &mdash; regrettably they are prone to accident because of the state of our roads &mdash; again trotted out the inter-ministerial committee as being about to put recommendations and so on, but I will believe that when I see it.</P>
      <P>In one of the newspapers of 2 May 1990 the present Minister for Industry and Commerce was once again in the headlines as the Minister who does not shirk taking difficult decisions.  The article states: &ldquo;A tribunal for personal injury claims in motor insurance cases, which would establish levels of awards, was suggested by Industry Minister Des O'Malley yesterday.&rdquo;  The article went on to say:</P>
      <P>He said he was determined to tackle the high cost of motor insurance &mdash; four times greater here than in Britain. And he stressed it was time for a fundamental review of the way compensation is paid.  The average personal injury claim here is six times more expensive than the equivalent in the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal, he explained, would <Col N="695" /> try to establish a reasonably predictable level or awards.  &ldquo;If people knew within certain parameters what the level of award for a particular injury to a particular persons was likely to be it would mean that these cases would be settled much more rapidly,&rdquo; he argued.</P>
    <P>I think everyone would agree with that, but it has not been done and it now looks like it is not going to be done.  It still provides backing for quick scripts for Government backbenchers but it seems to have been dropped as Government policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Insurance Industry Federation tell us that high insurance costs are caused by the high rate of claims.  Maybe this is a valid reason &mdash; undoubtedly it is true to some extent &mdash; but on the other hand it could well be a smokescreen to hide the poor running of the insurance industry in this country and their ability to manipulate profit outturns at the end of the year as between one sector within the industry and another. Every time the Oireachtas takes action to reduce insurance costs one can almost be guaranteed that the next insurance invoices posted out to the consumers will contain a notice of an increase on the way.  It is time that a whole package of measures was implemented to improve safety on the roads and the manner in which the insurance companies conduct their business.  Greater emphasis should be placed on enforcement of the road traffic legislation.  The amendment in the name of my party outlines a series of proposals to make driving safer and cheaper for the motorist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are major problems with regard to the loadings put on policies by the insurance companies, in particular the high cost of insurance for young drivers, which are in most cases such as to be prohibitive.  While the number of claims from young drivers appears statistically to be as high as 40 per cent of all claims, <Col N="696" /> should they be expected to pay premiums as much as 400 per cent more than the average insurance policy?  Many young drivers find it either impossible to get insurance cover or are forced to pay through the nose for a policy, or of course, worse still, to drive without insurance.  The premiums can range as high as £2,000 to £3,000 and there are some insurance companies who will not even give a quotation to young drivers.</P>
    <P>I have a recent cutting of 13 June 1991, I think from the <i>Evening Press</i>, in which a reporter states:</P>
    <P>Exorbitant car insurance premiums &mdash; one 25 year old man was quoted £8,000 &mdash; have led to calls by the Consumers Association for an urgent inquiry into the car insurance industry. Premiums for many drivers under 30 have doubled in the last two years, according to the Fair Insurance Association.</P>
    <P>The Courts Act, 1988, for example, removed the role of juries in deciding the cost of compensation.  That has not resulted in any noticeable reduction in awards despite the claims made for it at the time.  The removal of the three counsel rule has not reduced the extent of legal fees in insurance cases.  In fact, legal costs are still rising.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, answering questions on 15 February 1990, claimed, as reported at column 2084 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The insurance industry expected that legal costs would fall as a result of the abolition of the three counsel rule. Unhappily, there is no evidence at all that legal costs have fallen as a result. Indeed, the contrary may well be the case.  The insurance industry itself has estimated that legal costs contribute some 20 per cent to their overall costs. I should point out, however, that, in addition to barristers' fees, these legal costs include solicitors' fees and the fees and expenses charged by expert witnesses such as doctors and engineers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor in his contribution and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> from his personal experience dealt at considerable length with the merry-go-round that is involved not merely in the area of legal expenses but in the cost of professional and expert witnesses, which are, in plain man's language, a rip-off.  Clearly expert witnesses, including medical doctors, see it is an opportunity of a quick and easy killing.  It is a rip-off and it is contributing seriously to the problems in the industry, but again it goes untackled by the Government.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the present high level of claims and legal costs is the appearance of ambulance chasing solicitors.  Advertisements are appearing regularly in newspapers from solicitors announcing that they specialise in accident claims and that they work on &ldquo;a no win, no fee&rdquo; basis.  I would not go down the road of claiming that the increased number of solicitors &mdash; from 2,000 to 3,500 in recent years &mdash; are pushing the law to the limit on compensation claims. I feel very uneasy with this practice and it may be a matter for the Law Society to act upon.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party believe that there is a need to establish a procedure to adjudicate on claims on a less formal basis than courts but which provides the consumer with an adequate means to obtain compensation from insurance companies when the matter is disputed. We have called for the establishment of such a tribunal for personal injuries.  Such a tribunal could be made up of a High Court judge and several lay assurers.  The tribunal could reduce the enormous court costs involved and could set guidelines for compensation payments.  Neither Minister who contributed to the debate explained why the Government have dropped their own commitment to the establishment of a tribunal of roughly that nature.  Commitments were made in the House that such a tribunal would be established, but that has not happened.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the poor quality of many Irish roads contributes to difficult driving, and the condition of roads is a matter for concern.  The need for additional expenditure to make roads <Col N="698" /> safe is a point that has been well made through the years, at no stage more emphatically than during the recent local elections.  This Government have not given local authorities sufficient finance to enable them to begin filling potholes, erecting proper signposts and employing road safety officers.  For example, there is a strong indication that the most recent accident involving a Bus Éireann bus travelling to Wicklow occurred largely because of the poor condition of the roads.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why the Government has continued to block the introduction of roadworthiness tests for cars. There should be a MOT test of the kind which exists in other countries and for which Deputy Kenneally argued very strongly just a few moments ago.  The Minister for the Environment has had ample opportunity to introduce such a test.  He almost reluctantly announced recently that testing would come into effect by 1998.  The need to ensure the safety of all vehicles travelling on the roads is urgent, and I call on the Minister for the Environment to introduce roadworthiness tests long before 1998.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>Tonight I wish to make a case for at least three categories of drivers who have not yet been spoken about by any Deputy contributing to the debate.  I shall refer specifically to the need for a fair rate for insurance for motorcyclists, PSV drivers, hackney and taxi drivers, and tradesmen who are obliged to use their cars in the pursuit of work and who very often have to carry large quantities of tools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the nature of the building industry and the desire of so many tradesmen to obtain employment, it is imperative in 1991 that a tradesman have a vehicle in order to pursue his trade.  Because of the nature of the building industry, tradesmen very often have to travel long distances to and from their work, and their work may require that they stay for a short time in various locations.  Therefore, in order for a tradesman to get work he must be able to carry his tools and have a car which is insured.  Their position <Col N="699" /> in relation to motor insurance is quite outrageous.  As apprenticeships are for four or five years, the vast bulk of tradesmen will be under the age of 25 years. For instance, I know of a married man of 21 who is a very sober person, does not drink and is in a stable relationship and who has a ten year old car valued at £3,000.  He has to pay the outlandish sum of £1,750 for third party, fire and theft insurance.  Everyone knows of the difficulties encountered when trying to get work, particularly in the building industry.  In order to pursue job opportunities, which are scattered throughout the city and the country in general, unemployed tradesmen are obliged to be insured at an extremely high rate.  I wish to make a case for them specifically.</P>
    <P>Motorcyclists often receive very little sympathy.  It is said that they are all young and that their bikes are difficult to control.  However, more and more people &mdash; hundreds of them in the city alone &mdash; require motorbikes not for leisure pursuits, joyriding or reckless driving but, like the tradesmen, to pursue work opportunities.  Everyone is familiar with the sight of motorbike couriers.  They are on the streets in all kinds of inclement weather.  It is fact that a monopoly prevails in the insurance industry in relation to motorcyclists and that one company has exclusive rights to insure them.  As a result, their premiums are extremely high.  They are young people trying to earn a few shillings, trying to earn a living, who put their motorbikes at the disposal of a company and work extremely hard through unsociable hours and in all kinds of weather and they are being severely penalised by the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>The third category to which I wish to refer are taxi drivers and hackney drivers. They are engaged in a crucial public service, particularly at night, and play a great role in enabling other drivers who wish to go out to drink in the evenings to leave their cars at home and travel by taxi.  Believe it or not, taxi drivers have to pay insurance premiums as much as £4,000.  I argue that the Government and <Col N="700" /> the insurance companies have a responsibility to consider carefully the reasons that taxi drivers have to pay such outlandish rates.  A great job was done this time last year, and a joint project involving the availability of taxis and the combined forces of the Garda Síochána enforcing the laws resulted in there being very few accidents on the roads at Christmas time.  Outside of the Christmas period enforcement of the traffic laws is sadly lacking.  Everybody can see the number of cars outside every pub in the city and they cause traffic jams particularly at weekends.  The statistics show that on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays there are car accidents all over the city directly resulting from the consumption of alcohol.  The Minister himself pointed out that one third of road accidents is caused by drinking drivers.  Given the amount of alcohol being consumed and the number of people driving to and from pubs, greater participation among more and more taxi drivers and hackney drivers combined with stricter enforcement by the Garda Síochána is needed to encourage more motorists to leave their cars at home.  This country is sadly lacking in that respect.  Our British counterparts take a much more responsible attitude to drinking and driving and drivers are more likely to leave their cars at home.</P>
    <P>Those three categories &mdash; people in search of work such as tradesmen who need cars for carrying tools, motorcycists working as couriers, and those who provide taxi services &mdash; should be better treated by both the Government and the insurance companies.  The Government have a very important part to play in bringing some reduction of insurance premiums to those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the debate with Deputies Rabbitte and Byrne on behalf of the Workers' Party and support the amendment moved by our party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic problem seems to be that our insurance system is much too expensive and is prohibitive for too many people, particularly young drivers, to the extent that the driving of cars without insurance <Col N="701" /> is perhaps directly related to the cost being so unacceptably high.  The Minister stated in his speech that that was not primarily his responsibility.  On the other hand, the insurance industry argue that their costs in maintaining the service are too high.  It would seem that the two main players in the area are not prepared to take direct responsibility for action.  The formula remains the same.  Our drivers must continue to pay unacceptably high premiums.  In many instances drivers are not afforded the opportunity to take up insurance at all.</P>
    <P>If it could be left at that we might all be happy.  However, the social consequences of the pattern that is now emerging are so great that we cannot be complacent.  In particular I believe that the extent of uninsured driving is not acceptable and must be addressed, and there is a strong history of direct Government intervention in the insurance industry when it was in trouble.  I refer particularly to the saga of ICI and PMPA. There was no argument that it was not the direct responsibility of the Minister or the Government when they were on the point of collapse.  The Minister said last evening of his own role:</P>
    <P>I must dwell for a short time on my role as Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to insurance and on the problems facing the insurance market in the State.  It must be emphasised that the basic role of the Minister laid down both by international and Community law is one of supervision of insurers in order to ensure that insurance companies meet their statutory solvency and reserve requirements.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say:</P>
    <P>It is not my function to tell insurers how to run their business or to interfere with their rights to accept or reject or dictate the terms applicable to any insurance policy or to interfere in their rights to charge realistic premiums in the light of their underwriting experience.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> We must challenge that hands off attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It certainly is an attitude that cannot be tolerated at the level of chaos that now exists within the industry.  It certainly does not reflect the hard line statements that he has been issuing for some time now, some of which have been referred to by Deputy Rabbitte in his contribution, all of them for public consumption over the last number of weeks and then, when it comes to answering a charge in the House, he says that really it is not his function at all.</P>
    <P>This approach is welcomed and played upon by the Insurance Federation itself because, dressing up its position in figures that really are not worth the mention, it argues strongly that there are other ways of dealing with the problem and that the problem is not with the industry itself. They tell us they are in a bind, that they have paid out so much money in claims over the past year.  It would appear the Minister for Industry and Commerce is prepared to borrow those figures without question to dress up his own arguments. They say they paid out £320 million in claims in the past year.</P>
    <P>I am advised that there is something of the order of 1,040,000 registered vehicles alone on our roads, whatever about unregistered and unaccounted for vehicles.  On a mean average that would mean that insurance should be averaging at something around £300 per vehicle per year, but that is certainly not the mean average at the moment.  In fact we are not told what is the mean insurance average, but I know it is much higher than that.  We are told that the insurance industry lost £40 million in 1988 in the motor area and £116 million in the last year with something comparable for the current year.  We are told that that is in the motor sector.  We are not told what is the overall take of the insurance industry in the motor area or how they perform throughout the industry generally in other areas.  We are not told the huge profits they make in the property, business, public liability and all the other areas in which they operate and out of which they should be expected to carry <Col N="703" /> the loss leader of the motor insurance sector.  The figures that the insurance companies present suit their own case and no one else's.</P>
    <P>We have to look a bit more closely at what has been happening over the last number of years.  During the debate on the Courts Bill of 1988 the Government presented a four point package: the abolition of the juries, which were abolished in civil cases and which has not led to a reduction in the cost of litigation; limiting counsel's fees, where the reverse has happened but still there are no regulations introduced in statute or otherwise and the Bar are allowed negotiate with the Minister and the Minister for Justice; the publication of a book on quantum damages is still awaited; pre-trial procedures were to be legislated for and that has not happened.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, introducing that debate in 1988, said that there would be a reduction of between 10 per cent and 20 per cent in premiums for drivers.  That certainly has not happened. There has been abject failure in this whole area.  The Government must stop the hands off attitude advocated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce last night and begin to take direct action by intervening in the industry.  Models exist in New Zealand and elsewhere of no fault liability, of establishing national personal insurance where people are compensated for accidents based on their need and on other criteria by tribunals and not by expensive and cumbersome courts of law. There are many propositions there that could be taken up; but it needs a Minister, in whatever Department, with the courage and commitment to do it.  If that commitment is absent anything we have heard from the two Ministers who contributed to this debate is meaningless.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of motor insurance in Ireland is now one of the highest in the European Community. Premiums here are now over three times higher than in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It is now commonplace to read in our newspapers of the unacceptably high quotes that drivers, particularly young drivers, are being given.  In many cases insurance companies are refusing to quote for young drivers.</P>
      <P>Continued losses for insurance companies has meant and will mean for the foreseable future that unless some action is taken by the companies and by the Government premiums will continue to increase and young drivers in particular will continue to experience great difficulty in getting motor insurance and great hardship in an attempt to meet the levels of motor insurance costs.</P>
      <P>The cost of motor insurance is a source of much frustration to many of our young people, in particular those young people who are seeking employment.  I am personally aware of a number of young people who had to give up the opportunity of a job because they could not afford to pay the insurance to get a car to travel to work.  This is a commonplace occurrence throughout the country.  It is a severe imposition on our young people, especially those under 25 where there is now a 23 per cent unemployment rate.  It is adding to the frustration and disillusionment with our system.</P>
      <P>The cost of motor insurance is by no means a new issue.  It has been an issue since I entered politics.  I brought up the matter on several occasions in this House on the Adjournment and at Question Time.  Several other Deputies have done likewise.  The Government have been very slow to act and I can see no reason why proposals brought forward recently should not have been brought forward years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the widespread public concern about the matter, little has been done by the Government.  Recent moves by the Government, including tougher measures against drinking and driving and the reduction in the waiting time for driving tests, will go some way towards reducing <Col N="705" /> the accident rate in this country, but they are by no means sufficient.  Further measures proposed here by the Minister tonight and also mentioned by Minister O'Malley last night are certainly very welcome.  I hope they are not too late to stem this spiralling cost of insurance cover.</P>
    <P>The causes of high insurance premiums have been gone into by many speakers here.  There are several.  The main cause is the high accident rate here, one of the highest in Europe.  A number of speakers mentioned ways of preventing this.  In addition, court awards are much higher here.  They are up to ten times higher now than in the UK.  The level of uninsured drivers is estimated now at between 8 per cent and 10 per cent of all drivers, and it is estimated that there are about 80,000 to 100,000 uninsured drivers on our roads at the moment.  This figure may be exaggerated somewhat.</P>
    <P>There are many unqualified drivers and drivers with provisional licences on the roads and despite the increase in the number of testers, there are long delays in getting a test, in some cases up to eight months.  This is totally unacceptable.  The number of claims increased by more than 5 per cent in the past year.  The average third party claim is now £17,500 which is six times higher than the UK average.  It is estimated that uninsured drivers add £40 extra to the insurance costs of each driver.  Indeed, there is a low conviction rate for uninsured drivers and the average claim rose from £5,000 to £8,000 in 1989 and is increasing.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies must bear some responsibility for the losses they sustain. Reckless competition in the seventies between companies has been replaced by a cartel monopoly like structure.  Fianna Fáil in their 1987 manifesto proposed a programme for young people and said that the cost of motor insurance was beyond the reach of most young people yet insurance companies were losing money.  Fianna Fáil aimed to resolve that unsatisfactory situation through an imaginative approach.</P>
    <P>It has taken the Government too long to come to terms with this.  They should <Col N="706" /> introduce a school road safety campaign. There should be a written or oral test prior to the granting of provisional licences.  There should be a register of schools of motoring and a compulsory course which would act as credits in the final test.  A similar system operates very effectively in many parts of the US.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that young drivers cannot avail of employment opportunities and their social life and general freedom is being restricted by the high cost of insurance.  This is an unfair imposition on young people and I appeal to the Minister, and the Government, to take on board the proposals put by many speakers tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for affording us the opportunity to discuss this matter in Private Members' time.  I thank those who support our proposals and we accept The Workers' Party amendment which is identical to ours.  I am not sure that the holding of a public inquiry, as suggested by Deputy Taylor, will resolve the problem.  Public inquiries can be long, tedious and extremely expensive and may not in the end, in this instance, resolve our problems.  The proposals Fine Gael have put forward would achieve the right blend.  They are being supported by the Workers' Party and largely by the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>Three Government speakers expressed surprise that this issue should have been raised again in the House.  I make no apology for raising it, and we have raised it at every possible opportunity.  When young people meet public representatives this one issue comes up again and again. I hope this debate helps focus the attention of the Government on a matter which is crying out for change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A statistic trotted out by the Minister for Industry and Commerce last evening virtually condemns young people to their fate on the basis that they are the architects of their own misfortune.  The figures seemed to indicate that young drivers are a bad risk, that they are dangerous on the road.  I refute that suggestion.  The figures also show that a large proportion of young people drive long distances on <Col N="707" /> the roads daily in the course of their work.  A large proportion of young people work as company representatives and travel to the four corners of the country in the course of their business.  Taking that into account and the long journeys many young people undertake inevitably they will end up being involved in accidents.  The accidents arise not because they are young or because they own cars.</P>
    <P>How many young people have been refused work because they cannot drive or get a drivers licence?  How many have been refused work because they have been waiting for a licence?  How many of us have been approached repeatedly by young people to have driving tests expedited so that they can get employment?  The figures issued by the insurance companies support the Minister's argument that nothing can be done.  Most of the proposals put forward by the Government will do little to improve the situation, and some of them are somewhat repressive.  If the Government are serious about this issue, why has it taken the interim ministerial committee so long to report?  As my colleague Deputy Deenihan pointed out, Fianna Fáil were talking about this back in 1987.  Did the Ministers stress the urgency of the matter to the interim committee, or are they kicking the issue around like the legislation to control pitbull terriers?  When an emergency arises the Government rise to the occasion and produce something that will get the people on this side of the House off their backs for the time being.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise the way the Minister for the Environment tonight sidestepped the issue of the bad roads. Another Government speaker referred to the fact that they have better cars in the North.  Is is any wonder that they have.  They do not have to cross as many potholes, drive around as many dangerous bends or drive on so many slippery road surfaces.  We have many signs warning people of slippery road surfaces.  I invite anyone to drive from Dublin to Tralee and note the number of accident blackspots identified on the roads.  We should ask ourselves why those accidents <Col N="708" /> blackspots have been identified.  The reason is that there have been hundreds of accidents there costing hundreds of thousands of pounds, possibly millions of pounds, in compensation, in Garda time, in professional medical time, in legal time and there have been huge costs in terms of high insurance premia.  There is no excuse for allowing accident blackspots remain particularly since 75 per cent of the funds needed to remove them is readily available from Europe.</P>
    <P>Insurance company figures are open to question when one asks questions like that raised by Deputy McCartan as to the total take under respective headings.  The Minister's response to these questions was vague, go to the blue book and so on.  When we asked for a comparison with other European countries the Minister was more vague.  There is not any reason why people here should pay higher insurance premia than that paid in other European countries other than the bad roads, bad driving instruction, lack of proper instruction before the young driver goes out on the road and the lack of enforcement.</P>
    <P>Those issues should be tackled instead of the Government talking about what is likely to happen in the future.  The contributions from the Government side referred to what is likely to happen in the future.  In 1987 the Fianna Fáil Party were talking about this issue and in 1991 we are in the same position.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies seem to have plenty of information available when they want to highlight their losses and make a case to keep premia high.  How is it that we do not have statistics available to help eliminate abuses, for instance where a person repeats claims ten, 15, 20 or more times?  Modern technology should be used for that purpose.  It should not be difficult for insurance companies to get the information required in those areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken on board some parts of the Fine Gael proposals.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, claimed tonight that he had put forward these proposals in the first instance.  I do not mind whose proposals they are so long as they are implemented. <Col N="709" /> People have been crying out for the implementation of these proposals which have been operated successfully for many years in other countries.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a difference of opinion between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for the Environment.  The Minister for the Environment did not accept the proposal in regard to the zero level of alcohol.  He regarded this as unfair.  Yet we are trying to bring down insurance costs for everyone, particularly young people.  He also felt that a restricted speed limit would be unfair as it would discriminate against young people.  Young drivers are being <Col N="710" /> seriously discriminated against at present and it was ridiculous for the Minister to suggest that a reduction in the speed limit of five miles per hour for young people would discriminate further against them. If the Minister was really serious about this issue he would have come up with a better answer than that.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank all those who contributed to the debate.  If the motion does nothing else I hope it focuses the attention of both Government parties on this vital issue so that it can be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 19 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Costs shall not be awarded against a plaintiff who brings an action under this section unless the court which heard the action certifies that the proceedings were frivolous or totally devoid of merit.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One has to consider here the position of a person or small company who considers that he, or they, have been adversely affected by a breach of this Bill.  He has to consider a number of important items. He considers he has important rights which have been violated, rights granted to him by this Bill.  If his claim arises by reason of an alleged breach of section 4 he must go to the High Court.  Let us consider that position.  He has to consider a number of things before he takes the field of a High Court action and the very serious risks involved in that.  He has to carry this burden himself.  He has no support from anyone.  As I have said, legal aid is virtually non-existent.  The Authority are going to do nothing.  He is on his own here.  Of course, he could just swallow his pride, swallow his losses and just carry on and say that this legislation was passed, it was supposed to protect him but it is doing him no good; or he can say he will have to consider taking the field, a High Court action, solicitors, barristers, consultants, economists, experts, the whole panoply of a High Court action and all the enormous expense involved there.  He has to consider further the real possibility that he might win the action and that the big company against whom he is claiming might appeal it to the Supreme Court, an even bigger escalation of risk and costs that could bankrupt him, ruin him and his family and put his employees out of work and so on.</P>
      <P>When you contemplate proceedings in the High Court, you have to consider that you may lose and whether to appeal.  You have to be prepared for that and take it into account.  It does not end there.  It is not just a matter of one's own costs in the High Court and possibly in the Supreme Court.  If it goes wrong and you lose, you will have to pay the other side's costs as well.  There are precious few people faced with that daunting prospect who would be prepared to undertake it.  I have tried other measures here in the course of this Bill to alleviate that situation.  All have failed except the concession of the Minister in giving a jurisdiction in section 5 to the Circuit Court which is to come into force at a later date.  The Circuit Court costs are considerably less than the High Court but still they are not inconsiderable and there would still be the possibility of an appeal to the High Court so that it could be a double effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible to have a case of considerable merit but court cases can take <Col N="719" /> strange turns.  It is not always easy to predict; in fact one can rarely predict the outcome of a High Court or Circuit Court action with anything like scientific precision.  The system does not work that way, I wish it did.  There are all sorts of uncertainties and difficulties in interpretation.  For example, the court have to be satisfied that the firm you are suing has a dominant position.  You may think it has a dominant position but they may bring forward evidence that you could not possibly have discovered suggesting otherwise in a substantial part of the State and then you have to establish the abuse as well.  There are a lot of imponderables that would make the case very difficult to predict.  What I am saying in this amendment, in a nutshell, is that if the case has merit, even though it may fail, at least costs should not be awarded against the person who brings it.  In a sense the person who brings the case is doing the State's work for it.  I make that proposition because when the State prohibits something, the State should have a role in enforcing the prohibition itself.  The State is apparently deciding it will not have any such role and that it is leaving it to the citizen to enforce what the State is prohibiting.  The person is doing the State's work for it and the least we could do is to say: &ldquo;if the case has merit, even though you fail, you will not be liable for the costs of the other side&rdquo;.  That is not such a strange or revolutionary concept. I agree that in these islands, Ireland, Britain and some of the common law countries, it is not normal but in other jurisdictions it is by no means unusual. In the United States, for example, costs are not given to you if you win and are not given against you if you lose.  I am not sure about the position in Australia or New Zealand but there are countries where that position does pertain.  It is not something that is entirely unknown even to a common law system.  It would be innovative in our jurisdiction but then the Bill is innovative, has new concepts and must be at the very least on the borderline between the area of criminal breach and civil breach.  One could have come down <Col N="720" /> either way in deciding that issue.  The Minister conceded that he spent a very considerable time in making up his mind which it was to be.  He came down on the civil side and that is fair enough.</P>
    <P>This amendment would give a prospect to some small companies or some people of availing of their rights under the Act without having to run the very serious risk of ruination and bankruptcy if a case that had merit went wrong through no fault of their own.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure we can anticipate the Minister's response to this amendment is likely to be that surely we cannot expect the taxpayer to fund an action by Irish business or by an individual or whatever, that it would be improper for the taxpayer to bear that burden.  I have no doubt that a logical argument can be set out to support that position especially in an economy where the extent of taxation contributed by the corporate sector is a great deal smaller than in any comparable European country, indeed than in any other member state of the EC.  The problem I have had with the Bill in this area is that I have never been able to get a fix on how the aggrieved person can vindicate the new rights which the Bill confers.  In a great many situations it is not easy to envisage how a person can exercise these new rights through the courts or can be reasonably expected to do so.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 23, which is in my name, is similar in many ways in the sense that it seeks to give the power to the Competition Authority, and provides:</P>
      <P>(4) Where the Authority is satisfied that any person has reasonable grounds for action in consequence of any agreement, decision, concerted practice or abuse under section 4 or 5, but lacks the financial capacity to initiate such action, the Authority may do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor has taken a slightly different approach to the same problem.  In my case I have put in what might be from the Minister's point of view the saving grace that where the person concerned lacks the financial capacity to initiate such an <Col N="721" /> action the Authority may do so.  I cannot understand or see the distinction the Minister is making between the usual functions with which the Authority are charged as somehow being in conflict with the Authority themselves prosecuting an action where they consider that <i>prima facie</i>, there is a reasonable case to do so. I do not see how that would undermine the normal role of the Competition Authority where they are satisfied from the initial case made to them that there is cause for concern under either sections 4 or 5 and that the cause for concern is such that an action may well lie but that the person or small company concerned cannot initiate such an action for want of financial capacity.  I do not know what can be done in that situation.  Surely it is not beyond the wisdom or combined knowledge of the Government to devise a method of clawing back some costs roughly commensurate with this from the corporate sector if the fear is that it would be putting an unwarranted burden on the taxpayer from the point of view of the Minister?</P>
    <P>We have just concluded a discussion on the insurance industry in Private Members' time.  The Minister previously held out the prospect in this House that we could expect a better deal for the consumer in the insurance area when the Competition Bill is enacted.  There was a reference in that debate to the very considerable contribution made at Christmas by the enforcement of the drunk driving laws, which presumably imposed quite an additional burden on the taxpayer in terms of funding Garda overtime.  I would not have any compunction about devising a mechanism to claw that back from the insurance companies.  I certainly would not have any compunction about making the insurance companies pay for the resulting improved situation in terms of claims, accidents and so on.  Similarly in this Bill the argument that it is an extra imposition on the taxpayer is not valid.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister really saying that the very fact that this Bill is on the Statute Book is a deterrent and that it will not be necessary to avail of the existing process <Col N="722" /> through the Circuit Court in the case of section 4 or through the High Court?  It would be very naive to think that and I do not believe that the Minister could believe it.  It will certainly not deter anybody who may be involved in the kind of anti-competitive practices envisaged in either section.  There is no point in conferring rights unless we confer the capacity to vindicate those rights.  That is the gap in the Bill as I see it and I do not understand how the aggrieved person, corporate or otherwise, can be expected in all circumstances to be able to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that there should be no special rule in relation to the awarding, or non-awarding, of costs under this section.  The thinking behind this amendment appears to be that it would make it easier for actions to be taken.  However, there are at least two difficulties arising in that regard.  First, the plaintiff in an action under section 6 could be a competitor or the undertaking against whom the action is taken.  Indeed, the plaintiff could be far bigger and in a much stronger financial position than the defendant and he could take the action for all the wrong reasons.  The action could in the circumstances be an almost anti-competitive act or abuse of the dominant position.</P>
      <P>The rules which apply to awards of costs should not be specially weighted in favour of one party, particularly where the possibility of the sort of situation I envisaged in that regard could arise. Second, there must be a balance between giving reasonable access to the courts on the one hand, which I am sure we all want to do, and not encouraging excessive levels of litigation on the other, which I am sure we are equally anxious to avoid. This amendment would make a plaintiff immune from having costs awarded against him in almost any circumstances unless it could be shown that his case was &ldquo;totally devoid of merit&rdquo;.  There is a real danger that this test would be too easy to pass and it could and would encourage excessive litigation, sometimes by the wrong people for the wrong reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor makes it hard for any <Col N="723" /> Minister, even one sympathetic to the underlying idea of what he is trying to do, to be sympathetic by putting down an amendment of this kind.  Unless the case is totally devoid of merit it could be found by the court to be devoid of merit and taken for all the wrong reasons.  They would still be in the position where they could not award costs against the plaintiff.</P>

      <P>It is indicative of the Deputy's approach and it is not on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte made several references to the taxpayer and seemed to assume that I would refuse to accept this amendment on the grounds that it would cost the taxpayer money.  The taxpayer very rarely enters into this and would not be a factor.  It is not to save the taxpayer; it is to try to achieve equity between parties who litigate.  Deputy Rabbitte asked how an aggrieved person can vindicate the rights conferred on him by this Bill.  He referred to amendment No. 23 and he talked about the role of the Authority.  He will appreciate that this does not arise on amendment No. 20, which is being taken on its own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>The possible role of the authority was discussed here today and it was also debated at considerable length on Committee Stage.  It was decided that this should be a civil Bill and should not be a Bill of criminal sanctions.  Like any branch of civil law, the vindication is a civil process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte also asked whether I considered that the Bill will be a deterrent.  It certainly will, the great majority of people will obey the law and the remedy for the small minority who do not is in section 6.  I am not naive enough to think, as the Deputy suggested, that because this is on the Statute Book it will not be necessary to use the provisions to <Col N="724" /> enforce it or to vindicate rights.  Of course it will be necessary, but we must also make sure that the process of vindication is such that only real rights and a genuine sense of grievance are vindicated.  The Bill should not be used as a means of trying to get at competitors in one way or another, particularly by bigger people to get at some of their smaller competitors.  For example, if you gave a large supermarket chain a virtual indemnity against having costs awarded against them, they could certainly afford to pursue some small supplier who might have annoyed them.  It is better to allow the court to have discretion in regard to these matters and let them operate it in the usual way instead of forcing artificial rules of this kind on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply briefly to what the Minister said.  He posits the position of what he calls a major supermarket chain going after in the courts a small supplier &mdash; those are his words and not mine &mdash; presumably trying to make out that the small supplier was abusing a dominant position in the market.  If those facts are disclosed, quite clearly no court would have difficulty in deciding that it is totally devoid of merit.  If, as the Minister said, a major supermarket chain was going after a small supplier, that would be totally devoid of merit and costs would be given against them, notwithstanding my amendment.  Therefore that does not add up.  To say that the adoption of my amendment would lead to excessive levels of litigation does not hold up either.  Even without the risk of costs being given against a person, to undertake a major action in the High Court or even the Circuit Court is a very serious matter and would involve huge expenditure to that person, whether they won or lost.  That is not something that would be lightly undertaken.  I cannot see that that would give rise to excessive litigation.  It might be a small factor where a person is in doubt as to whether or not to avail of their rights under this Bill, but apparently even that small matter is being denied them.</P>

      <P>We now move to amendment No. 21.  Amendments Nos. 23, 24 and 26 are related.  It is proposed therefore to take for discussion purposes amendments Nos. 21, 23, 24 and 26 together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The Authority shall have a right of action in respect of an agreement, decision or concerted practice or an abuse which is prohibited under section 4 or 5 for the relief specified in subsection (3) (a).&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment basically seeks to give the Authority more legislative power, independence and autonomy in pursuing matters in their own right and taking action in respect of any agreement, decision, concerted practice or abuse prohibited under section 4 or section 5. In this Bill many powers of investigation are being given to the Competition Authority, but the Authority are not being given sufficient powers of enforcement. The system of remedy and enforcement is weak.  Section 6 gives power to an aggrieved person to take action in the High Court as a result of activities undertaken contrary to the provisions in the Bill, and relief may be granted by way of injunction.  The Minister also has power to apply to the court for an injunction in respect of the continuation of activities prohibited under section 4 or section 5.  I cannot understand why the Competition Authority are not being given the same powers, in the event of complaints from aggrieved parties, to apply to the court for relief by means of injunction against activities that are considered to be in contravention of section 4 or section 5. Fine Gael put down this amendment so that some autonomy would be given to the Competition Authority to take an action in court on behalf of an aggrieved person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty arises on the question of enforcement of the legislation.  For <Col N="726" /> example, a person supplying milk to a large supermarket chain may be dependent on that supermarket for his living. It is very unlikely that such a small supplier will take an action against a large supermarket chain because of the cost involved and the risk of losing the contract to supply the product.  In those circumstances if the Authority is satisfied that a person has a grievance they should have power to take action and bring the matter to court.  Perhaps the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade could be given such a power also.  It is important that the Competition Authority have sufficient powers to take such action in court.  The aggrieved party may not take the action because of the reasons I have just outlined.  It would cost a lot of money to take a large supermarket to court and the case would surely end up in the High Court.  That would involve a lengthy and expensive procedure, and by the time the matter is heard in the High Court the aggrieved person would probably have gone out of business.  That is the anti-employment feature of this section.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the question of enforcement.  The Competition Authority are not being given sufficient powers to act promptly in arresting whatever problems arise and to take action on behalf of the aggrieved person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 23 is related to this amendment, and I have already spoken to the amendment.  I agree with the thinking that Deputy Hogan has outlined.  I cannot see where the conflict arises in terms of the necessity to have enforcement procedures commensurate with the powers in the Bill.  I would draw the attention of the Minister to the wording of my amendment, which requires the Authority to be satisfied that a person has reasonable grounds for action and that in such a circumstance the Authority may initiate the action.  It does not impose an obligation on the Authority to do so.  It says that in circumstances where the Authority are satisfied that any person has reasonable grounds for action in consequence of any agreement, decision, concerted practice <Col N="727" /> or abuse under section 4 or section 5 but lacks the financial capacity to initiate such action the Authority may do so.</P>
      <P>That amendment is very well circumscribed because there are a great many obstacles that must be surmounted by the person in question.  He must have sufficiently reasonable grounds for action and must satisfy the Authority that there is a basis for action.  He must certainly satisfy the Authority that he lacks the financial capacity to do so.  Other than vesting this power in the Minister, I am not clear how a person in that circumstance is expected to vindicate his rights.  I have listened very carefully to what the Minister had to say on this matter.  I know what he said about the civil process and so on, but the fact remains that it will inevitably arise that the aggrieved person will find himself precisely in the circumstances envisaged by this amendment and will not have the resources to initiate the action and vindicate his rights.  That must happen; it will inevitably happen.  I do not understand why it is necessary to distinguish between the role of the Authority as conferred elsewhere in the Bill and the enforcement role provided here for use by the Authority if it so wishes and if it feels that the grounds are sufficiently compelling to warrant its use.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>I agree with the comments made by Deputy Hogan and Deputy Rabbitte.  My approach to the issue was pretty much the same, although I went about it in a different way by purporting to add in that the Authority as well as the Minister would have the right of action. It seems to me that that could do no harm.  It is possible that the Authority would be the appropriate body to do that, they would have expertise in the field and they would be involved in it.  I do not foresee that such provision would be used very often.  It is not an ideal solution to the difficulty anyway because the remedies that would be open to either the Minister or the Authority would be somewhat more limited than those open to <Col N="728" /> an ordinary citizen in the sense that an ordinary person who was affected could get damages, but presumably the remedy of damages would not be open to either the Minister or the Authority if they were to bring proceedings because they themselves would not have suffered any damage.  The remedy by way of injunction or declaration would of course be open to them, but I do not suppose that the remedy of exemplary damages would be available to them either.  That would not be an ideal way to go about the enforcement of the Bill, but it would be some improvement of what we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall speak briefly on this matter because of the constraints on time.  I go along with the points made by Deputy Hogan, Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Taylor.  In several aspects people for one reason or another do not have the financial resources to enable them to seek legal redress to defend their position.  The Competition Authority should be given the power to go into courts and act on their behalf and make sure that a case is made.</P>
      <P>I realise that the issue came up earlier when the matter of the abuse of dominant position was debated, but I wish to refer to one group of people in particular.  The Minister knows of the position in relation to electrical dealers.  The matter came up during debate on the Second Stage of the Bill.  A serious problem exists in that the ESB have a dominant position in relation to their method of billing.  This is a matter of public policy and it is a matter deserving of detailed investigation in order to reach a resolution.  Electrical dealers are certainly not in a position to act and to bring a case on their behalf.  A large number of electrical dealers have lost out and a significant number of them have closed down in the past few years.  The Minister understands the seriousness of the problem.  I suggest that it would be perhaps in this kind of instance that the Competition Authority would be able to act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar position exists in relation to very large dealers.  Deputy Hogan mentioned the likes of supermarket groups as <Col N="729" /> against small grocers, small milk suppliers and so on.  A serious situation arises there also and the Minister has acknowledged that on several occasions.  The matter of petrol deliveries presents another problem.  Dealers do not agree to provide deliveries to some of the smaller stations around the country.  I ask the Minister to see what can be done in that regard.  The issue is worthy of attention.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Competition Authority is a very important part of the Bill, but the Authority should be given more extensive powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>The four amendments under discussion are essentially the same. They have the same objective: they seek to give the Authority the power to take action on behalf of itself or someone else. During debate on Committee Stage I stated at some length and several times that the principal task of the Authority was to consider applications for exemptions and for negative clearance and to issue or not issue, as the case may be, licences and certificates as a result.  Under the Bill that has to be the central function of the Authority.  The daily task of the Authority will be to investigate and adjudicate on such applications and it would therefore, in my view, be wrong and inappropriate to give the Authority the further role of prosecutor.  That would be something akin to there being a preliminary investigation in the District Court and then the District Court being asked to take over the prosecution in the Circuit Court or the Central Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>One of the core features of the Bill is its enforcement mechanism, which is based on an equitable balance between regulation on the one hand and the need to preserve and safeguard economic liberty on the other hand.  Under this Bill enforcement will be through private action for the most part.  I would have to reject any suggestion that would seek to unhinge that balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth noting that apart from the single phrase &ldquo;the Authority&rdquo; amendment No. 21 is exactly the same as section 6 (4).  The Minister already has all of the <Col N="730" /> powers that Deputy Barry would seek to give to the Authority.  I think that it is really enough for one public authority to have those powers.</P>
    <P>The other point that I want to remind the House of, because all Deputies who spoke referred to the need to take action to get damages, is that under the amendment that has been moved, which is an exact copy of section 6 (4)&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;damages would not be available because the Authority would be able to get only the relief specified in section 6 (3) (a), relief by way of injunction or declaration.  In the example given by all of the Deputies who spoke to the amendments, that relief would not apply anyway, even if the amendment were accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I myself was of the view that it would perhaps be preferable in certain circumstances for the Minister to have the right to damages under section 6 (4).  In some cases the obtaining of an injunctive relief comes too late, the damage has been done.  I put it to the Office of the Attorney General that I should like to delete (a) at the end of section 6 (4), which would allow the reliefs provided by section 6 (3) (b).  I was very strongly counselled against that idea and was told that in our law a plaintiff by and large cannot get damages for loss that he himself does not suffer. As a rule, one cannot get damages on behalf of someone else.  There are certain very limited exceptions to that rule, but unless within the Bill there is set up a rather convoluted system of representative or class actions or something of that kind that the Minister could take and some method whereby he could either distribute the damages to injured parties or, alternatively, pay the damages into the Exchequer, then the damages aspect simply could not be pursued.  The kind of provisions that Deputies have been arguing for could not be granted under their own principal amendment, amendment No. 21.  I draw the attention of Opposition Deputies to the fact that <Col N="731" /> they specifically confine relief to the relief specified in section 6 (3) (a).  For that reason, Deputies may, on reflection, agree that these amendments would not in fact be appropriate, whatever the intention, and they might not pursue them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to extend the time provided in the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851 for the issue by district justices of warrants of committal to prison in respect of persons who fail to pay fines or to perform conditions ordered by justices of the District Court.</P>
      <P>Orders of the District Court imposing a fine or a condition will usually provide for imprisonment in the event of failure to comply with the order.  In such a case it is necessary for the court to issue a warrant, for execution by the gardaí committing a person in default to prison.</P>
      <P>The Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, provides for the issue by a district justice of committal warrants for the non-payment of fines or for the nonperformance of conditions, directly on the expiration of the time for payment or performance ordered by the court or at the latest on the next court day.</P>
      <P>The large volume of warrants which have to be issued makes it impossible in ordinary circumstances to comply strictly with the provisions of the 1851 Act.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the District Court Rules have, for a considerable time past, provided that warrants may be issued at any time after default of payment or after a district justice is satisfied that a condition has not been performed and this rule has been generally followed in practice.</P>
      <P>The present rule dealing with the time for issuing warrants dates from 1948, but it followed a rule on similar lines made in 1926, so that the practice in respect of which doubts have now been expressed, is of long standing, and has never been challenged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>District Court Rules are made by the District Court Rules Committee established under the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  Despite the fact that, under the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, the District <Col N="735" /> Court Rules Committee are empowered, in carrying out their functions, to make rules for the adaptation or modification of any statute that may be necessary, doubts have recently been expressed over the question of whether or not it was within the power of the Rules Committee to provide for a time for the issue of warrants different from that provided by the statute.</P>
    <P>The position is unsatisfactory and the Bill proposes to deal with it by extending the time prescribed in the 1851 Act to allow a realistic period &mdash; six months &mdash; during which warrants may be issued.</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of the Bill the District Court Rules Committee will be asked to bring the rules into conformity with the provisions of the Bill so that similar doubts will not arise in the future in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (1) (a) of the Bill provides that a warrant of committal to prison may be issued not later than six months from the expiration of the time fixed by an order of the district justice for the payment of a fine or the performance of a condition.  This provision will apply in the case of an order made by a district justice after the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It will also apply to orders made before the passing of the Bill where the time for complying with an order expires after the Bill is passed.  I am satisfied that six months is a reasonable period of time to allow for issuing warrants and that it will be possible for the District Court to operate within this time limit in the future.</P>
    <P>However, in order to ensure that existing orders of the District Court imposing fines are complied with and to avoid financial loss to the Exchequer which might otherwise occur if a doubt existed as to whether warrants could be executed, it is also necessary to deal with warrants which have not yet issued or which were not issued within the time specified in the 1851 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (1) (b) provides that warrants may be issued not later than six months after the Bill is passed, where the time for the payment of a fine or the performance of a condition expired between <Col N="736" /> 1 July 1989 and the day before the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>While, on one view, there may be a doubt under the present law as to whether warrants can now issue in respect of fines which fell due for payment in this period, there is of course no doubt but that these fines are legally payable on foot of proper District Court orders.  The date, 1 July 1989, will catch virtually all outstanding fines so that it is not strictly necessary to go back further than that and it might appear unreasonable to go too far back. The Bill will remove any doubt about the power of the District Court to ensure enforcement of its orders and it also provides a reasonable time for the issue of warrants in future.</P>
    <P>This is very much a technical measure, arising from a doubt expressed in relation to the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851. The present position in relation to the 1851 Act is unsatisfactory and the Bill proposes to deal with this doubt.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter:</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first read the Bill I was sceptical about the motives behind it.  However, having listened to the Minister's speech I have been put somewhat at ease in this regard.  I accept the reasons given by the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House.  I want to refer briefly to the background to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate will enable us to briefly review some of the difficulties in the area of justice as it relates to the issue of warrants, the committal of people to prison and other related matters.  If at all possible, people should not be committed to jail.  Many people who could never be described as criminals have been put in jail for the non-payment of fines imposed for very minor offences.  This is an unnecessary practice in the sense that it takes up valuable space and prevents the committal to jail of people who should be detained.  It is unfair that people who commit serious crimes are allowed to get out on bail.  It is not unknown for rapists and other hardened criminals such as bank robbers, etc. to obtain bail under our law.  One of the reasons they are able to do this is that space in our jails is at a <Col N="737" /> premium.  This is why I believe people who commit minor crimes should not be committed to jail if at all possible and alternative penalties imposed.</P>
    <P>The extension of time provided in the Bill for the issue of District Court warrants of committal to prison for non-payment of fines might be of benefit in that it will give people extra time to pay fines and thereby avoid being committed to a place of detention for non-payment.  I hope that this will be the case.  All of us regularly meet constituents who find it impossible for one reason or another to meet the deadline for payment or to pay the fines.  These people end up being committed to jail.  Even though this is usually for a short period, it should not happen. The Minister should consider introducing an alternative form of sentencing for such people.  Jails should be kept for people who commit serious crime and are a danger to society.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made major strides in the area of justice in recent times.  The promises he has made seem to suggest that he will bring forward further legislation over the next six to eight months. The Government seem to have made the tightening up of the law in as many areas as possible one of their priorities.  While I welcome these moves by the Government they should also examine the possibility of introducing preventative measures.  At present District Courts deal with many cases involving petty criminals, some of whom end up in jail.  As I said, the Government should be looking at preventative measures.  People who commit serious crime should be brought before the court and sentenced as quickly as possible.  If the crime is of a very serious nature we should ensure that they are kept in a place of detention.  In addition, there is a need to look at the origins of petty crime.  I imagine&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your decision. However, I would have thought that we would have a certain latitude on Second Stage in this area.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Minister and the Government will look at preventive measures rather than merely look at detention, sentencing and incarceration. Much can be done.  Most of the crimes are committed by persons who come from unstable backgrounds, for example, families who are unable to order their affairs or cope, and later become serious criminals.  A strong case could be made for the setting up of family support groups.  I accept that this is not the responsibility of the Minister for Justice but such groups could be of help in city areas where a large number of families are patently unable to cope or order their affairs.  They are in need of support from voluntary family support groups the members of which could receive training from child care specialists and specialists with an understanding of family dynamics.  I would like that suggestion examined.  The Minister for Justice should enter into discussions with his colleagues on the desirability of establishing such groups.</P>
      <P>Another matter of concern is that the victims of child abuse can become criminals if they do not receive treatment because of the damaging effect it has had on them, psychologically.  It is obvious that juvenile crime is on the increase.  It has been described as a time bomb which is likely to blow up in our faces at some stage.  Therefore, there is a need to introduce preventive measures.  We must treat the symptoms at an early stage rather than the disease later.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said.  I will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage unless I learn something which would make me change my mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party will not support the Bill which has been commended to the House by the Minister for the simple reason that it is wrong to <Col N="740" /> commit a person to prison for the non-payment of a monetary fine.  Any legislation seeking to improve existing law which stipulates that a person be incarcerated for the non-payment of a fine, should not be supported by the House.</P>
      <P>I should like to outline briefly the reasons we hold this view.  First, the reason people do not pay their fines, even when faced with the alternative sanction of imprisonment in Mountjoy or elsewhere, is poverty and inability to pay. There is no other reason.  Anyone who suggests that there is a clever class of crook in our community who would much prefer to spend time in a so-called holiday camp &mdash; prison &mdash; than to pay a fine is not treating the issue with the seriousness it deserves.  I do not believe any person should be sent to prison simply because they are poor.  For this reason I argue that one is being heavy-handed, unfair and unjust in an enlightened society in using imprisonment as a sanction to force people to pay fines.</P>
      <P>The second reason we oppose the idea that people should be incarcerated for the non-payment of a fine is that it does not make economic sense.  I should like to quote some figures I elicited from the Minister for Justice for 1987.  On 18 June 1987 the Minister advised me in the House that for the latest year for which figures were available, 1986, 1,006 people were committed to prison for the non-payment of fines.  He went on to state that the average length of stay in prison was 40 days and that the average figure involved was £238.  Therefore, 1,000 or more of our citizens were obliged to spend 40 days or thereabouts in prison because they could not raise the sum of a little over £200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine the cost to the taxpayer.  The Minister advised us in the Dáil in 1988 that the average cost in 1987 of detaining a person in prison was £28,000 which worked out at £540 per week.  Therefore, it cost the taxpayer £3,600 to detain a person in prison for six weeks; in other words, to collect £238 from a person who had failed or refused to pay a fine we asked the taxpayer to spend in the region of £3,600.  We have <Col N="741" /> to presume, given that the average length of stay was 40 days, that the figure of £238 was not collected.  Does any Member seriously suggest that this makes economic sense?  Is the taxpayer getting any return for their money?  Would the system of justice have fallen apart if those 1,006 persons had not been sent to prison for the non-payment of a fine?  This would have made economic sense, resulted in a saving to the Exchequer and provided badly needed places in our prisons.  I also believe that it would not have led to anarchy.</P>
    <P>A third reason is that the Minister should rely on the fundamental document on penal reform, the Whitaker report, which has been available to him since 1985 and to which he has referred on occasion at great length in suggesting that he was taking on board its recommendations.  What that report has to say on the question of the non-payment of fines has to be examined very carefully in the context of this legislation.  It is stated succinctly at paragraph 5.15 of the report under the heading &ldquo;Confiscation to Enforce Fines&rdquo;: &ldquo;Confiscation should be the ultimate penalty, not imprisonment in default of payment of a fine&rdquo;.  That is the clear view of the commission set up by the Government to investigate the penal system and make recommendations on how to improve it.  That report has been before the Minister since 1985 but, regrettably, that recommendation has been ignored.</P>
    <P>With regard to the escalating cost of detaining a person in prison, the Whitaker Commission argued that we should get away from the idea of using imprisonment as a sanction to collect fines.  They recommended, with regard to motor offences, the area where most fines are imposed, that the motor car, the subject matter of the offence, should be impounded to extract the fine from the recalcitrant offender.  That recommendation merits closer examination.  At least it is an indication of the direction the Minister could take if he was concerned that the fines imposed were paid. There are other ideas &mdash; for example, the concept of community service as an <Col N="742" /> alternative to imprisonment which could be used as a device to enforce the payment of fines.  When fining people we could tell them that if they default on the payment of the fine for the offence they would be required to work in the community and to give public service.  I have no doubt that in the case of many people in employment who have means and who have a certain amount of community pride this type of sanction as an alternative to the non-payment of a fine would be pressure enough to ensure that they would pay their fine.  We could then deal with the very small number who are committed to prison for non payment of fines. Indeed, they are a very small percentage of the people who come before our courts, they numbered 1,006 in 1986, and I invite the Minister in his reply to tell us something of the statistical reality of the 1990 figures, if they are to hand, of those who were committed to prison for non payment of fines.  I would like to know that number, I am using the figures for 1986 to illustrate the point I am making. When we have to decide what to do with the small number of offenders who will not pay their fines I think the community would be far better served and the taxpayer would get a far better return on his or her money by having the person put to some useful function or purpose or by restricting their movement in the community and by having them put some work back into it.</P>
    <P>These ideas are not new and should not take the Minister by surprise: they are in the Whitaker report.  I would have much preferred to see something along these lines tonight rather than this meagre legislation to tidy up a perceived difficulty.  These are the three basic reasons that we are opposed strongly to the introduction of this legislation tonight.  We would have preferred if the Minister had come before us with a realistic formula to deal with the non-payment of fines by offenders in circumstances where they refuse or simply cannot afford to do so.</P>
    <P>As all Stages of the Bill are being taken tonight there will not be an opportunity to deal with matters in regard to the <Col N="743" /> legislation after tonight.  I have to ask why in 1991 we are still relying on legislation drafted in 1851 to deal with the administrative side of justice in this country.  It is remarkable that when we spoke earlier about the administrative improvement of the courts and the Minister gave a fulsome commitment that we would be making progress in this area we are now brought back to the stark reality of where we are in this general area by realising that the fundamental legislation dealing with the whole question of the issue of warrants is to be found in an Act of the Imperial Parliament of 1851.  Yet we have done nothing else in the legislative area in this regard other than to produce a one page Bill tonight to cover a loophole that some genius has uncovered.</P>
    <P>In the interim period since the State was founded we have managed to draft rules of court in 1924 and in 1948.  Where is the expertise and the overview of the workings of our courts for the past several decades and what has been happening in regard to updating all our court procedures and providing in the Department a coterie of experts to work on administrative improvements of the District Courts including the legislative basis and the rules and regulations to be drafted by the courts' procedural committees? When I was in practice and had to deal directly with the Department I remember trying to have the basic legal aid form &mdash; it runs to four pages and has to be filled up when one is claiming anything up to the princely sum of £30 for appearing in a District Court case &mdash; modified, but after six years of negotiations with the Department we still could not come up with a document that could work in something less than four pages.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a fundamental problem in the Minister's remit in the Department of getting a dynamic group of people who can look quickly and succinctly at the administrative side of the courts, make recommendations and put forward serious propositions.  In this regard a very fundamental issue arises from the wording of the legislation.  The 1851 Act provided that the warrant <Col N="744" /> should be issued directly upon the order being made for the payment of a fine when the period of time expired.  I understand that in 1851 the Legislature at the time might have thought there was no great difficulty about doing this because there were many scriveners attached to the courts, there was not such a great volume of work to be done and the scrivener would deliver the warrant to the clerk to be signed by the justice within a matter of hours, if not sooner.  What has happened is that the volume of work has increased and the scrivener side has decreased to the extent that now the rules decide that it would take six months for a clerk of the court to prepare a warrant for the district justice, to fill in the blanks in the standard form.  The fact that the clerk of the court would need six months to do that is a reflection of two things. The first is that the administrative side has become antiquated because they were not provided with the facilities to keep up with the present workload. Surely in this day and age, when we are talking about the computerisation of the administrative work of the courts, it should take no more than pressing a key on a computer system to have the warrant issued there and then to be signed at the expiration of the court's business at the end of the day.  In 1851 this could have been met, but we have moved into a period of chaos, out of which we should be able to move with the aid of computers.  I believe it is utterly ridiculous to afford six months to the courts to issue a warrant arising from a specific date, be it the expiration of the time upon which the fine should have been paid or that the condition required has not been met.  For what reason should we need a period of six months other than that the Minister recognises that the administrative side is in chaos.  I accept that there is a huge volume of work, but surely we should not be accommodating chaos but introducing a system of computerisation and efficient administration that will not require such long periods to meet with the simple issuing and signing of warrants.</P>
    <P>I want to query the Minister on section 1 (1) (a) (ii) and 1 (1) (b).  Does the <Col N="745" /> Minister consider that this amounts to a provision of retrospection with regard to penalties under the criminal code and has he consulted with the Attorney General's Office as to the constitutionality of these provisions?  It seems to me that at the time an order of a penal nature is made in the court nothing can be done subsequently to interfere with the making of that order, the effect of that order and the capacity of that order to be implemented. The conditions that existed at the time the order was made are the conditions to be visited upon the offender for all time. The Minister is addressing the period 1 July to date in section 1 (1) (b) and is perhaps retroactively tidying up what was previously untidy but to the benefit of those who would be visited with a penal sanction.  Is the Minister convinced that we are constitutionally sound in respect of that retroactive provision?</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was motivated to bring forward this legislation on the basis that a doubt had been uncovered.  This position had existed since 1924 without any question being raised or challenge being made.  The Minister should have graciously indicated, at least in general terms, where the spark of genius was found which uncovered the doubt.  Was it within the Department or was it by some attentive District Court clerk?  Was it in the Attorney General's Office or elsewhere?  Whoever it was deserves a certain pat on the back for uncovering what the entire legal profession have failed to uncover over decades.  I can see some people close to us in the House who could have had a part in that but I am not entitled to say more.</P>
    <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party, I recognise the administrative difficulties which have propelled the Minister to introduce this legislation.  However, we have a fundamental opposition to the notion of incarcerating people who for reasons of poverty or disinclination fail to pay a fine.  For that reason we will be opposing the Bill on Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical Bill designed to regularise matters and we will not be opposing it.  It is important <Col N="746" /> that we should devise some methods other than warrants for arrest and imprisonment in some instances.  A district justice is faced with difficulty on almost every occasion where a case comes before him involving a person charged with driving an untaxed vehicle, failing to display a tax disc, failing to wear a seat belt or wrongfully parking a car.  If a person fails to pay a parking fine a district justice will normally impose of fine of £25 or seven days' imprisonment.  Failure to wear a seat belt can incur a fine of £20 or seven days' imprisonment.  There must be a far greater latitude and discretion allowed to a district justice in these instances.  It is important that there should be a commonsense approach.  It is not right or proper that our prison system should be used to incarcerate people who fail to pay these fines.  Some kind of community work should have to be undertaken for the persons found guilty of such offences. That approach would be far better for the person and more productive for the community.</P>
      <P>The Minister will reply that it would be very expensive to set up such a system and to supervise the work carried out.  It should be remembered, however, that the cost of keeping a person in prison for a week is in the region of £600 or £700. The logic of committing a person to prison for a relatively minor misdemeanour should be seriously examined and we should consider community work as an alternative to imprisonment in a case where a person defaults on the payment of a fine.  I have seen a district justice impose a sentence of one day in prison for a relatively minor offence.  Our prison system was designed to cater for people guilty of serious crimes against society as distinct from minor offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in touch with the Minister's Department on numerous occasions regarding petitions.  Let us suppose I write to the Minister about the case of a person who has been fined £200 for driving an untaxed vehicle or for some other similar offence.  How will a warrant be affected by a petition?  When a court imposes a sentence and a Deputy writes to the Minister, the Garda do not proceed <Col N="747" /> with enforcement of the warrant while the Minister is investigating the representations.  This procedure has not been abused over the years.  The Minister and his predecessors have taken time to deal with these matters.  When we were in Government I remember going into the Minister's office one night and seeing him working through files to decide where mitigation should be allowed.  The hands of a district justice are tied but the Minister might be able to mitigate the fine because of family circumstances or some other aspect of the case which did not come across clearly in court.  Perhaps the Minister will let us know his views with this regard.</P>
    <P>Some attention must be directed towards the overall policy of committing people to prison for the types of minor offences I have mentioned.  The Minister may have read an article which appeared in the <i>Evening Herald</i> on 19 June last which reported the general secretary of the Prison Officers Association, Denis McGrath, as referring to revolving door jails.  When one reads an article of that nature it is necessary to weigh up exactly what it means.  I have not sufficient information to comment on it tonight.  The article states that more than 300 burglars, joyriders and handbag snatchers sent to jail by courts are signing on weekly in prison and then going home. They are back on the streets because the jails cannot accommodate them at a time when city suburb crime levels are soaring. Mr. McGrath said he was speaking out because the position in regard to early releases was getting worse.  I am sure the Minister will share my concern if that is so.  I hope it is not, but I would like the Minister to let us know the situation.  On occasions every Minister has allowed a type of parole for people to see how they get on.  Much of that is justified.  It gives people the option of going back out into society and to re-establish themselves.  A certain level of that is good, but I would be concerned if people who have committed serious crimes are not compelled to serve their full sentence.  We hear of <Col N="748" /> gardaí saying they brought a person to prison for some offence and the following day in the town or village they met that person back out again.  Much of that can be incorrect information but I would like the Minister to ease my mind on it.  That article in the <i>Evening Herald</i> written by Mr. Mallon and Miss O'Kelly highlights a matter of importance and needs to be clarified.  I hope the Minister will comment on early releases for people who have committed serious crimes.</P>
    <P>There is an epidemic of crime at present.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to a situation that is of concern to me.  I am worried about the present level of committal to prison by our courts of people who have committed offences of a civil nature.  A simple example is failure to pay debts.  Nightly on TV and daily on radio and in our newspapers we learn of hire purchase companies, banks, building societies and other types of financial institutions advertising attractive rates to induce people to invest their moneys with them on the one hand, and they offer very competitive terms for borrowing on the other hand.  Most of these institutions are taking a calculated risk. On the one hand a person will give them security for repayment of a debt to them. We have heard of repossessions of houses by building societies and banks and repossession of farms by building societies, banks, the ACC and so on.  After such repossession as a result of a court order the people concerned are later followed and are put in jail.  There are people in jail who have committed serious crimes.  We must be careful that our system as it is at the moment is not utilised&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy, but it is clear to me and must be clear to himself that he is straying considerably from the subject matter of the Bill before us.  The Bill before us is a very brief Bill, very succinct, and it deals solely with the question of the time allowed for the issue of District Court warrants, committal to prison for non-payment of fines or non-compliance with any condition, and no more. <Col N="749" /> The Deputy is straying into a variety of areas that are quite irrelevant to the subject matter before the House.  I would ask the Deputy to come back to the Bill before us.  It is a very short, succinct measure and does not give rise to dealing with the variety of matters to which the Deputy has adverted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, may I clarify the situation?  We are having an amendment to an Act which authorises a district justice to issue a warrant for offences under the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act.  People are committed to prison and sometimes have been released early because there is overcrowding in our prisons.  Warrants are issued in respect of people who fail to pay fines imposed for both criminal and civil offences.  We must ensure that people committed to prison are committed for serious offences.  I am concerned that people may be committed to prison for civil matters and non-payment of debts. I assure you, Sir, that I do not intend&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>A brief reference to such matters is quite in order, Deputy, but to go into them in anything like detail would be quite improper at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to go into them in any further detail.  I make the point &mdash; and the Minister is probably aware of this &mdash; that this is occurring. Banks and financial institutions are causing people to be committed to prison for this type of offence.  Perhaps some type of community work would be imposed instead.  The taxpayer is paying for the running of the prisons that are being used in that way.  We should see how that can be avoided so that the prisons, which are there for criminal offenders, are not overcrowded with such people who have committed no crime.  I will labour the point no further but it needed some ventilation here.  I have been concerned over some people who have been committed to prison at different times for offences which were not strictly criminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall the Bill is worthy of support in <Col N="750" /> the House.  We are trying to rectify a situation where there can be problems. On previous occasions action was not taken in time on matters relating to the administration of our courts, so it is important to be seen to act in time.  That is what we are doing in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies who have contributed to this Second Stage. Let me say at the outset that the question was raised by a number of Deputies as to who raised doubts about the legality of the warrants of committal issued by the District Court.  The issue has been raised from time to time by some people affected and by the Garda.  While I do not concede that any arguments that can be made as to the legality of warrants of commital that are issued by the District Court are well founded, I decided on the legal advice available to me to obtain the Government's approval for statutory provisions that will put the matter beyond doubt and will introduce new arrangements for issuing warrants of committal that would be apporpriate to modern circumstances.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cotter, Deputy McCartan and Deputy Enright quite legitimately asked if we should be looking at penalties other than just committal to prison.  The Committee on Court Practice and procedure submitted a report in 1990 which recommends a system of attachment of earnings and of deductions from State grants in cases where convicted persons are able but unwilling to pay fines imposed by the District Court.  I am having a look at that in my Department at the moment.</P>
      <P>I see merit in what the Deputies have suggested in relation to community service orders and the extension of the community service orders to this area. Normally it is really under the Road Traffic Acts that a large number of these fines arise, as we are all aware, and that comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will have a look at this area.  I have spent considerable time and effort on this matter and have secured from the Government additional financial support <Col N="751" /> for an extension of the probation and welfare service even in the difficult financial circumstances in which we live. I am a great believer, so far as is possible, in keeping people out of the prison system, having them work within the community or trying to bring them back as full contributing members to the community.  I am not saying this will happen immediately but I give a commitment to the House to have a look at this whole area.</P>
    <P>The question of detection was raised by Deputy Cotter.  I can assure him that the Garda are doing everything they possibly can.  He mentioned also bail in relation to available prison spaces.  Bail is available because of two Supreme Court decisions and it has nothing to do with space in prison.  I thank Deputy Cotter for his comments in relation to the efforts I am putting in and the priority which is being given to the tightening up of the law.</P>
    <P>Deputies Cotter, McCartan and Enright raised the question of the number of people who are in prison for non-payment of fines.  At any one time about 1 per cent of prison places on an annual basis is taken up with people for non-payment of fines.  As Deputies will be aware they serve very short sentences. The matter of petitions was raised but there is no change in that area.  Regarding inability to pay we do not have the power at present to attach community service orders.  Not everybody is unable to pay. There are some unfortunately who refuse to pay and the law has to be enforced. We debate and pass Bills in this House every day which have provision for fines or imprisonment.  The intention is that the laws will be enforced, whether pollution, traffic or any other laws.  At the end of the day the final enforcement of the law is the threat of prison.  There must be some stick as well as the fine.  At present about 55 per cent of people who are fined do not pay.  There are about 55 per cent of people who do not pay within the specified period.  I should like to inform Deputy McCartan that there is no retrospection element because the court <Col N="752" /> orders already would have been made. He referred to his experience with my own Department when he was a practising solicitor.  I have served in many Departments of State.  I had the honour of being Minister and Minister of State in various Departments of Government and I can say without fear of contradiction that I have not come across finer officers in the public service than in the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>I welcome the decisions we took in the earlier legislation today to accord judges of the District Court their proper title, that of judge.  I do not have to repeat what I said earlier today.  I am curious as to why the Minister is using the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; at this stage. The point I made on 12 June and again this morning is that the Irish text of the 1961 Act uses the word &ldquo;breitheamh&rdquo; which translated directly should read &ldquo;judge&rdquo;.  I do not know where the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; originated.  What is the necessity of repeating it in the legislation?  I accept that we have gone on to the next step.

Many mistakes have been made in the past and we are trying to correct them here.

      <P>I accept the amendment and I am aware of the reason for it.  I want to make a brief comment on the Minister's attitude to this whole business. It is good that he has such an open mind. Now that he has been relieved of another portfolio, and has much more time at his disposal, I look forward to new initiatives particularly in the areas about which we are talking this evening.  I thought it was foolish of The Workers' Party to oppose the Bill on the basis that there should never be a prison sentence for non-payment of a fine.  On the basis that there should never be a prison sentence for non-payment of a fine the word &ldquo;never&rdquo; would hardly be appropriate in that case, as a cursory glance at certain matters would indicate.  I am happy with the Bill as it stands and I am equally happy with the Minister's attitude, which I hope will be translated into further enactments in the autumn, or as soon as possible, to try to keep out of court many people who should never have been there in the first place.  I welcome the Minister's attitude in that regard.</P>

      <P>The Minister made the point earlier that terms of imprisonment are imposed as an alternative to fines. The Minister has shown an open mind in <Col N="755" /> regard to many of those matters and he said he would investigate the situation in regard to community type work.  I hope the Chair will allow me some discretion in making another point.  A parking fine is collected on the spot, or the person can pay it within seven days.  During the recess perhaps the Minister will consider imposing on the spot fines for a person not wearing a seat belt, failing to display a tax disc or driving on bald tyres.  It would be better than having our courts clogged up with these matters.  It is waste of Garda time in serving summonses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Bryne Mr. Bryne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bryne:</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is so late, my remarks will be brief.  It is time that real leadership, particularly from Government Departments, was given to encourage the greater use of recycled paper.  The token contribution by the Department of the Environment is insufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago our timber was exported from the south to continental mills and sold at £1 per tonne.  The export of our timber, coupled with a huge potential supply of our own waste paper, indicates that it would make environmental and economic sense to encourage more use of recycled paper.  Indeed, I would go further than arguing in favour of encouraging more use of recycled paper; the Government should help to establish, possibly in a joint venture with local authorities like Dublin Corporation, Dublin <Col N="756" /> County Council and private interests, to establish the plants to process more and more of our waste paper.</P>
    <P>There is no reason for supermarkets and shops in general not using brown paper bags from recycled paper, thereby helping to get rid of the plastic bags which cause so many environmental problems in rivers, lakes, streams and mountains. The plastic bag does not rot and damages the environment.  Telephone bills issued by Telecom Éireann and gas bills should be printed on recycled paper.  Indeed, it could be extended to rates demands and income tax forms.  Ballot papers, public notices, circulars and newspapers &mdash; particularly the &ldquo;freebies&rdquo;&mdash; should be printed on recycled paper.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that it takes approximately 17 trees to make one tonne of paper.  Of the one million tonnes of domestic and commercial waste disposed of each year by local authorities, nearly one quarter is paper.  If paper was recycled it would obviously save on collection and disposal costs because of its bulk and would also reduce the requirement for extensive landfill sites, which are costly and becoming scarce.  Recycling paper also saves energy; and I understand that there is assistance from the European Community for the management of waste, which should be availed of.  Given the size of the annual production of <i>Golden Pages</i> alone, which have to be disposed of each year because they are out of date, their bulk capacity in relation to recycling has tremendous potential.  It is estimated that Britain could save £400 million per year in imports if there was an increase in the use of recycled paper. They use about eight million tonnes of paper and board each year, which is the equivalent of felling one tree per person per annum.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure that a start is made in Government offices, including Dáil Éireann, to have the hundreds of tonnes of paper ending up in our litter bins collected specifically for recycling purpose.  It is a sad fact that I had to make my few notes on paper which should have been recycled but which was not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Byrne for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  One of the fundamental principles of environment policy is, in the words of the Environment Title of the EC Treaties, &ldquo;to ensure a prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources&rdquo;.  I am very pleased to have this opportunity of speaking about the advantages of recycling.  Deputy Byrne referred in particular to the advantages of using recycled paper but before addressing the paper issue specifically, I would like to speak about recycling more generally.</P>
      <P>Changes in our economic and social structure, improved living standards, increased production, the use of non-durable goods, more and bulkier packaging and the advent of disposable products have led to a massive increase in the quantities and types of waste generated in recent years.  Large volumes of this waste, particularly bottles, cans, plastics and paper have ended up as litter or on landfill sites.  Previously, these materials were the focus of attention mainly for their nuisance value.  Fortunately, we are now also seeing them for their resource potential.  Recycling of the main recyclable materials, cans, glass, plastics and paper, saves energy and raw materials, saves valuable space in landfill sites and creates employment opportunities.  In addition, recycling contributes to the promotion of a litter free environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paper recycling does make sense! I will give some facts.  It takes 17 trees to make one tonne of paper.  Of the 1.1 million tonnes of domestic and commercial waste disposed of in Ireland each year by local authorities, nearly 25 per cent or 270,000 tonnes is paper.  The recycling of paper would save on collection and disposal costs and reduce the requirements for expensive landfill sites.  Recycling paper saves energy.  These facts clearly illustrate the advantages to be gained by using recycled paper products.  Paper has a long history of recycling but until recent years was used mainly in the manufacture of packaging paper and board.  Advances in technology in the eighties enabled the <Col N="758" /> production of recycled paper which is almost indistinguishable from that manufactured from virgin pulp.</P>
    <P>Why then, one might ask, is the level of collection and subsequent recovery rate of paper and board here so relatively low in comparison with other European countries?  There are a number of factors contributing to this including the population distribution and the lack of demand from industry for waste paper.  Milling of waste paper currently requires large production volumes.  Ireland's small population means that in many cases sufficient quantities of similar types of waste paper to make a mill feasible are not generated.  This affects the logistics and the economics of waste paper collection.</P>
    <P>The absence of convenient milled supplies of waste paper in Ireland also makes it difficult for Irish manufacturers to maximise market opportunities in high value-added products based on recycled paper.  Despite these constraints several projects involved in waste paper collection have been assisted by my Department's recycling grants scheme. Unfortunately, some of these projects depend on the export market which because of over supply and resultant price cuts is having problems at present.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that improving the paper recycling rates in Ireland demands further processing capacity.  The IDA have already established a working party with Smurfit Ireland Ltd., the main paper recyclers, to examine business opportunities for the further recycling of waste paper and cardboard.  I am hopeful of a satisfactory outcome to this initiative.</P>
    <P>I would like to see Government Departments and public and private companies using recycled paper to the greatest extent possible particularly because of the high quality products which is now available.  My Department have now definitely switched to a policy of using recycled paper for all their needs.  Local authorities have been urged to consider all possibilities for promoting or assisting recycling and some, in fact, now use recycled paper.  My Department will continue to support and encourage this practice in tandem with their efforts to <Col N="759" /> support recycling generally.  I am happy to say that considerable progress has been made in this area in the last couple of years and I will use this opportunity to summarise briefly what has been happening.</P>
    <P>The Environment Action Programme launched early last year established a number of initiatives in this regard.  It lead to the preparation of recycling schemes by local authorities, provision of grants for recycling activities, feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing new industries based on recycled products and a study of how the tax system might be adapted to encourage waste recycling on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>I list those to show what central Government are doing to push the recycling drive, and our combined efforts are bearing fruit.  For example, glass recycling has increased from 8 per cent to 17 per cent since 1986 and can recycling has risen to 10 per cent in the same period from a position of virtually zero in 1986. While these results are encouraging we have a long way to go to reach the European average in the recycling league. There are extensive untapped resources in wastes which are thrown away.  It is up to all of us, policy makers, manufacturers and consumers alike, to play our part in ensuring that these resources are realised for out mutual benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this issue, and also the Minister of State for coming to the House to reply.  I have been informed by the Western Health Board that approximately 125 patients have been investigated at University College Hospital, Galway, and are on the waiting list for open heart surgery.  I understand that some of them are in a serious condition and have been on the waiting list for over two years for admission to the Mater Hospital, Dublin, where this type of surgery is carried out. This is a horrendous state of affairs which <Col N="760" /> any country with a health service that is claimed to be modern and efficient simply cannot stand over or condone.  One of the key planks of the Fianna Fáil Party when they went before the electorate seeking a mandate in 1987 was that &ldquo;health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped&rdquo;.  The billboards and the hoardings shouted it from on high.  Graphic illustrations were advanced in television advertisements.  Clear unequivocal commitments were given by the Minister and his colleagues that all health queues would be eliminated.</P>
      <P>I spoke to a doctor today who told me that he has 25 patients waiting for limb replacements.  The patients are in chronic pain and their slim hopes have now been dashed by virtue of the fact that all orthopaedic surgery of a replacement nature at Merlin Park Hospital, Galway, has been suspended until next October at least.  In my constitutency an elderly pensioner living on her own is waiting for a simple cataract operation.  She cannot read or watch television and has not been given any indication of when she will be called for this simple procedure to restore her sight.  Another person has been waiting for a heart by-pass operation for the past 18 months and has been told that in the meantime he should not get excited.  I have in my possession a letter in respect of a teacher in County Mayo who was seen by the senior cardiac consultant on 21 September 1990 at the Mater Hospital.  She was put on the waiting list for mitral valve replacement surgery at that hospital, but to date she has not been called and there is no indication as to when she will be called.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each case is personal and individual. The loss or restriction of sight as a result of non-availability of cataract operations and the sheer excruciating pain of trying to hobble on worn hip or knee joints is something which somebody who has not experienced it can only imagine.  What distinguishes people waiting for heart by-pass and open heart surgery is that these conditions are not alone life-threatening but people waiting for this procedure have died.  This is a matter of life and <Col N="761" /> death.  The longer somebody is left without an operation the more difficult the ultimate operation becomes.  Meanwhile the quality of life of each person on a waiting list is considerably impaired. They cannot work and they are subject to collapse.  One housewife whom I know cannot vacuum clean her floor or change the bed clothes, but the Minister, and the Department will not accept this.</P>
    <P>I spoke with a general practitioner today about the problem.  He has to be quite blunt with his patients.  He tells them that unless they are in the VHI and can afford to go to the Blackrock Clinic they must go out and raise £10,000 to £12,000 by way of loans or guarantees from relatives or friends.  Local dances, raffles and so on are being vigorously promoted by local communities in order to enable a young man in his thirties with a young family to undergo vital and immediate open heart surgery.  That young man is still paying off the loan raised by his family on his behalf and will probably do so for the rest of his life. Had he not had the operation with the consequent cost there is no doubt that he would be in his grave by now.  This was a matter of life or death.  There is also the human degradation of having to go, literally cap in hand, and beg the pounds from the public to rescue one.  It underlines in clear detail the cold reality of the two-tier health service that exists here.  It simply is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I know I will be accused of begrudgery, but the spending of £17 million pounds on the refurbishment of Government buildings and the Taoiseach's Department was immoral in the extreme in the context of the total disarray in our health services.  One can equate it as one will, one can justify it as one might, or one can defend it and make comparisons but, at the end of the day, it represents 2,000 vital heart operations at the Blackrock Clinic.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take on board the Fine Gael suggestion, to go to the lottery fund and for one year only take out of it the much needed finance to eliminate health queues once and for all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood):</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I point out that the matter before the House concentrates on the issue of the University College Hospital, Galway, the 125 patients investigated there and their requirement for open heart surgery. Deputy Higgins strayed over a wide range of issues.  The very fact that I do not respond to them specifically tonight does not mean that I accept the statements made by Deputy Higgins on a wide variety of items, but I am sure that Members will have an opportunity to address those items at another time.  I wish to concentrate specifically on the important matter raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I first remind the Deputy that the success of new surgical procedures such as bypass operations has resulted in an everincreasing demand worldwide for these procedures.  As a result waiting lists are expanding despite the increase in facilities available.  Even with the development of physical facilities, hospitals are finding it difficult to keep up with the increasing demand.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that cardiac surgery is performed in two national units, one at Cork Regional Hospital and one in the Mater Hospital, Dublin. Patients from the Western Health Board area are generally referred to the facilities at the Mater Hospital.</P>
      <P>The facts of the present situation regarding cardiac surgery have already been spelt out on a number of occasions previously.  Briefly, my Department had an agreement with the Mater Hospital going back to 1987 that an annual target figure of 750 bypass operations should be aimed at and the hospital received funding for these operations on that basis.</P>
      <P>In January 1990 cardiac surgeons at the Mater Hospital advised the hospital that they intended to retain their cardiac patients there for the full duration of the post-operative stay.  This change in practice had knock-on effects: it created a longer length of stay for cardiac patients than previously obtained and a consequent reduction in the number of patients being operated upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> Nevertheless, the Minister for Health instructed his officials to look urgently at ways and means of improving this situation with the Mater management with a view to restoring the activity of the cardiac surgery unit to previously agreed levels.  Special additional funding was approved for the provision of ten additional cardiac surgery beds.  I would like to emphasise that at no stage has there been any delay on the part of my Department in processing this project, which came into operation on 2 April 1991.  The total costs involved in the project are quite significant.  They are: £235,000 for renovation and upgrading works; £186,000 for equipment; £400,000 annual staffing costs, which is, of course, a cost which must be provided each year. My colleague, the Minister for Health, recently had the pleasure of opening the newly refurbished facility in the Mater Hospital.  I am delighted with the very high level of accommodation that is now available for patients in the National Cardiac Surgery Centre.</P>
    <P>The chief medical officer and the Department have been requested by the Minister to examine cardiac surgery lists in general and the Minister met cardiologists and cardiac surgeons and had detailed discussions with them.  The Mater Hospital and St. James's Hospital have recently been invited to submit a proposal regarding their hospitals' ability to meet an increase in the number of operations of that kind to be carried out in Dublin from 750 to 1,000 per annum. An option appraisal of their proposals will be undertaken by my Department immediately.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to emphasise to the Deputy that if a particular patient is concerned about his or her condition he or she should, as would be normal, contact the family doctor or his or her cardiologist directly, because they will be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of a case to a consultant at the cardiac surgery unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for taking the time to be with us here tonight.  I wish to deal with a very specific matter which, indeed, will not take five minutes as such but is of extreme importance.  It relates to the long waiting list for bone marrow transplant operations, which, as the Minister and the House will know, can save the lives of people with certain kinds of cancer.</P>
      <P>One six month old County Galway baby has been waiting for more than four months for this operation, which may not be carried out until late in the autumn or even later in the year.  The irony of the case is that there is a donor available, which, the Minister will agree, is a very important aspect, and there is no reason why the operation should not have taken place.  To complicate matters, the family concerned lost a four year old child with a similar complaint a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bone marrow transplant operations have virtually come to a halt in this country.  In 1990 a total of 19 such operations was completed, but to date this year's total is only three operations.  The unit handling these most delicate operations is based in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin.  It contains some of the most modern facilities in the world. However, due to Government financial cutbacks last year, most of the 25 specially trained nurses and other specialist staff were dispersed into other areas of the health services.  When the Department of Health decided to grant financial funding to the unit earlier this year the hospital authorities had to recruit and train another 25 staff.  The lack of planning and the lack of a short to medium-term strategy, which prevents the continuity of the service, is nothing short of deplorable.  The result of this mismanagement by the Department of Health is causing great anxiety and stress to parents of many children who require such operations.  It is particularly galling for parents to know that the technology and medical expertise is available in Ireland but that because of Government <Col N="765" /> mismanagement and lack of recognition of the problem the unit has been virtually closed from 1991.</P>
    <P>It is understood that a bone marrow transplant operation in Ireland costs between £20,000 and £25,000, whilst a similar operation could cost £50,000 in the United Kingdom and a staggering $100,000 in the United States.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health must take the blame for the problem.  I cannot imagine how an even half thought out plan could go so wrong, that a unit carrying out such important work could literally be closed. I know that it will be said that the unit is still open, but I put it very clearly on the record of the House that because of the initial cutbacks a very difficult problem has arisen.  It is important for me to point that out.  It is very important to have specialised, well-trained staff for such very sophisticated operations.  Bone marrow transplant operations are extremely important and we are very lucky in this country to have people with training and expertise that matches the best in the world.</P>
    <P>I speak now on behalf of the parents of a child from County Galway, but I am fully aware that there are many other people around the country with the same anxiety.  What I say tonight is that our priorities must be standing on their ear.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Higgins mentioned funding from the national lottery. I would go further.  One can argue the toss one way or another about the Taoiseach's office and other projects. However, when a child in County Galway whom I personally know and whose parents whom I know very well are under great stress and pressure because time is of the essence, is in such great need, it is difficult for politicians like me to say we have our priorities right if golf clubs and other such amenities can attract lottery funds while a unit of that nature is virtually closed down because the funds are not available.  In the name of the Almighty, where are our priorities?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health talks about planning strategies for the future and delivering good service and so on.  Surely at this late stage &mdash; and it is very late <Col N="766" /> because a full year has been lost &mdash; something can be done for this very important hospital unit so that my constituent and many others will get the sort of treatment that will save their lives or at least prolong them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Deputy for giving me this opportunity to clarify the position regarding bone marrow transplant operations for children at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.  The hospital provides an excellent national service in paediatric oncology generally which has been developed on an ongoing basis over the past number of years.  The achievements of this unit have been very successful and compare favourably with international standards in the field of paediatric oncology.  One very successful form of treatment for certain types of cancers is bone marrow transplantation and a successful programme for transplantation is presently in place at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin.</P>
      <P>I understand from the hospital that two bone marrow transplants have been carried out this year to date, which is a slight decrease on the number of transplants carried out over the same period last year.  The reason the number is down is a lack of nursing staff with specialised nursing expertise who are required to nurse these patients.</P>
      <P>In response to this specific difficulty my Department have approved an additional six staff nurses.  These nurses have now taken up appointment at the hospital together with a clinical teacher who is assigned to the oncology unit for the training of staff in all aspects of oncology and bone marrow transplantation.  The Deputy will appreciate that oncology is a particularly stressful discipline for staff and a high level of training and expertise is necessary for staff in order to prevent burnout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospital provides a first-class multi-disciplinary team approach to oncology patients and their families.  This team includes the consultant, nursing staff, social worker, clincial psychologist, psychiatrist and dental surgeon.  The team is very sympathetic towards the <Col N="767" /> medical, social and emotional needs of the patient and family and in this regard provides a 24-hour service where the parents of patients may receive advice on any matters which are of concern to the family.</P>
    <P>I am glad to inform the Deputy that a modern, purpose-built unit at Crumlin Hospital is due to open in the very near future.  The building of this unit is now completed and is presently being equipped.  This 15-bed new unit will replace existing accommodation.  The unit includes purpose-designed facilities for parents of children.  A great deal of diligent and sustained effort has been applied in order to raise funds for this very worthwhile project and my Department are making a significant contribution of £300,000 towards the overall cost.</P>
    <P>The difficulties referred to by the Deputy have not arisen in this area because of cutbacks in the Department of Health, nor has the unit been closed for 1991.  The allocation of the additional staff, resources and capital expenditure for this hospital will allow them to continue to expand the excellent services to which the Deputy has referred.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, the proposed group water scheme for Asdee has been designed on the basis that the area can be served by the Listowel regional water supply scheme.  Kerry County Council have submitted plans for the extension of the Listowel scheme to supply the Asdee area and to provide the necessary trunk mains and the reservoirs to facilitate the development of the group scheme.  The contract documents for this scheme are being examined in my Department.  The allocation of grants for the Asdee scheme will be considered further when a decision is made on the extension to the Listowel scheme.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to impress on local authorities the immediate need to introduce a uniform <Col N="770" /> disc parking system.  At the moment tourists are being totally confused by the different systems in operation in towns. A great deal of confusion could be eliminated by the introduction of a uniform disc which could be used in any town.</P>
      <P>Parking problems are more of an irritant than a major cause for complaint among the one million plus visitors who travel to this country and use cars.  Some 350,000 visitors travel in their own cars, while 200,000 more people drive hired cars.  Taking an average of two people per car, that is a sizeable proportion of the 2.8 million visitors who come here annually.  The motoring holiday is still a major attraction to visitors and we should do all we can to expand potential in this area.  The same parking disc cannot be used in any two towns throughout the country.  This is annoying and it is a bone of contention with the Irish motorist and the tourist.  The Minister should compel the local authorities to introduce a standard parking disc.</P>

The Garda Commissioner has been asked by my Department to consider the legal provisions necessary to allow for this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Each week 12 Mayo patients must make round trips of up to 250 miles in some cases to a hospital in Galway for essential life preserving kidney dialysis treatment.  In some cases trips have to be made more than once per week.  The patients are ferried in taxis contracted by the Western Health Board. Over the last number of years there has <Col N="771" /> been a keen appreciation in Mayo of the need for a kidney dialysis unit.  Numerous fund raising exercises were undertaken. One of the most publicised was a sponsored national cycle by the Garda Síochána Cycling Club.  Various Mayo associations in other parts of the country and indeed in Manchester and in other cities overseas have given cheques amounting to several thousands of pounds.  The total funds now lodged in the bank at Castlebar are in excess of £130,000, a considerable sum by any standards and a massive indication of public awareness and demand for such a service. The fund raisers are more than willing to commit the total amount towards the equipping of the General Hospital in Castlebar with a dialysis unit.  I understand that the accommodation has been suitably identified and made available by the hospital authorities.  There is a keen anxiety on the part of the consultant staff to provide the service.  I understand that the trained personnel are ready, willing and available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there is a cost factor involved.  I appreciate that the Western Health Board are terribly overstretched and cannot manage within their existing resources.  I would ask the Minister not to advance again in this House the argument trotted out time and time again that the Western Health Board have been assigned a budget and that they should decide on priorities.  The Western Health Board do not have sufficient resources to cope <Col N="772" /> adequately with the current essential needs.  Castlebar is a new modern general hospital, phase one of which has only been recently brought into commission. The demand for dialysis will not go away. Indeed, the likelihood is that the demand for the service will grow and intensify.  I appeal strongly to the Minister to make an additional budget allocation available to the Western Health Board on an annual basis to provide for the equipment, the servicing of it and the running costs of the dialysis service.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to clarify the position concerning a dialysis unit at Castlebar General Hospital.  The provision of dialysis treatment in the Castlebar area is a matter for the Western Health Board in the first instance.  Patients from the Castlebar area currently receive dialysis treatment at Merlin Park Regional Hospital, Galway.  I would be glad to see the dialysis unit established and providing a service to patients in the Castlebar area, provided the running costs of the unit can be met from the Western Health Board's allocation.  Consideration is being given to this proposal by my Department in the context of resources which are available for the health services generally and having regard to the board's priority for new service developments in their area.</P>

      <P>The key to a successful tax <Col N="592" /> collection system is to secure timely payment of current taxes.  Timely payment not only maximises the cashflow benefit to the Exchequer but also reduces the risk of default when accumulated arrears may ultimately exceed the taxpayer's capacity to pay.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that since the 1988 tax amnesty they have consistently maintained a firm pursuit policy in order to secure timely payment of current taxes. Timely payment normally means payment every month for PAYE/PRSI, payment every second month for VAT or payment once or twice per year for other taxes as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Enforcement through the sheriffs, court proceedings or attachment is initiated only after a taxpayer has failed to respond to the normal requests for payment and arises at a stage when the vast majority of taxpayers have already complied.</P>
      <P>The commissioners are conscious of the need to ensure that the non-compliant minority of taxpayers do not secure an unfair commercial advantage over those who pay their taxes on time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, the operation of such facilities currently requires customs checks at border posts and other entry points in order to prevent abuse of the various permitted entitlements.  As fiscal border checks at internal Community frontiers will be prohibited on completion <Col N="594" /> of the Internal Market, it is clear that the continuation of duty free facilities as currently operated will not be possible.

      <P>Verolme Cork Dockyard went into receivership in December 1984 and was in effect on the market from that time.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds):</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact the figures to which he refers are some considerable number of years out of date.  Because Schedule D cases were, at that time to which the figures relate, taxed on the basis of previous year's income, the figures appertain to income arising in the year to 5 April 1987.</P>
      <P>There are other important qualifications. They relate, it should be noted, to &ldquo;Total Income&rdquo;, this is gross income after deduction of such items as capital allowances, interest paid in full and retirement annuities.  It would be invalid to regard the figures as representing the amount declared to the Revenue Commissioners. The particular figure quoted appertains to cases where the main source of income was a trade or profession. This definition encompasses, as well as professional persons and business proprietors, such persons as small shopkeepers, farmers and others working on their own account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making any comparison with other categories of taxpayers, it is important to take account of the historical nature of these figures.  As a proportion of the total number of taxpayers whose main source <Col N="596" /> of income derived from a trade, profession, rent or other investment, the number with gross incomes over £25,000 in the 1987-88 tax year came to 6 per cent. For the same tax year, the equivalent proportion of PAYE taxpayers was 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Because of their concern to ensure that all sectors of the community pay their fair share of tax, the incoming Government in 1987 decided on the radical changes to the administration of the taxation code which have since been implemented. Among the changes which were made were the following: the 1988 amnesty was introduced; self-assessment was applied to, among others, the self-employed; the enforcement powers of the Revenue Commissioners were greatly strengthened, e.g. by giving them powers of attachment; withholding tax on professional fees was introduced and tax clearance certificate requirements have been introduced for public contracts and grants.</P>
    <P>Some of these changes, and in particular self-assessment, are still in the process of being developed and I can assure the Deputy that if experience shows that they do not result in a fair distribution of the burden of taxation, the Government will take whatever further steps may be necessary to achieve that end.</P>

      <P>Presumably the Deputy is referring to the European Commission's proposal for the introduction of an EC-wide minimum withholding tax of 15 per cent on interest income.  This was not a proposal for harmonisation of the taxation of savings: member states, for example, would have been free to impose a higher rate on their own residents.  The proposal was strongly opposed by a number of member states and, although it has not formally been withdrawn by the Commission, it is not expected to find agreement.</P>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy's interest arises from the possible implications for deposit interest retention tax of Ireland's obligation to abolish exchange controls by end-1992 at the latest.  This matter is under active consideration at present.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the interdepartmental study which I announced in my budget of 31 January 1990.  The working group examined, primarily, the relationship between PRSI and income tax and their combined impact on the lower paid.  They also considered the impact of possible PRSI and income tax changes on employment.</P>
      <P>The group reported at end-October 1990.  Their report was part of the background to consideration by the Government of options for the 1991 budget.  I have no plans to publish the report.</P>
      <P>The group's conclusions were based, <i>inter alia</i>, on available economic research and on an examination of a variety of mainly revenue neutral changes.  As regards employment, the group's main findings essentially were that possible changes in employee PRSI and in income tax affecting the lower paid would have little or no impact on employment and that the effect on employment of possible changes in employers' PRSI would be uncertain and probably small.  It is important to bear in mind that PRSI rates in Ireland, for both employers and employees, are low by European Community standards.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline in respect of soft drinks and non-alcoholic beers (1) the taxation and excise rates applicable for each in each of the years 1986-91, (2) the yield to the Exchequer for each of the years 1986-90 and the anticipated yield for 1991, (3) whether he has received representations since June 1990 to have the Exchequer levies reduced on the basis that the rates are such as to create a price incentive particularly to young people to consume alcoholic beverages; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The factual information requested by the Deputy is contained in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>In so far as VAT is concerned, it is not possible to furnish actual receipts as VAT returns are not completed in a manner which would enable the yield from particular items to be separately identified. The figures quoted are estimates of such receipts, derived from non-VAT statistical information.</P>
      <P>Apart from the normal pre-budget submission from industry interests, the only representations of the specific type mentioned by the Deputy which I have received were from himself in the form of a Parliamentary Question on 30 April 1991, columns 1415-6 of the Official Report refer.  There is little I can add to the reply I gave on that occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>Future inflation will be determined by developments in import prices, international interest rates, domestic costs and taxation as it affects price-levels. Historic inflation figures play no role in its determination &mdash; apart from warning us against the necessity to be competitive with our trading partners.  In this year's budget I forecast Irish inflation quite close to 3 per cent in 1991.  Trends to date are consistent with an outcome of this order.</P>
      <P>The rate of consumer price increases fell from 20.4 per cent in 1981 to 3.9 per cent in 1986; and fell further, to 3.4 per cent, in 1990.  Key factors underlying the high rate of inflation in 1981 were increases in import prices of almost 19 per cent and of almost 17 per cent in hourly earnings in manufacturing, and significant upward pressure on prices from taxation changes.  By contrast, in 1986 import prices actually fell &mdash; by over 11 per cent, as oil costs fell substantially and the value of the US dollar declined against the Irish pound; comparable wage increases were down to 7.1 per cent and taxation changes added 0.5 per cent to average inflation.  In 1990, the comparable wage increase had fallen to 4.7 per cent and taxation changes ameliorated inflation by 0.5 per cent; but there was a lesser fall in import prices, of 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lesson to be learned is that we can, ourselves, be significant contributors to high domestic inflation &mdash; through actions which demand increased taxation or by seeking income increases to compensate for imported inflation without corresponding national productivity increases.  The responsible increases in incomes agreed under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are <Col N="603" /> combining with reductions in rates of taxation to moderate the domestic contribution to our inflation; at the same time the firm maintenance of our exchange rate within the EMS is ensuring that the external contribution, through import prices and interest rates, is minimised. The associated approach of fiscal discipline is, of course, a key factor underpinning that moderation of taxation and maintenance of exchange parity.</P>
    <P>The policies adopted in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and confirmed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provide the basis for keeping Ireland among the low-inflation EC member states &mdash; as it currently is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds):</NameTxt>
      <P>Significant steps have been taken in the past four years to improve tax compliance and combat evasion.  The introduction of the self assessment system and the measures associated with it have made a major contribution in this regard.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are satisfied that programmes are in place to ensure the effectiveness of the self assessment system and that adequate staff resources are available for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programmes include the pursuit of taxpayers who failed to lodge returns.  A measure of success of the programme is that 95 per cent of self assessment taxpayers lodged returns for 1988-89 compared with approximately 60 per cent in the pre self assessment era.  They include also the examination of returns <Col N="604" /> to identify cases meriting audit &mdash; in the year ended 31 December 1990 a total of 101,000 returns were examined, some 3,100 merited selection for detailed examination and of these 1,100 were selected for audit.  They include an audit programme which is in operation nationwide and staff are progressively being released to audit work as other programmes progress. I should explain that under the provisions of self assessment inspectors of taxes have a period of six years in which to audit a return and any understatement of liability will be subject to interest and penalties.  Cases chosen for audit in future years will, of course, if there seems to be a need to do so, be scrutinised for earlier years.</P>
    <P>There are currently 45 inspectors engaged on self assessment audits.  The programme is now being expanded progressively. The number of inspectors on audit work is being increased to approximately 100 during the year ended 31 December 1991, to cover the auditing of both income tax and corporation tax returns.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the auditing of income tax and corporation tax returns is only one dimension of Revenue's total audit capacity.  There are also separate audit programmes covering the PAYE, value added tax and the construction industry. In the 12 months to 31 December 1990 audit visits have been carried out in some 25,000 cases in these areas.  When taken together with the self assessment audits, this works out at about 9 per cent of taxpayers.  This figure is very high by international standards.  It has to be borne in mind too that the vast bulk of taxpayers comply with their obligations.</P>
    <P>The details supplied with the question suggest a significant loss to the Exchequer based on a yield of £9,800 per audit.  In the year to 31 December 1990, 694 audits were completed with a yield of £6.8 million i.e. an average yield of £9,800 per audit.  However, as the cases concerned had been selected for audit because of certain unsatisfactory features in the returns and accounts, and not on a random basis, the yield cannot be taken <Col N="605" /> as an indication of the general level of compliance in the community at large.</P>
    <P>In addition to ensuring that those on the tax record comply with their obligations the Revenue Commissioners operate a specific programme in Dublin and the surrounding counties to identify those persons with a taxable income who have failed to register for tax purposes. During the year ended 31 December 1990, 6,787 visits were made for this purpose. These resulted in the detection of 746 persons not previously on record and a further 603 persons who had either understated their income from disclosed sources or who had omitted to disclose specific sources of income.  This programme also operates in some country districts.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should say that the Revenue Commissioners have recently announced a major new initiative to tackle tax defaulters.  I have provided an additional £1 million in the budget to meet the cost of the extra staff required for this purpose. An additional £30 million is expected to be collected from tax defaulters this year as a result of the various measures under the initiative. This new initiative is in addition to the advanced audit programme and to the whole range of other collection and enforcement mechanisms now in place.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the Government are committed to building on what has been achieved in improving compliance, ensuring prompt payment of liabilities, reducing arrears, developing audit programmes and tackling the black economy.</P>

      <P>Accordingly, this did not form part of the canal undertaking which was transferred from CIE to the Commissioners of Public Works under the Canals Act, 1986, and the commissioners have no responsibility in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds):</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of this latest review of the medium term prospects for the Irish economy.  It is a useful contribution to the process of planning for the sustainable betterment of our economy for the benefit of the whole of our community.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's main focus is on the review's &ldquo;central forecasts&rdquo; for the period to 1996.  This, of course, is based on stated assumptions, as is the case with all forecasts, but especially those which look several years ahead.  The ESRI assessment emerges at a time of considerable uncertainty about the possible timing, pace and sustainability of the expected recovery in certain major economies, and thus, in particular, about the shorter term external environment within which Ireland must develop.  In this context, their assessment of the implications of some alternative assumptions is also to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the &ldquo;Central Forecast&rdquo; itself, the key elements of the medium <Col N="607" /> term prospect 1992-96, as seen by the ESRI, in annual average terms, are: output (GDP) growth averaging some 3½ per cent; a continuing solid balance of payments surplus; inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, below 3 per cent, with the industrial sector maintaining its competitive edge; non-agri-cultural employment growth of some 15,000, partly offset by a further secular decline in agriculture leading to net annual growth of about 10,000; numbers in the labour force rising by about 12,500 annually &mdash; in part because of a continuing weak UK labour market &mdash; and thus a small annual increase in unemployment over the period.</P>
    <P>I agree with the authors' views that &ldquo;the behaviour of the world economy is the single most important influence on the potential for Irish growth&rdquo;, and that, over the medium term, &ldquo;the Irish economy should continue to perform somewhat better than the average for the EC&rdquo;. This latter assessment represents a strong endorsement of the current thrust of Government policies.</P>
    <P>It is, at the same time, a sobering document. While it projects a rate of growth in employment over the next five years which would be &ldquo;satisfactory for many countries&rdquo;, and &ldquo;greater than that attained in the past five years&rdquo;, it nevertheless highlights the key issue for the future: to create conditions which can support a still more rapid expansion of jobs.  While one could debate either way some of the assumptions made and thus its conclusions about potential growth and employment developments, a realistic basis for policy-formulation demands a set of assumptions which are as likely to be optimistic as pessimistic.</P>
    <P>Against the background of the last decade, I also am in firm agreement with the authors' view that &ldquo;past experience shows that fiscal expansions can not promote lasting growth in employment&rdquo;. Under such a course, as they describe it, &ldquo;the problem of the debt could return to dominate the national agenda&rdquo;.  That would damage investor confidence, <Col N="608" /> remove all the benefits of policy credibility, and put at risk the substantial growth in output and employment contained in their assessment.</P>
    <P>We should look on this assessment as part of the basis for planning the development of the Irish economy to achieve more.  It presents us with challenges.  It points to the vital importance of incomes moderation to employment expansion.  It directs attention to the need for improved efficiency of &ldquo;the supply side of the economy&rdquo;&mdash; an approach that is already in train, but one to which we can all contribute more, and thus lay the basis for greater competitiveness and still faster growth through this decade than the ESRI team foresee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds):</NameTxt>
      <P>Particulars of domestic and commercial rateable valuations at county and national level are contained in the following table.  The figures, which reflect the position as of November 1990, are derived from valuation office records of the combined rateable valuations of domestic and commercial buildings and information in respect of commercial valuations obtained from the rating authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 of the Valuation Act, 1988, introduced a system of continuous revision under which the owner or occupier of a property, the rating authority, or an officer of the Commissioner of Valuation may apply at any time to have the valuation of a property revised.  Applications are sent through the rating authority on a monthly basis to the Commissioner of Valuation, who issues <Col N="612" /> particulars of the revised valuations at quarterly intervals.</P>
    <P>In addition to the continuous revision process, the Valuation Acts also contain provisions for a general revaluation of all properties in a local authority area. Section 34 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, relates to county councils.  At the request of a county council, the Minister for the Environment may, if he thinks it fit to do so, direct the Commissioner of Valuation to carry out a revaluation of all properties in the county.  The revaluation of all properties in a county borough is governed by section 65 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, which provides for such revaluation to be done at the request of the relevant county borough council. There has been only limited use of these powers &mdash; the city of Dublin was revalued in the period 1908 to 1915; the city of Waterford during the years 1924 to 1926; some areas in Galway between 1946 and 1950; Buncrana urban in 1950.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner of Valuation is at present conducting a review of the valuation code in consultation with the Department of the Environment and my Department.  When I receive the results of this review I will consider the matter further.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that in each of the last four years the trend established by publication of the live register figures has demonstrated a steady reduction in unemployment as a percentage of the workforce for the first five months of each year, and that the trend in the first five months of this year has been exactly the reverse; if this matter will be investigated with a view of establishing the reasons for this difference; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Quest>if he will outline the figures for unemployment on the live register for the end of April 1990 and the end of April 1991; and if he will make a statement on the reasons for the increase.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>The total number of persons on the live register at end-April 1990 was 221,060. The comparable figure for end-April 1991 was 247,991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the years 1987-90 the live register total expressed as a percentage of the labour force rose in January but &mdash; with one exception &mdash; fell in each of the following four months.  In 1991 there were increases in each of the four months to <Col N="614" /> last April but this trend was reversed by the end-May figures.</P>
    <P>Because of the increased availability of seasonal employment, the live register normally falls in the February-to-May period.  This year the underlying increase exceeded seasonal outflows resulting in an increase in the live register over the period.</P>
    <P>The central reason for this upturn in the live register is the adverse developments internationally, especially in the UK, which have reduced outward migration and led to the return of previous emigrants.</P>
    <P>This is confirmed by the preliminary results of the 1991 census of population published recently by the Central Statistics Office.  Net emigration in the 12 months to last April is estimated at only 1,000, that is, 30,000 less than in the 12 months to April 1990.  The virtual cessation of net emigration has led to rapid expansion of the domestic labour force.</P>
    <P>While we must await compilation by the Central Statistics Office of figures for April last, the evidence of income tax and related receipts strongly supports the view that employment trends have not been a factor in the increase of the live register.</P>
    <P>In response to the Taoiseach's suggestion, the special task force on employment have initiated an assessment of the possibility of identifying the components contributing to changes in the live register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen press reports of <Col N="615" /> the comments referred to in the Deputy's question.  As I have stated on numerous occasions, the administrative budget initiative has the twin aims of (a) reducing the overall cost of administration in the Civil Service and (b) improving the quality of Civil Service management.  These aims will be achieved through the delegation of much greater authority to individual line managers for the more efficient use of the various administrative resources &mdash; staffing, overtime, travel and subsistence, computer expenditure, office premises expenses, postal and telecommunication expenses &mdash; at their disposal in order to deliver the services required by our citizens.</P>
      <P>I would not accept that the initiative should be automatically equated with fewer jobs in the Civil Service.  Clearly, however, each Department and each manager of every section in the Civil Service will have to examine her or his operation to see if it is operating as cost effectively as possible and, if not, to determine what changes are required.  It may well be that this process will lead to different employment patterns in particular Departments and sections but that is a matter for the Departments concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that a special VAT refund scheme is already in operation for medical equipment purchased through voluntary subscriptions.  Under the terms of the existing scheme, voluntary groups are granted partial refunds of VAT in <Col N="616" /> respect of individual items of equipment which must be certified as being necessary in the running of the health services and are of a tax-exclusive cost of £20,000 or more.</P>
    <P>I am having the scheme reviewed at the moment but the Deputy will appreciate that, in order to avoid a disproportionate administration cost, a realistic threshold is necessary.</P>
    <P>The refund scheme was established in recognition of the valuable work done by voluntary fund-raising groups, who raise significant amounts of money to finance purchases of specialised health equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds):</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of flooding in the Shannon Basin is of long standing and has been the subject of many reports and investigations over the years.  These reports all highlight the complexity of the problem in technical terms.</P>
      <P>Flooding occurs because the channel is incapable of adequately conveying the large volumes of water involved.  The problem can be rectified only by carrying out large-scale civil engineering works which would involve substantial deepening and widening of the channel at very considerable cost.  There are no plans at present to carry out such a scheme of works.</P>
      <P>The removal of silt from the river is undertaken as required by the Commissioners of Public Works but this has no significant effect on the flow regime of the river.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a Shannon Authority has been the subject of debate for some time.  There are so many interests involved in this vast natural waterway that the River Shannon Forum was set up in October 1988, to serve as a platform for discussion among these interests.  The forum discharges a useful function in promoting co-operation and understanding on an informal basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> As I have indicated, the solution to the problem of flooding in the Shannon Basin lies in the execution of a major drainage scheme.  The Commissioners of Public Works are the statutory authority for such schemes under the terms of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The funds that would be required to carry out a drainage scheme on the Shannon are simply not available.  The establishment of a Shannon Authority would not alter the financial position and I have no plans to set up such a body.</P>

      <P>The application for optical benefit from the person concerned was disallowed because, according to the records of my Department, the person did not satisfy the relevant contributions conditions. However, it now appears that the information supplied to my Department in respect of the 1990-91 contribution year is incorrect and as soon as this is established the person's claim for optical benefit will be approved.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the full rate of child dependant allowance is not being paid to a person (details supplied) in Kilkenny in view of the fact that all maintenance paid in respect of this child is being assessed as means against her mother.</Quest>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of unemployment assistance of £32.50 per week being the long-term rate for herself and half rate increase for one child dependant less means of £25 derived from maintenance payments by her separated husband.</P>
      <P>Where a couple are living apart and no adult dependant increase is payable, the legislation specifically provides for the payment of full child dependant increases where the other spouse makes no child support contribution.  Up to now, the legislation has been interpreted to mean that half child dependant increase only would be payable where the other spouse does make a contribution towards child support.</P>
      <P>It is considered that this interpretation is inequitable and, in the circumstances, it results in a claimant's income from unemployment assistance and child support being less than what they would receive in unemployment assistance were they not receiving any child support. Accordingly, I have arranged for the payment in future of full child dependant increases in these cases.  This will ensure that there is no financial penalty on claimants who are in receipt of contributions towards child support.</P>
      <P>The person concerned will, therefore, benefit by £5.50 per week from this improvement and her weekly payments will increase from £32.50 to £38.00. Arrears will issue shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon):</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available in the format set out in the question.  The Eastern Health Board provide a comprehensive range of services for the elderly including those with dementia.  The main focus of the service is community based in line with Government policy for the care of the elderly. The board's community services are wide ranging and were greatly enhanced recently by the making available of special allocations for services for the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The range of community services available include general practitoner and <Col N="624" /> public health nurse care, home help services, means-on-wheels and day care facilities.  Assessment and rehabilitation services are available in the acute hospitals and in day hospitals as appropriate. These services are augmented by respite and intermittent care on a planned basis in a variety of settings.  These services continue to be developed in line with the recommendations of the working party report on services for the elderly, The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy For The Elderly.</P>
    <P>When a patient, including a patient suffering from dementia, can no longer be managed in the community, in-patient services are provided by the Eastern Health Board following assessment.  This service is provided in the health board's own institutions and in private nursing homes either by subvention or by contracted beds.  There is a continuous demand for long stay placement of patients in the board's area.  Admissions are made on the basis of priority need, which is determined at all times by medical/social assessment.  The board's complement of long stay beds does not relate specifically to any particular community care area but is allocated in a flexible manner in accordance with the priority needs of the patients seeking admission.  Those under the age of 65 years who require long term care are placed in units for the young chronic sick or in subvented beds in private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>The breakdown of long stay beds in the Eastern Health Board area is as set out hereunder.  These figures include provision for those suffering from dementia: total number of long stay places for elderly patients, 1,547; total number of respite places, 170 approximately; welfare accommodation &mdash; places, 238; total number of patients currently in receipt of nursing home subventions, 1,700; total number of places for young chronic sick (including ten respite places), 69.</P>
