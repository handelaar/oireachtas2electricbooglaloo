      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>Any European state may apply to become a member of the Community. Austria, Malta and, as of yesterday, Sweden have applied for membership. However, as I have indicated to the House on previous occasions, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on such applications pending receipt of the Commission's opinions in the normal way as provided for under the treaties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach <Col N="162" /> when he expects the Commission to provide an opinion on these applications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, there is a general view throughout the Community that new applications for membership should be held over until the Internal Market has been completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>While, as the Taoiseach has indicated, no opinions have been expressed by member states, it is known that a number of member states are not happy with some of the applications, at least with the Austrian application, because of their neutrality.  Will the Taoiseach indicate his view in that regard?  Does he foresee any difficulty with the application of any of the countries named in Question No. 2, specifically in relation to Austria?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pre-empt anything, but I know that both countries feel their neutrality will not constitute an impediment to their membership.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Taoiseach will not be adjudicating on the membership of these three applicant countries, surely it is highly appropriate for him to welcome the application of three neutral countries to join the Community as that would strengthen the position Ireland has always held within the Community. Surely the public voicing of such an observation does not in any way cut across the protocol in relation to the Commission's view on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Taoiseach has said about the timing of this application, is it not likely that by the time these countries join the European Community, the Community will be operating under a new treaty which will contain the concept of a common foreign policy for Europe?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I allowed these questions on the basis that they relate to possible legislative action in relation to the office of the Presidency generally and not in relation to any particular President. My ruling in relation to the existing President stands, it is a long-standing rule <Col N="165" /> that the President shall be outside and above debate in the House.  The Deputy may ask questions in relation to legislative matters but not about the current incumbent of the office of President.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will rephrase the question.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to the present President, and I have accepted your ruling that I may not do so.  Does the Taoiseach consider that the provisions in the Constitution which are such that even if the President wishes to go on holiday the approval of the Cabinet is required are foolish and should be changed?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>The Task Force on Employment have been established under the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to monitor the job situation under the programme and explore all possibilities for new job creation.  The membership of the task force comprises nominees of the social partners who are parties to the programme apart from the secretaries of the Departments of Finance, Labour and Industry and Commerce and the chief executives of Aer Rianta, the ESB, Telecom Éireann, CTT and the IDA.  The question of nominating women, therefore, was a matter for the social partners and not for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No deadline has been set for the completion of the work of the Task Force on Employment.  The task force will report to the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The task force have already identified one area for action.  They estimated that £1 billion of products and components could be made in Ireland to <Col N="167" /> meet the annual needs and specifications of the multinational companies in Ireland and asked me to discuss with the commercial State companies their undertaking a programme to produce these products and components.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the report on the number of women on the boards of semi-State organisations and the indication that either 59 or 69 such bodies had no women members at all, did the Taoiseach in establishing the task force tell the social partners that he would like women representation among the nominees, given that the task force are Government established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not take that specific action.  That is a matter for the individual semi-State bodies.  As the Deputy knows, the Construction Industry Federation did include a women in their delegation. We would all have wished for the task force to include more women but, unfortunately, because of the way it is structured, it was not possible to do that.  I shall certainly keep an eye on the matter and ascertain whether suitable women can be attached to the task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to my second question, Question No. 6, since the Taoiseach has not fixed a deadline by which the task force should report, has he in mind any timescale within which the task force should report given the urgency of the unemployment problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The final phrase used by the Deputy gives the key to the issue. Because of the urgency of the problem, I expect the task force to report right along the line; in fact, as the Deputy knows, they have already submitted one report to me on the supply of components and products of the multinationals.  The task force made the recommendation at their first meeting and that is the way I should expect them to do their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that Cabinet itself should be <Col N="168" /> the Task Force on Employment?  Would he not further agree that the fact that, after four years in office, the Cabinet had to establish a task force to do their work in an area of policy formation is, to a certain extent, an admission of failure on the part of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not agree. Most reasonable people would recognise the establishment of the task force as an enlightened step and a constructive approach.  In fact, all those involved see it as such.  There is great enthusiasm among the members of the task force for their job, and I do expect concrete results from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the statement issued after the meeting I had on 24 June 1991 with the chairmen and chief executives of the state-sponsored bodies, copies of which were placed in the Oireachtas Liberary.</P>
      <P>The meeting, which took place at my request, was to discuss how the Statesponsored bodies might contribute to accelerating employment under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> particularly in the light of the fact that net outward migration has now virtually ceased.  The meeting took note of major developments by individual bodies which will create extra jobs and which are detailed in the statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two major conclusions of the meeting were that an expert working party consisting of representatives of the IDA, ESB, Bord Telecom, Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna and CIÉ be established to initiate a programme to manufacture in Ireland products and components which the Task Force on <Col N="169" /> Employment had reported multinational companies located here were willing to source in Ireland to an estimated value of £1 billion.  The first meeting of this group will take place tomorrow.  The second proposal was that the bodies would establish development units, if they had not already done so, to develop new activities which could generate employment.</P>
    <P>I shall continue to have periodic meetings with these bodies to review their progress in developing activities to create extra jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's initiative in bringing together the chairmen and the chief executives of the State sponsored bodies.  For some time I had felt that that was an area that had been largely neglected from the point of view of job creation.  When speaking to the earlier question on the task force, the Taoiseach said it was hoped that the semi-State companies could help to create the linkages between themselves and the multinationals and that it had been estimated that about 25,000 jobs could be created by fulfilling the £1 billion imports the multinational companies have at present.  What is the basis for the estimate of 25,000 jobs that could be created from import substitution?  How successful was the previous commitment made by semi-State companies, which arose from a meeting held between them and the Taoiseach in December 1989, that an estimated 7,000 new jobs would be created?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimate of 25,000 jobs was a rule of thumb.  It is a calculation made by the economists and statisticans that £1 billion worth of business would create that many jobs.  That is very sensible calculation.  The IDA have great experience in calculating what it takes to create jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy <Col N="170" /> does not understand, but the IDA can now measure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All activities and policy with regard to the IDA are directed towards keeping down the capital cost of creating jobs.  I consider the estimate to be a fairly good one.  To reply to the second query, the meeting in December 1989 had a fairly worth-while result.  For instance, Aer Lingus alone have brought on stream three major sub-projects which will, in time, create a considerable number of jobs.  Aer Rianta are also actively considering job creation prospects. The position is the same across the spectrum of semi-State bodies.  The statement issued after the December 1989 meeting listed several specific job creation proposals that the semi-State bodies have on hand and most of those have been initiated since that meeting.</P>

      <P>In the Taoiseach's meeting with the chief executives of the semi-State bodies, was there any discussion on the targets of, for example, the ESB for job shedding to reduce numbers from 13,000 to 10,000, An Post to shed 1,500 staff or Telecom for job reduction, all of which targets are set out in the programmes of those bodies?  Did the Taoiseach discuss with the chief executive of Bord na Móna the issue of capital restructuring?  I believe that Bord na Móna have sought from the Government on numerous occasions in the past two years a proper financial basis because the company is very heavily in debt. Would the Taoiseach consider putting some of the money from the sale of the Sugar Company and Irish Life into the recapitalisation of the semi-State industries? How many jobs does the Taoiseach expect to be created in the semi-State bodies before the end of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a long list of questions.  The Government did, of <Col N="171" /> course, discuss the question of the semi-State bodies slimming down their operactions in order to become competitive, of necessity, by shedding employment. That is a fact of life, unfortunately and regrettably.  Every commercial organisation is engaged in that exercise at the moment.  A starting point for the discussions was that the efforts of the semi-State bodies to become more competitive and productive in their labour force were not at issue.  We did direct attention to the question of whether semi-State bodies, out of their own resources and in other areas, could create new projects and new jobs in other areas, perhaps to some extent absorbing the numbers that they would shed in their core business. It is a perfectly logical and reasonable concept that a semi-State body which, by necessity and economic circumstances, has to trim its workforce and core business should, <i>ipso facto,</i> start searching for projects that could absorb those people. That was the basis of our discussion.</P>
      <P>The question of the restructuring of the capital of Bord na Móna does not affect their capacity to create jobs.</P>

Will the Taoiseach agree he is making a fool of himself coming into this House speaking as he has done when Government policies are forcing job losses of 1,500 or more in An Post?  Would the Taoiseach consider he is making a fool of himself speaking as he does when CIE, <Col N="172" /> for instance, because they employ 10,000 to 11,000 people, pay over £30 million in PRSI while companies with bigger turnover in the private sector pay a fraction of that?</P>

The Minister for Labour has acknowledged that he cannot answer questions on the impact of social welfare on employment, the impact of the differential rent system on take-home pay or the impact of medical cards on take-home pay.  Would the Taoiseach not accept that there is a need for one Minister for Employment, given our record in unemployment, with overall responsibility for co-ordinating the relationship between the take-home pay of people at work and what they would get on social welfare?</P>

The first meeting of the Council of Ministers of the <Col N="180" /> CSCE on 19 June also issued a declaration of this kind.  In the view of the Twelve, neither unilateral acts nor threats or use of force, but only dialogue and negotiation, can bring about a peaceful and lasting solution to the crisis.</P>
    <P>The Troika consisting of three Foreign Ministers of the Twelve visited Belgrade and Zagreb on 28 June at the request of the European Council which was meeting in Luxembourg on that day.  Their objective was to study the situation, to convey the Twelve's concern and to promote a peaceful resolution.  They reported having secured the agreement of all sides to three points: a ceasefire and return of armed forces to their barracks, suspension of the application of the unilateral declarations of independence for a period of three months, and restoration of the constitutional order by designation of a president and vice-president of the collegial presidency.  However, as it became apparent that implementation of these three points was not proceeding as envisaged, the Troika of Foreign Ministers returned to Yugoslavia on 30 June. They emphasised to all parties the importance of complying fully with the terms of the agreement.</P>
    <P>As well as this, the Twelve consider that the situation in Yugoslavia constitutes an emergency in the sense set out in the Charter of Paris of the CSCE. The Twelve have, therefore, invoked the emergency mechanism of the CSCE, and a meeting of the senior officials provided for by that mechanism will take place in Prague tomorrow afternoon, with a view to agreeing recommendations or conclusions to arrive at a solution.</P>
    <P>Ireland fully subscribes to the Twelve approach which has been to seek to get a negotiating process under way between the parties in Yugoslavia which will take account of a series of closely interlinked principles: re-establishment of a constitutional order; respect for human rights as well as for all of the other principles of the CSCE; intensification of the process of democratisation of Yugoslavia as well as further economic reform; and, finally, respect for the territorial integrity <Col N="181" /> of Yugoslavia on the basis of agreement by negotiation on its future structures.</P>

      <P>What exactly was Ireland's position at the meeting of the Council of Ministers about the efforts by Slovenia and Croatia for independence?  Would the Minister not agree that, in view of the similarities with our own country where, for example, in 1919 a unilateral declaration of independence was made in Dáil Éireann and where the division of the country had a lot to do with religious beliefs, our Foreign Minister should have at least indicated support for Slovenia and Croatia in pursuing their right to independence?</P>

      <P>Deputy Owen is aware that agreement came about as a result of consensus between the Twelve on the particular issue.  The Twelve constantly underline the necessity for political and economic reforms in Yugoslavia, and we see these as essential in their own right as a condition for maintaining Yugoslav unity.  We have considerable understanding for the aspirations of the Slovenian and Croatia peoples and we hope that these may find expression within a united and democratic Yugoslavia.</P>

Do they, or do they not, support the right to independence of Slovenia and Croatia?  Does the Minister agree that this should not have come as <Col N="182" /> a surprise to the Council of Ministers because last December the people of Slovenia passed a referendum seeking independence by an overwhelming majority?

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 10, 20, 27, 34, 35, 50 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The provision for Official Development Assistance, ODA, in the 1991 budget was £43.7 million or 0.18 per cent of GNP, an increase of over £9 million over 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the adoption of the budget, further measures have been undertaken which will increase the total by over £2 million more.  These are the additions to bilateral and multilateral contributions in respect of European Community programmes for relief of the emergency situations in Africa and in Bangladesh and the humanitarian needs of the Kurdish <Col N="184" /> population of Iraq.  Total ODA for 1991 is now expected to rise to close to £46 million.  This represents 0.19 per cent of GNP and over one third more in cash terms than the 1990 level of ODA.</P>
    <P>The increase in the level of funding is a clear indication of the Government's strong commitment to developing countries. Total expenditure for the first half of 1991 is estimated at £23.4 million.  This has been spent mainly on projects in our priority and partner countries, on volunteers sponsored by the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, on disaster relief grants to Irish and international relief agencies and on contributions to the European Community, the World Bank and other international agencies involved in development and relief work.</P>
    <P>As has been explained repeatedly in this House and elsewhere, the Government remain committed to achieving the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for Official Development Assistance and will make progress towards it as economic and financial circumstances permit. However, it is not realistic given our current situation to expect that it can be reached quickly.  I welcome the views and advice of all parties in this House on development assistance matters but would have to note that, to date, proposals I have received for progressing towards the target of 0.7 per cent or intermediate targets have been made without regard to the difficult budgetary and economic situation the Government face.</P>
    <P>There is no formal reporting structure at the United Nations on aid provisions, but we have reported in detail to the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD and have given full explanations of our allocations each year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that as we sit in this Chamber today 20 million people in Africa alone are facing the threat of starvation?  Is the Minister seriously telling this House that the 0.18 per cent provision for Overseas Development Assistance is a satisfactory response to the horrific statistics on the number of people who will die?  Is the Minister <Col N="185" /> aware that the 0.18 per cent level to which he referred is the same as the percentage given in aid by this country ten years ago? Will he now give a commitment &mdash; I know he will get support for this from all parties in the House &mdash; to bring in a supplementary budget this year and increase the budget next year?  Will he say when the Government hope to reach the target of 0.7 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should pay particular attention to the original reply given by me to her question and the questions asked by other Members which clearly shows that there has been an increase of over £9 million in 1991 over 1990.  That is a considerable increase by any standards.  Will the Deputy also please take into account the very long statement made by me on the subject the last time I answered questions in which I explained in very great detail the policy and attitude of the Government in regard to this issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that some of the increase about which he speaks arose as a result of the Gulf War and crises which occurred in other areas and that he is hiding the real level of assistance given by the Government? The Government have not made any serious commitment towards reaching the UN target of 0.7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad Deputy Owen has given me this opportunity of clarifying some of the confusion which seems to have arisen about the funding for countries most affected by the Gulf crisis.  I assure the House that this is properly classified as development assistance. About half the funds are being provided via the EC and the World Bank to help Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, the three frontline states most affected by the crisis.  The balance is being provided bilaterally and all of our bilateral aid for the frontline states, £3 million, is being provided for Egypt, the poorest in <i>per <Col N="186" /> capita</i> terms of the three frontier states. The balance of £500,000 is available for other developing countries and of this £250,000 is being provided for food aid for Sudan, the worst affected of our priority areas.  The remainder has been allocated to other developing countries, in particular, our other priority countries, Zambia, Tanzania and Lesotho.  All three frontline states are classified as developing countries and it would be very odd if we were to exclude from our ODA table our aid to these countries while our fellow members of the OECD Development Assistance Committee include theirs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 30 and 33 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave a full account of the Community's response to the famine in Africa <Col N="187" /> in replies to questions on 17 April and 21 May.</P>
    <P>As I indicated then, the special programme to provide 400,000 tonnes of grain referred to by Deputy Owen is additional to the normal EC food aid programme.  The Council agreed to an increase in the EC's budget of 140 million ECU in order to finance it.  The member states also agreed to finance a further quantity of up to 200,000 tonnes of grain. Ireland contributed £325,000 to the latter effort in the shape of payment to Concern and Trócaire for the purchase of food. This is in addition to our contribution through the Community budget of almost £1 million.</P>
    <P>The EC special programme is well advanced.  Contracts, for the most part, have been negotiated and deliveries are on their way or already supplied.  The additional food will ensure that delivery capacity is fully utilised over the next few months.  While more food may be needed before the end of the year, the immediate requirement is not for further pledges but to ensure delivery of stocks already available or expected.  There are, for example, berthing difficulties in Ethiopia's ports which the international agencies are taking urgent action to alleviate. In Mauritania there is a danger of blocking the port with too much food arriving at the same time.  In Sudan there is good movement of food out of Port Sudan but serious difficulties exist as regards delivery of food to the interior because of low capacity on the roads and shortage of transport.  Delicate negotiations are taking place under the auspices of UN and EC agencies about alternative means of reaching some of the most vulnerable and inaccessible people.</P>
    <P>In so far as Ireland's bilateral assistance is concerned, we have given in the region of £1.5 million from the disaster relief fund towards the present emergency, £0.85 million in 1990 and £0.71 million this year.  A further contribution of £250,000 is being provided for food purchases in Sudan through the World Food Programme in the context of our aid for countries most affected by the Gulf crisis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> The Community has already done a great deal.  It has pledged to donate over 1.5 million tonnes of food.  I hope that other donors will make an additional effort to provide needed supplies later in the year.  The Commission is monitoring the situation and I shall also keep under review the need for any further action, including the use, if suitable, of grain from intervention.  The products to be supplied as food aid are determined by the needs of the recipients rather than by what is in surplus in intervention.  In so far as some of these products may be suitable for programmed or long-term food aid, I am in favour of their use.  The Community already supplies many food aid needs in this way.  I should state, however, that food from intervention or elsewhere in Europe may not be suitable for emergency needs where speedy delivery is crucial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I rose previously, a Cheann Comhairle, on a point of order and I am very happy to accept that your office did make an attempt this morning to communicate with me concerning my question and that the impression that the situation in Nicaragua has not changed is one that is held by the Department of Foreign Affairs and not your office.  I welcome the potential use of grain from intervention but I would like the Minister to answer directly one simple question.  Given that my question raises the famine in Africa, what is the Irish Government's attitude towards the international debt dimension of the African famine crisis?  Given that the debt of those countries, where 29.9 million people are threatened with starvation, is $162 billion, what is the Irish Government's attitude towards that debt, having regard to the fact that the interest payments in the affected countries have in each year for the last five years accumulatively exceeded aid, including aid from the Community which the Minister has referred to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the debt of these countries is a major contributory factor to the difficulties which exist and which we are talking <Col N="189" /> about at present.  It is certainly one of the elements and it is a matter which has to be taken into account.  The European Community, of which we are a full member, is involved in discussions with the World Bank and other international agencies to see how they can help.  The Commission will be present at the meeting of the G7 which will take place within a matter of days in London.  The Commission will be involved, through the President, Mr. Jacques Delors, in these discussions with the membership of the G7 to see if positive help can be given to make the debt more manageable than it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Government in favour of an international conference on the debt and, given that interest payments are greater than the total sum of aid, will it be suggested by Ireland at the next meeting at which Foreign Ministers of the European Community discuss this matter, that there be a moratorium on debt repayments for a period of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the Deputy is correct in that there will be further discussions shortly on the issue when we receive a report from the Commission on the talks which will take place in London in a matter of weeks.  At that stage we will assess the situation to see how best we can be of help in tackling the difficulty which exists.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 28 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The liaison group mentioned in the first question addresses to the President of the Council of Ministers at least once during the term of each European Community Presidency a memorandum on the situation in South Africa.  These memoranda receive careful consideration in the formulation of policy in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The South African parties committed to a peaceful solution are broadly agreed on the need for a multi-party forum in which negotiations on a new constitution can proceed.  Agreement has not yet been reached on how the negotiations should <Col N="191" /> be structured, and on what institutional arrangements should apply as the transition to a fully democratic society takes place.  These are matters for the parties themselves to determine.  Ireland, together with its European Community partners, will continue, however, to press for an early start to negotiations on a new constitution for a united, democratic and non-racial South Africa.</P>
    <P>There have been some very positive developments in South Africa over the recent past.  The legislative steps to repeal the major remaining pillars of apartheid have been taken by parliament, and the way is now open for negotiations on a new South Africa.  The Government welcome the repeal of the Group Areas Act and the Land Acts as well as the Population Registration Act.  We also welcome the repeal or amendment of a number of provisions of the Internal Security Act.</P>
    <P>There remain, however, obstacles in the way of opening substantive constitutional negotiations, notably delays in the release of all political prisoners and in the return of South African exiles from abroad.  These are matters which the Taoiseach discussed with President De Klerk when he visited Ireland in April. Subsequently, the Twelve have been in frequent contact with the South African Government on these various issues and have made known our concern at the negative effects of delays on the creation of a climate conductive to negotiations. On 28-29 June at the European Council in Luxembourg, the Twelve issued a Declaration on South Africa again expressing the hope that a rapid solution can be found to the problem of political prisoners and to that of the return of exiles.</P>
    <P>The Community has also been in touch with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees on the question of the repatriation of South African exiles and will continue to promote an agreement satisfactory to all concerned.  The Government have already provided £25,000 last year to the UNHCR's Special Programme for this purpose.  We naturally wish to see that programme become operational as early as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> While the South African Government clearly have the primary responsibility for law and order, all parties have an obligation to work for tolerance and to seek ways to bring the violence to an end. I was heartened by the results of the 22 June conference on violence under the aegis of Church and business leaders, but just how fragile the situation is was demonstrated by further violent incidents only a few days later.  We believe nevertheless that the constructive attitudes evident at that meeting offer hope that the violence can be tackled effectively.  The Luxembourg Declaration also reiterated the concern of the Twelve about the violence in South Africa and called on the South African Government to spare no effort to uphold law and public order. The Declaration noted the consultations on this grave problem and called on all parties to display moderation.</P>
    <P>Irish policy on sanctions is the subject of consultations within the Twelve.  The overall objective of the Twelve is a united, democratic, non-racial South Africa and we have set out a number of specific steps which we wish to see taken in pursuit of that objective.  As these steps are taken the sanctions which we have applied to bring about change are modified accordingly.  There have already been positive developments over the past year and a half and we are ready to make further modifications as this process continues.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply in which he admitted that there are many problems outstanding in South Africa.  With regard to sanctions, does the Minister agree that no further amelioration of the sanctions should be permitted until substantial progress has been made?  Would the Minister state, if the European Community wish to relax the sanctions without further progress having been made, if Ireland will take a separate stance on the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The sanctions have never been regarded by the Government as immutable but rather were intended to influence the South African Government <Col N="193" /> to change their policies and abolish apartheid. They have now firmly embarked upon that road and it is appropriate, as I have already said, that policy be reviewed in the light of those developments.</P>

      <P>In relation to Question No. 28, which is being taken with Question No. 14, may I ask the Minister to outline, as the question asks him to do, the specific steps the Government have taken to press for assistance for the return of exiles to South Africa and for the release of political prisoners there?  The Minister must know that there is still a considerable number of political prisoners in South Africa and that the South African Government are using all sorts of devices to hide the fact that these detainees are political prisoners, even to the extent of actually moving prisoners around and hiding their identity.  Would the Minister indicate the specific steps the Government are taking, given that the Irish Government met with President De Klerk in Ireland and presumably, although we were not told in this House, got some undertakings from President De Klerk in regard to these matters.</P>

      <P>Deputy De Rossa should have regard to the record of this House because at the time of the visit of President De Klerk the matter was discussed in the House and as far as I can recall it was clearly said that the Taoiseach raised the question of political prisoners with President De Klerk, who went into very great detail about what his Government were trying to do.  He spoke about the difficulties he was experiencing in the classification of persons in prison as to whether they were ordinary criminals or political criminals.  The Deputy will also recall full well that the EC, in which we play a full part on this issue, has at every opportunity raised the question of political prisoners with everybody and anybody who has any say or influence with the South African Government.  As I said in my reply, we see this issue as an obstacle to the talks getting under way in a meaningful way.</P>

      <P>It is very important for us to remember that while it is always useful to hear the European Community's attitude it is only contextual. This is the Oireachtas and we are here to listen to the Irish Government's foreign policy.  On this point, given that the Minister referred to the EC position, it is well known that the Danish and Irish position differs from the British position.  In his reply the Minister stated that it was well known that the Irish Government's policy on sanctions was one to seek to influence attitudes to apartheid.  I seem to recall it being on the record of this House that the purpose of sanctions was to abolish apartheid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been quite a number of policy statements to that effect made on this issue since early 1985.  As early as 1985, and we were in full support of this, the Twelve issued a list of steps they wished to see the South African Government take in pursuit of that particular objective.  These were &mdash; if I may mention them very briefly &mdash; the unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners; the unbanning of all political organisations; the lifting of the state of emergency; the end to detention without trial and forced relocation; a firm commitment by the South African Government to end apartheid and to dismantle discriminatory legislation; and finally, negotiations with representatives of the majority population.</P>
      <P>It should be recognised, and I believe it is by a great majority of people, that since the advent to office of President De Klerk the South African Government have gone a long way towards fulfilling most of the demands of the Twelve.  I accept that action is still required in respect of political prisoners, detention without trial &mdash; but we must accept the reality that considerable progress has been achieved by President De Klerk in his efforts to dismantle apartheid.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 15, 18, 36, 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>We have not been approached about the World Food Programme's appeal on behalf of people displaced by the war in Cambodia.  I am, however, aware of it and I can inform the House that the delegate of the European Commission in Thailand is currently making arrangements for a Community contribution to the appeal.</P>
      <P>Events relating to the Cambodian peace process have moved quite rapidly since the EC-ASEAN meeting at the end of May.  The Joint Declaration published at the conclusion of that meeting devoted considerable attention to the issue of Cambodia and reaffirmed the condemnation of the Twelve and the ASEAN countries of those responsible for the extermination of hundreds of thousands of Cambodians from 1975-78. The statement also emphasised the continuing commitment of the Twelve and ASEAN to the UN plan for Cambodia, which has been elaborated by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.  The Twelve and ASEAN countries desire to have the Paris International Conference on Cambodia reconvened as soon as possible, in an atmosphere conductive to national reconciliation and peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A meeting of the Supreme National Council (SNC) with the co-chairmen of the Paris International Conference on <Col N="199" /> Cambodia, France and Indonesia, took place in Jakarta from 2 to 4 June.  This was followed by another meeting in Pattaya, Thailand, from 24 to 26 June.  I am happy to report that solid progress has now been made in the negotiating process. Most importantly, the parties to the conflict have agreed to an unlimited ceasefire and have undertaken to stop receiving foreign military aid.  Agreement was also reached in relation to the chairmanship of the Supreme National Council and it is intended that the SNC will represent Cambodia at the UN General Assembly in the autumn.</P>
    <P>These positive developments in the peace process are an indication of a growing spirit of compromise and flexibility by all concerned.  However, there is still a long way to travel before the progress towards peace, justice and democracy for the Cambodian people is irreversible. The achievements to date, which have been forged through a long and difficult negotiating process, must be preserved and built upon, so that the current momentum will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I will of course, give very careful consideration, at the appropriate time, to Ireland's position on any Cambodian resolution at the UN General Assembly, but it is too early to forecast what the position in the Assembly will be.  Last year's resolution on Cambodia was adopted by consensus.  I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate, once again, that there must be no return to power of Pol Pot and that any settlement must ensure no possibility of a repeat of the genocidal policies of the past.</P>
    <P>I consider that the information available to me on Cambodia is adequate for the purpose of formulating Irish policy and that, therefore, a fact-finding mission would not be justified.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the end of the Cambodian tragedy is at last in sight and that the Cambodian people will now be spared further suffering from the wanton destruction and death which the conflict has imposed on them.  I will continue to maintain my efforts within the Twelve <Col N="200" /> and in the international arena to bring a just and lasting peace to Cambodia.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I compliment him on the initiative he has shown in this area of foreign policy.  I welcome the fact that the EC are considering contributing to the world food programme appeal and I would ask the Minister to ensure that a sizeable contribution is made to assist the 185,000 Cambodians who are currently displaced from their homes, as well as the 360,000 in the camps on the Thai border.  The Supreme National Council representatives from the Khmer Rouge side include two people who are as close as one can get to Pol Pot.  Does the Minister agree that it would be very difficult for the Supreme National Council to get support at the UN if two of the representatives are clearly people who are responsible for the deaths of many thousands of people in Cambodia?  Could the Minister intervene to see if it would be possible to have different representatives from the Khmer Rouge side on the Supreme National Council?  I name Khieu Sampau and Son Sen.</P>

      <P>My answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the affirmative.  I will have due regard for the situation which the Deputy outlined.  I share the views she expressed.  Regarding the second part of the supplementary question, the Deputy knows very well that this is a complex and difficult matter which is at present being debated.  It was only at the meeting in Pattaya in Thailand on 27 June that any worthwhile progress was made in the past 12 months in achieving the movement.  The Deputy is correct when she talks of the sensitivities with regard to personnel, their associations and their involvement at an earlier stage. Our position is quite clear in that we will not be in any way tolerate the return to power of Pol Pot.  Of course, we must have regard to advice being given to us by those who are involved.  In that respect I maintain close contact with Senator Gareth Evans, the Foreign Minister of Australia, who is personally very much <Col N="201" /> involved and who has come here to brief us on the issue.  We have had discussions recently with Foreign Minister Nakayama of Japan who is playing a leading role in this issue too.  We will reflect on the situation when we are asked to consider further SNC delegations.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the Government's position on the current Middle East peace initiative; if the Government will urge that any peace conference should be under the auspices of the United Nations and that the role of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation as the representative body for the Palestinian people should be fully recognised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government fully support the current US initiative to attempt to achieve peace in the Middle East.  We believe that the commitment of the US Administration, as evidenced by Secretary Baker's four visits to the region since March, offers prospects of breaking a deadlock which has lasted too long.  I hope that notwithstanding present differences between the parties they will find it possible to agree on a format which will allow a conference to be convened at an early date.</P>
      <P>The European Council held in Luxembourg last weekend reaffirmed support for the US initiative and urgently appealed to all the parties concerned to overcome the remaining procedural difficulties to enable the holding of a peace conference.  As a participant in the peace conference, the Community and its member states aim to make their full contribution to its success and to the negotiations between the parties.</P>
      <P>While supporting this initiative, we in the Twelve maintain our own long standing policy of pressing for a wide ranging international peace conference for the region under the auspices of the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the UN should in any <Col N="202" /> event have a central role.  Any settlement must be based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and on the principle that all states in the region have the right to exist within secure and recognised borders.  The legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to a homeland, must also be respected and the principle of &ldquo;land for peace&rdquo; as outlined in the UN resolutions must be applied.</P>
    <P>With regard to who should represent the Palestinian people, the Government are of the view that this is a matter for the Palestinian people themselves to determine.</P>

      <P>While welcoming the Minister's statement that he regards it as important that any peace conference be under the auspices of the United Nations, I detected in part of his reply an indication that he was willing to move from that position.  Will the Minister indicate that he is of the opinion, as is the European Community, that any international peace conference should be under the auspices of the UN, who should not simply have a participative role in the process?  In view of the fact that the PLO are the acknowledged representatives of the Palestinian people, clearly they must also be involved in any such conference. Would the Minister agree that the policy of the Israeli Government which systematically denies human rights to Palestinians in the Occupied Territories does not augur well for the success of any peace process, in particular the application of collective punishment of families in the occupied areas which has rendered thousands of Palestinians homeless?  Would the Minister agree that any state such as Israel which claims to be democratic and civilised cannot be allowed to continue with this form of collective punishment of families in the Occupied Territories?</P>

      <P>I said in my reply that I hope, notwithstanding the present differences between the parties, they will find it possible to agree on a format which will allow the conference to be convened at an early date.  The European Council in Luxembourg at the weekend reaffirmed support for the US initiative and urgently appealed to all parties concerned to overcome the remaining procedural difficulties to enable the holding of a peace conference.  I clearly said that Ireland and the Twelve maintain our longstanding policy of pressing for a wide-ranging international peace conference on the region under the auspices of the United Nations.  We believe the UN should in any event play a central role.  Any settlement must be based on the United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and on the principle that all the states in the region have the right to exist within secure and recognised borders, that the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to a homeland, must be respected and that the principle of land for peace outlined in the resolution must be applied.  That is our position on this extremely complex and delicate issue.</P>

      <P>Sir, I communicated with your office yesterday under Standing Order 30 that I wished to raise a matter at the commencement of public business today.  The matter is as follows: that this House expresses its grave concern at the miscalculations revealed by the media in Exchequer returns published on 1 July and calls on the Government to arrange a full Dáil debate on the situation before the House rises for the summer recess and to spell out in the course of that debate the full range of corrective measures the Government propose to take.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I wish to request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the publication yesterday of the Exchequer returns for the first six months of the year which showed that the Government's budgetary targets were seriously off-course and that Exchequer borrowing was already more than £300 million over the target set for the full year, the need for Government to announce any corrective action they may plan before the Dáil recess so that the House may have an opportunity to fully debate and decide on any such measures, and the absolute necessity of avoiding any further cutbacks in essential public services which have already been pared to the bone, and the need to address the problem by increasing tax revenue from those sectors which are not currently bearing their fair share of the burden.  In view of the extreme urgency of the matter I hope, Sir, you will agree to the request.</P>

We are now talking about a situation where we have a massive overrun in relation to the Government's figures.

I assert that a Dáil debate on the Estimates is to commence next <Col N="311" /> Friday and is due to continue all next week or the greater portion thereof.  The Deputies will, therefore, have an ample opportunity to ventilate their views on this matter.

We believe this attempt to guillotine legislation through this House is fundamentally anti-democratic and occurs only because this Government do not wish to allow Dáil Éireann to continue in session because the Government are unable to resolve their own internal difficulties in regard to the budget and other matters and do not wish to find themselves under scrutiny in this House.</P>

There are occasions when it is necessary to apply guillotines but it is quite unacceptable to have seven other Bills being guillotined this week.  I would draw particular attention to the Temple Bar Bill which we were told last week was being taken off the agenda for this week and then we were told it was being put on again.  We <Col N="313" /> are not being given any time to debate the Committee Stage of that Bill.  There is quite an extraordinary situation in relation to that Bill.

I would urge the <Col N="314" /> Taoiseach yet again to do what was promised two years ago in this House by way of the Programme for Government which was agreed between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, that they would introduce proposals for reform of how we do our business in this House.</P>

    <Title>Temple Bar Area Renewal and Development Bill, 1991: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is, firstly, to establish, on a statutory basis, Temple Bar Renewal Limited as the company to act as provided for in the Finance Act, 1991, and provide that the company shall lay its decisions, on the approval of development proposals before both Houses of the Oireachtas for their information; Temple Bar Renewal Limited is a company limited by guarantee.  Up to now its essential function has been to advise me, and through me the Government, on how the Temple Bar area should be developed.  From now on its essential function will be to decide which development proposals merit the incentives provided for the Temple Bar area in the Finance Act, 1991.  Secondly, to establish, on a statutory basis, Temple Bar Properties Limited as the company to implement the development of Temple Bar on behalf of the Government; Temple Bar Properties Limited is a company limited by shares of which the Taoiseach, through his nominees is the sole shareholder, as the member of the Government with responsibility for culture. Its essential function is to act as the development company for the Temple Bar area on behalf of the Government in accordance with the recommended development plan.</P>
      <P>The development of the Temple Bar area is a Government Flagship Project for Dublin's Year as European City of Culture in 1991.  The objectives of the renewal and development of Temple Bar is to build on what has been taking place in the area spontaneously and to create a cultural and tourist quarter which people will visit and in which others will work and live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Temple Bar has developed over the years to become a &ldquo;village&rdquo; within the city.  The tenants have been attracted by the historic ambience of the streets and buildings, and through their wide variety of activities they have contributed greatly to this &ldquo;village&rdquo; atmosphere.  Already there exists a vibrant intertrading and interdependence among the tenants involving artists, traders, restaurateurs, musicians, business people, publicans and residents.  The expansion of existing <Col N="329" /> facilities and the promotion of new tourism and recreational facilities will include restaurants, speciality shops, recording studios, a film centre, craft workshops, theatres, art galleries, hotels and a variety of retail shops and markets.</P>
    <P>The visual impact of the area will focus in particular on cobble stones, wood panelled shop exteriors, lamp standards, sculpture, buskers and speakers corner and a weekend market.  In this way the unique character and &ldquo;left-bank&rdquo; atmosphere of Temple Bar will be promoted. The objective is also to provide residential accommodation for students and others who wish to live in the area.  This is in keeping with the policy of creating a living vibrant inner city area along this part of the quays.</P>
    <P>Temple Bar Properties Limited will implement the European Commission pilot project for the Temple Bar area for which the Commission has provided funding of IR£3.6 million representing 50 per cent of the total cost.  In addition, the European Investment Bank have agreed to provide a loan of IR£5 million to Temple Bar Properties Limited for the first phase of the development of the area and to consider favourably further loans for later phases of the development.</P>
    <P>The development of the Temple Bar area has been undertaken by the Government on the basis of unanimous proposals and recommendations made to them by Temple Bar Development Council, which represents people from the area, in Dublin Corporation's action plan for the area and by representative groups. The development has the full support of the Arts Council and the council will be actively involved in its implementation.</P>
    <P>The company will acquire all the properties owned in the Temple Bar area by CIE and Dublin Corporation.  It will, also, acquire such other key properties in the area as it considers essential to its development role.  A particular focus of this role will be to encourage refurbishment of existing buildings in a way that enhances and complements the conservation and architectural legacy of the area.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that Temple Bar <Col N="330" /> Properties Limited will be required to provide details of its operations to the Minister for Finance given that he will give a State guarantee of the company's borrowing up to a limit of IR£25 million. The company's accounts will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  As a commercial State company, Temple Bar Properties Limited can be added to the remit of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies; Temple Bar Renewal and Properties Limited will be subject to public service pay guidelines; tenants may not assign, sublet or share possession of premises without the prior consent, in writing, of Temple Bar Properties Limited; Temple Bar Properties Limited will have powers of compulsory purchase in the Temple Bar area in accordance with the Third Schedule to this Bill; and Temple Bar Properties Limited will be exempt from stamp duty in relation to the properties it acquires in the Temple Bar area.</P>
    <P>A number of tax reliefs have been introduced for the Temple Bar area, which are similar to those in &ldquo;designated areas&rdquo;.  Broadly speaking, these include double rent allowances, industrial buildings allowance, owner occupier allowance for private dwellings and &ldquo;section 23&rdquo; allowances for rented residential accommodation.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the need to give priority to the refurbishment of the area, a special new 100 per cent capital allowance is being given for refurbishment of the existing buildings.  This new capital allowance will cover the actual expenditure incurred on refurbishment plus either the cost of acquiring the building or its value as at 1 January 1991 &mdash; exclusive of site cost or value &mdash; where the amount spent on refurbishment exceeds the latter.</P>
    <P>I believe that the new incentives for refurbishment in Temple Bar which allow not just the full cost of the refurbishment but also the cost of the building which is being refurbished are critical for Temple Bar being redeveloped sensitively as we all wish.  Already the first steps have been <Col N="331" /> taken in the redevelopment process.  The acquisition of the CIE properties is being arranged and new leases will be drawn up by the new company with existing tenants.  A survey of Dublin Corporation properties is underway and a report is expected shortly.  A large number of developers have already expressed an interest in developing sections of Temple Bar and these inquiries are being actively pursued.  Needless to say, such a high level of development will provide considerable jobs in the construction industry and support services.</P>
    <P>Jobs will also be provided in the cultural industries.  Temple Bar Properties Ltd. has commissioned several cultural reports to direct the development of the area with specific reference to job creation.  These reports include: a report on the National Music Centre; a report on a development strategy for the Irish film industry with particular emphasis on job creation; a report on food and employment in the food industries; a report on the social impact of the development on the local community.</P>
    <P>Specific proposals for a wide range of artistic, cultural and retail projects have been received from many individuals and entrepreneurs.  The Irish Film Centre Project, which is a flagship has gone to tender and will be started this summer. It will be completed in spring 1992.  An architectural competition for a comprehensive and co-ordinated building plan for the Temple Bar area is being launched in conjunction with the RIAI. The building, known as Saint Michael and Johns at Fishamble Street, has been acquired for the development of the Viking Adventure in conjunction with Bord Fáilte.  This project will be totally suitable for this historic area beside Wood Quay.  Dublin Corporation has commenced the pedestrianisation of a number of streets in the area.  The current phase will be completed by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The redevelopment of the Temple Bar area will make history in the life of this city.  It is a distinctive part of Dublin frequented by young people, attracted by <Col N="332" /> the unique ambience of the area, where art and cultural activities have begun to flourish spontaneously and which will now be extended and nurtured by these new companies, which the Oireachtas is establishing.  This old and well-loved part of Dublin will be restored to prime condition, which it deserves.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the development will provide a vibrant new living area, providing new jobs and attracting many visitors.  It will, no doubt, provide a showcase both nationally and internationally to emphasise the great potential for renewal in inner city areas where there is a cohesive plan, supported by Government, city planners and people from the area itself, for development encompassing cultural and business activities.</P>
    <P>The Temple Bar Project brings to physical reality a dream that many dedicated people have cherished for a long time.  It also gives expression to our hope that Irish society will develop a vibrant artistic dimension in which all will be involved and in which creativity will be fostered and extended to all sections of the community.  I know this project has support right across the political spectrum and for that reason I will welcome and carefully consider any ideas or suggestions which Deputies may wish to offer.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House are happy to support any significant move to restore elegance, life and ambience to our city centre, but why should the Taoiseach introduce this Bill here today?  The fact that the Taoiseach is handling this Bill, the fact that the Bill nominates the Taoiseach as the sole shareholder of both companies proposed to be set up by this Bill &mdash; Temple Bar Renewal Limited and Temple Bar Properties Limited &mdash; is very unusual and gives rise to many questions which have been the subject of parliamentary questions in this House but which have never been adequately answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cloak under which the Taoiseach <Col N="333" /> introduces this legislation is his responsibility for culture.  I submit that the cultural dimension of the renewal of the Temple Bar is but a side show.  Clearly the responsibility for urban renewal lies with the Minister for the Environment. Why is that Minister not the sponsor for this Bill, and why is he not nominated as the sole shareholder of the companies proposed to be set up under this Bill?</P>
    <P>It is unusual for the Taoiseach to take direct responsibility for something that is clearly the function of one of his Ministers. The Minister for Finance, appointed by the Taoiseach, is the only other person required to give approval to guarantees and other loans under the Bill.  The function of the Minister for Finance here would be normal if this legislation involved another Minister as he would provide, for the taxpayer and the House, a safety check so that at least the approval by the Minister for Finance would be required before another Minister could become involved in expenditure either directly or indirectly from the Exchequer.  The Minister for Finance is independent of other Ministers in that respect.  It cannot be said, however, that the Minister is independent of the Taoiseach who has the hiring and the firing of him.</P>
    <P>I am disturbed that the Taoiseach should take direct responsibility for this Bill.  I am disturbed that the Taoiseach should be the sole shareholder of the two companies proposed to be set up under this Bill.  This is unusual and raises certain worries and concerns on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I will come back to the whole question of the ownership of the Temple Bar, the profits that will be or could be made and the compensation that should or could be made to a number of institutions.  Does the Taoiseach not have any confidence in his own Minister for the Environment in the area of urban renewal?  Would he not permit him to sponsor this Bill or to be the shareholder of those companies? What role has the Minister for the Environment in urban renewal in this Government? What is the role of Dublin <Col N="334" /> Corporation in relation to urban renewal?</P>
    <P>When the Government of which I was a member set up the Metropolitan Streets Commission it was denounced by Deputy Haughey, although it was clearly a statutory body without any shareholding whose statutory purpose was to renew the city centre and to restore elegance with urgency to the city centre.  This body was peremptorily cut off by the Taoiseach as soon as he became Taoiseach in 1987. As a result there has not been any coordination in the drive towards urban renewal which was proposed by the Urban Renewal Act, 1986.  In so far as this Bill is an extension of the purpose of the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour Government, I welcome it.  There is no doubt that the Temple Bar area has particular features and that it lends itself to a certain atmosphere, character and ambience which can add to the vitality of the city.</P>
    <P>Some people query the boundaries proposed for the Temple Bar area.  In the minds of Dubliners and those who know the Temple Bar area, the area would stop at Parliament Street.  The fact that it is being extended as far as Fishamble Street has caused some eyebrows to rise.  It may be said that the extension is because the Church of Sts. Michael and John, which is to be a vital museum, is in the section between Parliament Street and Fishamble Street, but I would have thought that the building could have been designated without designating the whole area.  The area is detached physically from what is understood to be the Temple Bar area and it is detached in character and in mood.  The extent of the Temple Bar area provided for in this Bill would not meet Dubliners' normal definition of the Temple Bar area.</P>
    <P>What about the role of Dublin Corporation, the council elected to develop and run the city, to restore the city and to maintain it in an elegant and clean environment?  Some months ago we ran through this House what purported to be a local government reform Bill which in almost every section centralised power with the Minister for the Environment <Col N="335" /> and further diminished the role of the local authority and thus the power of the people.  Now even the Minister for the Environment is not being trusted with power and it is going directly to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach came into the House to make a major statement on employment or to introduce an employment Bill, I would welcome that because that is where we have a central crisis.  While unemployment figures soar to all time records, the Taoiseach refused to appoint a Minister for Employment but he has introduced a Bill which in reality should be the responsibility of a junior Minister at the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is usurping the role not only of his own Minister for the Environment but of Dublin Corporation. It is no wonder that in last week's elections people used their votes, so far as they voted at all, to appoint even absentee candidates.  The attitude of the electorate is that if the Minister for the Environment is to treat local government as a joke, so should they and many of the electorate took the opportunity to treat local government as a joke.  Yet again in this Bill the role of the local authority, in this case Dublin Corporation, is being diminished and taken over not by the Minister for the Environment but by the Taoiseach.  This gives rise to many questions. For example, what are the Taoiseach's priorities?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not say anything in his introductory speech about two vital matters to which I now want to refer. The first relates to planning and by-law procedures.  I want an assurance that the normal planning and building by-law procedures will have to be adhered to and that no pressure, either overtly or covertly by virtue of the enactment of this Bill or by officials at central Government level, will be put on planners to make decisions which they would otherwise not objectively make.  I should like an assurance that it is not the intention of this House through the enactment of this Bill <Col N="336" /> to override normal planning considerations or to put on planners moral pressure to make planning decisions which they would otherwise not objectively make.  In other words, just because Temple Bar Renewal Limited or Temple Bar Properties Limited designate an area or building for concessions this should not <i>ipso facto</i> require planning authorities to give planning permission or building by-law approval which would be in breach of their normal standards and requirements or of what they consider good planning. There was no reference whatever in the Taoiseach's speech to planning matters.</P>
    <P>These are serious issues.  The electorate of Dublin city and county have thrown out Fianna Fáil majorities on the council and corporation.  One of the issues of concern to the electorate was planning and the decisions made in regard to planning matters.  This House, and the people of this city, need a reassurance that no explicit or implicit attempt will be made to get around normal planning procedures and that no pressure, explicit or implicit, immoral or moral, will be brought to bear on planners to make decisions which they would otherwise not make in keeping with good planning criteria.</P>
    <P>The second issue I want to raise &mdash; no reference was made to this in the Taoiseach's speech &mdash; is that of windfall profits.  Will any individual or groups at one remove, two removes or several removes, either directly or indirectly, stand to profit financially to an excessive degree by virtue of the enactment of this Bill and Chapter VII of this year's Finance Act?  Are any steps being taken to ensure that there will be no such massive windfall gains for individuals as a result of the passing of this legislation?  Can we have an assurance that no individuals will gain massively from the passing into law of this legislation and the relevant Chapter of this year's Finance Act?  If so, are any steps being taken to ensure that those windfall profits will be taxed?</P>
    <P>I raise this issue because many reasonable people believe individuals could make substantial gains as a result of the <Col N="337" /> passing of this legislation.  It was the scandal of individuals who make huge gains as a result of planning decisions in County Dublin which caused so many sitting councillors to lose their seats in the local elections.  People were clearly not happy with a situation where re-zoning decisions had the effect of enabling individuals and groups to make large profits.  Frequently those decisions seemed to be in breach of good planning norms.  It would be a great scandal if this House enacted legislation which had the principal effect of enabling individuals to make windfall profits either directly or indirectly.  I should like the Taoiseach to give us an assurance that his officials have taken steps to ensure that this will not be the effect of this legislation.  I should like to know what inquiries have been made regarding the ownership of properties in the extended Temple Bar area.  I should like to know if any attempt has been made to quantify the increase in property values as a result of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to windfall losers.  As a former Minister for Transport, I know that for many years CIE acquired parcels of property in this area, and on the other side of the quays, with a view to developing a central bus station on both sides of the Liffey, possibly inter-connecting with an extension of the DART eventually. This was to become the hub of communications for the city and county of Dublin.  However, because of a very speedy decision which could not have been properly considered, and the waving aside of all their years of planning, CIE have had to abandon their plans for the development of a central bus station in the heart of the city.  It is wrong that a decision could be taken so quickly and lightly and, obviously, without any due regard to the future needs of the travelling public.  However, it will be worse if CIE are penalised for accumulating that property over the years.  I should like the Taoiseach to tell us how much money CIE have spent over the years in acquiring property in the Temple Bar and Bachelors Walk areas.  I should like to know in today's money terms how much they spent.  I should like to know what value <Col N="338" /> that property will have following the enactment of this Bill.  By how much will the value of that property increase by virtue of the enactment of this Bill and the relevant Chapter of the Finance Act?</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to know if compensation will be paid to CIE.  This is a very important issue.  At Question Time today a series of questions on employment were put down to the Taoiseach, one of which related to the role of the State sector in employment creation. That specific question arose from a high profile meeting the Taoiseach had with the heads of semi-State bodies on their employment potential.  The reality is that the State sector have been clobbered and banged on the head by the Government many times.  Any time they have shown initiative which has resulted in profits they were clobbered.  There is, for example, the case of RTE who, because they were successful and transformed losses which they incurred in 1982 when I became Minister, into profits, were clobbered and restricted.  We now have a situation where CIE, who prudently acquired properties over the years and then sublet them pending the acquisition of the full parcel of land, have been robbed of that property.  It will be a shame if they are not fully compensated, by which I mean not just given back with interest the money which they expended in acquiring the properties but part of the profits which will arise out of the revaluation of the properties upwards following the enactment of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The dereliction and the rundown state of Dublin city centre has irritated, aggravated and alienated many Dubliners for a long time.  The area covered by the Bill is undoubtedly in need of some refurbishment but it is a long way from being the worst part of the city centre.  Indeed, the area west of this site up along James's Street and Bow Lane approaching the far side of Guinness's and the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham is in a state of dire dereliction mainly because Dublin Corporation have postponed, deferred and prolonged decisions.  On the other side of the Liffey the section of the city from Park Gate to East Wall and from the <Col N="339" /> Liffey to the North Circular Road is full of what I would call &ldquo;environmental obnoxia&rdquo;.  I regret to say that a great number of people in that part of the city are living in what can only be described as ghettoes.  In the main the individual flats and houses are kept very well but the environment outside is appalling.  It is a matter of regret that we do not have a Bill before the House which would give priority to the task of transforming those &ldquo;environmental obnoxia&rdquo; on the north inner city into acceptable habitats for people.</P>
    <P>There is an old saying that we are all products of our environment but we should all be ashamed of the north inner city.  Within a half or three quarters of a mile of the Custom House there are environmental standards which are unacceptable. It is not fair or right to ask people to live in such conditions any longer.  Yet no priority has been granted to the renewal of the north inner city; in fact during the past four years the Government have deferred and delayed the refurbishment programme commenced in 1985 by the previous Government of which I was a member.</P>
    <P>This debate will not go on for very long as it has been curtailed and we will not have much time, if any, to discuss each section of the Bill.  I want therefore to go through the Bill very briefly and raise some questions on it.  In relation to Part II which will set up Temple Bar Renewal Limited, can the Taoiseach point to the precedent for the Taoiseach being the sole shareholder?  Why is it that the Minister for the Environment or Dublin Corporation will not be shareholders in the company?  Would the Taoiseach explain why it is necessary to set up two companies? Why are Temple Bar Renewal Limited going to be set up parallel to Temple Bar Properties Limited?  Why can there not be just one company?  Is there any significance in that?</P>
    <P>I would also like to know if it will be possible for the company to sell some of their properties and, if so, whose consent will be necessary.  Will it be possible for them to set up subsidiaries in which there <Col N="340" /> will be other shareholders?  What rights will these subsidiaries have and what control will this House have over those subsidiaries? Will it be possible for either of the companies which will be set up under this Bill to assign property or properties to subsidiary companies in which they themselves will only be a part shareholder? These are questions which should be teased out in great detail on Committee and Report Stages but because of the decision to guillotine the debate it will not be possible for the House to do so.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us should be welcomed without question by the House in that it adds to the momentum for the renewal of the inner city, but my enthusiasm for the Bill is tempered by the concerns I have already expressed, by a feeling that unnamed individuals may be the great beneficiaries &mdash; renewal of the inner city may take place in any event without the Bill &mdash; and by the fact that it is the Taoiseach of all people and not the Minister for the Environment who is introducing the Bill and it is the Taoiseach and not the Minister for the Environment who will be the shareholder.  I cannot recall any precedent in my time in this House for such personal intervention by the Taoiseach.  I would like him to explain when replying why it is that he can do nothing about unemployment and will not appoint a Minister for Employment and yet seems determined to do the job of the Minister for the Environment and of Dublin Corporation.  Because of these concerns and the decision to guillotine the debate, we in Fine Gael will oppose all Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the dynamic approach to the development of the Temple Bar area which is inherent in the Bill and the Labour Party will support the Bill in principle but it is scandalous that so little time has been allowed for the Committee Stage of the Bill and that we have to complete all Stages today. There is no time to put down properly drafted amendments which are desperately needed between the end of Second Stage and the commencement of <Col N="341" /> Committee Stage.  The amendments are so vital that we will have no choice but to oppose the final passage of the Bill in its present form.</P>
      <P>In a number of important respects this is a deeply flawed and very dangerous Bill.  It contains within it the genesis of a very substantial conflict of interest. Indeed, if the powers in the Bill were put into the wrong hands the seeds of corruption on a grand scale could be planted.  Apart from the issue of a conflict of interest and the potential for corruption which I intend to deal with in detail in a moment, there must be a serious question mark surrounding the constitutionality of the Bill.  Among other things, the Bill establishes a public company with a very loose structure and reporting relationship.  That public company will have wide and sweeping powers, including powers of compulsory purchase and the power to borrow and spend public money which is guaranteed to the tune of £25 million by the State. The structure of the company, its relationships and overall accountability are extremely ill-defined in this Bill to such an extent that we are moving down a dangerous road in passing this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the achievement of its objective, which is to retain the physical fabric of the area in question without substantial damage or extensive and costly refurbishment, unless something is done to ensure there is a proper mechanism of planning evaluation combined with a very explicit understanding of the application of the by-laws &mdash; they are still legally in force and most of these buildings would be closed down under them &mdash; and the implementation of the mechanisms to administer the Building Control Act which still do not exist, including adequate and specific provisions for fire certificates for buildings approved for artistic purposes set out in one of the Schedules, this Bill will simply not function.  I make a prediction that the builders who are invited or enticed into developing the Temple Bar area will walk a million miles away from various refurbishment programmes because the Minister for the Environment still has not <Col N="342" /> established the mechanism to administer the Building Control Act.  In the absence of a proper interpretation of the fire regulations of the building control regulations which we debated in this House so long ago &mdash; it is ten years since the Stardust tragedy I might add &mdash; no cautious or prudent property developer is going to invest in this area because of the unbelievable uncertainty that exists in the operation of that part of the city at present.  One cannot get a clear and concise timetable from Dublin Corporation's building by-law section as to when, if at all, they will grant building by-law approval to an application.</P>
    <P>The central issue thrown up by this legislation is the potential for corruption. What do I mean by that?  This Bill sets out to establish two companies.  Temple Bar Renewal Limited will act as the body which will decide what projects will attract a very generous range of incentives from the State.  The second company, Temple Bar Properties Limited will act as the development company for the area and will be putting up the projects to attract the incentives either directly on its own or in conjunction with other partners, as Deputy Mitchell referred to earlier.  Clearly these two companies must act at arms length from each other if the normal principles of democratic accountability are to be observed.  The same relationship must exist as between any planning authority and any private developer.</P>
    <P>What do we find in this Bill?  We find that the Taoiseach is arrogating to himself the sole shareholding of the development company and at the same time he will appoint all the directors of the overseeing company, in fact, the directors to both companies.  There is no time limit in relation to their appointment.  There is no process for their removal nor is there the normal provisos that would attach to the directors of any semi-State company in relation to political activity, standing for elections and so on which are on a standard file in the parliamentary draftsman's offices and which could be attached in the normal way.  We believe this is <Col N="343" /> wrong, fundamentally wrong for a number of reasons.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach would not dare bring in a Bill before this House which would allow, for example, the confederation of Irish Industry to appoint all the directors of the IDA or the petro-chemical industry to appoint the members of the Environmental Protection Agency. Nobody in this House would defend the notion that only property developers and speculators should be allowed to be members of local authorities in view of all the planning functions they must carry out but this is precisely what the Taoiseach is proposing in this Bill.  We do not know who will be appointed.  Temple Bar Renewal Limited, effectively owned and run by the Taoiseach, will have the power to decide that projects put up by the Taoiseach through Temple Bar Properties Limited will have access to the extraordinarily generous range of incentives. All of this is to be done in private and behind closed doors.  Copies of decisions made by Temple Bar Renewal Limited will be laid before the Oireachtas on a quarterly basis for information only but the implications of those decisions will not be spelled out.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has already indicated in this House that he is unlikely to be taking parliamentary questions about the activities of the companies.  We have had experience in the past at how adept the Taoiseach is at avoiding parliamentary questions which he does not wish to answer.  Indeed, his very absence from the House now during this very short debate is not out of line with his performance in these areas.  He is not a Taoiseach who likes to be asked questions by his own side and certainly not by Members of the Opposition.  Therefore, we are unlikely ever to be told with any clarity or certainty how much it is costing the taxpayer to support projects put up by the Taoiseach's company and approved by the Taoiseach's other company.</P>
    <P>It is pointless and wrong for the Taoiseach to argue that he will own those <Col N="344" /> companies in an <i>ex-officio</i> way.  The questions that this proposed arrangement raise are too numerous.  Why is the shareholding of Temple Bar Properties Limited not vested in the Minister for Finance or indeed in the Minister for the Environment as would be the normal procedure? Why is the board of Temple Bar Renewal Limited not appointed by the Government, as would be the normal procedure?  More fundamentally, why did the Taoiseach not propose an arms length nominating procedure for this board, the regulatory board, as applies in the case of An Bord Pleanála or the Environmental Protection Agency?  Why has the Taoiseach so blatantly and gratuitously chosen to construct a Bill which contains an obvious and dangerous conflict of interest between the developer and the regulator?  Why has he allowed that conflict of interest to reside in the middle of his own office?  At the time that this whole scheme was announced the Taoiseach made it clear that the chairman of Temple Bar Renewal Limited would be the Lord Mayor of Dublin on an <i>ex-officio</i> basis.  This has been dropped completely from the Bill without any explanation in the Taoiseach's speech.</P>
    <P>The Chairman of Temple Bar Renewal Limited will be whoever the Taoiseach chooses.  Could it be that the Taoiseach has now realised that there is unlikely to be a Fianna Fáil Lord Mayor of Dublin for the foreseeable future and that the greater likelihood is that there will be a chairperson who will be less than amenable to his will or that of his Department?</P>
    <P>There is a fundamentally important reason why all these questions deserve straight answers.  The Labour Party have already advised this House on the establishment of a number of companies hidden behind nominee shareholders and directors who appear to have been established principally for the purpose of taking advantage of the scheme of incentives outlined in the Finance Bill.  Clearly we do not have the resources to carry out a detailed investigation into the real ownership of these companies but what is particularly worrying is that they also appear to have been established prior to <Col N="345" /> the publication of the Finance Bill when nobody should have known about the incentives likely to be available.  I am perfectly willing, if the Taoiseach should so wish, to supply him with the limited information.  I have about these companies. What I want in return is a complete investigation of who the owners of these companies are, what are their intentions in relation to the Temple Bar area and the very large sums of taxpayers' money that will be invested directly and indirectly in this area.</P>
    <P>There is another very worrying feature to the Bill.  The area intended to be covered by the grants and incentives is far larger than any of the original studies and examinations of the Temple Bar considered to be necessary.  When we think of the Temple Bar area &mdash; indeed the original people who came forward with the proposals were of a similar mind &mdash; we tend to think of the Crown Alley area, and the streets immediately around it which are full of run down buildings of great character and charm, attracting young and old alike because of its bohemian atmosphere.  The tax incentives and grants envisaged in this legislation will extend to an area which stretches the whole length of Dame Street and includes a great many expensive and lucrative commercial enterprises that do not need the assistance of these tax incentive packages that will now fall into their lap, and, perhaps, constitute part of the windfall profits to which Deputy Mitchell referred.</P>
    <P>The grounds for approval outlined in the legislation are sufficiently flexible to enable a great many profitable businesses to move into the area.  It is perfectly possible, for example, to envisage the Temple Bar area becoming a mecca for the rock video industry in the future but it is equally possible to see it as a centre for solicitors' offices.  Whether either or both of these activities will ensure the survival of the left bank atmosphere of the area is open to question.  The essential point is that this Bill ought to be aimed at supporting enterprises which are not of themselves highly lucrative, but it is <Col N="346" /> not tightly drawn up in drafting terms to achieve that objective.</P>
    <P>We have already tried a similar experiment in this city, namely the Financial Services Centre.  Nobody can yet say that this has been a successful experiment because not enough time has elapsed to be able to judge the number of jobs and the spin-off impact.  There are already questions about the cost of that experiment. It is inexplicable, for example, that nobody appears to be able to calculate how much State investment there has already been and how much tax revenue has been foregone to attract the 600 or so jobs already located there.  The Taoiseach when replying might elucidate. Nobody has been able to quantify the benefits, if any, which have accrued to Ireland as a whole through the existence of the centre.  I say that as a person who supports the concept of the centre and was a member of the Government who set up the original Custom House Dock Development Authority.  We should be able to measure the effectiveness or otherwise of a venture into which so much taxpayers' money has been poured.  Above all, nobody has been able to measure the impact on the local community, including the proposed upheaval associated with the detenanting of people who are trying to build a community spirit against the odds in the vicinity of the Custom House Docks.</P>
    <P>If we cannot say that the experiment of the Financial Services Centre has been an unqualified financial success, we should at least be able to learn some lessons from it.  We must establish absolute transparency and accountability in relation to any new experiments.  The Taoiseach has been guilty of a serious error of judgment in bringing this Bill in its present form before the House because it completely fails the test of transparency.  It must be clear to Members who look at the Bill objectively that a foolish and dangerous structure is being established here.  Given the very large amounts of public money that could go astray, borrowings of up to £25 million plus tax foregone of a substantial amount, the lack of wisdom associated with this <Col N="347" /> project in its present form is all the more evident.</P>
    <P>It makes me wonder what is in the Taoiseach's mind and if the Progressive Democrats Ministers attend Cabinet any more.  With their alleged concern for probity, how did they allow the Bill to be drafted in this way?  Will they support a Bill which makes the Taoiseach not only the planning authority for the area and the principal developer but also gives him sole power to decide who should get access to the very large sums of public money involved?  If the Taoiseach does not wish to stand accused in this way, he should realise that he has left himself open to being suspect.</P>
    <P>The local elections allowed the people to give their verdict on planning impropriety in County Dublin.  Because the Taoiseach is suspect due to the lack of transparency in this Bill, he should take it back to the drawing board and ensure that it is redrafted to provided for a proper distance between the developer and the regulator, with full independence for the regulating company.  If he does not do so, he leaves himself open to the charge that this Bill has the potential to be a recipe for corruption and in time he will have to shoulder the blame.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to withdraw the Bill at this stage or else to proceed no further than Second Stage and to come back in the autumn with a substantially redrafted Bill.  It would in no way affect in real terms the operations of the Temple Bar Properties Limited or Temple Bar Renewal Limited as they are currently constructed.  There is ample time to get this Bill right and to avoid some of the serious charges contained in my contribution. The Government are failing to address themselves to this issue in the aftermath of a local election when the Fianna Fáil chairman of Dublin County Council was swept out of office because of an alleged perception by many people that things were not right in Dublin County Council in relation to planning decisions, rezonings, material contraventions and the relationships <Col N="348" /> between elected politicians and property developers.</P>
    <P>It is a most unwise political decision of a Government who have suffered such a defeat at local level to proceed beyond Second Stage with this Bill.  I would urge the Minister to withdraw it and to invite us to make suggestions.  There are many ways in which this Bill could be put right through consultation between Members of this House and the Government.  In its present form it is seriously flawed and I will have no hesitation in voting against it at the appropriate time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mixed feelings about the Bill before us.  I share the concerns of previous speakers about potential problems.  As elected public representatives we should be very careful that any legislation passed by this House is good legislation and that we do not give authority or power to groups, companies or individuals which is so great that it could possibly be misdirected and ultimately used in an incorrect or corrupt manner.  Of course we should be concerned that this Bill is to be subject to a guillotine.  We, as public representatives should be allowed to make a full input with a view to strengthening the Bill but because of the guillotine, we will miss out on the possibility of amending some important provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite these concerns, I hope everything will go well for the development. Unlike the two previous speakers, I wear two hats, one as a member of Dublin Corporation and one as a Deputy.  I am highly conscious of Dublin Corporation's marvellous and innovative plans and the extremely dedicated staff in the planning department who make an incredible contribution and who were the prime movers in getting the Government to address the problems of decay in Dublin's inner city. I congratulate Dublin City Council, the managers and the planners who collectively have been working tirelessly over the past six years to bring about in the mind of Government and of the public generally an awareness of the great treasures in the heart of our city and to get something done to retain what is best <Col N="349" /> in the inner city core, to try to develop to the utmost all those important buildings, communities, quays and streetscapes, retain them for the benefit of future generations and beautify and enhance them in the interest of tourism which has rightly been targeted as an area of potential employment.  I hope everything will go well and that within the Temple Bar area generations to come will see the beauty of Dublin, its history and its antiquity retained for their benefit.</P>
    <P>When Dublin Corporation planners set about producing their document on the area they restricted themselves specifically to a zone which they classified as the Temple Bar area.  They did remarkable work on that project and geared themselves specifically to a more limited area than that covered by the legislation here. Questions are being raised about why the Taoiseach extended the area from that earmarked by Dublin Corporation to a much wider area, possibly greater in extent by at least the same total area, twice the size of that originally planned. I am of mixed opinion as to why this was done.  One of my immediate problems is that possibly the original plan did not go far enough.  It stops now sandwiched between Westmoreland Street and Fishamble Street.</P>
    <P>There are other interests out there in the community who are concerned about Dublin's inner city core, not least of whom are the South Inner City Community Development Association who went to tremendous ends to produce documentation in favour of an environmental improvement scheme with a commitment from Government similar to that of the Liberties, and enhance the area because therein is the living core of Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the South Inner City Community Development Association represent basically an area to the west of what the Taoiseach has earmarked for substantial grant assistance and development in the Temple Bar area. In a sense the important element in the plan, which is to attract people back to live in the inner core, is very positive and worthy of support, but it recognises that <Col N="350" /> the Temple Bar area has been denuded of residents and is in need of this incentive to get people to come and live in it again, whereas the Liberties contains people. There are living communities in the Liberties area where there is tremendous potential.  If similar thinking and plans are set afoot with incentives to developers, there is great potential for job creation so sadly and badly needed. There is great potential for environmental improvement with a view to encouraging more and more tourists to visit the area.</P>
    <P>The Temple Bar area as regarded by Dublin Corporation is the Temple Bar area strictly speaking.  The present legislation is going to cover an area bigger than that.  I wish it well and hope it works. However, I wonder if it could be argued that there are areas to the west of Fishamble Street that are equally in need of some financial input.  Let me point out that the Viking Village in the crypt of St. Audoen's is not included in the present area.  St. Catherine's Church in Thomas Street and other historical landmarks, buildings in a state of incredible decay, are seriously in need of a central Government support to assist, in conjunction with the local authority, in saving them. The ruin of St. Nicholas Within at Christchurch Place unfortunately falls outside the zone.  St. Luke's Without nearby unfortunately has been vandalised and is almost totally in ruins, to join St. Nicholas Within.  The Iveagh Markets and Werburgh Street Church are just across the road from the area earmarked by this legislation.  There is a very depressed community and economic decay in large portions of the area west of this line.</P>
    <P>While there are tremendous incentives and benefits for the leaseholders at the moment, the numbers of residents are limited &mdash; let us be honest, in comparison to the Liberties they are insignificant. The incentives will be tremendously important to the leaseholders of the properties, mainly CIE, but is it enough that the area should be so earmarked with <Col N="351" /> incentives for both tourism and employment while alongside it is all this dereliction and decay in what is possibly of equal importance in the historical context, that which lies to the west of Fishamble Street?</P>
    <P>The South Inner City Community Development Association put tremendous effort into the publication of their plans for the environmental improvement of their community.  EC money was being sought.  Unfortunately, nothing has gone their way.  I am questioning whether this is the way forward in planning, targeting just a particular area and everything alongside it is neglected or allowed to deteriorate further.  If we are interested in the tourist element of the Temple Bar area, we must remember that tourists are equally attracted to the west, to Guinness's hop store for example.  A quarter of a million tourists annually visits the Liberties and 80,000 of them visit Guinness's hop store.  Will this legislation stymie them?  Will they think the Temple Bar is where you stop and go no further because you are meeting areas of massive dereliction, urban decay and poverty?  That is not a good approach to the planning of the city.</P>
    <P>I started by sharing the concerns of previous speakers and I call a spade a spade.  Presumably the argument being put forward is that if the Taoiseach is the man in the driver's seat and given the lack of democratic controls, somehow or other companies would be formed and huge killings made and somebody would get terribly wealthy as a result.  I hope that never happens.  It would be criminal. I live in hope that the Taoiseach's intentions are in the best interests of the city, but I want to mention the lack of democratic control.  We must be careful about and conscious of the possibility of people making a killing through property values being enhanced or out of the incentives that are available, but we are the more conscious of it on this occasion because of the structure of the companies.  It is fair to say that we in The Workers' Party are not at all happy about the lack of democratic input particularly by the City <Col N="352" /> Council and their public representatives. I say from memory that the Bill provides that the Taoiseach will nominate the boards of Temple Bar Properties Limited and Temple Bar Renewal Limited.</P>
    <P>Given that it is such an important area within an important city and given that there are people who go to the trouble of being elected through the democratic process, it is scandalous when one looks at the list of board members that, for example, on the board of Temple Bar Properties Limited there is not one single elected public representative and there is only one representative from Dublin Corporation in a planning capacity &mdash; he is a bureaucrat and a member of the staff of Dublin Corporation.  Somebody mentioned the Lord Mayor, but he is not a member of that board, and probably will not be in the future.</P>
    <P>When the board of Temple Bar Renewal Limited was established the Lord Mayor at that time, Alderman Seán Haughey, was represented on it. However, there is no guarantee that future lord mayors will sit on that board. I would not have been very impressed by the presence of lord mayors on these boards because they are usually put there in an honorary capacity.  Their activities on a day to day basis are so demanding that for them to play their role on such boards would be asking a bit much.</P>
    <P>I believe very strongly that, while at present there are two officials of Dublin Corporation on the board of Temple Bar Renewal Limited, who may or may not be on the board after the Taoiseach has made his nominations, there are no elected public representatives on that board.  It is important that the concerns expressed about how things might go wrong be lessened by the Taoiseach giving us a commitment today that the appointment of members of these boards will be more democratic in the future.</P>
    <P>Three members of the Temple Bar Development Council &mdash; I have much respect for that council who have done tremendous work &mdash; are represented on the board of Temple Bar Renewal Limited, and rightly so, but they represent the vested interests of the lease holders, <Col N="353" /> the property owners or the residents within the Temple Bar area.</P>
    <P>I have studied some of the documentation and submissions they have made to the Taoiseach but while, in the main, they are excellent, there is one major fault in a section of one of their submissions.  I will highlight this because it brings me back to the need for a role for the city council where public representatives, planners and officials of the Dublin Corporation should be sitting on these boards.  In their submission Temple Bar Development Council called for two new car parks to be constructed &mdash; one at the ESB site identified in the corporation action plan and the second to the west of Parliament Street.  Obviously as a result of their lobbying and their participation on the board of Temple Bar Renewal Limited, they had the Minister for Finance include, for incentive purposes, the building of multi-storey car parks. Section 55 (1) (a), which deals with Temple Bar reliefs, states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;multi-storey car-park&rdquo; means a building or structure consisting of three or more storeys wholly or mainly in use for the purpose of providing, for members of the public generally without preference for any particular class of person, upon payment of an appropriate charge, parking for mechanically propelled vehicles;</P>
    <P>As a city councillor, I would say that the council, in general, would not be supportive of two multi-storey car parks in excess of three storeys in the Temple Bar area.  I am highlighting this aspect because &mdash; this is where democracy and the democratic structures are lacking &mdash; it would not be the general consensus of Dublin Corporation to allow two multi-storey car parks in the Temple Bar area. Yet, the influence the Temple Bar Development Council have on the Taoiseach is such that he is willing to grant these incentives.  I will not labour the point.</P>
    <P>It is very disturbing that they are not democratically structured boards but when one looks at the structure of the Financial Services Centre, the Custom <Col N="354" /> House Docks site, one sees that this is happening more and more.  Central Government can make decisions for large tracts of land and allocate to other boards and committees functions that had normally been the function of the City Council and Dublin Corporation, with all sorts of financial ramifications for rates in the city.  We have the Temple Bar area, the Financial Services Centre and the other areas, referred to earlier, which carry tax breaks and rates reliefs which combined would constitute a huge potential source of income from commercial rates to the city.  The city is now being developed by all these little committees for their own benefit.</P>
    <P>Regarding the prospects for jobs and tourism, I would ask the Taoiseach to look at the sites of major importance in the Liberties and to ask members who represent tourist interests &mdash; for example, Mr. McNulty of Bord Fáilte is on the board of Temple Bar Renewal Limited &mdash; to integrate the tourist trail network through the Temple Bar area and even extend it, because if any money accrues from the potential success of Temple Bar Renewal Limited, rather than that money going back into the Exchequer, it should be used to benefit the adjoining districts which, if not upgraded economically, socially and environmentally will not attract tourists in the near future.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask questions about the duration of the terms of office of these boards.  Besides the fact that the Taoiseach would nominate them, I could not find in the Bill any reference to how long their terms of office would be.  Could we be faced in the future with the Taoiseach hiring and firing board members on a week to week, month to month, year to year basis?  I would like clarification on how it is proposed these boards will operate. Will their appointment be for an indefinite period?  Is there a time schedule? At some stage it might be argued that the boards could be phased out of existence and that everything would revert back to the local authority.  I cannot come to terms with the open-ended nature, not so much in terms of <Col N="355" /> the salaries of the boards but as a State owned company, and I would like to know what is the duration of the term of office of the officers elected.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few comments about the area.  I am deeply committed to the prospect of successfully improving the area.  As a Dublinman, it is an area I frequent.  Following our local election victory, I went there to see many people, young people in the main, who were enjoying themselves in the open.  There is a great air of festivity and a great sense of joy about the place.  The variety of middle price restaurants is a massive attraction, anything from a Cajun to a traditional Irish restaurant is there.  I had a pizza in &ldquo;Fat Freddie's&rdquo; which was very nice and I encourage the Minister to try it.</P>
    <P>I was also conscious &mdash; I made this point before &mdash; that there is a history of exploitation of young, cheap labour.  I hope as the area develops, as controls are brought in and as unions organise the younger members of the workforce, that exploitation will cease.  It would be sad to think that after all the financial incentives, including the commitment of European money to the development of the area, some of it would be built on the exploitation of young labour.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn mentioned by-laws and planning.  I am sad to have to tell the House that I had to report a restaurant in the area to the corporation's fire officers.  I went to this restaurant, which shall remain nameless, and I was directed to the basement from which there would be no escape in the event of fire, the kitchens were on the ground floor above them.  I hope the boards of these companies will not lower the traditional high standards of Dublin Corporation's fire officers and that regulations will remain in force to protect life and limb, not just in relation to those working in restaurants and other premises but for the people who visit for all sorts of reasons.</P>
    <P>At city council level we are very conscious of the fine buildings in our city. Even though some of them are listed <Col N="356" /> it did not make much difference if the property owner did not have the money to repair a decaying building.  We certainly know that in the past listing a building did not mean it will survive; I argued very strongly that there should be incentives to the owners of important buildings to retain, maintain and upgrade their fabric.  I am overjoyed that there are incentives for people who decide to move from the outer to the inner suburbs.  We are trying to attract such people to the inner city and it is important that there are incentives.  Their faith in living in inner city Dublin should be rewarded by way of assistance for refurbishment of property.  I have had experience of living in two old houses and I know it is extremely expensive to try to maintain them in a semblance of their original state.  When dealing with property which was built 100 years ago it is even more costly to maintain it.</P>
    <P>I note the substantial powers to make or even withhold incentives.  I am not satisfied that the structure of the board is sufficiently democratic to be above suspicion or that they will avoid rows in the future.  I can see all sorts of problems, given the structure of the committee. Temple Bar Renewal Limited and Temple Bar Properties Limited have the power to accept, reject and make recommendations. I am afraid that there will be rows in the future about conflict of interest or applicants for incentives being badly treated and allegations of political skulduggery.  Perhaps the Minister will ask the Taoiseach to make the structure more democratic.</P>
    <P>I have tabled an amendment, am I allowed to speak on it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBarrett" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. M. Barrett) Acting Chairman (Mr. M. Barrett)">

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the question of multi-storey car parks.  The Minister is wrong in allowing incentives to developers to build three storey &mdash; and bigger &mdash; car parks.  The scale of the multi-storey car parks will be completely out of proportion.  The area does not need <Col N="357" /> multi-storey car parks, they are counter to the consensus of Dublin Corporation in relation to development.  We need more facilities for people living in the inner city, such as pedestrianised areas, where people can get around on bicycles. If this area is to have theatres, art galleries, restaurants, public houses, and so on, we should not encourage people to bring their cars.  This is an ideal area to argue in favour of a proper public service transportation system coupled with a highly efficient taxi service.</P>
      <P>The multi-storey car parks would have a negative effect on the area.  Like SICCDA, who have identified areas in which they feel car parks should be developed, I see no reason for them not being developed within those districts mentioned by SICCDA near Thomas Street.  We do not want cars in the immediate Temple Bar area and opening multi-storey car parks will merely attract more cars to the area.  Perhaps the Minister will consider my proposal in regard to public transport and taxis because we should encourage people who go out to enjoy themselves at night and who will drink to be safe.  This will be the night life district of Dublin and drinking invariably is part and parcel of night life. The last thing I should like to see is multi-storey car parks for people who have been enjoying themselves all night and who would then get into a car over which they did not have proper control.  I would be glad if the Government could see their way to developing a link between Heuston Station and Connolly Station, with an underground station in the Temple Bar area.  It has been mentioned on previous occasions by Dublin Corporation that it should be possible to build an underground station in the Temple Bar area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving aside the notion of people drinking late at night, it is important to point out that there would not be great enthusiasm for a multi-storey car park in the area, even on the part of the daily commuting traveller.  If a car park was built it would act like a magnet and would suck motor cars into the area.  It would completely undo the stated aims of the <Col N="358" /> people in the Temple Bar area who say they do not want parking meters on the streets, they want the streets pedestrianised and want to see the development of all the derelict sites at present used as car parks.  I would ask that consideration be given to this matter.</P>
    <P>I would like some answers to the questions I have raised.  I am sorry the Bill has been guillotined because there are areas I would like to have teased out but I did not have the time.  I share some of the concerns expressed already but hope they are unfounded.  I would like to see more democratic structures in this regard and a greater role for Dublin Corporation and the elected public representatives.  I wish the Temple Bar area well and hope there will be a knock-on effect for the area to the west, around the Liberties.  I am living in hope that the Taoiseach does not let us down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome this legislation.  The fact that the Taoiseach came into the House today to deliver the Second Stage speech and that he is taking an active interest and participating directly in this legislation is a measure of the important focus the Government are placing on renewing the city.  It would be a shame if one was to pour cold water on a proposal such as this.  For many years we have harked back to our past and have done everything possible to try to develop the old atmosphere of the city.  Perhaps conflicting with unsavoury development, high density traffic, multiplicity of cars and choking air in the city, this move should be welcomed by everyone.  It should be seen as a move forward in an area of the city that will act as a catalyst to the development of other areas.  It is quite impossible to have an all-embracing locality that would include huge areas as has been referred to by previous speakers, but at least this is a start and it is to be welcomed.  There should be no conflict between our major local authority, Dublin Corporation, and a renewal group as proposed.  I would see it as a synergy &mdash; both bodies acting in tandem would do nothing but good.  In fact &mdash; I have referred to this matter before and I make <Col N="359" /> no apology for doing so again &mdash; the example of true bureaucratic vandalism in this city lies very close to the Temple Bar area.  I refer to the development at Wood Quay site and the building of the civic offices there.  That development which was set in train by Dublin Corporation many years ago had a snowball, knock-on effect, much to the shame of the city.</P>
      <P>A genuine attempt is being made here to revitalise a very ancient part of the city.  It is ironic that it is directly beside the Wood Quay site, the development of which many of us in Dublin Corporation felt at the time was a mistake.  It stands as a testament to very bad planning and a serious error of judgment.  Senior officials on Dublin Corporation will readily admit that it was a mistake.  It is no harm to refer to that again because it is from our mistakes we learn.</P>
      <P>One matter that has not been referred to in previous contributions and is particularly important is that this area of Dublin is very rich in archaeological treasure. It is important that we approach progress by protecting our heritage.  Any development in the Temple Bar region affords us an ideal opportunity to take cognisance of archaeological surveys that would take place prior to the development. Archaeological examination has become very sophisticated.  Archaeologists are on hand and ready to move in very quickly before developers start work, to see if there are treasures or parts of the city that can be preserved.  A poignant example is Ushers Island where a complete Norman harbour was found recently.  A development was taking place there and the developer encouraged archaeologists to survey the site. Fortunately they discovered a most interesting, unique, complete Norman harbour in the locality and some important archaeolgoical treasures were found on the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to assume that the region we are talking about is cluttered with important treasures of our past, and these should be sought and housed within a museum in the Temple <Col N="360" /> Bar region.  A museum of this kind would be a tremendous tourist attraction and would be a living example of Viking, Norman and Medieval times, right up to the present.  It would be a huge tourist attraction in the region.</P>
    <P>The last speaker referred in eloquent fashion to the invasion of motor cars in the locality.  I am totally opposed to this. I feel a sense of disquiet in relation to multi-storey car parks.  Perhaps their presence is an admission of defeat in coping with a problem that is now strangling the city to death.  Everyone will realise that over the past year or so the traffic in Dublin has become quite chaotic.  It has been building up over the years.  Ten or 12 years ago I raised this question in Dublin Corporation as a serious matter, and it has now gathered momentum.  We have to face up to this very quickly, otherwise we will have a city like Athens or Cairo where there is constant blowing of car horns in what are dusty, noisy, polluted cities and we could not even contemplate revitalising an area like Temple Bar.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to consider building a station at Temple Bar.  I concur with the suggestion that we should examine the possibility of such a project in that area. It would be approporiate to start a pilot scheme in light transport around the periphery of that locale.  People speak about light rail and so on, and although such an operation would be very costly it might be possible to consider some system of light rail for within the inner city on a pilot basis &mdash; to find out how it works. Light rail systems are now available practically off the shelf.  Continental firms such as Siemens and large multinational transportation firms offer packages on light rail systems.  The development of the Temple Bar area would provide an ideal opportunity to experiment with such a scheme.  We would be in trouble if we considered the redevelopment of an area without feeding it with the right transport.  Dublin people, Irish people in general and visitors here do not tend to be taxi-minded for one reason or another. Very often taxis spend a lot of time in the traffic jams and because of that they are <Col N="361" /> more costly.  Perhaps the Department of the Environment could engage in a publicity scheme to encourage the use of reasonably priced taxis and could provide incentives for people to avail of car pooling and the sharing of motor cars to feed the inner city.</P>
    <P>It is important to try to struggle against over use of motor cars in this development concept.  We have become very lazy in the use of the motor car.  We virtually want to drive into town and park outside a premises rather than as happens on the Continent and in many cities, be prepared to park outside the city and come in by a rapid system of public transport. People would guarantee to find a parking place on the periphery of the city.  The problem can be tackled and it has to be tackled.  Up to a year ago there was appalling pollution in the city's air.  Pollution was affecting the health of the elderly and young to an extent that could be quantified and measured medically.  That has gone.  Now we have a traffic problem, which will be a huge blight on the Temple Bar area and other areas to be developed unless the problem is tackled.  Why not take the incentive now and create &ldquo;pink&rdquo; zones in the city into which motorcars are just not allowed?  We have to stand up to the pressure groups and the vested interests who will say that there is no alternative, that people are entitled to use their motorcars and so on.  People are not entitled to use their motorcars if that means affecting the health and safety of many others.  The content of lead in the air in my constituency, around the Pearse Steet area, and, indeed, in the Temple Bar area, is very high and results from exhaust fumes, despite the programme for the use of unleaded petrol.  They are stressful areas in which to live in Dublin. Dublin is under siege from the uncontrolled use of the motorcar.  In the Taoiseach's summary I should like him to take cognisance of the fact that something has to be done about that problem urgently and that it could be worked alongside the Temple Bar experiment.</P>
    <P>Nothing would please me more than to have the dereliction of the Temple Bar area remedied.  The potential in the <Col N="362" /> development is vast.  If the development gets under way very quickly, is an efficient mechanism and receives full local authority co-operation, then it will obviously become an example for other areas.  Competition being as it is, people will rapidly recognise the Temple Bar development as working and will say that they have to do something about their own area.  There is no reason that other areas of the city cannot also be renewed, as was the spirit of the legislation on urban areas renewal.</P>
    <P>On the more positive side, Dublin Corporation are to be congratulated on some of the highly successful pedestrian schemes operating in the city.  Dublin looks much better than it did a few years ago.  I do not wish to drift back to the subject of talking motorcars, but they present the one inherent danger that will destroy the city's character.  The River Liffey is an ideal waterway flowing right through the city and opening out into a rapidly developing port.  From the point of view of the Temple Bar area, it would be practical to try to use the river for boat trips, including trips at night, which have proved to be a highly successful operation in other cities such as London.  In that way Dublin would take on a whole new perspective and proper development of the quay area would be encouraged.</P>
    <P>There has been some talk about revelry and enjoyment within the area, and that is as it should be.  However, Temple Bar should also be an area of cultural development.  Whilst I am certainly no killjoy in my attitude towards young people enjoying themselves, the consumption of alcohol and so on, I have nonetheless become apalled in recent months &mdash; and I am quite sure that the House will agree with me on this &mdash; by a seemingly uncontrolled blitz of young people drinking on the streets outside public houses in Dublin.  That has got out of all proportion, and it sets a very bad example to young children.  The Rod Stewart concert in Ballsbridge the other evening provided a poignant example of that.  It went well beyond the point of acceptability. Hundreds of young people were out drinking on the streets and were trying to <Col N="363" /> cross the roads against the traffic flow. Children, and I speak of very young toddlers, were looking on with absolute amazement.  The behaviour was irresponsible in the extreme and was breaking the law as well.  Publicans should be very careful when they allow uncontrolled drinking on the streets.  If such behaviour carried on into the Temple Bar area it could destroy the whole purpose of the development.  There has to be a controlled attitude.</P>
    <P>Temple Bar will be an area of developed culture, theatre and the arts, but we do not want the development of uncontrolled consumption of alcohol with its consequential effects of vandalism and sometimes, regrettably, drug pushing and so on.  As I said, I am not a killjoy, but Ireland has reached the stage at which it has to square up to the massive problem facing the young population through the abuse of alcohol.  It is better that that is said and spoken about rather than to take an ambivalent attitude to uncontrolled drinking and breaking of the law by people who literally run around the streets and lie down on the streets with glasses and cans of beer in their hand.  I am completely opposed to that, but that is not to say that I do not encourage the development of the area with proper restaurants and licensing laws being strictly enforced.  We all want the development to succeed.</P>
    <P>I share the Taoiseach's confidence as shown in his opening address.  He went into a fair amount of detail.  One could gather that there is this sense of urgency to get on with the development.  We have fine examples of success in Dublin at present.  The Government Buildings restoration is a magnificent example of what can be done.  There are other buildings crying out for that type of development at present.</P>
    <P>Here we are dealing with the old part of Dublin where literally hundreds of different trades took place during the 16th and 17th centuries and they are now to be highlighted again.  This is a tremendous focal point for Dublin and it is significant that it is happening in the year of <Col N="364" /> culture for the city when Dublin is the focus of European culture.  It is an area that can be highlighted for tourism and can be sold abroad.  It will give our young people an opportunity to participate in the development of the city.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, it is ironic that alongside this we were developing the civic offices.  I say, tongue-in-cheek because it might be a non-starter anyway, that with European funding and the fact that the European Structural Funds were supportive of maintaining Wood Quay as a Viking site at the time, it might not be hugely expensive to remove those buildings. I say that tongue-in-cheek because I know people would jump up immediately and say that is outlandish, but we are talking about future generations.  Could you imagine how Dublin would look without those buildings, but with the development of the Wood Quay site as a park alongside Temple Bar, with Christchurch and the whole area properly excavated? We would have a unique city.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the Bill.  I want the area archaeologically surveyed and well protected.  I do not want motor car intrusion into the city.  I pledge my support for the Bill.  I hope it will be a dream success for the city that is so much needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Brady's contribution.  I note with particular interest his desire not to have an intrusion of the motor car into that area.  He was gracious enough to acknowledge the progress that Dublin Corporation made in giving access to pedestrians in many areas of the city &mdash; Henry Street, Grafton Street, South William Street, Duke Street and many other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the city is to remain economically viable some accommodation must be given to the short term motorist who wants to come in and support the economic viability of the city.  I see no problem providing short term car parking facilities for people who wish to shop in the city or to do business in the Temple Bar area. That is essential for the economic future of the city.  It must be remembered that <Col N="365" /> the motorist is being given a choice now. There are excellent roads now being built, for example, the Southern Cross and the Western by-pass, and new businesses will be established along these roads, drawing business from the city unless we provide some car parking facilities in the city.  I would be in favour of multi-storey car parks and pedestrianisation as far as possible, to get cars off the streets.  I think that is the ugliest aspect of Dublin &mdash; seeing so many cars parked on our streets.</P>
    <P>To get back to the Bill, for a long time, CIE have been purchasing parcels of land in the Temple Bar area on both sides of the river for a central bus station.  A central bus station has many merits.  To make this central bus station viable, CIE needed a financial partner and, unfortunately, such a partner was not forthcoming. In the draft development plan which Dublin Corporation are now preparing, we request that CIE move elsewhere so that land in Temple Bar could be developed for the benefit of the city.</P>
    <P>I must say that while the actions of CIE did result in some dereliction, the company deserve credit for leasing the property they bought at very low rates to young entrepreneurs and so allowing young business people to completely change life in the Temple Bar area.  It has produced a bohemian type of centre city, very much like the Parisian Left Bank.  A lot of credit has to be given to CIE and to these young people.  I want to see that progress continuing.  It is very important that whatever development takes place in the proposed Temple Bar area, it will provide the kind of development that exists there at present.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to section 3 which provides that, notwithstanding any provision of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, the Taoiseach shall appoint the directors of Temple Bar Renewal Limited. We see the same statement in section 10: &ldquo;Notwithstanding any provision of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, the Taoiseach, through his nominees, shall be the sole shareholder of Temple Bar Properties Limited.&rdquo;  We are told in the memorandum that we have to <Col N="366" /> read these sections in conjunction with Chapter VII of the Finance Act, 1991, which provides the incentive for the Temple Bar area.  I spoke on Committee Stage on that section of the Finance Bill and was given an assurance by the Minister for Finance that the Lord Mayor of Dublin would be chairman of Temple Bar Renewal Limited.  We see nothing about that in this Bill, so I would like the Minister to guarantee that that is the Government's position, that they still hold to the definite statement made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have drawn up an action plan for the Temple Bar area. There are pedestrianised areas in that development plan.  I would like to know what the role of Dublin Corporation is in the development proposed in the Temple Bar Renewal and Development Bill.  It is important that Dublin Corporation would have a function and that any development that takes place there would have the approval of the planning department of Dublin Corporation.  I feel that would eliminate the possibility of abuses that have been mentioned in the House this evening.</P>
    <P>I have always welcomed the proposal to develop the Temple Bar area.  I support this Bill in principle but there are many questions that have to be answered. I will not take up the time of the House now because I know Deputy MacGiolla wishes to say a few words and there are a number of amendments being put down by my colleague, Deputy Jim Mitchell, on Committee Stage, which will take place shortly.  In view of that, I will give way to Deputy Mac Giolla.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I want to make is in regard to the extremely short time that has been given to debate this Bill.  It is unbelievable that a guillotine should be imposed on a Bill of this nature.  We have two and a half hours to take all Stages of a Bill of such importance for the city of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle just made the point that CIE have been much maligned for their entry into the Temple Bar area with the <Col N="367" /> intention of building a central bus station. There was no objection when they moved in because no thought was given to the Temple Bar area which was generally rundown and which was moving gradually into decay.  When CIE gradually bought over properties they implemented a very enlightened policy, whereas other developers who purchased properties in the city then ensured that they would gradually fall into dereliction and if sites were not becoming derelict fast enough, they removed slates from the roofs and allowed buildings to decay so that they could be knocked down and the whole area could be redeveloped.</P>
    <P>In contrast to that, CIE leased out properties at cheap rent and gradually the area awoke and was automatically renewed.  Once the area was developed through the enlightened policy of CIE and grew in importance with young people moving in, and all sorts of small shops and so on developing in the area, everyone began to attack CIE and to say that we must get them out of the area. On the corporation we also said that they should find another site for the central bus station.  CIE need a central bus station. I still believe in the CIE policy of a rapid rail system to Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown, to the youth population. There should be a small six mile underground system from a central bus station to the various CIE stations.  That is the best policy, but this Government shot it down, simply saying that it would cost too much, while they have probably spent 50 per cent more on roads in the meantime.  CIE gave new life to the area in the beginning and they should get credit for that.  I do not see anything in the Bill to indicate that they will be compensated by the Government.  I would not be surprised if the Government just took it over leaving CIE at a loss.</P>
    <P>My party and I totally support the idea of developing the Temple Bar area which will be of vital importance to the city but this Bill has been brought in now because, as the explanatory memorandum says:</P>
    <P>The Bill contains provisions for the <Col N="368" /> implementation of the renewal and development of the Temple Bar area. This is a Government flagship project for Dublin's year as European City of Culture in 1991.</P>
    <P>Because this is a flagship project we must rush it through before the Dáil goes into recess and so that the Taoiseach can stand up for his flagship project for the year of culture, 1991.  That is no way to develop an area of this vital importance for the city of Dublin.  The Taoiseach seems to want to take control of the whole city in a Ceausescu-like manner, first building the Custom House Docks and now renewing the Temple Bar area.  What area will he take over next for renewal? The corporation have been thrown out. We have just had a local election to elect a new city council and when they meet on Monday morning they will discover that this is another area of the city in which they have no remit, a no-go area for Dublin Corporation.  They are losing control of the whole city to the Taoiseach and to central Government when we were supposed to be getting more control in local government.  The Minister for the Environment wants to run the city in his own way but suddenly the Taoiseach has taken over and has decided to run it his way.  If this is to be the procedure in the city the new members elected to Dublin City Council will have their eyes opened when they see what they are up against. They will see that they are wasting their time on the city council, as the Taoiseach decides to grab one piece after another to implement his plans.  The Taoiseach will decide whether or not there will be multi-storey car parks and the city council will have no say as to what will be developed in the Temple Bar area.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have made detailed plans for the Temple Bar area as Deputy Eric Byrne outlined to the House.  They have already commenced a programme of pedestrianisation in the Temple Bar area.  The corporation should be consulted on this Bill and members of the city council should have an opportunity to discuss the Bill and make representations to the Taoiseach and other <Col N="369" /> Deputies as to what they think before this Bill is rushed through the House prior to the first meeting of the new city council. The manner in which this Government and the Taoiseach are trying to bulldoze their way across the city is outrageous. The Taoiseach seems to want to leave some sort of monument to himself when he moves off stage, like Ceausescu in Romania, to leave some kind of city landmarks with the words &ldquo;Charles J. Haughey was the man who thought of this, ran this or organised that&rdquo;.  This issue concerns the people of the city.  The members of the city council should have a detailed say in what happens and on the Bill.  If the people of the city do not want a multi-storey car park there, it will not be built.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gerard Brady pointed out that Dublin Corporation made a right mess of the Fishamble Street area, and I agree with him.  I came on to the city council in 1979 in the middle of the big agitation in relation to that area.  A bad decision was made by the architects as well as by everybody else, in designing such an enormous bunker to be built right beside Christchurch Cathedral.  Deputy Brady seems to indicate that it was just as well that the Taoiseach was taking this over seeing that Dublin Corporation would make such a mess of the decision.  That is an outrageous comment.  There is a new city council there now with new ideas.  They will be putting their ideas to the Temple Bar Council.  There is no guarantee here that the Lord Mayor will have any say in this, but we on Dublin City Council will attempt to ensure that at least the Lord Mayor is there and that there will be other representatives on the council to see that things are done in accordance with what the citizens require.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the contribution of the Opposition spokespersons and Deputies for almost three hours and I am shocked at the negative attitude prevailing.  Deputy Mac Giolla's contribution was typical.  A good idea, a positive approach, a renewal <Col N="370" /> of a particularly traditional environmental area in the city, a special area in the city, is being objected to, and Deputies are trying to impede its development. When the State, through the Government, through the tremendous leadership of the Taoiseach and this party, are prepared to support financially and legally the renewal of this area, I cannot understand why representatives of Dublin Corporation, who admit that they made mistakes, oppose the Government here. It baffles me as a rural Deputy.</P>
      <P>Any programme involving the conferring of special benefits on localised areas necessarily involves a degree of judgment.  In so far as Temple Bar is concerned there are good development reasons for the size of the area.  The boundaries for the area were not decided by the Government in particular but mainly by Dublin Corporation and the Temple Bar Development Council which represents people from the area.  This is a homogeneous area stretching from Fishamble Street to Trinity College. While the proposed area may extend beyond what is commonly referred to as the Temple Bar, I am sure the House will agree that the western part of the area should definitely be included in this scheme as it is very much part of old Viking Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach is sole shareholder of Temple Bar Properties Limited arising from his Government responsibility for cultural and artistic affairs.  It is normal practice that the member of the Government responsible for a project holds the shares.  It should be emphasised that the sole shareholder is the Taoiseach of the day and the shares are not vested in the present Taoiseach in any personal capacity.  The Taoiseach appoints the members of both companies.  As the Taoiseach indicated at his recent press conference, the chairperson will be the Lord Mayor of the day.  The Taoiseach has not indicated that the position will be changed and I do not understand the negative attitude of Opposition speakers on this point.  Neither will board members be changed, daily or weekly, as suggested <Col N="371" /> by Deputy Byrne.  Membership will be changed in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Temple Bar Properties Limited may have subsidiary companies under section 18 of the Bill.  Such companies would be subject to the same regulatory procedures as Temple Bar Renewal Limited and Temple Bar Properties Limited in terms of the auditing of accounts.  The companies will be subject to the remit of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  I also want to emphasise here the important role of the Comptroller and Auditor General in his capacity as Comptroller and Auditor General of all State expenditure right across the board for Departments and semi-State companies.  The same criteria will apply in this case and accounts must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as per sections 7 and 16.  The companies are subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, 1963-1990, and, as I have said, to the remit of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies and their accounts will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There will be no question of unconstitutionality in this regard.</P>
    <P>In his reply to a series of questions in the House on 7 May last, the Taoiseach confirmed that the corporation's planning requirements would be fully adhered to. He drew attention to the fact that the corporation's plan for the area has been adopted as part of the overall development programme.  Dublin Corporation will still remain the planning authority for the Temple Bar area.  Therefore, all proposals which constitute &ldquo;development&rdquo; whether by way of construction or material change of use, will require planning permission and will be subject to appeal in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Building by-laws are being abolished and will be replaced by building regulations under the Building Control Act. Drafts of the building regulations have been sent to the European Community in Brussels and it is expected that they will be brought into operation in the autumn.  The intention is that the building regulations will be operated as flexibly <Col N="372" /> as possible and different options will be available to enable their requirements to be met.</P>
    <P>There will not be much scope under the Bill for windfall profits as key properties are owned by Dublin Corporation and CIE.  The local community strongly support the development plan for the area.  With regard to the tax relief available for capital expenditure, there can be no inflated tax relief by virtue of the Temple Bar incentive package. Any inflation of property values caused by the Temple Bar reliefs will be ignored in computing the tax reliefs available.</P>
    <P>We are not usurping the role of the Minister for the Environment in this Bill, as suggested by Deputy Mac Giolla and others.  This Bill is multidimensional and is directed at renewal, tourism and the creation of jobs with a strong cultural emphasis through the activities of the two companies whose functions are being given a statutory footing.  It is entirely appropriate that this function is being taken by the Taoiseach as the person responsible legally and constitutionally for projects like this.  Neither does the Bill usurp the role of Dublin Corporation in relation to planning.  As I have already said, the normal planning requirements will be adhered to.  Deputies will note that Dublin Corporation officials are members of both Temple Bar Properties Limited and Temple Bar Renewal Limited. Surely this acknowledges the key role Dublin Corporation play in this area.</P>
    <P>Temple Bar Renewal Limited is chaired by the Lord Mayor of Dublin of the day.  It has a board of directors which is made up of high ranking officials of Government Departments, municipal and other State bodies and members of the Temple Bar Development Council which represent people from the area itself.  Given the composition of the board of directors of the company, the House can be assured that only projects which will contribute in the right manner to the revitalisation and development of the area will be approved of by Temple Bar Renewal Limited.  There can be no <Col N="373" /> suggestion that ill-conceived projects will gain approval for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>In deciding whether to approve buildings or premises for the purposes of the Temple Bar scheme of tax reliefs, Temple Bar Renewal Limited will have to have regard to the criteria which are set out in the Second Schedule to the Bill.  These criteria will allow Temple Bar Renewal Limited to approve the following categories of buildings: any building or premises where activities of a cultural nature are carried out, buildings providing services for tourists, restaurants, public houses, hotels and hostels, craft workshops and small retail outlets employing not more than 20 people, multi-storey car parks, residential accommodation and office or service buildings primarily serving the Temple Bar area.  Temple Bar Renewal Limited will be precluded from approving factories other than small craft workshop type enterprises, warehouses and large stores for the purposes of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Pending the establishment of the proposed depot in Temple Bar, CIE gave out a number of leases to very desirable small projects, not necessarily at economic rents.  We were faced with the problems of how to deal with the cessation of CIE's interest in the area while, at the same time, maintaining the people in the CIE properties who had set up all sorts of desirable enterprises.  We decided that the new company, Temple Bar Properties Limited, on behalf of the people in the area and the Government, would take over the premises from CIE at an agreed valuation so that Temple Bar Properties Limited would be in a position to continue the tenancies of the various people who had established enterprises there.  That is the economic basis of the whole operation.</P>
    <P>Many of the people who are running art galleries, studios, musical venues and so on, are not in a position to pay the commercial rents that normal redevelopment would require.  This is why Temple Bar Properties Limited, on behalf of the Government, are stepping in and becoming a property company. They will encourage these people to carry <Col N="374" /> on at rents which they might not otherwise be able to pay.</P>
    <P>In reply to a number of questions raised, particularly by Deputy Mac Giolla.  I can assure the House that CIE will be compensated.  A figure in excess of £3 million has been agreed and as soon as the Bill is enacted, the necessary contracts will be signed and the necessary compensation paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not compensation. They paid £12 million for the property three years ago.</P>

      <P>A comparison with the Financial Services Centre, as suggested by Deputy Quinn, is misplaced.  It is not in the same category as that of the Financial Services Centre, which is very successful and profit driven for the companies locating there.  We are seeking to encourage in the Temple Bar area, by way of special incentives, many small enterprises which would not in the normal way be commercially viable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn also referred to a number of other registered companies. These companies are nothing more than aggressive private enterprises.  I want to assure the House that they will have no influence, connection or association with Temple Bar Properties Limited or Temple Bar Renewal Limited, which have their own special mission.  I do not want to speculate on why this range of companies is being formed by other groups, but it may be that they want to take possession of names for their own purposes.  They will certainly not be associated in any way with the two companies covered in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Temple Bar Development Council have played a key role in ensuring that this project has been put forward.  I want to stress that the development council did not get all the concessions they looked for.  The concessions were carefully considered by both the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners before they were finally put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people are to avail of the range of social, cultural and tourist related services which the Temple Bar area will <Col N="375" /> offer it is essential to ensure access to the area, which is in the inner city, and that there be adequate car parking facilities. The multi-storey car parks provided for must meet the aesthetic construction standards under the supervision of Temple Bar Renewal Limited.  The tax reliefs for Temple Bar will run out in 1996 and the role of Temple Bar Renewal Limited in relation to these reliefs will terminate at the time.  I hope that the objectives of the Temple Bar package will be fully achieved by that time also.</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree that this is a very important Bill, particularly during this year when Dublin is the European city of culture.  It is a major effort by the Government to acknowledge the key role Dublin can play in maximising the cultural and tourist opportunities which are <Col N="376" /> there for all people, Irish people and the many tourists who will visit this country in the future.  I hope the House will acknowledge, endorse and support the efforts being made to avail of this tremendous opportunity to expand and develop cultural and historical tourism in the capital city during European City of Culture year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whenever the question of insurance is mentioned, the discussion quickly turns to motor insurance and particularly to the question of insurance for young drivers.  It is in this context I commend to the House the Fine Gael motion in my name and that of my colleague, Deputies Michael Lowry and Philip Hogan:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the cost of car insurance, particularly for young drivers, and asks the Government to adopt the Fine Gael proposals, namely <Col N="379" /> to encourage better driving skills, safer roads, stricter enforcement, tighter costs control or claims and a better deal from insurance companies.</P>
    <P>In order to fully appreciate the situation we must have regard to the fact that young drivers find it almost impossible to obtain motor insurance cover, and the many who succeed have to meet premiums ranging from £2,000 to £3,000 and sometimes even more.  This leads to a tendency to drive without insurance cover in some cases, and in other cases young people have become unemployed because of their inability to drive to work due to prohibitively high motor insurance premiums.  These are not isolated instances.  In fact, numerous cases have been brought to our attention where young people who had obtained employment and as a consequence had to drive to work or had to drive in the course of their employment had to give it up because they were unable to get motor insurance.  This is a deplorable situation. It is high time that the Minister dealt with this matter.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies apply loadings on insurance cover for young drivers on the basis that this age group predominantly feature in road traffic accidents and have consequent claims.  They have produced statistics to prove their case.  However, a closer examination will reveal that compared to other EC countries, an exceptionally high proportion of our population is in the under-25 age group.  This of course means that in the event of a motor accident the chance of a driver aged under 25 being involved is much greater in this country than in other EC states.  We are all aware of the contention of insurance companies that they put a loading on drivers under 25 years of age because they are a high risk category. This high risk is determined on the basis of the number of accidents that have taken place in which that age group were involved.  Obviously if a high proportion of the population is in that age group and a high percentage of them are driving cars, it automatically follows that they <Col N="380" /> must be involved in a high proportion of the number of accidents and this would not necessarily relate to bad driving skills.</P>
    <P>We must examine the following factors in order to determine the contributory causes of accidents: bad driving, driver error etc., defective cars, cars that would not pass an MOT test, bad roads and numerous black spots, which claim hundreds of lives and result in hundreds of thousands of pounds being spent on medical bills and compensation costs; insufficient implementation of the law in respect of defective and uninsured vehices; exceptionally high legal costs due to the cumbersome system of dealing with claims; and finally the exceptionally high cost of the settlement of claims which are up to nine times higher than in some of the EC states.  This is often contributed to by repeated or spurious claims and some people have successfully claimed on up to ten occasions.</P>
    <P>Unless these issues are tackled there will be no reduction in insurance premiums and Ireland will not benefit from the liberalisation which should come after 1992.  In relation to the number and cost of claims it should be noted that through advertising it has become almost an industry to bring a claim.  With due respect to my friends in the legal profession, they are placing advertisements in the media inviting people to consult them if they have tripped or slipped or been involved in a motor accident or any other type of accident in order to ensure that they get their just rights.  If they are not successful, no fee will be charged.  In country parlance, they are operating on a &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; basis.</P>
    <P>There is a huge propensity for increased claims and repeated claims. For some people, repeating claims has almost become an industry.  I can fully understand that some people may be unfortunate enough to have two or three accidents but when claims arise repeatedly, perhaps ten or 20 times, one must ask whether these people are accident prone or particularly good at achieving some kind of monetary consideration in respect of these accidents.  This applies also to people using the public transport <Col N="381" /> system.  Our national transport companies are the ready targets of repeated claims of one kind or another.  If somebody slips, falls or trips on a bus, that person goes to a practitioner for medical advice and then gets legal advice.  The combination of advice from both sectors leads to a huge claim which is passed on to the transport company and the insurance company.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern is the cost of professional advice during the course of cases which may go to court or may be in the process of going to court.  The cost of medical or legal advice is duplicated to a great extent and is very expensive.  This has been brought to our attention by the media and by private individuals who have explained to us the kind of costs they were faced with when they went to court or achieved a settlement out of court.</P>
    <P>We are not suggesting a curtailment in the just claims of people who have suffered an injury and are entitled to some kind of compensation.  We are referring to abuses of the system which ultimately are paid for by other people, either by increased insurance costs or by subventions to public transport.  Fine Gael propose a number of measures which will, if applied collectively, have the effect of automatically reducing insurance risks and preparing the groundwork to allow young drivers with a clean licence to obtain motor cover for an average car at the rate of approximately £750 per annum.  There are those who are sceptical about that.  The Minister will probably reply that he has had an interdepartmental committee examining the insurance industry for some months and that they propose to report shortly. I accept that he is acting in good faith but I would point out the necessity to encompass within the scope of the discussions the matters we are bringing to his attention.  These points may have been brought to his attention by other people but if not it is important that he should take these issues on board now.</P>
    <P>A starter policy costing £750 for young <Col N="382" /> drivers is not beyond the bounds of possibility. Somebody may say that one company attempted to do this a few years ago but found it was not very lucrative.  The reason it was not lucrative was that there was little competition in the market-place. Only one company will quote for young drivers and the result is that there is no competition.  It is not that this company want a monopoly in that sector but simply that other companies are not interested.  The result is the higher premiums are charged.</P>
    <P>We propose that all drivers receive off-the-road instruction in a registered driving school, plus a prescribed number of driving hours under controlled conditions as well as a requisite number of driving hours on the road under the guidance of an instructor.  One of the first lessons that should be taught to persons receiving instruction is the mechanics of using a motor vehicle.  Often people learning to drive do not know what happens by virtue of the manipulation of various instruments. The first thing a person taking flying lessons is taught is exactly how the craft works.  If he or she cannot master that, the lessons do not proceed.  A good working knowledge of the mechanics of the vehicles is required.</P>
    <P>We propose an MOT or certificate of road worthiness for all cars over five years old and stricter application of the law in respect of uninsured vehicles.  In relation to the MOT, it is essential to recognise early that in many other countries such a system has been in operation for many years.  They have lower insurance premiums, a lower rate of accidents and better driving.  They are getting a better insurance deal for their people.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about uninsured vehicles.  The insurance companies claim that up to £40 million is lost to the industry by way of uninsured vehicles each year.  I am not certain about that because I have not seen the evidence.  The gardaí back up the claim that there are so many uninsured vehicles.  It is virtually impossible for a person to obtain insurance in his or her own name but there is not great difficulty in obtaining insurance in somebody else's name and driving a <Col N="383" /> vehicle which may be part of a commercial fleet.  There is an inequality in the applications of the rules and regulations.</P>
    <P>We also propose restricted driving for young drivers.  If the statistics produced by the insurance companies are correct and if young drivers have a tendency to be involved in accidents, let us give them a trial period of three years after they receive the starter insurance policy.  Let them be restricted to driving at 50 mph. They should drive alcohol free and follow the criteria which apply in other countries. If we want to achieve a reduction in insurance costs we must introduce some restrictions.  One without the other will not work.</P>
    <P>We call on the Minister for the Environment to eliminate as a matter of urgency all accident blackspots.  The costs will be recouped by lower and fewer claims for compensation and a reduction in medical and legal costs.  I could not overemphasise that aspect of the matter. If one drives from any point here to the furthest extremity one will find at least 20 notified accident blackspots on the roads.  Countless others are not identified. A person who is not familiar with a stretch of roadway can readily come upon an accident blackspot without realising it.  It is quite usual to come upon a marked blackspot and find that an accident has occurred.  Local authorities do not like to identify such accident blackspots in their areas because it gives them a bad name.  I admit that the elimination of accident blackspots would cost money but in the case of national primary and national secondary routes it is possible to obtain EC funds to the extent of 75 per cent.  We should utilise that facility while it is still available.  Every Member can identify locations in his or her constituency where up to ten accidents have taken place involving loss of life and hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation. I know at least one such location in my constituency of Kildare where 18 lives have been lost in the past 20 years &mdash; almost an average of one life per annum.  Only at this stage has it been <Col N="384" /> seen fit to eliminate that accident black spot.</P>
    <P>I know at least two other locations where a number of people have died as a result of road accidents.  When many lives are lost at the same spot emergency measures need to be taken.  I can accept that a person not familiar with a stretch of road can make a mistake once or twice but when accidents happen in the same place measures must be taken to eliminate the cause of these accidents.</P>
    <P>We propose also to set up a claims commission to eliminate the delays and the high legal and medical costs involved in setting claims.  The claims commission would be a speedy way to overcome the difficulty that has arisen in recent times in processing claims through the courts, the duplicated legal and other professional costs that may be involved.  This would be a simple system to go through the claims commission initially.  Of course, the parties involved would later have recourse to the courts if they want it.  I am concerned that we could end up with every argument being taken to the courts.</P>
    <P>We call on the Minister for the Environment to appoint sufficient driver testers to eliminate the backlog which makes it virtually impossible for young drivers to obtain a test within a reasonable period. This can and should be readily resolved and I call on the Minister to take the necessary action.  I know there are budgetary restraints but we must get our priorities right and deal with the issues that affect most people.</P>
    <P>We call on the Government to lift the derogation given to the non-life section of the insurance industry some years ago and thus allow greater competition in the motor insurance area.  I encourage insurance companies to give the motorist the benefit of the free market.  The Minister may say this derogation was given by a previous Coalition Government.  I accept that, but that derogation was given in the circumstances which prevailed at the time and if it were removed it would be of considerable benefit.</P>
    <P>Public liability insurance is also an issue here because it is costing hundreds of <Col N="385" /> jobs and millions of pounds in claims, some of which have been repeated up to a dozen times.  In the course of this short debate I could not even begin to attempt to address the question of public liability insurance for the simple reason that it is one area where a major scandal exists at present in the sense that people are afraid to seek public liability cover, some small businesses cannot afford it and many people are operating without it.  The consequences should be quite clear to all if that is allowed to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House is based on a desire to remove one of the most inequitable penalties imposed on our young people.  This penalty is much more than a financial imposition. It has implications that affect the way a great many young people live as they prepare themselves for the future. Our motion requests Dáil Éireann to deplore the cost of car insurance particularly for young drivers and goes on to suggest ways in which this can be reversed by political action through an upgrading of driving skills, an improvement in road quality, a more sophisticated system of grading and enforcement and a general review of the way in which costs are incurred and charges are located.  It is important for us to realise that this motion recognises more than the cost element of car insurance for young drivers.  It also identifies the reasons for and implications of this cost element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the first great anomaly which has surfaced in this area in recent years.  We are asking the people who can least afford it to bear the greatest cost. We are telling our young people they are qualified to drive, but they cannot afford to do so, and we are not prepared to do anything about it.  Where is the sense in a system which permits a young person of 18 years of age to become a fully fledged, legally qualified driver and then places on him a financial constraint too great to bear thereby preventing him from doing what he is qualified to do? Where is the sense in a system which permits a great many people to drive on our roads who have never passed a <Col N="386" /> driving test but who enjoy the benefits of low cost insurance because they survived the system without having any claims against them?</P>
    <P>Statistics relating to young drivers' involvement in road accidents are constantly used by those who argue in favour of loading young drivers' premiums, but are there any statistics to show the percentages of drivers involved in accidents each year who have never passed a test? I feel sure we all know some drivers who survive on the roads not because of any skill on their part but rather because of the skills of those around them.  On one hand, you have non-tested drivers who form a significant proportion of the driving population but are not a recognised category of driver, and on the other, you have young drivers who have been granted a certificate of competence by the Department of the Environment but who all too often cannot exercise the right that certificate gives them because of the financial constraints imposed on them by the insurance premiums.  This is ironic. What are the implications of this extraordinary situation for the young driver of today?</P>
    <P>Let me quote the example of one young person in my constituency, the unwilling victim of the circumstances in which so many young people find themselves.  This young man is 20 years of age and the holder of a valid driving licence.  He has already worked for three years with a commercial concern which included driving for them.  Recently he decided to put to good use the skills he learned by setting up his own firm.  To do so he needed to insure a car which would be an integral part of his daily activities and without which he simply could not manage his affairs.  The cost quoted to this 20 year old was a staggering £2,400 for straightforward, third party, fire and theft.  Needless to remark, he is now a much chastened young man who has had to put his plans and ambitions very firmly to one side for several years.  Where is the justice or the fair play in a system which allows this to happen?  If he cannot now afford to pay this insurance at what point will he be recognised as a safe risk by an <Col N="387" /> insurance company?  Suppose he were content to hold on to his licence until he reaches some arbitrary age, would he then be considered a safe risk even though he may drive only on the odd occasion provided, of course, he can persuade a financially better off relative to include him on his policy?  Those are some of the existing anomalies.  To suggest that the answer to the problem of high cost insurance lies solely with the insurance industry is to be unaware of the overall implications of the problem.</P>
    <P>Our motion seeks to have all the various strands linked together so that an equitable outcome will result, but the insurance industry undoubtedly have a part to play.  They must be seen to be weighing all the factors involved.  They must put before their customers the statistics on which the cost imbalances are based.  We must have more information on the various categories of drivers who are at risk and are paying the piper who plays a very erratic tune.  For example, is it right to penalise all drivers because of an arbitrary age limit?  Does skill not have a part to play?  Does one's adherence to the laws of driving and the consumption of alcohol not have a bearing on the whole question?</P>
    <P>This motion recognises these factors and, more importantly, seeks to do something about them.  Young people have no defined right to special treatment, but they have a right to be treated fairly and equitably.  One of the most important aspects of this motion is the question of better driving skills.  It is an acknowledged fact that one of the reasons for the loading of premiums on young drivers is their lack of experience, but this creates a catch-22 situation: you cannot get experience without driving and you cannot drive without insurance and you cannot get insurance at an affordable cost without experience.  This is why we are proposing a revaluation of the requirements on drivers at the provisional licence stage.</P>
    <P>We are advocating a system of restrictions in the early years of a driver's life, thereby encouraging a demand for <Col N="388" /> greater skill levels.  Of course, this would be contingent on the insurance industry's recognition of the need for a greater spread of responsibility for starter drivers and the need to have a more detailed breakdown of risk groupings.  There are excellent young drivers and it is our responsibility to do all in our power to encourage many more young people to improve their driving standards so that the load can be shared more evenly. This motion embodies many of the things necessary to bring about this situation.</P>
    <P>One of the great dangers inherent in the present state of affairs is that people may feel justified in driving without proper cover or without cover at all.  The consequences of this do not need to be emphasised.  It may not be possible to quantify the numbers of uninsured drivers in the country at any given time but there is ample evidence to suggest that there are significant numbers using our public roads.  The presence of uninsured drivers is to be deplored but more importantly the reasons for it must be recognised.</P>
    <P>One of the major factors in the cost of insurance is the impact which the cost of claims has on the whole area.  There are a number of factors involved here which need to be examined and which require the goodwill and expertise of all the different related sectors.  We need to exert tighter control on the cost of claims even if it requires a radical overhaul of the present system.  We are proposing that a quantum of damages be introduced to control and standardise the cost of claims.  It is a weakness in the present system that the criteria for assessing claims are too loosely based and too much dependent on the subjective judgment. We are saying that objective standards are essential.  Allied to this is the need for a critical overhaul of the system for analysis of claims with a view to eliminating spurious or fraudulent claims.  We have arrived at a point where there is a tacit acceptance of claims at a certain level.  A proportion of claims are tolerated and accepted as a soft option rather than going through a complex and <Col N="389" /> time consuming judicial system.  This has encouraged an approach which is not in the best interest of everybody concerned. We need a fresh look at this whole area. We also advocate that the insurance company recognise the major role they have to play in providing statistical data which will enable the identification of problems in different areas and the reasons for resultant heavy loadings.  It is in the best interests of the insurance industry itself to take this initiative.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the high cost of cover which has recently been brought to my attention is that many young people feel they have no alternative but to accept the high cost of first-time cover and are then forced to borrow money to pay for it.  This is one of the hidden impositions of the story and is an unfortunate consequence to be borne by the driver who would ordinarily have enough to cope with in raising the finance for the vehicle itself.  In essence what this motion seeks to achieve is an awareness, first of all, of the problem itself and, secondly, of the need for an input to a solution from all the interested parties.  It is not an Irish problem, indeed, it is common to most developed countries but it does have an Irish dimension since general claim costs are so high here that our young drivers have serious problems with affordable insurance.</P>
    <P>The points which we have put forward in this motion are substantiated by the contents of a recent OECD report in which it is recognised that there are a number of features which militate against a reduction in the current costs.  Principal amongst these is an inadequate level of driving instruction, a point which we are strongly making in our submission.  The report stresses the part which the use of alcohol plays in the standard of driving, and again this is in line with our thinking. The report also points out that Ireland and other countries have not yet started an integrated road safety policy geared to young drivers and that there is a lack of data generally on the mobility of young drivers.  We have the opportunity, therefore, of being in the vanguard of the move in recognising the problem, of <Col N="390" /> dissecting it into various components and of coming up with a long term policy which will bring about a major improvement. This motion can provide the groundwork for such a move and should be accepted by the Minister and the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion put forward by my colleague, Deputy Durkan.  Many Deputies have spoken in this House about the problem of car insurance and the high cost of it during the last year or two and many Government Ministers have told us what they would do about the problem.  However, at the end of the day we have heard that the Minister has set up an interdepartmental committee involving himself and the Minister for the Environment which was to report about a month ago but which I now understand will not report for another two months.  In the meantime young drivers must suffer because they are not able to get quotations from insurance companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Wexford people as well as Kilkenny people know all about the high cost of insurance cover.  There are young people in Wexford as well as in Kilkenny who are going to insurance brokers who tell them they can do nothing for them. The reason the motorist continues to have high motor insurance is that the Government refuse to allow competition from Europe or to take action that would reduce costs in relation to claims.  This situation does not have to continue in this way if the Government have the political will to implement the same regime that pertains in the UK or in Europe.  It is no exaggeration to say that motorists are punch-drunk from the rising costs of insurance.  Indeed, in the last year there <Col N="391" /> have been four increases from most insurance companies.  I regret to say that yesterday another insurance company, Guardian Royal Exchange, have indicated that they are increasing commercial vehicle insurance rates by a further 10 per cent and at the same time are reducing to three months a concession given to motorists whereby they could keep their vehicles off the road for two years and still hold their no claims bonus.  This is simply disgraceful.</P>
      <P>Ireland has the most expensive insurance regime and the second most expensive location for motor cars in Europe.  All the Government are seeking is more and more derogation to protect insurance companies rather than the consumer, so that at the end of the day insurance premiums remain high.  There is agreement and collusion within the insurance industry to get young drivers off the road because they are deemed to be high risk, particularly those with provisional licences.  They even refuse them a quotation for general insurance terms.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to implore the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, to intervene with the insurance industry so that all companies accept a share of the young driver market.  Nobody should have to pay more than £750 for third party insurance which in itself is high enough but it is much lower than many of the quotations being made by a small number of companies who are quoting at present.  Young people should not be singled out for discrimination by insurance companies.  It is time the Government told companies in the strongest possible terms, that there are obligations and responsibilities to be met to young drivers.  As I have stated, the Government have talked about the problem long enough but have achieved nothing for the hard pressed young motorist and the hard pressed consumer in relation to motor insurance.</P>

      <P>It has been pointed out on these occasions that both the Government and myself are very fully aware of the difficulties being experienced by motorists at present and in particular the problems being faced by young drivers, and the Ministers concerned have been extremely active in seeking ways of improving matters.  All parties are concerned at the high cost of motor insurance.  I will repeat myself once again and say that an interministerial group, comprising the Ministers for Justice, the Environment, the Attorney General and myself are at present examining ways and means of improving the environment for motor insurance.  This group are focusing on strict and sustained enforcement of existing road traffic legislation, on amendments to the Road Traffic Acts designed to reduce the motor accident rate, on suggestions to improve the cost and availability of motor insurance and improvements or alternatives to the courts system for the resolution of personal injury claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This group have available to it the full resources and experience of all the Departments of State concerned with this area.  They have had close consultation with the Irish Insurance Federation and have considered every aspect of the matter in considerable detail.  So intensive has been the examination of the <Col N="393" /> problem which this group have carried out that I cannot see what possible benefit would derive from the setting up of a Commission of Inquiry as advocated by the amendment to this motion.  Such investigations for example, the O'Connor report in 1972, the O'Donoghue report in 1976 and the Prices Advisory report in 1982, have not led to the discovery of anything startlingly fresh.  Indeed, what is needed now is action not the creation of a situation that would require awaiting the outcome of some future further investigation.  I believe, given the progress made in the deliberations of the interministerial group, that such action will be taken speedily and, consequently, I cannot commend the establishment of a commission of inquiry to the House.</P>
    <P>The Ministers with responsibility for the areas concerned have already announced a number of measures being considered by this group.  Recently published Fine Gael proposals appear to be nothing more than a regurgitation of some old ideas and the taking on board of what has already been announced by Ministers.  There is little in their document which has not already been put forward and debated and any claim that all or any of these ideas are novel and theirs is spurious.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael policy document suggests that insurers should introduce a policy for starter drivers which would cap the premium at £750.  Approximately three years ago one insurance company introduced such a special young driver's policy which capped their premium at £800 per annum.  However, following a very bad claims experience which the company sustained the company had, I am advised, no option but to significantly increase premiums.  I do not believe this House &mdash; or any Minister &mdash; should try to dictate the level of premium required to meet specific risks, this is a commercial judgment best left to practitioners.  I would point out based on previous experience that, if this cover were made available at the rate suggested by Fine Gael, someone else would have to pay for it, the more mature motorists.  The <Col N="394" /> problem of high insurance costs is not just confined to young drivers.  For example, there are many mature drivers on low incomes who are having difficulty in meeting their present premiums and it would be unfair to further penalise them.</P>
    <P>The price of insurance, including motor insurance, here &mdash; as indeed in any other market &mdash; is directly and substantially dependent on the frequency of claims and the cost of settling those claims.  In 1988 insurers sustained underwriting losses of £48 million on their motor portfolios; the corresponding figure for 1989 was £116 million and losses for 1990 are expected to be similar to the 1989 figure.  Confronted with losses of this magnitude and in order to maintain their viability, insurers have considered it necessary to increase their premiums in line with their claims experience and-or to exercise more selectivity in the type of risk undertaken.</P>
    <P>The fundamental cause of high insurance prices for consumers is the high claims rate allied to the high cost of individual claims.  These factors bear on the level of insurance premia quoted to young drivers as well as those quoted to more mature motorists.  Insurers may legitimately require certain categories of business which represent a higher than average level of risk to pay higher premiums, to adequately reflect the claims experience of such risks.  The Government are aware that when an insurance company quotes in respect of motor risks for young people the premiums may be regarded &mdash; and frequently are &mdash; by those concerned as excessive.  The cost of motor insurance for young drivers, however, tends to reflect the claims experience of motor insurers.  While one sympathises with the situation in which young drivers find themselves, statistical evidence has shown that they are more likely to be involved in accidents and, therefore, to cause claims.  The cost of these claims can only be met by insurers if a realistic premium is forthcoming to cover the risk involved.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw some of the statistics to the attention of the House. While young policy holders account for <Col N="395" /> only 15 per cent of the total number of policies issued by insurers, young drivers account for 36 per cent of all claims.  The average cost of claims caused by young drivers is more than 40 per cent higher than the cost of claims arising from more mature drivers.  In 1989, the latest year for which full figures are available, 3,732 car or motorcycle drivers were killed or injured in road traffic accidents, of which 1,061 or 28 per cent were aged 24 or under and 2,119 or 57 per cent were aged 34 or under.  Similarly, of the 2,940 car drivers killed or injured in 1989 in road traffic accidents, 568 or 19 per cent were aged 24 or under and 1,437 or 49 per cent were aged 34 or under.  These figures clearly demonstrate the disproportionately high level of accidents involving young drivers.  Indeed, specific research carried out by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board in recent years suggests that the loadings applied in Ireland for age of driver are not out of line with the identified level of risk.</P>
    <P>This House may be aware that a formal common position was adopted by the European Community Council of Ministers under the Irish Presidency on 20 June 1990 on the EC Directive on Freedom of Services for Motor Insurance, which is due to be implemented by all member states before 20 November 1992. Since this directive has not yet come in the suggestions made that the use of derogations in its implementation here was causing a lack of competition is untrue as the directive cannot come into force until November 1992.  The underlying principle of that directive is the creation of greater competition in the areas of policy conditions and premium rates and that the general availability of insurance should improve overall.  While it is hoped that the opening up of the Community market will intensify competition, it should be noted that there is already a massive foreign presence in the Irish motor insurance market.  Over 80 per cent of non-life insurance undertakings operating in Ireland are foreign owned.</P>
    <P>Increased competition will not automatically lead to a reduction in insurance <Col N="396" /> costs in Ireland.  Prudent insurers, indigenous, foreign established or foreign services must set their premium rates to match the compensation pay-out.  The compensation levels existing in each member state should determine the premium rates charged by both established and services insurers.  The implementation of the Motor Insurance Freedom of Services Directive should help to emphasise the role of the policy holder and the claims atmosphere of the country concerned in determining the premium paid and minimise any misconceptions about &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; and &ldquo;home&rdquo; motor insurers in this regard.</P>
    <P>The suggestion of insurers implementing tighter controls on claims is not new.  I focused attention on this matter a long time ago.  Indeed, as far back as January 1990, at the annual dinner of the Insurance Institute of Cork, I spoke about claims control on the following lines:</P>
    <P>An ominous development in the non-life insurance area generally is the suggestion that there is an escalating problem in this country in the number of spurious claims.  The insurance industry for example in referring to the specific area of &ldquo;whiplash&rdquo; injuries has indicated that there is firm evidence that the incidence of claims for such injuries in Ireland is significantly in excess of UK levels.  Claims of this nature must be eliminated and efforts are needed from all parties to highlight and end any ambivalence in respect of such practices which might be present in the public mind.  I sometimes get the impression that some people adopt a &ldquo;hear no evil, see no evil&rdquo; approach and ignore the fact that such an approach may be one of the reasons their insurance premium is not lower. This myopic and insular view is damaging and stupid and at the end of the day results in a real cost to the average insurance consumer.  From the insurer's viewpoint greater use of information technology has obvious advantages in tackling the problem of dubious and spurious claims.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> I was glad to read in the newspapers recently in regard to spurious claims that a huge series &mdash; 15 I think &mdash; carried out by one individual over a period of eight years was at long last unearthed.  The judge made appropriate comments in dismissing the case.  I am glad that the case got a good deal of publicity because it might serve as a warning to many others engaged in equally fraudulent practices in relation to the consequences if they are caught.</P>
    <P>I was also pleased to learn recently that a magnetic resonance imaging scanner, which can help to detect if accident insurance claims are bogus, is in operation at present in a Dublin hospital.  This scanner acts as a sort of &ldquo;lie detector&rdquo; preventing spurious claims arising from accidents.  This type of scanner is a further help in detecting such claims and I understand that other hospitals are seeking funding to enable them instal such equipment.</P>
    <P>Following discussions between my officials and the insurance industry, motor insurers have established a collective and computerised data bank to assist in the detection and stamping out of fraudulent or dubious claims.</P>
    <P>I will deal later with the specific proposals which are being considered by the group in an effort to improve the insurance environment.  However, I must dwell for a short time on my role as Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to insurance and on the problems facing the insurance market in the State. It must be emphasised that the basic role of the Minister laid down both by national and Community law is one of supervision of insurers in order to ensure that insurance companies meet their statutory solvency and reserve requirements.  It is not my function to tell insurers how to run their business or to interfere with their rights to accept or reject risks, or dictate the terms applicable to any insurance policy, or to interfere in their rights to charge realistic premiums in the light of their underwriting experience.</P>
    <P>However, insurers do have certain duties.  These duties lie in co-operating in <Col N="398" /> the measures taken by the State and the community without undue selectivity in the acceptance of risks.  I am confident that as in the past they supported the road safety campaign, the support of the industry will be forthcoming.  It is a further concern that insurance should be provided efficiently and at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>The cost of insurance cover has been increasing steeply recently.  Many of the influencing factors are undoubtedly outside the direct control of insurers.  In 1989, motor insurance claims costs are estimated to have risen by £28 million over 1988 as a result of increased claims frequency alone and by a further £40 million over 1988 on foot of a rise in the average cost of individual claims alone. Thus, the conclusion has to be reached that recent increases in motor insurance premia are due to increases in the claims frequency and the average cost of individual claims, that is the quantum of compensation. However, I expect insurance companies to control those factors within their ambit so that inefficiencies in the insurance sector do not give rise to any unnecessary costs which have to be borne by the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Insurers are subject to very stringent supervision rules and are required to maintain various categories of reserves in respect of outstanding claims, that is those which have been received but not yet settled, and claims which have arisen but not yet notified.  The insurer must use the premium income to cover administration overheads and to meet due payments on claims.  The balance of the premium income received in any year represents the underwriting profit or loss. In addition to these requirements each company is also obliged to maintain solvency margins.  Insurance companies are therefore, subject to much more stringent financial control and supervision than is the case with commercial enterprises in general.</P>
    <P>Consumers, of course, are more interested not in the supervisory aspects of insurance, except when a crisis arises but the issues of cost and availability of insurance, particularly motor insurance. <Col N="399" /> I recognise, as I have said previously, that there are serious concerns in this area.  We should, however be aware that increasing claims consciousness and a more litigious environment have a direct adverse effect on insurance costs.  The greater inclination of many citizens to claim their full rights and entitlements to compensation under the law has meant that many more claims are made nowadays in respect of events which ten to 20 years ago would not have attracted a request for compensation.  Undoubtedly citizens value these rights and would resist efforts to curtail their exercise, but they have a cost.</P>
    <P>The cost of compensation in Ireland is abnormally high and has been so for far too long.  In 1989 motor insurers paid out £320 million approximately in compensation costs.  This gives some indication as to why insurance premia are seen as a burden.  In principle, Irish society as a whole has two options with regard to insurance.  We can accept the high levels of risks that exist at present and which arise from lack of care for safety, and this can only result in high prices for insurance, or we can reduce the level of risk which in turn should see significant improvements with regard to the price and the availability of insurance cover, and this is the course of action I hope we will take.  There are two other options in regard to insurance, first that we should continue to have the highest level of compensation in Europe and perhaps the highest premia in Europe or we should have a normal level of compensation and normal levels of premia.  I hope that this society, on reflection, would choose the latter rather than the former.  Up to now we seem, as a society, to have voted for the former.</P>
    <P>I was glad to read recently in an editorial in <i>Business and Finance</i> of 27 June 1991 a balanced approach to the subject of insurance.  I would commend that article to all Members of the House.  It set out the reasons insurance costs are so high in Ireland rather than just complaining about the high cost and ignoring the causes, which is usually what we hear <Col N="400" /> in debates on insurance.  I quote from that magazine:</P>
    <P>Claimants have not been the only beneficiaries.  The compensation boom has also thrown a lifeline to the rapidly expanding legal profession.  Over the last 15 years the number of solicitors practising in this country has more than doubled, from 1,500 to 3,500.  What do all these do for a living?  On the available evidence many of them are living on the &ldquo;compo&rdquo; culture.</P>
    <P>I am aware that certain members of the legal profession are advertising their wares concerning the consumer's right to compensation.  This is little more than an encouragement to people to submit claims in circumstances where they would not otherwise have done so.  I would urge the Incorporated Law Society to look into this matter and to discourage the type of advertising which almost incites people to bring claims.  I have no objection to normal advertising where a firm makes available its name and address and so on.  I hope when considering that matter the Incorporated Law Society will also avail of the opportunity to consider the practice, which I am advised is now widespread, of charging a percentage of the damages to the client concerned. That cannot but have the effect of increasing compensation.  If the client realises he will have to pay a percentage of his damages to his own solicitor he has no option but to look for more than he might otherwise have settled for.</P>
    <P>The inter-ministerial group established late last year has met on five occasions. Its brief is to ensure that action is proposed and taken by the appropriate Departments of State, which would be designed to improve the overall environment for motor insurance.  The group reports directly to Government.  Among the measures being proposed are strict and sustained enforcement of road traffic laws.  Ministerial responsibility for the enforcement of road traffic legislation, via the Garda, rests with the Minister for Justice.  The Garda authorities have confirmed that traffic law enforcement is continuing to be a high priority for the <Col N="401" /> force in 1991.  In particular, the force will be targeting breaches of drink driving laws and continuing the momentum generated during the anti-drink driving campaign in December 1990 which was particularly successful and for which the Garda and the Minister for Justice are entitled to our thanks and our congratulations. Increased resources in terms of gardaí and equipment have been provided for the road traffic corps.</P>
    <P>The results of this continued enforcement are beginning to show benefits in terms of saving lives.  There was a significant reduction in road accidents in the first quarter of 1991.  Fatalities declined by 25 per cent, 90 compared to 122 in the same period in 1990, and injuries declined by 13 per cent as against the same period in 1990.  However, at this early stage it would be imprudent to draw any definite long term conclusions from this.</P>
    <P>Ministerial responsibility for road traffic legislation rests with the Minister for the Environment.  It is his intention to propose a road traffic and licensing Bill for early consideration by the House. This Bill will provide for an increase in the minimum disqualification period for those convicted of dangerous or drunk driving from one year to two years.  In addition, those convicted will be required to repeat the driving test before they can go back on the road even after the two year period is up.  The Bill may make provision for the impounding of uninsured vehicles as well as introduce a mandatory disqualification period for those convicted of uninsured driving.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment estimate that the threat of impounding uninsured vehicles, together with increases in the conventional penalties imposed on uninsured drivers, should result in a reduction of up to 50 per cent in the rate of uninsured driving and should result in approximately 42,000 extra vehicles being brought into the insurance system and contributing towards meeting the cost of claims arising from accidents.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment are proposing the setting up of a register of driving instructors.  That Department <Col N="402" /> are involving the driving schools and the Irish Insurance Federation in the formulation and adoption of satisfactory standards for driving schools, to which standards registered driving schools will be required to adhere.  It is important that very strict criteria must be set for the scheme and that tuition standards be agreed for the programme between Government, insurers and driving instructors.  If an acceptable scheme can be agreed, the insurance industry will consider offering a discount to young or inexperienced drivers who have taken a minimum number of driving lessons from approved instructors.  In regard to the question of driver testers, which Deputy Durkan complained about, I might add that the number of such testers was increased earlier this year from 44 to 83. As a result, the backlog of tests is being reduced rapidly.</P>
    <P>The National Safety Council launched a road safety awareness plan in March 1991 which included a publicity campaign, to the funding of which the Irish Insurance Federation have contributed £250,000 in addition to the considerable financing which the federation already provides annually to the National Safety Council.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Environmental Research Unit of the Department of the Environment are carrying out a survey on attitudes to road safety issues, use of seat belts, scale of drink-driving problems and observance of speed limits.</P>
    <P>An analysis of statistics received from both the Irish Insurance Federation and the Department of Justice on awards made in personal injury cases reinforces the conclusion that the most appropriate basis for proposing improvements to the operations of the courts and fundamental alterations to the courts as a mechanism for resolving personal injury cases lies elsewhere than within the framework of the Courts Act, 1988.  It is not that the Courts Act, 1988, has failed in its objective but, rather, that if there are to be significant and immediate reductions in the level of personal injury compensation and a less expensive way of settling claims then initiatives which go beyond the <Col N="403" /> objectives of the Courts Act, 1988, are required.</P>
    <P>Ministerial responsibility for the courts rests with the Minister for Justice.  It is his intention to propose a courts and court officers Bill for early consideration by the House.  The Bill will contain a number of provisions which will be of importance to the objective of improving the environment for insurance.  For example, it will propose the establishment of a court of civil appeal with a very limited right of further appeal to the High Court in personal injury actions.  Secondly, it will propose an extension to the powers of the Taxing Master in an effort to reintroduce a degree of control on legal costs in personal injury actions, which have gone out of all proportion in recent years.  Thirdly, it will propose the giving of power to the Master of the High Court for the introduction of pre-trial procedures.</P>
    <P>At the request of the Interministerial steering group, the Bar Council, the Incorporated Law Society and the Irish Insurance Federation met as a joint working group to examine proposals for some form of arbitration which could be explored as an option for the purposes of reducing the costs of personal injury actions and also to consider any proposals which the members of the joint working group might have that could have the effect of generating a similar reduction and an overall increase in cost effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The joint working party of those three organisations submitted an interim report which recommends certain specific changes to procedures in personal injury cases to be implemented by way of changes to the rules of court; identifies areas for further examination and envisages a further report from the joint working group, and concludes that it would be premature to introduce an arbitration arrangement pending the implementation of the recommendations on procedural changes and experience of the operation of these changes.</P>
    <P>The interministerial steering group are <Col N="404" /> awaiting a further report from the joint working party.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has agreed that his Department would carry out a review of the levels and nature of personal injury compensation in Ireland in the light of a recent survey by Davies Arnold Cooper which suggests that personal injury compensation levels in Ireland are substantially higher than in other EC member states and a report which the Irish Insurance Federation is commissioning from Coopers and Lybrand on personal injury compensation levels in ireland compared to the UK.</P>
    <P>In order to provide data which would enable the monitoring of personal injury claims costs on an ongoing basis, a format for the supply of such data is being finalised by the IIF and my Department. Such data will be useful in monitoring the impact of the initiatives to improve the environment for insurance on insurers' claims costs.</P>
    <P>Other measures also under consideration by the interministerial group include a reduction in the blood alcohol level, hospital sampling of blood or urine post accident and a remedial programme for accident blackspots on roads.</P>
    <P>These are only some of the measures being considered, and I hope the group will be in a position to announce the full package of measures shortly as the report has now been completed and a draft submitted to members, and that these can be implemented in the very early future once they have been agreed by Government. I would add, however, that Government action of itself will not reduce or stabilise motor insurance costs. Consumers must play their part by increased awareness of the need for safety.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, for all the reasons I have enumerated, I do not consider it would be appropriate or useful to institute a commission of inquiry into the motor insurance industry, and Members should reflect carefully on the disruption of business and the costs which arise in servicing such inquiries before lending their support to calls for the setting up of it.</P>
    <Col N="405" />
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;  and insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;concerned at the cost and availability of motor insurance, calls on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to institute a commission of inquiry into the motor insurance industry.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, there may have been inquiries over the years and nothing startlingly fresh arose from them.  Perhaps an inquiry at this stage, having regard to the problems facing the consumers &mdash; those who require insurance at a reasonable and affordable level &mdash; would be more fruitful and address its mind to the needs of consumers.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that what is needed now is action and I could not agree more. We certainly need action but from what the Minister said I do not foresee any action in the short or medium term.  It has to be remembered that insurance companies are not voluntary bodies or charitable organisations.  They are business companies that are quoted on the Stock Exchange and have a single objective, profit, to make the maximum amount of profit for themselves and their very wealthy shareholders.  They are not in the business of providing a service or having any great public spirited feeling towards consumers who are compelled to avail of their service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that perhaps the highest level of compensation in the world is paid in Ireland.  Quite frankly, I disagree with that suggestion.  At the end of the day the compensation paid in Ireland is set by the judges in our courts, the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court and, ultimately, the Supreme Court.  I have watched the figures they have awarded over the years after examination of the evidence and, in my opinion, broadly speaking, the compensation awards are fair, neither too little nor too much.  There may be cases on occasions when a judge over-reaches <Col N="406" /> himself and awards too much or underestimates the figure and awards too little. In some of those cases appeals take place to a higher court where any mistake is corrected.  That is what appeal courts are for.  Broadly speaking, the awards are fair and appropriate having regard to the injuries sustained by a particular claimant.</P>
    <P>The courts in Ireland do not dispense money willy-nilly or throw out money that is not fairly or reasonably warranted by the case coming before them.  In my experience the judges examine each claimant very carefully and meticulously. They hear about the injuries; they hear evidence from doctors; assess the person in the witness box and make their awards. The judges are people of great skill and long experience in these matters and, as I have said, their awards are just and fair. They compare fairly well with awards granted in other countries.  In some countries, like the United States, awards are very high indeed, way above the Irish level.  However, on a European basis, comparing like with like, injury for injury, loss for loss, they compare very favourably with other countries and I would strongly disagree with any other suggestion.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies are among the greatest group of whingers and complainers ever to hit the scene in this country where multinational companies go. They are always whingeing and complaining that their profits are not high enough or that they have this complaint or that complaint.  We must face the fact that they are a very powerful lobby indeed.  They exercise tremendous clout and possess tremendous wealth.  They also generate enormous profits not just for motor insurance.  They are in a far wider range of activity than just motor insurance.  They make profits hand over fist.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is a risk element to the insurance business and anybody who sets up as an insurance company has to be prepared to take that risk.  Anybody going to the racecourse and putting money on a horse takes a risk and must be prepared to back losers as well as <Col N="407" /> winners.  As the saying goes, you cannot win them all.  However, of all the bad losers the insurance companies certainly take the biscuit.  We heard an interesting example of that recently in the UK with Lloyds, one of the wealthiest, most prestigious organisations going back hundreds of years, making hundreds of millions of pounds over the years whose members are among the weathiest people not only in Britain but in other countries. They have some members from this country, who put up a minimum of £100,000 &mdash; perhaps it is more &mdash; to become a member, and they have drawn substantial profits over the years.  Things go a little sour for them in one year, but do they take that in their stride and say they must take the bad with the good?  Not at all.  They put up a whinge, a moan and a complaint that taxpayers' funds have to be used to bail them out in the year things went wrong for them.</P>
    <P>That is the insurance company response to the business world.  They say they have to make their profits in life insurance, in household insurance, in public liability insurance, in factory insurance and in motor insurance.  They have to make their profits in every single field.  They make their profits, broadly speaking.  Go into any of their offices and look at their buildings; look at their reserves; look at their resources.  They have hundreds of millions of pounds. They are among the wealthiest institutions in this country, and in every country where they operate.  We do not have to concern ourselves unduly about them.</P>
    <P>They set up a lobby in this country to have juries abolished.  They campaigned for that and they persuaded Deputies, Ministers and Governments, the media, business and finance and all the rest of them that if only we abolished juries all would be well.  The Insurance Federation promised that if juries were abolished premiums would come down.  That is on the record.  They said the juries were the cause of all the trouble, that judges alone would be fine, that there experience showed that.  If we would only get rid of the juries all would be well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> What did we do?  We bowed to that argument.  We said that if that was what the insurance lobby wanted we would do it in the teeth of a lot of opposition from consumer interests and from legal interests who tried to point out, and who protested in vain, that it would not have that effect at all.  What happened?  It did not have the effect they said it would and, far from coming down, premiums have gone up and continue to go up.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made about costs of lawyers, and the Minister's attitude to lawyers has been known over many a long year.  Is no blame to be put on the insurance companies for the way they conduct their business where claims are concerned?  There is not a word of criticism. I now have a few things to say about insurance companies and how they attend to their own business of dealing with claims.  To a massive extent, they contribute to their own problems and to their own costs.  They throw away millions of pounds year in year out because they tackle the issue of claims in a very inefficient manner.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with one aspect of the matter.  Let anyone pick up the &ldquo;Legal Diary&rdquo; and look at the list of cases waiting to be tried, for example, in the High Court.  There are columns and columns of them.  At what level would you suppose most cases get settled?  Is it within a month or two of the accident?  Is it within six months of the accident?  Is it after the writ is issued?  Is it after the statement of claim is filed?  Is it after a notice of trial is issued or is it waiting there sitting in the list for a year or 18 months to reach its term?  No.  The overwhelming bulk of cases are settled at the doorstep of the court and any practising lawyer will tell you that.  The point at which the insurance companies choose to settle is the highest point in the cost factors that make up running down actions in our courts.  They wait until the biggest possible amount of legal costs have been incurred before they demean themselves to be prepared to settle.  At that stage, on standby at great expense of perhaps £200 or £300 a day are a couple of orthopaedic surgeons, a couple of GPs, <Col N="409" /> engineers on both sides, barristers, solicitors, photographers and all the rest of the family, all brought there that day prepared to go on with the case, and it is at that point that the insurance company say, let us see if we can settle the matter now.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 35, to delete &ldquo;two&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;three&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two amendments were proposed by me on Committee Stage and the Minister of State agreed to look at this issue more closely before Report Stage.  The issue here is whether we shall extend the period within which a claim can be made for loss or damage in respect of goods sold or transactions conducted under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, from two years to three years. I had advocated that the period should be extended to three years on the basis of uniformity, the three-year period being the general period available to injured or aggrieved parties to bring claims under the statute of limitations provisions of the 1957 Act.  The Minister of State indicated that when the two year period was introduced in 1980 it was on the basis of good market considerations, that an argument had been advanced at that time by the hire purchase industry generally and retail associations that to have a more extended period would reflect adversely on the market and could make things more expensive for the consumer in the long run.  I queried that on Committee Stage and pointed out that this legislation is working primarily from <Col N="410" /> the point of view of the consumer, seeking to protect consumer interests in the long term against defective goods or services and that there was not a compelling reason now to suggest that the market needed any special protections.  The Minister of State at the conclusion of the debate on 19 June agreed to look at this matter afresh.  I hope he has reflected on the matter and that the House will agree to accept this simple straightforward amendment.</P>
    <P>This is the only issue, I understand, which will be raised on Report Stage in what is otherwise excellent legislation which is long overdue and which will be greatly appreciated by litigants who heretofore had been badly disadvantaged because we did not have this principle of discoverability with regard to the period of time for which the right of action would run.  Heretofore the period ran effectively from the date upon which the sale or purchase was made and the contract entered into.  The fact that a defect could emerge subsequently was not taken into account.  We should strive to approach this from the point of view of the consumer and to achieve uniformity of rule. The three year period is a general period and there is no reason someone who, because of financial or other circumstances, enters a contract on hire purchase or on other credit trade arrangements should be in any way disadvantaged. Those who can put the cash on the table on the day of purchase should be in the same position as those who buy on hire purchase.  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy McCartan I am unhappy with section 3.  It seems somewhat anomalous that a category of person has certain security under the legislation while another, who could be in a more invidious position because of personal injuries, has his rights more restricted.  The Minister on the last occasion said that to expose the members of the motor trade to the risk of claims from third parties for a full six years after a sale could put the cost of insurance beyond the reach of many in <Col N="411" /> the trade.  I imagine the Minister was working on a hunch rather than on factual information, because he did not provide any factual information.  The Minister did not say how he came to that conclusion and his reply was unsatisfactory.  Without a deep knowledge and understanding of this, I find it hard to understand why the restriction should be two years when it is related to the sale of cars under certain circumstances.  I would ask the Minister to re-examine section 3 to see if he can accept these amendments.</P>
      <P>The whole question of insurance is being debated in this House and the debate will continue tomorrow night. Perhaps the Minister would urge the Government to look at the whole business to see if it is possible to have a public inquiry into the cost of insurance.  It should not be a factor in deciding whether to place certain restrictions on a citizen's rights in this legislation.  Everybody would agree that the cost of liability insurance here is colossal by comparison to what it is elsewhere and that it is entirely unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>In February the Minister for the Environment told the House that there were 77,000 uninsured drivers on the roads at that time.  No doubt there is a strong relationship between the number of uninsured drivers and the cost of insurance. The number and size of claims which could be made under this legislation will no doubt be affected by all of that.  The Government have been looking at the situation but they have not done anything about it.  They are now proposing to impound cars which are being driven without insurance.  The Government are attacking the problem from the wrong end.  There are many factors which have contributed to our unacceptably high levels of insurance.  The holding of a public inquiry into this industry is the only way in which we can ensure that these factors are put right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is good in general and Fine Gael decided at the outset to support it.  The 1987 report of the Law Reform Commission highlighted this problem in the first instance.  They suggested that the <Col N="412" /> then position was unconstitutional and that an amendment should be brought forward to rectify it, which is what has been done in this Bill.  Generally speaking this is a good Bill but section 3 seems to be somewhat unfair.  My party were unhappy that latent property damage was not included under the terms of the amendment, which we thought could be done.  I am aware of many cases &mdash; two in particular &mdash; where people's homes have been badly damaged by latent faults.  These people who have very limited resources are left in a totally invidious position.  Their homes are falling apart but they have no right under legislation to make a claim against anyone for compensation.  Many other cases from various parts of the country outside my bailiwick have been brought to my attention.  These relate to people who have suffered enormous financial loss because they did not have recourse under legislation to get compensation so that they could repair the damage caused to their homes.  This is unfair.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister has listened to the points made by Opposition spokespersons in this regard and that he will give us an assurance that he intends to bring in a further amendment to the Statute of Limitations Act to put this matter right.  I also hope that he accepts Deputy McCartan's amendment.  It is unfair that some people can be protected in a certain way under the legislation while other people who suffer the same kind of personal injuries are given less protection. There is no justification for this.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another matter, and I am sure the Cheann Comhairle will allow me to refer briefly to it.  This relates to the motor trade, to which this Bill refers.  The motor trade is in chaos at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Even though the practice of importing cars from Japan only began about 18 months ago members of the motor trade have assured me that this is the case.  This legislation may well have effects on the insurance industry and if the Minister is worried about insurance costs, which he said he was on the last occasion we debated this Bill, then he should look at this point also.  I hope the Minister accepts the amendments before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal first with the two amendments before us on Report Stage and to deal subsequently with the other points raised, if that is in order.</P>
      <P>We had a full debate on these amendments on Committee Stage and in accordance with my undertaking to have the position re-examined in the light of the debate which we had, I have consulted with the Department of Industry and Commerce in this matter.  The 1980 Act is the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That Department have advised me that the proposed amendments could have implications for the insurance costs of motor traders in general which would need very careful consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing two-year limitation period for proceedings against a motor dealer by a third party was set in the context of the comprehensive 1980 Act on consumer protection.  The House in setting this and <Col N="414" /> other limitation periods in the 1980 Act established a complex structure of entitlements and obligations with very particular circumstances in mind.  To use this Bill, which deals with the law on negligence, to amend the comprehensive frameword of laws based on statutory obligation would be most unwise.  They are two completely separate systems. Any change to the 1980 Act should be considered in the context of a review of consumer legislation where the full implications, including insurance costs, can be properly considered.  As an example of the growing extent and complexity of consumer protection legislation I might mention the Liability for Defective Products Bill, 1991, which recently passed Second Stage in this House.  This will offer significant additional remedies to consumers and is also being promoted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Consumer protection legislation is a large and complex area of law and one that is of growing importance.  With the establishment of the Single Market there is no danger that it will be neglected.  On the contrary, it will play an increasing role in responding to the needs of the citizens of the entire European Community. However, it is clearly vital that any changes or adaptations in consumer law are proposed in a planned, logical and informed manner with the House having available to it a comprehensive assessment of all the proposals.  This is why I maintained on Committee Stage that amendments to this Bill should be confined to the purpose of the Bill and not seek to make substantive changes to other legislation.  In the light of what I have said, I would ask the House and, in particular, Deputy McCartan not to press these amendments.  I regret, with all the information and advice available to me, that I will not be able to accept them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I thank the Minister of State for his reply, I have to say that, apart from telling us he consulted with the Department of Industry and Commerce who have responsibility for the 1980 Act he did not add anything <Col N="415" /> new to what he said on Committee Stage. He told us the Department had advised him that these amendments would have implications for motor insurance costs, but he gave no indication as to how this might arise and did not substantiate the argument by way of figures or empirical evidence.  As Deputy Cotter said, tomorrow evening we will continue the debate on the issue of insurance costs generally in the motor trade.  No doubt one of the facts which will emerge from this debate is that the insurance industry is one of the most empirically structured and organised industries in the country. Everything is done by way of facts and figures and all the actuarial experience available is brought to bear on the figure which is ultimately given over the counter to the consumer.  I am disappointed that the Minister of State in advancing the reasons given to him by the Department of Industry and Commerce was not in a position to offer us any form of empirical evidence which would support the argument that we should not move to equalise the general provisions dealing with the rights of persons to bring legal action within a stated period of time, namely, three years as proposed in my amendment. Unfortunately, for this reason I am not happy with the Minister of State's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason advanced by the Minister of State was that the framework of the 1980 Act provides a comprehensive scheme dealing with the supply of services and sale of goods.  He made the point that this Bill should not trespass into that area.  I advanced my amendment only on the basis that there already exists in the Bill a provision dealing with the 1980 Act and that the Bill has been extended at the Minister of State's hand into the corpus of law dealing with the sale of goods.  I am merely trekking down a road that has already been trodden by the Minister of State.  Therefore, if I am trespassing so is the Minister of State. Given that the Title states &ldquo;the period of limitation is to run in respect of actions for certain personal injuries, and to <Col N="416" /> amend related provisions in other statutes&rdquo; and that section 3 (3) makes reference to the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, the Minister is not being fair in seeking to reject my amendment on the basis that it is trespassing from one area of law into another.</P>
    <P>The statute of limitations and the law generally is an amalgamation of rules covering liability and tortious action.  The 1957 Act contains a litany of rules with regard to the litigation available and lays down the period within which actions can be initiated to right a wrong.  Therefore, it is not a valid argument that the statute of limitations deals with one area of law and that the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act which provides for the protection of the consumer deals with a separate area of law.  The statute of limitations contains provisions which specify the period of time in which actions can be taken in various areas of the law, be it in respect of breach of contract, breach of conveyancing rules, or a civil action in respect of personal injuries caused by negligence or nuisance.</P>
    <P>The 1980 Act extends the rules contained in the 1957 Act dealing with the delivery of services.  Section 13 of that Act deals primarily with the motor industry and the sale of motor cars.  Therefore one cannot separate them and say that the statute of limitations deals with one area of law and that the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act and other laws deal with another area of law as they are inter-related.  As I said, the statute of limitations, by definition, amounts to a codex and specifies the period within which actions in various areas of law may begin and end.  Therefore, we are not breaking any rules in dealing with something which is primarily covered by the 1980 Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.  As I said, if we are heading in a particular direction I am merely following the path already followed by the Minister of State in drafting the Bill initially.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that the area of law which provides for the protection <Col N="417" /> of the consumer is complex and constantly reviewed.  He instanced the Liability for Defective Products Bill, 1991 which is currently before the Dáil.  When I contributed to the debate on that legislation I pointed out that the origin of that Bill which was circulated by the Minister for Justice lies in a decision of the Council of Ministers in 1976.  One cannot, therefore, be happy at the rate at which legislation in this area is proceeding.  The point also has to be made that the Bill before the House tonight is a direct response to the ruling of the Supreme Court which highlighted the shortcomings of our legislation which has been in existence since 1957.  Therefore, it was an event outside the Minister's Department which propelled him to move in this area.  It is not satisfactory to argue that we should wait and provide for protection of the consumer in consumer law because I believe it will be a long day before we get round to addressing those issues or have a comprehensive statute of limitations introduced in the House.</P>
    <P>Given that this Bill is before the House and because of the provisions contained in section 3 (3), the House should have addressed this issue and the Minister of <Col N="418" /> State should have agreed to accept the amendment I have advanced.  It is a great pity that he did not take the opportunity to accept it.  I believe it is an injustice that while a citizen, can on the one hand, take an action within three years in general law, when we come to the law relating to the sale of goods, with particular reference to the motor industry, he is restricted to taking an action within a two year period.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside all the verbiage that the corpus of law is complex and should not be intertwined, the only reason the Minister of State has advanced is that it would have implications for the motor industry in terms of insurance costs but no figure has been produced to substantiate it.  For those reasons I am not prepared to abandon my amendment.  If some fair grounds had been advanced I would have been prepared to do so.  I ask that the amendment be put.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to substitute an entirely new section for the present section 5 of the Bill.

I was happy to make this amendment in response to comments made by a number of Senators that the precondition in question was somewhat superfluous.  In the context of this amendment I should like to inform the House of a number of developments which have taken place in relation to the young homeless since Report Stage.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of the early enactment of this legislation the health boards have been instructed to step up their efforts to provide accommodation for the young homeless.  My successor as Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Chris Flood, is co-ordinating these efforts and has announced a number of initiatives to increase the number of places available for the young homeless in Dublin and in other major towns and cities.  Additional places for the young homeless will begin to come on stream during the summer and further places will be provided later this year and early next year.  These developments are being funded from the special funds provided under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> for the implementation of this Bill.  I mention all of this in order to underline the Government's concern for the young homeless and to demonstate their commitment to bring to an end the plight of youngsters sleeping rough on the streets of our cities and towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is welcome in principle.  The notion of the health board or of anybody else doing some sort of investigation as to whether a young homeless person is able to provide for his own accommodation is ludicrous. A person would not be in danger of sleeping rough if he had resources to provide accommodation for himself.  The original provision is superfluous and would provide an excuse for not acting swiftly.</P>
      <P>On the wider issue of provisions for the young homeless, while the Minister of State's commitment to expand places is welcome, the House must be acutely concerned at the situation of the young homeless in our towns and cities.  We must also be aware that there has been a decline of roughly 120 places available to such young homeless people in the past five or six years.  The Minister's commitment to provide extra places will not make good that decline.  All the evidence from people who have studied this problem, particularly those involved in such groups as the National Campaign for the Homeless and their youth sub-committee, indicate that this is a growing problem and that there are increasing numbers of young people on our streets who are at serious risk of becoming involved in crime or falling victim to abuse of various sorts.  The Minister must give more than expressions of concern and must provide sufficient resources to address the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reports indicate that there is no emergency accommodation in Limerick or Waterford, none for girls in Galway, inadequate provision in Cork and very serious deficiencies in parts of Dublin.  In announcing extra provisions the Minister appears to be re-announcing previous announcements and consolidating these as if to indicate that 64 extra places will be available.  Many of the 64 places were announced by the previous Minister of State and are being re-announced because they have been slow to come on stream.  We need a firm commitment to the provision of places and a commitment to carry out a national review of the problem of youth homelessness, on the basis <Col N="424" /> of which the Minister can identify the scale of the resources needed.  There are huge discrepancies between official estimates of the scale of the problem and the estimates of voluntary care workers in the field.</P>
    <P>A final point I would like to make is that the Minister of State must look at the whole issue of providing some sort of 24-hour social worker service for young homeless people.  It is not good enough that there is a nine to five service during the week and no service at weekends. There is no chance that the health boards will get a proper handle on the scale of the problem or how they can deal with it properly if that is the sort of service that is provided.  The voluntary groups in the field on a 24-hour basis will tell you people come to them and they have to turn them away.  Focus Point have shown very frightening statistics of more than 50 per cent of those seeking accommodation being turned away, and those who were accommodated very often were accommodated in inappropriate places, perhaps in adult hostels.</P>
    <P>While welcoming this provision which is at the core of the Bill and is a major advance in explicitly giving responsibility to the health boards in this area, I think the Minister must make a greater commitment to provide for what are very obviously outstanding needs in this area.</P>

      <P>I have no difficulty in accepting the Minister's amendment which redrafts section 5 of the Bill.  We spent some considerable time on this section at earlier Stages.  It is important to underscore again the growing problem of homelessness particularly among young people.  Unfortunately, since this Bill was initiated the problem of homelessness generally has magnified very seriously.  When provision, particularly housing provision, is being squeezed as is the current case, and has been the case for the last three years, it is quite clear there will be a knock-on effect which will affect every section of the community. The most worrying aspect is the young people.  It used to be considered that youth homelessness or young people <Col N="425" /> sleeping rough was a phenomenon of our major cities.  However, recent studies have shown that youth homelessness now is a feature of even our small provincial towns and many of us are jolted into having to address that now.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in this Bill that puts a new responsibility on the health board in this regard.  However, I am concerned at a phrase like &ldquo;shall take such steps as are reasonable&rdquo; because I think there should be a clear responsibility to look after these children.  That is what they are, children who are without shelter. I am very worried at a point that runs right through the provisions of this Bill, that health boards are already strapped for resources to do many of the statutory things they are required to do and I do not see them having the wherewithal even to do a proper assessment on the scale of homelessness in every area of the country. They do not have the staffing to carry out their statutory duties at present.  We are devolving more and more duties upon them and squeezing their resources every year.</P>
      <P>We are now in a budgetary situation that again will probably result in a squeeze on the spending Departments. Whenever there is a squeeze it is usually in areas such as health and the environment, both of which are involved in providing housing, and there are many positive initiatives now involving local authorities and health boards jointly up and down the country through voluntary action claiming Government funding to make some sort of sheltered accommodation available to young people and to people at risk.</P>
      <P>I welcome all that, but the current provision is totally inadequate.  It is good to enact a provision like this but if the resources and the staff are not there and if the commitment in terms of finance is not there, then we are at nought.  While I welcome the new draft of section 5, I can only underscore again for the Minister the importance of stating that what we want are not pious words but action to help these very vulnerable people, the children at risk on our streets.</P>

      <P>To make a very brief comment, be it &ldquo;him&rdquo; or &ldquo;her&rdquo;, the reference is to &ldquo;him&rdquo;.  The amendment provides that &ldquo;unless the child is received into the care of the board under the provisions of the Act the board shall take such steps as are reasonable to make available suitable accommodation for him&rdquo;.  One of the greatest scandals of our time is the fact that there are homeless children and no provision has been made up to this to provide for them.  It is very important that this Bill be enacted as early as possible so that the health boards will have the power to make such provision. For that reason I welcome the amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendment and I also welcome the Minister of State back into the House to complete what has been a very worthwhile debate. I am happy that the Bill is to be implemented by the time we take the summer break.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows about the problem of homeless children in Dublin.  Father McVerry's flat in Ballymun has been the focus of a great deal of media attention and nobody could be in any doubt &mdash; but that there is a constituency of young people who are on the streets or living rough.  One could question why this is the case.  Nobody would voluntarily be homeless.  They must be homeless because of very severe social problems, probably related to broken marriages, broken families, alcoholism, unemployment and bad housing, and in a time of recession and high unemployment all these social problems become worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I came across the case of a girl of about 13½ or 14 who left home and went back only about every fortnight. Her father was an alcoholic but she caused a great deal of worry to her mother who was a very good, honourable, nice woman.  As she saw it, she could not control her daughter.  When the daughter was absent from home, I suppose she would be technically homeless. Nobody knew where she was when she was away from home.  For people who are voluntarily homeless there has <Col N="427" /> to be immediate and emergency care. Somewhere young people can be taken and given sleeping accommodation, food and general care and understanding is very much needed.  What can be done under law for young people who leave home because they do not like the discipline at home, do not like where they live, want to be with their pals, and will have no base and who probably will be very difficult to confine in a house or hostel?  Can anything be done about them?</P>
    <P>In terms of providing accommodation, do the health boards consider fostering for young persons of this age?  There has been a lot of talk about hostels and institutions &mdash; I do not want to call them institutions because we are trying to get away from the idea of institutions. However, I would like to think that at the end of the day we will be aiming to put people who have been dislocated from their family or extended family into family-like situations because we all accept that this is the best possible kind of accommodation and environment for young people.  Does this solution figure in the objectives of the health board?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues I welcome the Minister of State in the last lap of this marathon debate on the Child Care Bill.  I welcome also this amendment which legislatively, and hopefully in a practical way, will go a long way to relieving one of the greatest causes of concern and alarm with regard to care of children and their right to State protection.  I would like to ask the Minister in what practical way the health boards might be able to provide the kind of accommodation we are talking about.  As Deputy Fennell and others have pointed out, this is a special kind of accommodation that is not just a roof over the child's head and breakfast in the morning and nothing else.  At this stage we know there are a great number of children who are homeless.  Some who are not deemed homeless literally have only a night's shelter and breakfast and they are out on the streets in the morning.  I know the <Col N="428" /> Minister will take into consideration the special social position in this country where children who are homeless are particularly at risk because of the level of child prostitution and child pornography which has increased alarmingly.  Anything we can do to protect our children and give them accommodation that does not leave them vulnerable to that choice should be a priority.</P>
      <P>The other phenomenon which may have existed always but which is now being recognised, and a certain amount of help is now being offered, is the whole area of child sexual abuse.  I have been told by people who work with homeless children particularly that one of the reasons not disclosed by the child or young adult is that they have been forced to leave their house because of sexual abuse or attempted sexual abuse.  Sometimes they are loath to disclose that for family and other reasons.  It has to be dealt with very sensitively.  Above all, we must have a practical level of protection and security for children who find themselves in these dreadful situations.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if some type of half-way house or village in each health board area could be provided for children who need that type of security and protection as well as training and a normal home life in so far as that is possible. As Deputy Fennell said, the last thing we want is to institutionalise young people.  In other countries, such as Austria, there are SOS villages for children at risk or who have been made homeless.  They are accommodated in as near normal conditions as possible, not just in family surroundings but in social conditions that allow them to train and, hopefully, to obtain employment and move out of the area.  In using our resources &mdash; let us hope the resources exist &mdash; could we possibly focus them in innovative ways so that we give a normal background and protection to the children who have been discriminated against by being rendered homeless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if it is necessary.  I want to assure the House that the Government are absolutely committed to reducing and alleviating this serious problem of youth homelessness. We are very worried about it.  A high-powered Government committee under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach involving all the relevant Ministers, Ministers of State, Departmental Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries have been working on it for some time.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Flood, as I have said earlier, is the coordinator and has overall responsibility for this area.  I am disappointed Deputy R. Bruton has denigrated somewhat my confirmation of what we proposed &mdash; perhaps it was announced earlier.  I want to confirm that we gave a commitment that we would increase the number of places for these young people to a certain level in this capital city and we are doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As recently as today, my Government collegue and successor as Minister of State at the Department of Health. Deputy Flood, held a meeting of representatives of all the major voluntary bodies dealing with the problem of youth homelessness in the Dublin area.  I underestand that the matters raised by Deputy <Col N="430" /> Bruton and all the other speakers here were discussed and broad agreement was reached on the need for a co-ordinated response by the voluntary and statutory services to this serious situation.  A number of suggestions have been put forward &mdash; the SOS village concept by Deputy Barnes, fostering by Deputy Fennell and a number of suggestions made by other people.  I am pleased to say that we have initiated a new project through the Eastern Health Board which will provide some places for foster care for these bigger young people who find themselves in this situation.  We are working on that. It is a delicate area but we are reasonably optimistic and it will reach a satisfactory conclusion and we may be able to extend it to other areas where necessary.  I can assure the House we are totally committed to eliminating this serious problem and I know that Deputies are seriously concerned about it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2)  A care order shall commit the child to the care of the health board for so long as he remains a child or for such shorter period as the court may determine and, in such case, the court may, of its own motion or on the application of any person, extend the operation of the order if the court is satisfied that grounds for the making of a care order continue to exist with respects to the child.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where a care order is in force, the health board shall&mdash;&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The amendment to section 18 is a technical one which has been recommended by the parliamentary draftsman.  It deals with cases where a court decides not to make a care order until the child reaches 18 years but makes a care order for a shorter period of time.</P>
      <P>Where the court makes a short-term care order, it is important that it should have the ability to extend the order later if that proves necessary.  At present, section 22 (a) provides that the court may renew a care order.  I am advised that the provision in section 22 is too vague and that some criteria need to be laid down as to the circumstances in which care orders may be renewed or extended.  The amendment to section 18 deals with this by providing that a court may extend a care order if grounds for the making of a care order continue to exist with respect to the child.  I believe that this formula provides better safeguards for the child and his parents against unnecessary or excessive extensions of care orders.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 17, between lines 29 and 30, the following section inserted:</P>
      <P> 26.&mdash;(1)  If in any proceedings under Part IV or VI the child to whom the proceedings relate is not a party, the court may, if it is satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of the child and in the interests of justice to do so, appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> for the child.</P>
      <P>(2)  Any costs incurred by a person in acting as a guardian <i>ad litem</i> under this section shall be paid by the health board concerned.  The health board may apply to the court to have the amount of any such costs or expenses measured or taxed.</P>
      <P>(3)  The court which has made an order under subsection (1) may, on the application to it of a health board, order any other party to the proceedings in question to pay to the board any costs or expenses payable by that board under subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Where a child in respect of whom an order has been made under subsection (1) becomes a party to the proceedings in question (whether by virtue of an order under section 25 <Col N="439" /> (1) or otherwise) then that order shall cease to have effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This important amendment provides for the appointment of guardians <i>ad litem</i> for children in care proceedings.  On Committee Stage in the Seanad I was urged by a number of Senators to look at the possibility of including such a provision in the Bill.  Having examined the matter in detail and following intensive consultations with the Attorney General and the Minister for Health and between my staff and the staff of the Office of the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman, we came to the conclusion that a provision which would enable a court to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> for a child in appropriate cases would enhance the legal framework we are putting in place.  Accordingly, I was pleased to introduce this amendment on Report Stage in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) will empower a court in proceedings under Part IV or Part VI of the Bill to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> for the child in any case when the court considers it necessary to do so in the interests of the child.  Subsection (2) provides that the expenses of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> shall be paid by the health board involved in the proceedings.  Subsection (3) will entitle a health board to apply to the court for an order requiring the expenses of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> to be paid by any other parties to the proceedings. Subsection (4) provides that an order appointing a guardian <i>ad litem</i> for a child shall cease to have effect where the child subsequently becomes a party to the proceedings.</P>
    <P>The detailed provisions regarding guardians <i>ad litem</i> will be dealt with by way of rules of court.  I am advised that it is not necessary to provide for this in the legislation itself.  I see this as a major fundamental change.  It was requested in this House and by professional bodies. We gave it very detailed consideration and I am delighted to come back to the House with this amendment.  I hope the House will agree it.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment. We argued very strongly for it in the House, particularly in the special committee.  The most trenchant and consistent case was made by my constituency colleague, Deputy Yates, another member of the old team who is not present tonight.  It was unfortunate that the Minister at that stage could not concede the measure.  This very important principle has been worked on by the Minister.  If there is an argument for the retention of the Seanad it is that it improves legislation such as this and allows for a consultative process.  It very much underscores the value of a second Chamber.  We are a very cosy club here and we spent a very long time arguing the merits of this case.  There was a very consistent view from this side of the House.  I commend the Minister for taking on board the strong case put and being able to convince his colleagues and, indeed, the Attorney General to include this important amendment.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. My concern is that the work of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> would be in conflict with that of the social worker.  In practically all cases there is involvement by a social worker.  Will the Minister outline the role of this person?  I have a feeling that there could be a conflict in this regard and I would like the Minister to spell out the matter more clearly.</P>

      <P>Not being one of the happy family who considered this Bill in committee I would like some information from the Minister as to the nature of the person who is appointed guardian.  Are we to understand that the child will be represented legally in this way and that all the costs will be met?  Is that the intention of the appointment of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> or is there more to it than just legal representation?  The idea that the child should be actively represented is very welcome, but perhaps the Minister will expand a little as to the precise nature of the powers being given to the guardian who would be appointed by the court.</P>

      <P>I join in welcoming this amendment which strengthens the section and gives support for children in need of this type of guardian.  The court may, if it is satisfied it is necessary in the interests of the child and in the interests of justice, to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> for the child.  I know we cannot interpret the workings of the court but I would like to think that the court will interpret that provision in the most supportive and productive way in the majority of cases.  This measure should be not just part of legislation but the courts should actively use it if and when necessary.</P>

      <P>At the risk of repetition I also welcome this amendment.  It is an issue on which we had very long and detailed debate.  Appeals were made to the Minister to reconsider the matter.  I am particularly pleased with the amendment because it is setting a precedent. Many of the responses to the requests for this amendment were that this procedure has never been operated and could not be operated, that our system could not deal with it.  It is a little like the concessions granted in the recent rape legislation, although they did not go as far as this.  This is a very positive and worthwhile measure and I am delighted it has been included in the legislation.  I am one of the original clan that was involved in this legislation and I would like the Minister to spell out how the guardian <i>ad litem</i> system will operate and whether it is working in other jurisdictions.  Will the Minister give some examples of its operation?</P>

      <P>The pleadings of Deputies did not go unheard.  They pleaded very sincerely about the matter and we considered it in great depth.  We did not find it very easy to agree to all the demands because of the impediments and difficulties that existed but, through a process of detailed dialogue and constant negotiation, we were able to reach a consensus in achieving what was desired.  The guardian <i>ad litem</i> system operates in the United Kingdom jurisdiction.  In <Col N="442" /> response to what has been said, particularly by Deputy Sherlock, it is to ensure that there will be no conflict that we have agreed to this amendment.  Social workers work for health boards and lawyers or solicitors operate on a legal basis in the interests of the child.  The interests of the parents also have to be taken into account.  It is clear in the Bill that in court proceedings the interests of the child must be of prime importance.  The purpose of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> would be to represent the child, take care of the child, observe the child and ensure that the child's interests are protected beyond any doubt in the care proceedings, the court proceedings and in the interim period.  Instead of a solicitor the court appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> or, alternatively, in the interests of the child the court could appoint both a solicitor and a guardian <i>ad litem.</i></P>
      <P>Under this section the health board will be responsible for the expenses of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> but the health board in turn will be able to seek a refund of the money expended from a party or parties to the proceedings if it can be proven conclusively that those parties have the necessary resources to contribute to the costs.  The court would have the right to decide who the guardian <i>ad litem</i> would be.  It could be a social worker but in most cases the rcommendation would be that the social worker would not be a colleague of or working for the health board in question.  It is to avoid any conflict and to ensure that above all the interests of the child are protected in absolute terms that we agreed to the measure.</P>

      <P>Will the guardian be selected from the social worker profession or will he or she be a psychologist or a lay person?  Will the court select this person or will the person apply?  I can envisage difficulties in the appointment of this person.  I would like the Minister to say how the person will be appointed.</P>

      <P>The guardian <i>ad litem</i> could be from any profession, could be related to the child, a friend of the child, <Col N="443" /> a family friend, a neighbour or a teacher, somebody whom the health board would be able to recommend.  The court, on the basis of the information before it, will decide whether to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, a social worker, a solicitor or perhaps a guardian <i>ad litem</i> and a solicitor. The person would not have to be professionally trained but should be responsible and be able to execute responsibility in the interests of the child and satisfy the court that the interests of the child would be protected in the interim.</P>

      <P>The amendment raises the whole issue of the adequacy of staffing at residential centres.  Does the Minister envisage regulations to specify minimum requirements under the different headings of design, staffing and so on?  Could he indicate what kind of standards he is setting out, and does he know whether health boards generally have adequate standards?  By setting out those standards, is the Minister committing himself to funding for health boards to step up the standards of available services?</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>Section 40: In page 22, before section 40, the following section inserted:</P>
      <P> 40.&mdash;(1) The Minister shall make regulations in relation to the making of arrangements by health boards under section 35 (1) (d) for the care of children and for securing generally the welfare of such children.</P>
      <P>(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), regulations under this section may&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  fix the conditions under which children may be placed by health boards with relatives;</P>
      <P>(b)  prescribe the form of contract to be entered into by a health board with relatives;</P>
      <P>(c)  provide for the supervision and visiting by a health board of children placed with relatives.&rdquo;.  </P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that there is provision for the making of regulations in relation to the placement of children with relatives by health boards.</P>
      <P>The amendment is broadly similar to sections 38 and 39 which require the Minister for Health to make regulations in relation to the placing of children in foster care and residential care respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new section will also ensure that relatives who care for children on behalf of health boards will receive appropriate <Col N="449" /> payments from the boards for doing so. I wish to emphasise this point in order to counteract suggestions that the exclusion of relatives from the definition of a foster parent, which was inserted in the Bill on Report Stage in the Dáil at the request of Opposition Deputies, would result in relatives being denied payments.  These suggestions are without foundation.  It was never the intention to preclude the payment of allowances to relatives who look after children on behalf of health boards.  The insertion of this new section in the Bill places this beyond doubt.</P>

      <P>This section was the subject of considerable debate on both Committee and Report Stages.  Consensus view was expressed that in very many cases the best place for children to be placed was in foster care.  We wanted to underscore the importance of foster care generally.  It would often be a member of the extended family who could best provide that care.  I do not think it was ever anybody's intention to exclude such a provider of foster care from the benefits of any support or remuneration that might be available simply on the basis of their blood relationship to the child concerned.  I very much welcome this clarification of an intent that was always there.  The amendment is an improvement to the Bill.</P>

I have known of cases in my constituency in which the natural and obvious person to take a child when there was a problem in a family was an aunt, uncle or grandparent. I have found instances of hardship there.  It was very unfair to expect a child's relative, who would probably be in straitened circumstances, to buy shoes, clothes and so on for an extra person without support.

      <P>Section 41: In page 22, lines 16 to 21, subsection (2) deleted.</P>
      <P>The original draft of this section provoked a lot of controversy, particularly among foster parents, who saw it as a threat to the security of their foster placements. As a result of representations which I received from the Irish Foster Care Association, I brought forward a number of amendments in the Dáil in order to allay these fears and to provide a fairer deal for foster parents.  I gave further consideration to the situation before the debate in the Seanad and, as a result, I brought forward these additional amendments to deal with some residual problems.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these two amendments is to remove the existing subsection (2), which many foster parents found offensive, and to substitute what I believe is a more acceptable approach.  The existing subsection (2) makes it an offence for foster parents to refuse to deliver up a foster child on demand to the health board.  As I said, many foster parents found this offensive and saw it as a big stick being held over them by the health board.</P>
      <P>While I am satisfied that health boards would not abuse this provision, I am sensitive to the feelings and fears of foster parents.  Accordingly, under the new subsection a foster parent would be guilty of an offence only if he or she refused to obey a court order to return a child to the health board.</P>

    <P>This amendment was recommended by the parliamentary draftsman in order to bring this section into line with the amendments to section 41.

Its purpose is to ensure that there will be no difficulties in obtaining an order for the recovery of a child who has been removed from care or for granting a warrant to the gardaí to search for such a child.

      <P>&ldquo;56.&mdash;For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that the provisions of this Part shall not apply to&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  the care of one or more pre-school children undertaken by a relative of the child or children or the spouse of such relative,</P>
      <P>(b)  a person taking care of one or more pre-school children of the same family and no other such children (other than that person's own such children) in that person's home,</P>
      <P>(c)  a person taking care of not more than 3 pre-school children of different families (other than that person's own such children) in that person's home.&rdquo;.  </P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it absolutely clear that the provisions of Part VII do not apply to the care of pre-school children undertaken by a relative or a neighbour of the parents.  I introduced the amendment in response to concerns expressed by a number of Senators form all sides about the possible application of the requirements of Part VII to such arrangements.</P>
      <P>The whole thrust of Part VII is to regulate facilities such as playgroups and creches which cater for groups of young children from different families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was never the intention to interfere in arrangements made by working parents with a relative or a neighbour of theirs to look after their children for them.  Amendment 50 places this beyond doubt.  Paragraph (a) exempts a relative <Col N="455" /> or his or her spouse from the requirements of Part VII.  Paragraph (b) exempts a person taking care of children of the same family only in that person's home. Paragraph (c) exempts a person looking after not more than three children of different families in that person's home. I thrust this will clarify the situation to the satisfaction of everybody and in particular working parents who rely on their relations and their friends and neighbours to take care of their young children.</P>

      <P>I can see the difficulty with this.  It is difficult to determine what is a playschool and what is not a playschool. The definition sounds as if a good Jesuit sat down and determined that one can have any of these criteria: if the person is related to the children it is not a playschool; if the person has only children from one family and his own children, it is not a playschool; or if fewer than three children of any family are involved it is not a playschool.

      <P>This gives me a warm feeling of confidence when we are going down to one and two child families, that we really will have inspections.

I would like to think that we are going to <Col N="456" /> carry this out very diligently and I am very happy about that.  I can accept the first two subsections but I wonder about a person taking care of not more than three pre-school children of different families in that person's home.

However is there any way in which there can be, if not inspection, some routine way of making sure that children in a family home like that actually have the kind of conditions that we earnestly fought for with regard to pre-school facilities?  Would that be seen as an invasion of the privacy of the home?  I understand the difficulty is that it was considered that that would be an invasion of privacy and therefore it could not be investigated in the same broad open way as a pre-school facility with more than three children from different families.</P>

I feel that it we can implement all sections of this legislation on supervision, whether care or otherwise, and exempt the families mentioned here we will not be doing too badly at all. I can visualise a situation where a person who has spare time is prepared to take one or two children.  This is common enough in most towns and villages where <Col N="457" /> there are working parents and the Minister is actually exempting those from inspection.

      <P>I did not have consultations with any Jesuit on this matter but the Senatorial Jesuits did convince me that there might be a problem.  I considered this and took advice on it.  We looked at what information and recommendations were available and we found the Task Force on Child Care and the Working Party on Childcare facilities all recommended that below a certain threshold the State would not interfere.  We also felt that we must have a certain consideration for local comradeship, neighbourliness, care, thoughtfulness and community support for one another, particularly in housing estates where some people are at work and others are not and where in certain circumstances the woman next door or somebody down the estate takes the children.  It was felt that where there were up to three children things should be left.  The worry in the Seanad was that we might be overinspecting. We felt also that the parents themselves who place these children in the daily care of their neighbours have a fundamental responsibility themselves to ensure that their children are not at risk. In the interests of parental judgment and responsibility, of community relations and support for one another, we felt that in cases of more than three children we should be involved but below that number we should not get involved.</P>

      <P>With the agreement of the House I porpose to discuss amendments Nos. 57 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>Section 63 provides for the introduction of a pension scheme for the staff of the 40 or so children's residential centres around the country.  This has long been sought by the staff concerned and by their trade unions and associations.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to bring the pension scheme into operation as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted.  The section as now drafted could serve to delay the introduction of the pension scheme.  This is because the existing paragraph (c) provides that the scheme will only apply to centres that are registered under this Part.  Obviously it will take some little time to set up the new registration procedures and to make the necessary regulations for the purposes of this Part.  As the section is now drafted, the pension scheme could not be introduced until all of those preparations had been completed.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendments therefore is to delete the existing paragraph (c) so as to enable this section to be brought into operation in advance of the other provisions of this Part.

      <P>This amendment is to an amendment I put in on Committee Stage, to give the power to the Garda to intervene and remove a substance from a child who is abusing it in the streets.  It is shocking to see children staggering in the streets with their faces in bags containing glue.  I am not 100 per cent sure as to whether the word &ldquo;inhale&rdquo; is better than the word &ldquo;misused&rdquo;.  While we were primarily concerned with glue sniffing, I hope a garda would be in a position to <Col N="461" /> remove from a child any substance which would cause him to be intoxicated in public, whether it was administered by inhalation or otherwise.  I am happy that the amendment I put forward on Committee Stage was accepted by the Minister at that stage, and if he is convinced that the word &ldquo;inhaled&rdquo; is better than the word &ldquo;misused&rdquo; I will not argue with him at this stage.</P>

      <P>We welcome that section and I support Deputy Howlin on this.  If a garda sees a child purchasing or holding a substance and seriously believes that it is to be inhaled or abused could he be accused of exceeding his authority if he takes the substance from the child and if the child has not actually inhaled it even though everybody would know that he was going to do so?</P>

      <P>I commend Deputy Howlin for bringing in this amendment. Many other valuable amendments were suggested by all Members of the House involved in this committee.  In my effort to convince my colleagues in the Seanad of the necessity to have an improvement carried out, I had to pay a further tribute to Deputy Howlin and I eventually got agreement.  The difficulty in relation to the point Deputy Barnes raised is that there are a range of products which children might purchase on behalf of parents or somebody else, which might come into this category and it could create a difficulty for the Garda in trying to execute the law.  We have to be absolutely certain that when a garda is executing the law he knows exactly what must be done and knows when to take action.  This is a very important change in the Bill.  It will eliminate many of the serious problems that initially create major difficulties for children and ultimately lead them into the drugs scene.</P>

      <P>A modern children's Act has been long overdue.  Everyone concerned is waiting for that legislation to be enacted.  It will mean a more efficient procedure for the protection of children. The 1908 Act was all right in its day but it was not capable of meeting the needs of today.  There is concern among social workers and people involved with children about the delay so far.  I join with Deputy Bruton in putting the question as to when we can hope to have this legislation in place so that we can see the effect of it on our own areas?  I welcome the legislation.  It has been well deliberated on and I have no doubt that it is good legislation.</P>

      <P>I assure the House that so far as the Government are concerned we do not have any desire to delay further the implementation of that Bill.  As soon as the Bill is passed we will proceed with drawing up six different sets of regulations pertaining to various aspects of the legislation.  We will continue our consultations with the health boards and we will draw up the regulations but above all we will have to consult with the Rules of Court Committee representing the courts.  As soon as that consultation has taken place and the rules of courts have been agreed we will proceed.  Certain parts of the Bill can be implemented very quickly.  We will proceed as quickly as we can.  We have £1 million available to spend in 1991.  This was allocated in this year's budget in anticipation of the Oireachtas passing this Bill.  We are confident that we will be able to proceed quickly.</P>

I should also like to pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy and, without discriminating against anyone, to the Special Committee.  The commitment shown by all members of that committee is an indication of the efficacy, competence and effectiveness of such committees. I should like much more of our complex legislation to be dealt with in that way.  I should also like to pay tribute to Deputy Fitzpatrick who chaired the committee in a tolerant and flexible manner which enabled all of us to have a full input and to Deputy Yates commitment. He also displayed his wide knowledge of this area.</P>
      <P>This is an historic Bill and I hope it will be implemented as quickly as possible. Finally, I should like to pay tribute to the draftspeople who have shown such competence and commitment.  It took a long time to bring this Bill before the House and I hope it will stand the test of time.  If it needs to be updated I hope it will not take as long as it took to update the 1908 Act.  This is an historic occasion and I enjoyed very much being involved in the debate on the Bill.

      <P>I should like to be associated with the remarks on this worthwhile legislation which was debated in a way which is a model of how legislation should proceed, that is, the Government should not come into this House and think they are the repository of all wisdom.  They should be open and flexible to accept views from all sides of the House and transform this House, which unfortunately too often is simply a rubber stamping mechanism, into a legislative assembly.  In recent times we have seen too many Bills parachuted in here and guillotined through without proper analysis or any attempt being made to go <Col N="464" /> through them section by section in a preliminary way.  We have gone through this Bill in a very professional way and I commend the Government and, in particular, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, for the open and generous way in which he approached the Bill.  As Deputy Barnes said, I hope this Bill will be a framework which will protect the children of Ireland for many years to come.</P>

I realised at the outset that this was very important legislation.  I sincerely thank all the members of the committee, the Opposition spokespersons and all those who contributed to the debates in this House and the Seanad.  Not alone did this House make a mammoth contribution towards improving the Bill but Seanad Éireann made a very important contribution also. I should like to sincerely thank the staff of the Child Care division of the Department of Health, my former Department, for their tremendous dedication and work and for the positive attitude they adopted.  They had tremendous liaison with all the other relevant sections of Government and Government Departments. I should also like to thank the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman for their personal consultations with my staff and myself which enabled us to achieve the consensus which all Deputies desired.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most important and socially progressive Bills ever passed by the Oireachtas.  It has not rushed through.  We have passed a Bill which will be very worthwhile at the end of the day in protecting the interests of the children of our country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Yates has given me notice of his intention to raise the matter as to whether a full inquiry will be held into the causes and circumstances of the bus accident yesterday on the Dublin-Rosslare route, the terms of the inquiry, when it will be carried out and the arrangements which have been made for the health and welfare of those involved and their families.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh has given me notice of his intention to raise a rather similar matter as to whether the Minister for the Environment intends to hold an investigation into the horrific crash involving a CIE bus which injured up to 50 people on the N11 on 1 July on a stretch of road which has been repaired on several occasions and which recently has been the scene of a fatal accident as well as numerous other accidents.</P>
      <P>As the matters raised by Deputies Yates and Kavanagh are very similar I suggest that the Deputies should first make their five minute statements, to be followed by the Minister for the Environment who will then reply to both Deputies.  I first call Deputy Yates to make his five minute statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this very sad and important matter.  I should say at the outset that the wife and three daughters of a close friend of mine were on the bus.  I have very strong feelings about this matter and I do not believe it has been handled correctly by the Government.  I do not say this in any political way.  While important questions have correctly been raised in relation to the condition of the road, I believe the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and Bus Éireann have responsibility for this issue. The Minister for Tourism and Communications who has responsibility for public transport should be present in the House to respond to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a miracle there was no major loss of life in this accident.  This bus was driving on one side of the road when it careered off the road, turned over and <Col N="466" /> ended up in a ditch, upside down, on the opposite side of the road facing in the opposite direction from which it came. The people at the back of the bus, including one of my constituents, a 15 year old girl, were trapped and could not get out. Very hot oil poured down the backs of two people.  I visited Loughlinstown Hospital last night and tonight and I am aware that one gentleman has been extremely badly burned on his back. Other people are in intensive care in St. Vincent's Hospital.  As I have said, it is a miracle there was not major loss of life.</P>
    <P>In view of the gravity of this accident, I call on the Government to carry out, as is standard practice in relation to train accidents, a full public inquiry into this accident.  I was in touch with the managing director's office of Bus Éireann today.  He is on holidays but his office informed me they are carrying out an internal inquiry into the accident.  I am not happy with this as such an inquiry will not be carried out in a totally impartial and independent way: that organisation will carry out the inquiry in their own way and the results may not be made public.  In order to ensure that further accidents like this do not recur, it is vital that a full public inquiry is carried out, the outcome of which should be made public.</P>
    <P>I have detected from the comments made by Bus Éireann both in the papers and to me that they believe the condition of the road caused the accident and that their driver and bus were all right.  I drive up and down that road three times a week, virtually 52 weeks of the year and, while I accept that the condition of the road is unsatisfactory, I do not believe this was the main cause of the accident. My car has never overturned on the road. I want to state categorically that I do not believe the main cause of the accident was the poor condition of the road.</P>
    <P>Having visited the hospital last night and tonight it is remarkable to think that no representative of Bus Éireann or public official has visited the hospital to see if these people are dead or alive.  They have not shown any interest whatsoever in their welfare.  Whatever about liability and subsequent claims for compensation, it is only proper that Bus Éireann should <Col N="467" /> show some concern for their customers. One lady who has been discharged from hospital has to get home to Letterkenny tomorrow night but she has no way of getting there.  No one from Bus Éireann has contacted these people to see how they will get home.  Neither have they offered to provide transport for their families to visit them in hospital.  Some members of a family from Enniscorthy will be discharged tomorrow while others will not.  How will these people travel up and down to Dublin to see their relatives? This matter has been dealt with in an indifferent and complacent way.  I very much regret having to say this but I am very dissatisfied with the way in which this matter has been dealt with.</P>
    <P>If we want to have a successful intercity bus service it is very important that the public have the utmost confidence in the safety, speed and reliability of that service.  If Bus Éireann want to promote greater confidence in their services it is vital for them to ensure that a public inquiry is carried out, that every provision is made to look after the health and welfare of the families and, in conjunction with Wicklow County Council, that every step is taken to prevent this type of accident occurring again.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister for the Environment to discuss the matter with his colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Brennan, to ensure that a proper inquiry is held.  I could quote two recent instances, one in Claremorris and the other in County Kildare, where proper inquiries were held into train accidents. The fact that people were critically injured justifies the holding of a similar inquiry now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Ceann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important matter which is a source of concern nationally.  This horrific accident on the N11 in my constituency involving a CIE bus in which 40 people were injured of whom 15 are still in <Col N="468" /> hospital &mdash; three are seriously ill &mdash; warrants a full inquiry by the Minister for the Environment into all the circumstances surrounding it.  Many questions, not only relating to the construction and design of the road but also to the reason the road has had to be reconstructed at this spot on three occasions during the past eight years at a cost of many millions of pounds, must be answered.</P>
      <P>A farmer who lives on this stretch of road has had to attend at six accidents since the most recent reconstruction of the road which was completed three months ago.  Only three weeks ago at the same spot an articulated lorry went out of control and hit an oncoming car, the lady driver of which was fatally injured. Other serious accidents have occurred but, thankfully, they did not have the same consequences.  Mr. and Mrs. Hudson live in fear day and night that there will be a recurrence.  It cannot simply be a question of the drivers of vehicles being to blame either totally or partially.  Last Saturday when driving home from Arklow following the election count the road was like a sheet of glass as the tar had come through and was wet. It was frightening to drive on it as there was no adhesion.</P>
      <P>Many millions of pounds of State and European funds have been spent on the road.  There is a duty on the Minister to see that this money is spent in a proper fashion on behalf of the public.  Everyone living in the area feared that a major accident would occur.  Thankfuly, on this occasion there were no fatalities but, nevertheless, it has had serious consequences. The Minister will no doubt have received a full report on the accident from the emergency services in County Wicklow and have been made aware of the difficulties surrounding the reconstruction of the road at this point but the only way the Minister will be able to reassure us that all the facts will be made known and that action will be taken to ensure that the road is redesigned and reconstructed is by ordering a full public inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to give one minute of my time to my colleague from County Wexford to express his concerns with regard to this road, Euro-route No. 1, <Col N="469" /> the N11, which carries a heavy volume of traffic daily heading towards County Wexford and the boats for the Continent?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to thank the emergency services which attended at the accident, the gardaí from Arklow, Wicklow and Gorey, the doctors &mdash; some of whom left their cars &mdash; the matron and almost the entire staff of Wicklow County Hospital, the ambulance staffs from many counties, the fire services, the local people, and the staff of St. Colmcille's Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital and St. Michael's Hospital.  All those people rendered valuable assistance on this occasion.  We hope this will not be asked for in the future.  The Minister should indicate to the House, and to the people of Counties Wicklow and Wexford, that an inquiry will be held to find out why accidents occurred so frequently during the past few years at this spot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kavanagh for allowing me to add my voice to those which have called for a complete and full inquiry into this horrific accident.  We are lucky that there were no fatalities.  There is tremendous concern in the Counties of Wicklow and Wexford about the quality of the road and the numerous accidents which have occurred at this spot.  I do not wish to apportion blame tonight as that is not my job or that of any Member but we have to restore the confidence of the public who use what is supposed to be the most important road in Ireland, Euro-route No. 1 which links the port of Rosslare with Larne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year 1.2 million people passed through the port of Rosslare.  The port is growing and traffic on the road is getting heavier.  A substantial amount of money has been expended on it and I am sure the Minister will give us details.  It is ironic that the accident occurred at a location where works have been taking place for months.  Those of us who use the road each day made representations to our colleagues in County Wicklow relating to the length of time it was taking to complete the road works.  Road works were also completed there last year, yet accidents seem to recur.  I use the road at least two or three times each week and, despite all the works and the expenditure <Col N="470" /> of a large amount of money, it does not seem to have been improved.  I add my voice to those who called for a full public inquiry to be held as speedily as possible into this horrific accident to ensure that any faults are rectified immediately to prevent a recurrence.  I congratulate the emergency services who responded in a magnificent way to this tragic accident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me add my voice to those of the other Members who have expressed their deep concern at yesterday's accident. We are grateful that no lives have been lost and hope that the injured, some of whom are seriously injured, make a speedy recovery to full health.  I know the House will join with me in expressing our praise and gratitude to the emergency services and hospital staff for their speedy and efficient response.  Indeed, their efforts helped greatly in minimising the suffering of those involved.  They deserve our praise and I join with my colleagues in expressing it.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that the Garda Síochána have already launched a thorough investigation into the accident. In addition, Bus Éireann are also carrying out an investigation.  My Department have consistently monitored on a specific basis traffic accidents involving buses.  I have asked both the Garda and Bus Éireann to submit their reports to the Department when completed.  Those investigations should be allowed to proceed to finality and if at that stage I feel a further examination is required the matter can be considered further under section 66 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am reluctant to comment further in case any such comment might be deemed to prejudice any possible court proceedings or civil proceedings which may be taken.  However, I would like to record that the road works carried out in recent times in the vicinity of the accident location were improvement works rather than repair works.  For example, prior to 1989, works which included road widening and the provision of turning lanes were undertaken.  In 1989 road drainage works on both sides of the road were <Col N="471" /> carried out and since 1990 road strengthening works have been ongoing.  Deputies are quite right when they say that a great deal of public money has been expended over the years on this stretch of road.  Of course, it is a vital artery in the road network serving the major link with the main port in the south.  The section of road in question is a roadworks site where road improvements works are still being carried out and traffic is, therefore, driving on a temporary road surface. This fact is drawn to the attention of road users by nine elaborate road warning signs on a distance of just over one kilometre in advance of the point where the bus left the road.  There are many signs, and I have some copies of them here, but we do not have to go into that this evening.</P>
    <P>The accident happened in very bad conditions following a period of torrential rain which resulted in a great deal of water on the road.  This factor together with driving on a temporary road surface certainly led to difficult driving conditions.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that we launched a major road safety campaign last year which has been having some considerable success.  Its success can be judged through the reduction in road deaths and injuries this year.  In the first four months of the year provisional figures show that road deaths fell by over 26 per cent compared with the same period last year and we sincerely hope that the downward trend in road casualty figures will continue.  However, this accident highlights the capacity for tragedies to occur and every effort must be made by all road users as well as the various statutory bodies to ensure that such incidents continue to be a rarity.</P>
    <P>We are taking very careful note of everything concerned with the ongoing investigation into this accident.  I will be considering the matter further when I have the reports.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank you, Sir, for allowing my question on the Adjournment and I wish also to thank <Col N="472" /> the Minister of State for coming here to take the question.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that there is a chronic problem in remedial education at first level, and certainly at second level, and one of the biggest problems in the education system is the lack of resources for dealing with slow learners in the conventional school scheme.  There is a shortage but I acknowledge that in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Minister made a gesture in recognition of this by including section 69 (e) which provides that:</P>
      <P>A phased programme, starting in 1992-93 and for completion in 1994-95 will be introduced to provide for the recognition on an ex-quota basis of 0.5 of a wholetime post for guidance in secondary and community/ comprehensive schools in the 350-499 enrolment category.</P>
      <P>Similarly an additional 60 posts will be allocated to post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas.  This is a small gesture of recognition of the problem.  However, the problem will not get better over the years particularly in view of the fact that the Department have run their own short term release courses for training approximately 40 plus special teachers each year. What has happened is that this year that number has been reduced to something in the mid-twenties, despite the fact that there is an increasing demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been inundated with correspondence from teachers who want to get on those courses but cannot get a place because of the restriction on numbers and also from teachers who have taken it upon themselves, on their own initiative, to attend courses run in UCG. There is a very commendable course &mdash; the diploma in compensatory and remedial education &mdash; a one year fulltime course to teach pupils with learning difficulties and special needs.  This course is recognised by the Department of Education for the purpose of teacher secondment and release.  I have been approached by four teachers from different school categories, who are taking part in this course &mdash; two from the voluntary non-fee paying secondary school sector, one from a vocational school in County <Col N="473" /> Mayo and from the community school sector in the Midlands.  Without exception, they had to employ a substitute teacher at his or her own expense.</P>
    <P>The Department have the power to agree to a paid substitute secondment but have not chosen to use it.  I can give an example of a teacher in the south-east in a fee-paying secondary school with an open intake policy which has 600 pupils. The school has no remedial expertise among the existing staff.  The school has tried for some years to get some of the existing staff on the Department's remedial course, but because this teacher is not being funded from the school it is costing him in the region of £6,000 to £7,000 net to attend this course.  I concede there is recognition for tax relief purposes of the substitute's payment but after claiming this relief it is still costing this teacher between £6,000 and £7,000 to go on the course; this includes course fees, subsistence, texts costing over £200, travel, etc. apart from the inconvenience of being absent from home and from school.  When this is taken in conjunction with the fact there is no additional salary for this extra qualification, it shows that the Department are being remiss in this area.  I am asking the Department of Education to recognise and reward the commitment of teachers who, of their own volition, on their own initiative, without prompting from anybody or without pressure from the school, have undertaken to be away from home for several months of the year out of concern for the children who cannot cope with the conventional curriculum and because of their commitment to their job.  I fail to understand why the Department should make an exception of this category of teacher.  People who undertake other courses, teachers who undertake a diploma in special care, training and tuition for the deaf or the blind, receive £802 per annum.</P>
    <P>When members of the Garda Síochána seek leave of absence to undertake a course of study, in a particular discipline they receive payment, and the same thing applies in the Civil Service proper and people who want to better themselves receive a financial reward.  This is a good <Col N="474" /> cause and is worthy of serious consideration.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has raised this matter as it gives me an opportunity to inform the House of my Department's position.</P>
      <P>With regard to the post-primary sector, the Deputy will be aware that 60 teaching posts were allocated to schools in disadvantaged areas under the terms of circular letter 27/90.  School authorities were told that the resource provided should be used to counteract, as far as possible, the impact of disadvantage and that consideration should be given to providing remedial help to the children.</P>
      <P>A further 60 posts have been allocated to schools in disadvantaged areas in accordance with the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and schools have again been told to consider using the resource to provide remedial help to the students.</P>
      <P>Hours spent on approved programmes of remedial education by teachers holding the Department's certificate in remedial education and those participating in this programme of training, are recognised as normal teaching hours.</P>
      <P>School authorities considering participating in this programme were invited, in the first instance, to discuss their remedial education needs and provision with their local Department of Education psychologist.</P>
      <P>In view of the intensive nature of the programme, the number of places available is strictly limited.  All of those nominated are invited for individual interview. Final selection of participants is on the basis of both school need and assessment at interview.  Up to 36 teachers will be offered places this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substitutes may be provided for teachers attending the course.  Travel expenses and subsistence allowances at approved <Col N="475" /> rates are also payable to eligible participants.</P>
    <P>I would, of course, wish to be in a position to allocate unlimited resources to these areas of education, but this is not possible.  However, I am sure the House will agree that the position as outlined by me goes a long way to meeting requirements in this area.  The matter will of course be kept under review.</P>
    <P>For a long number of years, my Department have organised a programme of training in remedial education for teachers of second level students.  A circular issued by my Department in March last invited school authorities to nominate one member of their teaching staff to participate in the programme for the 1991-92 school year.</P>
    <P>The aim of the programme is to provide an intensive practical training for teachers in all aspects of remedial education provision for second level students.</P>
    <P>The programme consists of periods of attendance at a training course, interspersed with supervised teaching in schools or other centres and, in addition, participants complete a number of assignments during the year.  A certificate is awarded to participants who successfully complete all aspects of the programme.</P>
    <P>In order that teachers selected should obtain the necessary supervised experience of remedial teaching while on the programme, at least five hours a week of remedial teaching should be included in the teacher's timetable.  School authorities nominating teachers to the programme will be assumed to have satisfied <Col N="476" /> themselves that this requirement can be met.</P>
    <P>At primary level special courses for remedial teachers are held at six centres, Cork, Limerick Sligo, Marino (Dublin), Orwell Road (Dublin) and Drumcondra (Dublin).  The courses in Cork, Limerick and Orwell Road are held on Saturdays and the question of employing substitute teachers as replacements does not arise. The course in Sligo is held during the summer vacation and part of the course held at Marino is held on Wednesdays from October to May and substitutes are not employed as replacements.</P>
    <P>Substitute teachers are employed as replacements for permanent and temporary national teachers absent on certified leave, paid maternity leave, leave in lieu of maternity leave, jury service and absence on certain approved courses.</P>
    <P>Remedial teachers in national schools deal with individual pupils or small numbers of pupils.  These pupils are withdrawn from their normal classes at particular periods and attend special tuition given by the remedial teacher.  If a remedial teacher attends a course during a school day the tuition of pupils in the school continues without interruption.</P>
    <P>The provision in the 1991 Estimates for the employment of substitute teachers is £9.417 million.  The provision for 1992 is expected to be £12.142 million.  The increase in the provision arises because of wage increases under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 3 July 1991.</P>

      <Quest>the progress which has been made pursuant to the decision of the EC Summit at Hanover in June 1988 that the Commission undertake a study of the problems of access to the member states and the social integration of immigrants from third countries.</Quest>

      <P>The European Council at Hanover in June 1988 invited Foreign Ministers to agree the terms of reference for a study by the Commission on access to the Community by immigrants and the social integration of immigrants within the Community.  In 1989 the Strasbourg European Council called for an &ldquo;inventory to be prepared of national positions on immigration so that a discussion on this issue within the Council (General Affairs) can be prepared&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As these questions are closely linked, it was decided that the Commission should appoint independent experts to examine the question of integration of immigrants while the Coordinators Group on Free Movement of Persons, in conjunction with the <i>ad hoc</i> Group on Immigration, would study the question of access.</P>
      <P>In December 1990 the General Affairs Council discussed the report from the experts appointed by the Commission and from the national experts and it was agreed to request the Commission to undertake further studies to establish means of getting systematic information on migratory flows.  I understand that the Commission has not yet finalised its assessment of the studies.  These studies will also examine the question of the scope of Article 8a of the EEC Treaty regarding free movement of persons, be they either EC nationals or nationals of third countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be interested in a related and important development in <Col N="206" /> the area of free movement.  Considerable progress has been made recently on the negotiation of a convention on the crossing of the Community's external frontiers. The purpose of the &ldquo;Borders Convention&rdquo;, as it is known, is to strengthen and standardise frontier controls at the Community's external frontiers, in preparation for free movement within those frontiers after 1992.  It is hoped that this convention will be ready for signature in July.</P>

      <P>The present position in regard to membership of the Security Council is set out in Article 23 of the UN Charter as amended; and the geographical distribution of elected seats on the Council is determined in accordance with a UN General Assembly resolution of 1963.</P>
      <P>Under Article 23 of the UN Charter the Security Council has a membership of 15 of whom five are permanent members and ten are elected for two year terms. Paragraph 1 of that Article provides that:</P>
      <P>The Security Council shall consist of fifteen Members of the United Nations.  The Republic of China, France, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America shall be permanent members of the Security Council.  The General Assembly shall elect ten other members of the United Nations to be non-permanent members of the Security Council, due regard being specially paid, in the first instance to the contribution of members of the United Nations to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the other purposes of the organisation and also to equitable geographical distribution.</P>
      <P>The Charter as adopted in 1945 had provided for a membership of 11 of whom six were elected but Article 23 was amended in 1963 so as to expand the membership of the Council to the present level of 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By Resolution 1991 A of 1963, the General Assembly agreed that the distribution of the ten &ldquo;non-permanent&rdquo; seats would be as follows: five from African and Asian states; one from Eastern <Col N="211" /> European states; two from Latin American and Caribbean states; two from Western European and other states.</P>
    <P>The Government are aware of views that the composition of the Security Council, and in particular the allocation of permanent seats as provided for in the Charter, should be changed in order to take account of a world in which the distribution of power differs in some significant respects from that which existed when the Charter was adopted some 46 years ago.  Ireland is participating in the international exchange of views on this question but we do not plan to take an initiative on it.</P>
    <P>An important factor to bear in mind is that under Article 108 any amendment of the Charter would require a vote of two thirds of the members of the General Assembly and ratification by two thirds of the members of the United Nations, including the five permanent members of the Security Council.  This means that no change could be made without the agreement of all five of the permanent members of the Council.</P>

      <P>The Government continue to be concerned at the unsatisfactory rate of police accompaniment of patrols of the armed forces &mdash; including the UDR &mdash; in Northern Ireland.  The issue has repeatedly featured on the agenda of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and has been raised on numerous occasions through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.  The Government will continue to press for full implementation of the objective set out in the Hillsborough Communique, namely that, save in the most exceptional circumstances, there is a police presence in all operations which involve direct contact with the community.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The Twelve have been monitoring closely the restrictions on the movement of Palestinian workers from the occupied territories to Israel and have made known their concern to the Israeli Government. There are different estimates as to the overall number involved but it is clear that the number of workers travelling into Israel has been reduced by more than half and that this has adversely affected the economic situation of the population in the territories.</P>
      <P>Along with our partners of the Twelve, we have consistently called on the Government of Israel to respect human rights in the Occupied Territories.  The Twelve have expressed to the Israeli authorities our concern about the Israeli practices of collective reprisals such as the destruction of houses and restrictions on freedom of movement, and have deplored the decision to place moderate Palestinians under administrative arrest. We have also made known our concerns at the Commission for Human Rights which met in Geneva earlier this year. We will continue to draw attention to such injustices and seek, in co-operation with our colleagues in the Twelve, to bring them to an end.</P>

      <P>Following discussions four years ago between Irish members of the Economic and Social Committee and officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs an arrangement was formalised to ensure <Col N="215" /> that Irish members of the Economic and Social Committee obtain official briefing on issues of interest to them.  Official liaison officers were designated in my Department and in all Government Departments with the task of co-ordinating responses to any requests for information which come from Irish members of the Economic and Social Committee. In addition to this arrangement, regular informal contacts exist between Irish members of the committee and our Permanent Representation in Brussels.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that my Department are fully aware of their obligation to supply information in response to requests for briefing which are initiated by members of the Economic and Social Committee.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate to recall that all members of the Economic and Social Committee serve in a personal capacity: that we impose no obligation on them to reflect a Government line in their consideration of commission proposals; and that they are specifically prohibited under the Treaty from being subject to any mandatory instructions.  The briefing arrangement, which has existed now for several years, respects this situation and acknowledges that the initiative in seeking information on an issue lies largely with the committee members.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Economic and Social Committee play a useful role in the Community's decision making arrangements and the Irish members play a valuable role in influencing the opinions which the committee prepare on commission proposals.  From time to time in the course of our contacts with the Irish members either in Brussels or in Dublin we do of course advise them of our concerns on major issues which are under consideration by the Economic and Social Committee and we will of course continue to do so.</P>

      <P>As I have stated in replies to previous questions on the issue of South African support for RENAMO, the South African Government have declared that they no longer provide assistance for RENAMO and we welcome this.  On the other hand there remains a concern, that elements inside and outside South Africa, who are not interested in promoting the democratic process in either Mozambique or South Africa are continuing to support RENAMO.  I would call again on these elements to cease all such support.</P>
      <P>The Government are convinced that the only truly effective means of alleviating the problem of Mozambican refugees would be to end the conflict in Mozambique.  Ireland, together with its partners in the Community, has been urging the conflicting parties in Mozambique to work earnestly for national reconciliation.  On 27 May 1991, the Community stated its support for the talks process underway, under Italian auspices, between RENAMO and the Government of Mozambique.  I hope that as regional tensions ease and as relations between South Africa and its neighbours, and the wider international community, improve, Mozambican refugees will be granted the protection of the UN Commissioner for Refugees.</P>

The taxpayer was advised of the revised amounts on 12 June 1991.  The amounts of tax originally due for the years in question were referred for collection earlier in 1991 to the sheriff for County Meath after all normal collection action had failed to <Col N="224" /> secure payment.  The sheriff has been advised of the revised amounts due.</P>

      <Quest>whether it is possible to tax motorcycles for periods of less than 12 months; if not, the reason this restriction is imposed; his views on whether many people only use their motorcycles in the summer months and that it would be reasonable for them to tax them for this period only; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Part-year payment of any motor vehicle road tax is currently available only where the annual cost exceeds £70.  Accordingly, part-year payment is not available on motorcycles as the present road tax applicable ranges from £10 to £40, with over 80 per cent liable at £20 per annum or less.  It is not considered unreasonable that such liabilities should be met on an annual basis &mdash; irrespective of the duration of use.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment informs me that the cost of processing each road tax renewal amounts to about £4.50 on average.  It would be negligent of me to fail to take account of the fact that the collection of relatively small payments of road tax on a quarterly or half-yearly basis would be neither economical nor efficient.  While being mindful of the difficulty that motorists can have with the payment of large road tax bills, the present threshold is considered reasonable.</P>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are unable from the information supplied to trace any record of any such cases and that on receipt of more detailed particulars the matter will be investigated further by them.</P>
      <P>Customs and Excise operate a large number of prohibitions and restrictions on imports at present on behalf of other Government Departments such as those relating to the safeguarding of public health and the importation of dangerous substances.  In these cases the goods affected may not be imported except under licence and any application for such a licence or for review of a particular prohibition is a matter for the appropriate Minister.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer claimed a refund of deposit interest retention tax in respect of the years 1987-88, 1988-89 and 1989-90 on 6 June 1990. PAYE balancing statements for these years were issued to the taxpayer on 29 August 1990, advising him of a net underpayment of £181.37.  This underpayment arose because the taxpayer has been receiving a social welfare pension since June 1987, but this was only notified to the inspector of taxes in June 1990, i.e. when the taxpayer submitted his claim for a refund of DIRT.</P>
      <P>A return of income/claim for allowances form for the year 1988-89 was issued to the taxpayer on 19 January 1991 but to date he has not completed and returned same.  The inspector has now written to the taxpayer for the details necessary to bring his tax affairs up to date and on receipt of his reply his liability to tax will be reviewed.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the situation in relation to the extension of the severely disadvantaged areas status as opposed to the less severely disadvantaged areas; whether areas that have not as yet been included in the disadvantaged areas can be reclassified directly into the more severely disadvantaged category; the total amount which it is anticipated will be published in this more severely disadvantaged category and when; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>To be reclassified, an area must first be included in the Community list of less-favoured areas and, as the Deputy will know, our extension application to add new areas totalling almost two million acres to the list has been approved by the Commission and is in the final stages of ratification by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.  Our reclassification application is at present the subject of ongoing discussions with the Commission and includes a proposal to reclassify 1.3 million acres as more severely handicapped to increase the benefits available to farmers in these areas.  I am hopeful that the latter application will be as successful as the former and that it will be cleared by the Commission at an early date to enable the results of the reclassification to be published as soon as possible after the publication of the additional new areas in the EC Official Journal.</P>

      <P>These regulations provide that the labels of most foodstuffs must show a list of ingredients, in descending order of weight.  Ingredients for the purposes of the regulations comprehend what are generally referred to as additives.  The regulations include 18 listed categories which have to be identified by name and by either the full name of the ingredient itself or its identifying EC number (the &ldquo;E&rdquo; number).  Colours, preservatives, antioxidants, flavour enhancers and artificial sweeteners are some of the categories of additives covered under the regulations.</P>

      <P>Under current Irish insurance law a motor insurance risk which originates in the State must be placed with an authorised insurer in the State.  Consequently, if the owner of a vehicle is resident here the insurance cover must be placed with an insurer duly authorised to transact such business in the State.  This is compatible with our obligations under EC treaties.  I would <Col N="240" /> point out, however, that I do not have responsibility for the rules which govern questions of road tax and vehicle registration.</P>

      <P>Up to 1970 retiring forestry workers were only entitled to a pension under the Social Welfare Acts.  In 1970 a non-contributory pension scheme for non-established State employees was introduced to supplement their social welfare pensions.  The forestry pension is co-ordinated with the social welfare pension so that, in the case of a person with the maximum service of 40 years, the recipient's combined income from the State forestry pension and social welfare schemes should in general be equivalent to half his income prior to retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the person concerned received the contributory old age pension in 1989 his forestry pension had to be re-assessed and was reduced downwards to take account of the additional amount payable from the Department of Social Welfare.  The person's forestry pension is at present being revised upwards under the normal revision of pensions <Col N="241" /> and he will shortly receive his up to date pension together with a small amount of arrears.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance, introduced for the first time last November, provides for the payment of a personal allowance directly to the carer on a means-tested basis.  The scheme covers carers who are looking after elderly or invalided social welfare pensioners who require full-time care and attention. <Col N="245" /> Later this month the scheme will be extended to include carers of recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance (DPMA) and those in receipt of a pension from another EC member state or from a country with whom Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement.</P>
      <P>Any question of a full or limited removal of the means test applicable to the carer's allowance in the case of particular groups would have cost implications which would have to be examined in a budgetary context.  I have already indicated to the House that the means test is currently being reviewed to see what improvements can be made within existing resources.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the extension of the free travel companion pass to the mentally handicapped in residential care who had not previously been in receipt of DPMA would have cost implications which would also have been considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>Last November I introduced a free travel companion pass for people in receipt of DPMA who are unable to travel alone.  This new scheme, which was widely welcomed, enables the mentally and physically handicapped, including the visually handicapped, who are in receipt of DPMA, to bring a companion with them when availing of their free travel passes.  Some 12,000 people with disabilities have already received their companion pass.</P>
      <P>This year I am extending the right to free travel and the companion pass to former recipients of DPMA who had lost their entitlement to DPMA because they went into residential care.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for entitlement to a fuel allowance is that the claimant must live alone or only with a dependant, another eligible recipient or a person on short term unemployment assistance.

      <P>The free travel scheme applies to all those who have attained pensionable age, i.e. 66 years of age and over, blind persons aged 18 and over and to persons receiving social welfare type payments as permanently incapacitated persons.  The scheme enables those people to travel free on certain bus, train and ferry services and it also provides free travel for accompanying spouses or, in the case of recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance who cannot travel alone, for their companions.</P>
      <P>A reduction of the age requirement for free travel generally below pensionable age would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>All categories of pensioners have received increases over the last number of years which have more than kept pace with inflation.  A further 4 per cent increase in the weekly rates of pension will come into effect at the end of this month.

It came to light that she worked while continuing to claim benefit during the period 22 September 1984 to 28 February 1986.  A formal decision has not yet been made in this case.  However, on the basis of the evidence available, it appears that she was overpaid almost £2,400.

      <P>When the overpayment is formally established, she will be asked, to make proposals for repayment.

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is a resident garda assigned to Castlebridge substation and that the area is also served by mobile patrols from the divisional headquarters at Wexford which is only four miles away.  I understand that the garda at Castlebridge has been assigned to temporary duty in Wexford town on a regular basis to meet policing needs there, but that this duty has been reduced substantially of late to ensure an improved Garda presence in Castlebridge.  Measures have also been put in place to enable members of the detective branch at Wexford station to give greater priority to the detection of recent crime in the Castlebridge area and the Garda authorities are currently reviewing the effectiveness of local crime prevention measures.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Health and the health boards administer the principal legislation relating to fluoridation of water supplies.  In addition however, the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988, made by the Minister for the Environment, apply a standard of 1,000 micro grams per litre for fluoride in drinking water.  This is consistent with the differently prescribed standard in Regulations made under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960, and is more stringent than the maximum level of 1,500 micro grams per litre fixed under the EC Drinking Water Directive.</P>

      <P>Returns have not yet been received from all housing authorities on the level of homelessness in their areas or the liaison arrangements which they have made with voluntary bodies providing accommodation for homeless persons.  Those coming within the terms of the definition of homeless persons in section 2 of the Housing Act, 1988, may be regarded as homeless for the purpose of the assessment.</P>
      <P>Housing authorities were advised, in undertaking the assessment, to have regard to the appropriate provisions of the guidelines for the accommodation of homeless persons issued by my Department and, in particular, to the importance of consultation and liaison with health boards and voluntary bodies working on behalf of homeless persons.  They were also advised to give adequate and timely notice to such bodies of the making of the assessment and that any communication received in response to such notice should be taken fully into account in making the assessment.</P>

    <P>Persons with this condition who, in the <Col N="274" /> opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable to meet their medical expenses without undue hardship will be granted a medical card.

    <P>The question of determining eligibility for a medical card in individual cases is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Accordingly, in this instance the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The new psychiatric unit at Naas General Hospital was handed over by the building contractor to the Eastern Health Board in February 1990.  The commissioning of this unit is a matter for the board in the first instance.  I have made funds available to enable psychiatric services to be developed in County Kildare, including the commissioning of the psychiatric unit in Naas.  I understand from the Eastern Health Board that it is the intention to commence community-based psychiatric services in mid and south Kildare in August 1991.  The board are already providing a psychiatric service in north Kildare.  I also understand that the Eastern Health Board plan to open the psychiatric unit later in the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 and 180 together.  Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Government are committed to the development of services for people with mental handicap.  The need to expand speech therapy services in this respect is recognised.</P>
      <P>Plans are being prepared in each health board area to develop mental handicap services which will be implemented in line with the resources made available under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>My Department are currently examining the difficulties being experienced in the recruitment of speech therapists and the number of training places is being reviewed with the educational authority.</P>
      <P>Persons with mental handicap are eligible for any health service on the same basis as for other applicants.</P>
      <P>Under the 1970 Health Act, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependents.  Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer feels that this is necessary in the light of the individual's circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers to issue medical cards, I am satisfied that no one <Col N="276" /> is denied essential health services due to inability to pay.</P>
    <P>I have already announced that a statutory medical card appeals system is being introduced.  When this system is in place any person who feels aggrieved in relation to a decision not to grant a medical card can have the problem addressed under the appeals procedures.</P>
    <P>In addition, hospital in-patient and out-patient services are provided without charge for all children under 16 years of age who are mentally handicapped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department that people with mental handicap should live as normal a life as possible and that services should facilitate this objective.</P>
      <P>I recently launched the report of the review group on mental handicap services, Needs and Abilities &mdash; A Policy for the Intellectually Disabled.  The report endorses the overall approach of our services. It estimates the number of additional residential and day places required for people with mental handicap and recommends special facilities for those with behavioural problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations have been adopted in principle by Government and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> includes a commitment to their implementation over the seven year period of the programme.  The £2 million made available by the Government in 1990 to develop services for people with mental handicap has been repeated this year.  In addition, £1 million was made <Col N="277" /> available in the budget this year to implement the recommendations of the Needs and Abilities report under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I have reconstituted the mental handicap co-ordinating committees in each health board area.  The function of these committees is to bring health board and voluntary mental handicap agencies together to plan how best to develop services for persons with mental handicap in each area.  Each committee have been asked to prepare a plan to quantify the need for additional residential and day places (including facilities for those with disturbed behaviour), in each area as part of a national strategy to improve services for people with mental handicap under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>It has been the policy of my Department for many years that persons with mental handicap should not be admitted to psychiatric hospitals unless they cannot receive psychiatric care in any other way. Where they have been admitted to a psychiatric hospital in the past, health boards have been encouraged to care for them in separate accommodation and to develop programmes of activity suited to their needs.</P>
    <P>In some cases health boards, with my Department's agreement, have separated their care entirely from the rest of the hospital and transferred responsibility to the community care programme, which is responsible for mental handicap services generally in the areas concerned. I am aware from the reports of the Inspector of Psychiatric Hospitals that a high standard of care is being provided for people with mental handicap in some psychiatric services.</P>

      <P>Regulations made under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960 (No. 46 of 1960) prescribe that the amount of fluoride which may be added to a water supply shall be such that the water, after the addition of the fluoride, shall contain not more than one part of fluoride per million parts of water, and not less than eight tenths of a part of fluoride per million parts of water.  These regulations also prescribe that the fluoride content of fluoridated public water supplies shall be determined daily by a colorimetric method and, in addition, shall be determined by a distillation method at intervals not exceeding four weeks.</P>
      <P>Returns made to my Department by health boards of the results of testing by the distillation method of fluoride levels in water supplies in 1990 indicated that a satisfactory level was achieved in 81 per cent of the tests carried out.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable improvement in recent years in maintaining satisfactory levels of fluoride in water supplies.  The fluoridation programme is continually monitored by my Department as well as at local level and improvements are recommended to be implemented when required.</P>
      <P>At local level health boards through their directors of community care and medical officers of health have overall responsibility for the satisfactory operation of fluoridation programmes.  Within each community care area responsibility for monitoring the general operation of the service is normally assigned to the principal dental officer.  Local authorities have direct responsibility for the installation, maintenance and operation of fluoridation plants as agents for the health boards.</P>
      <P>A general report on the fluoride levels of each fluoridated water supply is submitted by health boards to my Department on a quarterly basis.</P>

      <P>The incident to which the Deputy refers happened two years ago and the elderly person in question, being the holder of a medical card, was attended to by her general practitioner.  As the Deputy may be aware, there is provision under the General Medical Services contract for investigations to be carried out on the treatment of patients either at the request of the patients themselves or by a relative acting on their behalf.</P>
      <P>The treatment of the patient concerned, who resides in the south-eastern area of the country, was the subject of a full and detailed investigation by the health board following representations by the daughter of the patient to myself and another Deputy in this House.</P>
      <P>Replies have issued to these representations outlining the board's conclusions following the investigation and its consideration that no further action was warranted in the matter.</P>

      <P>The provision of dental service for children attending national school is a priority of the community dental services programme.  Children requiring emergency treatment are given precedence over those requiring routine treatment and I am satisfied that the arrangements made by health boards in this regard are satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most areas routine treatment services for schoolchildren are provided in health board dental clinics following a screening examination carried out through the schools.  My Department have recommended to health boards that all children in first or second and sixth classes be <Col N="284" /> examined each year.  The choice of the earlier examination can be varied with local custom in order to ensure that children who present for the screening are of an age when dentition is sufficiently developed to permit the application of fissure sealants where necessary.  Children are examined again in sixth class to ensure that they are dentally fit when they leave the national school system.</P>

      <P>There are 349 national schools in Cork. The policy of the Southern Health Board is that children in certain classes would be inspected and treated on an annual basis under the schools' dental programme. The board have found it difficult to achieve this target in all cases. However, treatment of target groups has increased as a result of the additional funds provided in the 1990 and 1991 budgets.</P>
      <P>In East Cork the position is as follows: Youghal Dental Clinic: ten schools &mdash; it is expected that all children in first and sixth classes will be seen during 1991; Cobh Dental Clinic: seven schools &mdash; it is expected that all children in sixth class and a number in first and third classes will be seen during 1991; and Midleton Dental Clinic: it is expected that all children in sixth class and a majority of first class will be seen during 1991.</P>

      <P>The booklet <i>A Guide for Hospital Management</i> was circulated by my Department in 1980 in conjunction with the booklet <i>A Guide to help Hospital Patients and Visitors.</i></P>
      <P>One of the recommendations made in <i>A Guide for Hospital Management</i> was that each hospital should publish a booklet for the information of patients and their relatives.  Because the facilities and arrangements for patients and visitors usually vary from one hospital to another, it was considered that, rather than have one common booklet for all hospitals, it would be more satisfactory if a separate booklet was published for each hospital. To assist hospital authorities, my Department prepared a model booklet <i>A Guide to help our patients and visitors.</i></P>
      <P>It was recommended that the booklet should contain a map showing the location of the hospital, what a patient should bring to hospital, the admission procedures, arrangements for letters, telephone calls, religious services, visiting times, meal times and so on.</P>
      <P>Last year, my Department conducted a survey of all hospitals and found that most hospitals had booklets based on the recommendations and that the remaining hospitals were either updating their booklets or preparing new ones.</P>

      <P>There is no special provision in the higher education grants scheme <Col N="292" /> at present for mature students and all applicants must satisfy the requirements with regard to attainments in the leaving certificate, parental income etc.</P>
      <P>However, in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> an undertaking has been given to re-examine a number of areas of the scheme.  These include the question of the assessment of income of mature students who are not dependent on their parents as well as regarding mature students who secure a place in a third level institution as satisfying the academic requirements for the award of a grant under the scheme.</P>
      <P>These matters are currently being examined within my Department.</P>

      <P>These posts, which will be allocated for the 1991-92 school year, will be distributed on the basis of criteria agreed with schools' management and teachers. The criteria in question are based on socio-economic indicators of disadvantage and include such factors as unemployment levels, local authority housing, medical card holders and information on basic literacy and numeracy. In addition, in assessing the relative levels of disadvantage among applicant schools, account is being taken of prevailing pupil/teacher ratios and the presence of existing ex-quota disadvantaged posts in schools.</P>
      <P>All applicant schools, including the one mentioned by the Deputy, are being prioritised on the above basis and successful applicants will be advised in the very near future.</P>

      <P>When he refers to assessments in respect of dyslexia I take it that the Deputy is referring to psychological and other evidence that a candidate is affected by dyslexia, i.e., affected by a specific learning difficulty.  The number of applications for special consideration in the 1991 examinations on the grounds of specific learning difficulty was 439.  Of these, 299 applications were granted following consideration of all the evidence by my Department's psychological service.</P>
      <P>Applications for special consideration in respect of a specific learning difficulty are referred for consideration by the psychological service of my Department and such requests are granted provided my psychologists are satisfied that special consideration is warranted.</P>
      <P>I should add that special consideration does not mean more lenient marking.  In the case of candidates who have a specific learning difficulty it often amounts to no more than ensuring that the candidates' answerbooks are marked by examiners who are experienced in marking the work of such candidates and in deciphering their handwriting.  In extreme cases it may also consist of allowing the candidate the assistance of a person to read the questions and allowing the candidate the use of a tape recorder.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that, taking into consideration the areas of Blanchardstown <Col N="303" /> and Castleknock as well as the Navan Road and Cabra areas, some parents are experiencing difficulty in placing their children in the school of their first choice. My Department are concerned to ensure that there are sufficient pupil places between all the schools in the general area to cater for all pupils seeking places. I am satisfied that this requirement is being met for the area in question.</P>
    <P>While intake policy is essentially a <Col N="304" /> matter for each post-primary school management, it would be expected that priority would be given to pupils from within a school's own area.</P>
    <P>My Department do not have statistics which would indicate the number of Castleknock pupils presently attending St. Declan's secondary school who would have enrolled in a new school in Castleknock, had such been provided.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment on the 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with the agreement on staffing made between the Government and the INTO.</P>
      <P>In the case of St. Vincent's boys national school there were 142 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1990, which warrants a staff of principal plus four assistants for the 1991-92 school year. The school will also have the services of a full-time remedial teacher, and a concessionary teacher under the special scheme of teaching assistance for schools serving disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached. If the school authorities feel that St. Vincent's boys national school may qualify under either of these exceptions my Department will be happy to examine any application received.</P>
