      <asker>Mr. McCartan</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the proposals he has to give active and financial support to attracting foreign film makers to Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The main thrust of State support for film making is geared to assist native film makers.  That support is provided in the form of various tax reliefs and by the assistance of a number of State agencies, including CTT, the IDA, RTE and the Arts Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more professional and commercial <Col N="2" /> approach which has been adopted in recent years by film makers in this country has been complemented greatly by the State support to which I have referred.  This has resulted in a very considerable expansion in the value of our TV and film exports.  The value of such exports is estimated by CTT to have amounted to £12 million, £20 million, £25 million and £30 million for the years 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1990 respectively.  It is expected that it will amount to £36 million in 1991.</P>
    <P>The IDA continue to be successful in attracting to Ireland a number of foreign interests engaged in pre- and post-production work for corporate and feature videos, TV, film documentaries and series, animation, music recording and other ancillary support services.  The IDA estimate that total permanent <Col N="3" /> employment here in such grant-supported companies originating from overseas is in excess of 600 That figure does not include many casual and temporary staff.</P>
    <P>In addition to IDA initiatives, CTT actively encourage overseas film production companies to work with Irish partners and use Irish post-production facilities.  The promotional efforts of CTT at major International film-TV fairs has significantly increased the profile of the Irish film sector abroad, thereby putting many Irish film makers in touch with overseas partners interested in co-producing in Ireland.</P>
    <P>RTE participated in eight major co-productions with overseas film makers in 1989-90, while Bord Fáilte, as part of their publicity activities designed to generate awareness of Ireland's holiday attractions, assisted over 40 overseas TV crews in 1990 to identify Irish locations, subjects, and people for interview.</P>
    <P>There are strong indications that several major, large budget films will be shot in Ireland this year by overseas film makers.  I note with particular satisfaction a statement in &ldquo;Production Ireland&rdquo;, a privately published comprehensive guide to Irish film production companies, that 1990, the best ever year for theatrical features shot in Ireland, promises to be dramatically overtaken in 1991, given the number of incoming film projects likely to be produced here this year.  That achievement is due to various factors, including the excellent promotional work being done by the various State agencies to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for at least underscoring the importance of this area of cultural activity for the country.  Given the degree to which neighbouring countries, in particular our nearest neighbour, are actively increasing their sponsorship and aids to foreign film makers, would the Taoiseach agree that it is important that Ireland takes a more active involvement in attracting film makers to this country in view of the wide potential that exists in that field? <Col N="4" /> Are there specific proposals in consultation with the IDA or other agencies to introduce a special package promoting Ireland as a suitable location for making films?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined a range of support by all the different agencies, for indigenous film making and to attract foreign film makers.  These are being relatively successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a specific package with incentives or funding earmarked to attract foreigners, or is it just an accident that an independent foreign film maker chooses Ireland?  Do we actively look to bring people here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we do, through CTT mainly.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Barry</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if the Government will issue a White Paper outlining the issues being finalised in the GATT negotiations and their possible impact on the various sectors of the Irish economy.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Until there is more significant progress in the current GATT Uruguay Round negotiations and some clearer indication as to their likely outcome in the unprecedently wide range of sectors concerned, I consider that publication of a White Paper would be premature and would serve no useful purpose at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the GATT talks, no matter how they are concluded, will have a profound effect on the CAP and consequently on the economy of Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the way things are shaping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that this country more than any <Col N="5" /> other in the Community depends on agriculture, seeing that 26 per cent of our exports are agricultural?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  We will certainly be affected, but to what extent remains to be seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a Private Notice Question asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce to produce a White Paper on the effects of the CAP reform on the Irish economy.  It is not just agriculture which will be affected.  One can see the downturn in cement sales because of the loss of farm income.  Does the Taoiseach not agree that the Government should be preparing a plan for all eventualities so that if they look for compensation from Europe, as they are entitled to do, we will be better prepared and will know where to look for it and so on?  The whole economy, not just the agricultural sector&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole economy, not just the agricultural sector and the Government, should understand the precise implications of the current reform in the GATT and in the CAP and that a White Paper is necessary to promote debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that a White Paper at this stage will serve any useful purpose.  As the Deputy knows, things are still in a state of flux.  The negotiations practically broke down.  It is difficult to anticipate the final outcome, if any, but I assure the Deputy that all the Departments concerned are very much aware of the major implications of these negotiations and are participating fully and co-ordinating their efforts.  The entire resources of the State are being effectively brought to bear on the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's reluctance to publish a White Paper &mdash; and, I presume, by extension a Green <Col N="6" /> Paper &mdash; will he indicate, having regard to his assertion that the Government Departments are well briefed on the implications of the current state of negotiations, whether the Government are prepared to fully brief the Opposition in this House or the Central Revenue Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> in view of the major implications for the outturn of the economy in 1991?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly if the Central Review Committee make a request the information will be supplied; Members of this House have the opportunity, through Dáil questions and in other ways, to elicit as much information as possible.</P>

      <P>I was hoping to have finality in regard to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that for the public benefit some study should be made of the possible effects on the economy of the GATT and CAP negotiations?  Will he also ask the ESRI to conduct a study into this matter to see what benefits there are in GATT reform? However, there is a very big downside in the reform of CAP consequential on the reform of GATT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We know all that but it is still at a very formative stage.  On one side we have a major vested interest in ensuring the success of the GATT talks because we live by our exports and we are totally in favour of the maximum possible amount of international free trade.  On the other side of the coin there is pressure, mainly from the United States, for a completely new regime in regard to agriculture, particularly in regard to agricultural exports.  We must keep both those aspects in mind and we do.  The situation in the European Community, as the Deputy knows, has been a protracted one and the position of the Community in the negotiations has been very widely publicised.  However, when you are in negotiations like that it is not <Col N="7" /> always a very good idea to publish white papers, green papers, yellow papers or whatever and tell everybody concerned what your ultimate objective is.  There is such a thing as being reasonably cautious when you are in tense negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that it would be a very good idea to tell the people with whom we are negotiating &mdash; and to quantify authoritatively &mdash; the effects on our economy of these changes and to use the study as a basis for getting a better deal for Ireland, which would be very laudable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I understand the Taoiseach's reluctance.  Am I correct in summarising the position of the Government as knowing all the facts but not being prepared to share them with the Opposition and that if the trade union and social partner members of the CRC ask for the information in private they might be told?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not the position. If there is a change in the weather The Opposition want the Government to publish a White Paper or, alternatively, to have a judicial inquiry.  It is either one or the other.  There is a kind of knee-jerk reaction over there but we have to deal with the negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The export credit insurance scheme is administered by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland plc (ICI) as agent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Export credit insurance is available for all countries listed on a published country grading schedule which is provided to all policy holders. Applications for insurance for exports to countries not on the schedule are considered on a case by case basis.</P>
      <P>There are no restrictions governing the type of Irish products which may be covered by the scheme.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice to disclose the names of companies availing of the export credit insurance scheme or to give details of the amount of cover they have individually received.  This is confidential information relating to the commercial operation of the companies concerned. Its disclosure would be inappropriate and would not be in the best interests of the companies concerned or of the scheme. I can, however, say that at present there are about 400 companies covered by the scheme involving exports to 20,000 buyers in over 90 countries.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 5 and Oral Question No. 7 together.</P>
      <P>Since my reply on 24 April 1991 on this subject, I have received additional information from the relevant parties involved in these transactions.  This additional information suggests that the orders have been complied with to the extent that I am informed that disposal of the four plants has taken place. However, a feature of the orders is that the disposal of the plants must be in such a manner that they thereby cease to be under common control with AIBP, and AIBP do not own, control or make use of any of these assets.  On that aspect it has not been demonstrated to me that the purchasers are independent as required by the order.  I would, however, draw the attention of the House to the fact that it is only in circumstances that the conditions set down in the order are fully met that title to the Bandon and Donegal plants can pass to AIBP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they would remain the property and under the control of Master Meats Limited who are now, as I understand it, the official legal owners. The Deputy will, of course, recall that the Fair Trade Commission found, as a result of inquiries they made, that Master Meats Limited were controlled by Mr. Larry Goodman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably they would but the situation is complicated by the fact that while we were told a year ago that these plants were not in the ownership or control of the Goodman organisation they have since been shown by the examiner appointed to that group as being among the assets of the group.  The situation is certainly confused but what is important is that the people who will own 60 per cent of the Goodman group if and when the package is signed &mdash; and this has not happened as yet &mdash; presumably will not have title to those two plants which appear to form an integral part of the overall rescue package.  It is not necessary for me to draw their attention to this as I am sure they are well aware of it.  If and when they sign the agreement with the Goodman organisation no doubt they will raise that matter with the principals of that organisation.</P>

      <Quest>whether, having regard to the Government's decision to issue an insurance licence to Allied Irish Banks he will outline the safeguards put in place to ensure that public funds will not be required again to rescue this bank in like manner as occurred when the bank was involved in the insurance business on a previous occasion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions for the granting of an authorisation to transact life assurance business are set out in the European Communities (Life Assurance) Regulations 1984 which implement the provisions of the First EC Directive on life assurance.  As is the case in all such applications the decision to grant an authorisation to Ark Life Assurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks, was taken following a detailed examination by my Department to ensure that these conditions had been met.  Particular attention is given to ensuring that an applicant company has made adequate capital provision now and for the future and that the management team possesses the necessary expertise in all the key areas required for the proper management of a life office.  Like all new entrants to the life assurance market, the company will be the subject of close monitoring by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the non-life insurance business in which the AIB group were involved on a previous occasion, I should point out to the Deputy that none of the costs of the administration of that business has fallen on the Exchequer and, as I pointed out in a statement on <Col N="14" /> 13 February 1990 when announcing the sale of the Irish business of ICI, the Government do not intend that any cost will fall to be met by the general taxpayer or by insurance policyholders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that his Department will be able to monitor the bank adequately and that the bank have taken adequate precautions, before they venture into the insurance industry on this occasion, and that we will not have another débacle similar to the one which occurred in the mid-eighties following their acquisition of the ICI?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe so.  This application has been fully examined and suggestions were made as to how it might be amended.  These have been complied with.  I would point out to the Deputy that the bank now propose to get into the life assurance business, which is notoriously less risky than general insurance in which they had an unhappy short period of trading.  I am quite confident that they will be able to run the low risk life assurance business that they now propose to enter without any great problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from the advertisements in today's newspapers that the bank's Irish customers will be expected to continue to pay higher and ever-increasing charges to fund the bank's unsuccessful acquisitions and ventures abroad.  Is the Minister concerned about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I do not think the matter which Deputy Rabbitte raises arises out of this question and, second, I do not have statutory responsibility for bank charges.  However, having said that I agree with the Deputy.  It is a great pity that this bank have significantly increased their charges to Irish customers given that they are already very profitable in Ireland even though they may be loss-making.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a condition of their licence and if I get evidence that they do otherwise we can reconsider their licence.  Banks have been asked in the past to deal with their insurance subsidiary on an arm's length basis.  I was never as confident as the banks were themselves that they were operating on an arm's length basis but if a customer looks for a loan on the security of a life policy, then a life policy from any company should be equally acceptable to the bank concerned.</P>

I am aware that there is a form of civil indemnification in one particular paragraph of the agreed proposals, but it is not unusual &mdash; and I would point this out to the Deputy &mdash; for parties who are engaged in civil litigation to compromise civil proceedings between themselves, and they are perfectly entitled to do that.  That, of course, does not extend to criminal proceedings because the only one who can compromise criminal proceedings on behalf of the State is the DPP and there is no evidence that he has done so or had been asked to do so.</P>

      <P>The preparation of draft legislation on consumer credit, including moneylending, has progressed to the point where I expect shortly to seek Government approval for the principles involved.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the proposed legislation is to give effect to Council Directive 87/102/EEC on consumer credit.  The general intent of this legislation will be to lay down rules which will, as far as possible, apply to all agreements under which credit is provided for consumers, including moneylending agreements.</P>
      <P>The main effect of these rules will be to ensure that the consumer, when taking out a loan or otherwise availing of credit, will be given the maximum amount of information possible so that he or she is fully aware of the commitment being undertaken.  The legislation will also lay down rules in relation to such matters as early repayment by the consumer, repossession by the creditor or goods sold on credit, the use of promissory notes, liability for faults in goods sold on credit, etc.</P>
      <P>Moneylending is one of the forms of consumer credit which is at present governed by detailed legislation.  The special problems associated with moneylending and the way in which they can be addressed in legislation such as this will be encompassed in the decisions to be made shortly.</P>

Is there any provision in the legislative proposals that people who partake in moneylending must have a registered office in the area where they are operating, because people working with groups who are in receipt of social welfare tell me that the most flagrant cases of abuse occur when people come into an area and go from door to door using door to door sales techniques.  Is there any provision that moneylenders must have a registered office in the area of operation?</P>

      <P>The evaluation of projects by the IDA and SFADCo directly relates the level of State support being offered to the number and type of jobs to be created as well as reflecting the nature and location of the project.</P>
      <P>Under revised procedures implemented in recent years, grant agreements between a company and the agency provide that grant assistance may only be drawn down when a company has achieved set targets.  These will almost always relate to actual job creation, but for larger indigenous firms the targets may sometimes relate either to output or Irish economy expenditures.</P>
      <P>Over the next three years it is intended that half of all financial assistance to medium/large indigenous industry will be by way of repayable supports, including ordinary equity and preference shares.</P>
      <P>To further target the payment of grant assistance directly to jobs created I propose, subject to agreement by the Government and the Oireachtas and to approval by the EC Commission, to extend the eligibility for employment grants from small industry and international services&mdash;to which they are only available at present&mdash;to all manufacturing industry.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that increase in output does not necessarily mean jobs in the context of advances in technology?  If it is the case, as he has just said, that we are still getting poor value for money spent in industry <Col N="23" /> and if, having regard to the Minister's view of changes that were instituted recently, is there any change in the paragraph in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which says that all grant supports for industry will be related to performance, with jobs as the normal trigger for payment of capital grants? Does that signify any change or is the Minister saying that is what we have?</P>

      <P>What I have said, and what I would repeat, is that the procedures and criteria laid down for the payment of grants will almost always relate to actual job creation but for some larger indigenous firms the target may sometimes relate either to output or to Irish economy expenditure.  The reason it is necessary to have that, and that only applies to a very small number of firms, is that firms of that type sometimes are in danger of going under altogether if they do not get some support to maintain their level of employment.  They are the exception to the rule.  The normal criterion applied is that of job creation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The new east European markets have yet to develop as serious priorities for the majority of Irish exporters.  Niche opportunities exist and are on the increase.</P>
      <P>The best short term prospects are to be found in the sectors in receipt of support from international organisations such as the European Community's PHARE Programme and the targeted funding of the International Monetary Fund.  These opportunities are primarily, though not exclusively, in the services sector and it is in the provision of consultancy services that Irish companies have been most active and successful.</P>
      <P>To date Irish companies have obtained contracts to the value of some £10 million. CTT believe that with adequate development and a targeted marketing approach on the part of Irish exporters contracts to the value of £35 million to £50 million per year can be obtained in each of the next three years.</P>
      <P>Sectors with immediate opportunities include telecommunications, for which significant external financial assistance is available, and the food industry which is in need of substantial modernisation.  The potential in these areas is much greater if equipment sales can be linked with or follow from the supply of consultancy services.  I am convinced that with the correct marketing structures and strategy we will be well positioned to service these developing markets.</P>
      <P>We were quick to identify the potential of these emerging markets and CTT opened new offices in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland in November 1990. Several group and trade missions have already taken place.  The Taoiseach, accompanied by a business grouping visited Czechoslovakia in April.  I led trade missions to Hungary and Poland earlier this month.  Further group visits are planned for later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In visiting the markets I was particularly struck by the similarities in the difficulties facing eastern Europe in seeking to re-orientate and restructure their <Col N="26" /> economies and those which we here in Ireland tackled and overcame in the early years of our economic development.  It is for this reason that consultancy services available from Ireland are all the more relevant, based as they are on practical experience.</P>
    <P>Overall these markets present long term opportunities but it is important to be in at the beginning and I believe that the range of services available from Ireland is ideally suited to their needs and is being well presented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that one of the problems about selling into eastern Europe at the moment is their inability to pay in hard currency?  Is there any strategy or plan the Government can devise whereby they could give extended credit on behalf of exporters and take up the charge for that credit which might assist us in building up a reputation in any one of the countries from which we may benefit in the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the state of the public finances here with the public debt of more than 100 per cent of GNP, I do not think we are in a position to finance the purchases of other countries in that way.  We are conscious of what their difficulties are, of the fact that they have been exacerbated by the sudden change on 1 January this year in their trading practices with the Soviet Union, of their consequent dependence on the European Community, and we are doing everything we can to further trade within the limitations mentioned by the Deputy. However, as I pointed out in my reply, there are not insignificant sources of external funding and many of our firms are able to avail of those at present in the short term.</P>

I visited two of the three offices.  They are manned by one Irishman and one local staff member and I would like to take the opportunity to say that we are getting extremely good value because the people manning the offices are very active, enthusiastic and successful and are of great help to the Irish companies on whose behalf they are working.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 17 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>The final report by the Fair Trade Commission of their inquiry into the supply and distribution of motor fuels was published on 6 May 1991.  Copies of the report are available in the Oireachtas Library.  My response to the commission's report is contained in a press release issued at the time the report was published and I have arranged for it to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have accepted the commission's main recommendations and that of the International Energy Agency.  I propose to lift price control on petrol and autodiesel when there is the security against anti-competitive practices which the enactment of the Competition Bill, 1991 will provide.  However, I intend to keep the option of reintroducing price control <Col N="29" /> under review to ensure that the benefits, which the commission believe will accrue from the measures now proposed, are realised.</P>
    <P>I also agree with the commission's view that the enactment of the Competition Bill will make a revised restrictive practices order on motor fuels unnecessary. The Competition Bill will prohibit anti-competitive practices and the abuse of dominant positions in the market.</P>
    <P>The removal of these various controls which apply in the industry should enhance efficiency, eliminate trade distortions and facilitate vigorous competition in the industry, all of which should benefit consumers and were recommended by the Fair Trade Commission for that reason.</P>

It is quite possible, and the commission forecast this as something desirable, that the abnormal number of retail petrol outlets will reduce somewhat.  About half of them are not full-time petrol retailers, but are part of a larger business, be it shop, pub or whatever.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The choice is theirs.  If they want to engage in collusion and price fixing, as undoubtedly they did in the past, the more distant past anyway, then they have a choice of doing that and having these old, laborious, complex, bureaucratic controls reimposed on them, but if they are sensible they will not choose that.  That is what they assure me, and I will wait and see.  I am not naive.  I am well aware of what oil companies are capable of.  I had unhappy experiences with them in the seventies, as had others, but we wil see now, in the nineties, whether they honour their word.

In relation to the reply the Minister gave Deputy Spring on the important issue of the impact on small rural stations, does the Minister accept that those who are not full-time in the industry may very well close their retail outlets over a period of time?

      <askee>Minister for Industry and Commerce</askee>
      <Quest>if he has any plans to amend the law in order to ensure that, in the event of any company being under investigation, steps can be taken to protect the integrity of documents or other potential evidence in advance of the commencement of the investigation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have responsibility for <Col N="33" /> the Companies Acts, which contain specific legal provisions in relation to company investigations.</P>
      <P>Section 243 of the Companies Act, 1990, provides that any person who destroys or mutilates, or is privy to the destruction or mutilation of any book or document affecting or relating to the property or affairs of a company, shall, unless he proves that he had no intention to defeat the law, be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>In addition, where it has been decided that the affairs of a company warrant investigation under the Companies Acts, the situation is as follows:</P>
      <P>Section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to require the production of documents by a company in a wide variety of circumstances.  Section 20 of the 1990 Act empowers a district justice to issue a warrant authorising a member of the Garda Síochána together with any other person named therein to enter premises and take possession of any books or documents which have not been made available in response to the Minister's request, with a view to preserving them and preventing interference with them.</P>
      <P>Where the High Court appoints an inspector to undertake a more formal investigation of a company's affairs, it would be a matter for the court to ensure the integrity of the documents involved. I am satisfied that these provisions tackle the concerns raised by the Deputy in so far as investigations under the Companies Acts are concerned and, in the circumstances, I have no plans to further amend the Acts in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, in comparison with the investigatory powers of the UK fraud squad, our law is totally inadequate to protect documentation and documentary evidence in cases such as those outlined by Deputy Quinn?  I am sure the Minister is aware from experience that not only have the fraud squad lacked authority in recent years to gather information and documentation but that on many occasions they have been obstructed in the course <Col N="34" /> of their duties because they lack the authority and power to carry out proper investigatory procedures.  Does the Minister not accept that we need to strengthen our laws in these areas?  Otherwise we will never get to the root of white collar crime here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the case but, as the Deputy will appreciate, the question to which I replied relates to investigations under the Companies Acts by the Minister or inspectors and does not relate to criminal investigations under criminal law by the Garda Síochána, which is what the Deputy referred to.  I am aware of shortcomings in the evidence aspects of criminal investigations.  I will certainly draw the attention of the Minister for Justice to what the Deputy has said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no statutory prohibition on the use of trade marks registered abroad by Irish companies for products manufactured outside Ireland.</P>
      <P>The general position is that registration abroad with the appropriate official authority is the normal way open to an Irish company to protect the property in their trade marks abroad.  An Irish registration gives protection to the mark only in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Where a mark is registered, the owner of the registration can take action to prevent third parties, not having consent, from using the mark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the comments made by the former Director of the Office of Consumer Affairs, in the report of the Office for 1989, published on 3 December, that the office was so short of staff that they could not carry out all their functions and that consumers in some areas had no protection; if he will outline his response to these comments; if he intends to provide any additional staff or resources for the office; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the comments made by the former Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade in his report.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, control of public service costs continues to be a key factor in this Government's economic strategy.  The Department of Industry and Commerce, along with other Government Departments, are subject to restrictions on the recruitment of staff and the filling of vacanies.  As a result, my Department have suffered a reduction is staffing levels which has impacted across all sections of the Department, including the Office of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against such a background, and in common will all managers in my Department, the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade must continually review <Col N="40" /> and update procedures, including the setting up of priorities, in order to maximise the use of avaiable resources.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the importance placed on the Office of Consumer Affairs, significant additional staff resources were provided to the office in the course of 1990, increasing its staff complement from 23 to 30, a level which the director still retains.</P>
    <P>I would also like to advise the Deputy that the allocation for travel purposes sought by the Office of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade for 1990 was granted in full and, indeed, subsequently increased by a further 10.5 per cent representing an overall increase of 43 per cent on the 1989 allocation.</P>
    <P>I have agreed to a further increase in the director's travel allocation in 1991, as a result of which his travel allocation will have increased by 122 per cent over the 1989 level.</P>
    <P>These increases in staff numbers and in travel expenses are abnormally high and unique to that Office and as such are a cause of some concern to me given that there are severe restrictions in other parts of the Department whose work, at the least, is no less important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding what the Minister has said about the necessity to control public service numbers, does he not agree that it is a cause for concern that in his resignatory statement the director said he has been attempting to get some redress on these issues since 1979?  Does the Minister think it wise that the Director of Consumer Affairs continues to have no role in the choice of staff for his office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know every year the Director of Consumer Affairs makes in his annual report the same point.  I have no doubt that if other sections of my Department, for example, export credit insurance, foreign trade, industry and many other sections, were to produce individual reports each year they could all equally make a case that they were short of staff.  Since the former director resigned there has been, as I <Col N="41" /> outlined in the reply, a significant increase in the staff.  It must be the only part of my Department where there is such an increase.  It worries me a little that that is in fact the case and that there is also such a huge increase in the other facilities that have been made available to him.  He now has a very substantial staff and I have no doubt that the incoming director will be able to cope with the large number of civil servants now available to him.</P>

      <P>No.  We do not agree to this unduly short debate on the legislation on the health services.  This legislation is unwise and unacceptable in principle and we believe more time should be allowed for debate on the principle of the legislation, in view of its total inadequacy in dealing with the existence of a two-tier health service and the ever-lengthening queues and waiting lists in the health service.</P>

      <P>I am opposing the application of the guillotine to this Bill. My party do not oppose this Bill which we believe to be a good and proper Bill, but nevertheless we believe that three hours for Second Stage debate is totally inadequate and on that basis we are opposing the application of the guillotine. It is not sufficient time to deal with many of the related issues in the hospital services to which many Deputies want to give an airing.  I am in favour of the expeditious processing of legislation through this House and some more rational way of dealing with legislation, other than the application of the guillotine, must be found.  The Child Care Bill, which has been rambling through both Houses for six years, has still not been brought to a conclusion, yet we are capable of applying guillotines to legislation within days of its introduction to the House.</P>

However, I am prepared to talk to the parties about that. <Col N="115" /> If the House is under pressure for legislation then it might be advisable to leave that debate until the autumn.  It would be much more relevant then.  I shall know more about that shortly because the President of the Council &mdash; Luxembourg have the presidency &mdash; will be coming to Ireland to discuss the forthcoming Council and I will have a better idea then of the immediate agenda.  It might be a more appropriate way to proceed if the matter were to be left over until I could report on the Luxembourg Council.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill being brought before the House today is to make the legislative changes required for the restructuring of eligibility for health services, as agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The Bill also provides for the abolition of the income ceiling for payment of the health contribution, as announced in the budget in order to meet part of the cost of the very substantial development of community health services which will take place under the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's Bill arises from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> which was agreed between the Government and the social partners at the start of the year.  It is appropriate, <Col N="118" /> therefore, that I remind the House of the major commitments which it contains in relation to the health services.</P>
    <P>The programme commits the Government to investing, over a seven-year period, no less than £100 million of additional capital expenditure to the development of community-based services for the elderly, for persons with a mental or physical disability, for psychiatric patients, for child care, for the improvement of dental services and for the provision of new health centres.  We are also committed to significant increases in the level of day-to-day spending on these services, so that we will, by the end of the seven-year period, be spending £90 million more in real terms than the present level of current expenditure. The Government are committed to providing additional funding in each year's budget to achieve these targets, and a significant start was made with the allocation of £8 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>It is also very important to stress that the development of community-based services which will be possible as a result of this expenditure is going to take place in a very co-ordinated and planned way. Over the past few years working parties and study groups have carried out detailed reviews of the various services and have identified the necessary direction and priorities for their development. Deputies will be aware of the work of, for example, the Review Group on Health and Welfare Services for the Elderly, the Study Group on Psychiatric Services and the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services.  Under the programme, the key recommendations of all these reports will be implemented.</P>
    <P>The programme also set out the principles upon which the reorganisation of the health services should be based &mdash; again, drawing on the findings of the various expert groups which had studied aspects of this area, such as the Commission on Health Funding, the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group and the Hospital Efficiency Review Group.  The detail of the Government's proposals for the reorganisation of the management of <Col N="119" /> the health services will be announced in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The programme also reiterates and develops the Government's commitment to improvements in areas such as the quality of patient services, health promotion and women's health services.</P>
    <P>It would be very easy to provide health services to everyone's satisfaction if money were no object.  Unfortunately, the costs of providing health care are so high and the potential demands on the service so limitless that we will always face resource constraints and the difficult choices that go with them.  This will be true no matter what level of funding is provided.  It is crucial, therefore, that our decisions on the development of services and the way in which we make them available are based on the most thorough and expert analysis of the needs to be met and the best way of meeting them.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> involves a radical overhaul of the health services, and I believe that one of its greatest strengths is that the various proposals are backed up by the research and analysis of the expert groups I have mentioned.  Indeed, I reject the amendment in the name of Deputy Bruton that states we have our priorities wrong.  The Commission on Health Funding recommended this change in eligibility. It was recommended by NESC.  It was sought by the Congress of Trade Unions.  It was agreed by the Government and the social partners.  I cannot imagine any greater consensus than the Government and the social partners agreeing that this change is worthwhile in the interests of the people.  I have no difficulty in supporting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme's commitments in relation to eligibility provide further examples of the Government's approach to taking careful account of expert research and analysis in adapting <Col N="120" /> the health services to meet changing circumstances in our society.  The Commission on Health Funding was established shortly after I came to office in 1987.  Their report, which has been generally acknowledged as an exhaustive and most valuable examination of the funding and administration of the health services, was published towards the end of 1989.  The Government then embarked on a comprehensive consultation process on the commission's recommendations to ensure that we had the firmest possible basis for our decisions on their implementation. The commission made a number of recommendations in relation to eligibility. These were subsequently endorsed by the National Economic and Social Council in their important report &mdash;<i>A Strategy for the Nineties</i>&mdash; which provided a significant backdrop to the discussions with the social partners on the new economic and social programme. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, in particular, pressed for the inclusion of the measures in the programme, and this was agreed between the Government and the social partners.</P>
      <P>One of these measures, which did not require any amending legislation, was to have the chief executive officers of the health boards carry out an early review of the methods of assessment used throughout the country for determining eligibility for the medical card.  There is a need for these procedures to be flexible to ensure that a person in genuine need of a medical card does not suffer hardship through inability to obtain one. However, the commission had also highlighted the need for uniformity and consistency in the assessment procedures so that persons in similar circumstances are assessed similarly in all areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that this review has already been completed and that, on foot of it, the chief executives officers have now agreed uniform procedures for assessing eligibility for the medical card, which will operate consistently in all areas.  In addition, the chief executive officers have agreed that income from the social employment <Col N="121" /> scheme and the family income supplement will in all cases be excluded when an applicant's income is being assessed. These changes are very welcome.</P>
    <P>The removal of the income limit for eligibility for category 2 health services was one of the major recommendations of the Commission on Health Funding. At present there are three categories of eligibility: category 1 are entitled to the medical card and receive all necessary services free of charge; category 2 are entitled to the hospital services card and receive a more limited range of services, which includes free hospitalisation subject only to the £12.50 per day charge up to a maximum of £125 in any 12 months; and category 3 have the same entitlements as category 2 with two exceptions: they cannot avail of consultant care as a public patient and they cannot avail of the free maternity care and infant welfare service which is provided by general practitioners. In both cases, they must arrange to receive these services privately.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise, therefore, that the difference between category 2 and category 3 relates only to a person's liability for professional fees.  Everyone in either category has the same entitlement to a bed in a public ward, paying only the £12.50 charge where it applies. The removal of the income limit for category 2 &mdash; in other words, the abolition of category 3 &mdash; does not have any effect whatsoever on the number of people entitled to public ward services.  Every person is now entitled to a free bed subject to the changes I have mentioned in a public ward in a public hospital.  That will not change.  The change which comes about is for liability for professional fees.</P>
    <P>The commission put forward a number of arguments for removing the income limit &mdash; arguments subsequently endorsed by the National Economic and Social Council.  These arguments can be summarised in two sentences: first it is impossible to operate the income limit fairly; and, secondly, the existence of category 3 can in practice work against equitable access to public beds.</P>
    <P>As regards the first of these arguments, <Col N="122" /> there are several well-known difficulties in the operation of the income limit. Ostensibly, the purpose of the income limit is to identify a cut-off point beyond which a person should be able to afford to pay for any necessary consultant care for his or her self and for any dependants. In practice, the level of income alone is far too crude a measure to identify who can or cannot afford these services, since it takes no account of differing circumstances such as the size of the family, whether anyone in the family needs regular medical care and so on.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the only way to operate the income limit without having a very complex administrative system is to rely on the one document which most people can produce as evidence of their income, the form P60 or similar documentation from the Revenue Commissioners. Given that half the population are entitled to category 2 services, the House will appreciate the need for a simple method of determining eligibility, and the use of the P60 is ideal in that respect. However, it gives rise to certain anomalies. Each person in the family who has independent income, below the income limit, can obtain category 2 eligibility in their own right.  Since the income limit is £16,700 at present, a family with two salaries of £16,500 is in category 2 despite having a total income of £33,000 &mdash; yet a family with a total income of £17,000, from one salary only, is in category 3 and must pay for professional services.  A single person earning £16,500 is in category 2 while a large family with a single income of £17,000 is in category 3.  A spouse taking up employment, and thus increasing family income, can actually move from category 3 to category 2.  This occurs when the spouse of a person in category 3, who, as a dependant, would also have been in category 3, takes up employment at an income below the limit and is thus separately assessed as eligible for category 2.</P>
    <P>The second argument relates to the way in which the very existence of category 3 can, in the view of the Commission, of NESC and of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, work against <Col N="123" /> equity of access to public beds.  The fact that patients are simultaneously public patients of the hospital but private patients of the consultant, in other words, where a category 3 patient exercises his entitlement to a public bed, involves a danger that consultants may, all other things being equal, admit the fee-paying patient ahead of others, resulting in &ldquo;queue-jumping&rdquo; into public beds.  There is no administrative device that can overcome this difficulty, since the decision as to which patient is admitted first is a clinical one which can only be made by the consultant concerned.  The only solution is to move away from the concept of having fee-paying patients in public beds at all.  There are two possible ways of doing this.  The first way would be to remove the entitlement to a public bed from those in category 3.  Looking at Deputy Bruton's amendment, it appears that that is the way he wishes to go.  This would mean that the difference between the costs faced by those in category 2 and those in category 3 would greatly increase.  Since we have already seen the difficulties associated with the method of identifying those in category 3, the House will appreciate that this approach would only serve to increase the unfairness of the system.</P>
    <P>The second way is to give everyone the entitlement to avail of a public bed, as the public patient of the consultant, but to require fee-paying patients to avail of private or semi-private accommodation. This was the option recommended by all the groups I have mentioned, and it is the approach which is embodied in the Bill before the House today.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements will be as follows: everyone, regardless of income, will continue to be entitled to a public bed as a public patient; those who wish to be public patients will not be liable for consultant's fees; where a person opts to be the private patient of a consultant he or she will, of course, continue to be liable for professional fees; and modifications in the access to beds will be phased in so that, in general, public patients will be accommodated in public <Col N="124" /> beds and private patients in private or semi-private beds.  However, emergency cases will always be accommodated even if the appropriate bed is not available.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives effect to these arrangements as follows: sections 3 and 10 deal with the removal of the income limit; section 5 withdraws the entitlement to a public bed from a patient who is not availing of public consultant care, and <i>vice versa;</i> and section 6 deals with the manner in which services are to be provided to patients who are not exercising their entitlement to be a public patient, and empowers the Minister to make regulations governing this.</P>
    <P>When the Bill has been enacted, I will immediately make the regulations in question.  My intention is to provide for the designation of public hospital beds as public and private, and the public patients must be accommodated in public beds and private patients in private beds. There will be provision for emergency cases to be accommodated even when the appropriate bed is not available.  The regulations will provide for the gradual phasing in of the restrictions in access to beds over the next three years, to enable me to ensure that the new arrangements are operating fairly and effectively.</P>
    <P>In preparation for the new system, my Department have been involved in detailed discussions with every health board and public voluntary hospital, who have been asked to draw up proposals for the designation of public and private beds and for a three year phased implementation of the modified system of access to these beds.  These proposals are being examined by the Department of Health, which are responsible for co-ordinating the overall phasing and for monitoring the new arrangements as required under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  It is important to get the balance right in the designation of beds to fairly reflect the patterns of public and private practice.  Hospitals have been asked to ensure that their consultants are fully involved in drawing up their proposals.</P>
    <P>The clear identification of the status of every patient, as either the public or <Col N="125" /> private patient of the consultant, will be implemented in every hospital, for every patient, from next Saturday, 1 June.  Also from 1 June, subject to the enactment of the Bill by that date, the income limit for category 2 services will be removed, so that those who wish to avail of public consultant care may do so, regardless of income.  The system of requiring public and private patients to avail of the appropriate designated beds will then begin to be implemented, carefully and gradually, to make sure that the transition works smoothly and effectively in the interests of all patients.</P>
    <P>The new identification system will also apply to outpatient hospital services. Section 7 of the Bill provides that, in relation to outpatient services also, I will be able to specify by regulation that where a person is the private patient of a consultant he may, as with in-patient services, forego his entitlement to treatment as a public patient.  It also empowers me to specify outpatient hospital charges for private patients.  This is consistent with the general approach now being taken, i.e. that private patients of consultants should be regarded as private patients of the hospital as well.</P>
    <P>I can best summarise the purpose of the new system by saying that it is intended to benefit public patients without disimproving the position of private patients.</P>
    <P>Public patients will benefit by having greater access to public beds, as private non-emergency patients cease to occupy these beds.  My Department will be ensuring, through their monitoring of the bed designation process, that there is no fall in the number of what would have been regarded as public beds up to now. In certain hospitals, there have been beds which are nominally regarded as semi-private but which have up to now been largely occupied by public patients.  The appropriate proportion of such beds, based on a detailed examination of their usage, will be designated as public beds to ensure that there is no reduction in the number of beds effectively available to public patients.</P>
    <P>The private patients who were occupying public beds will gradually be <Col N="126" /> absorbed in private and semi-private beds.  To some extent, this will be possible by better management of these beds but, where necessary, hospitals will be able to increase the number of private and semi-private beds to cater for the level of private activity.  Any increases in the number of these beds will not be at the expense of public beds and will be introduced on a self-funding basis.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the changes in eligibility to cause any significant reduction in the proportion of the population who are already insured for private and semi-private care.  This view is shared by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and is borne out by independent research by the Economic and Social Research Institute.  There is, therefore, absolutely no basis for the suggestion which has been made by some Deputies in recent months that the new measures will lead to substantially increased pressures on public wards.  All the indications are that the benefits to public patients arising from the measures can be achieved without having to increase the number of public beds or to incur additional costs in the public hospital system.</P>
    <P>However, the programme contains a commitment to monitor the operation of the new arrangements.  If there are teething problems I am satisifed that they will be overcome and I will take whatever action proves necessary to ensure that the fundamental objective of equity of access is achieved to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Health Funding placed great emphasis on the complementary roles of public and private health care.  When those who can afford to do so decide to take financial responsibility for their own hospital expenses &mdash; for example, by taking out voluntary health insurance &mdash; those who rely on the statutory services benefit also since there are more resources available to meet their needs.  It is also unquestionable that public patients, and the public hospital system in general, benefit from the availability in that system of the highest calibre of consultant, which is encouraged by the existence of private practice in <Col N="127" /> the public hospital.  The Commission on Health Funding, whose primary concern was so much related to ensuring equity of access to services, argued clearly that there was nothing wrong with people being able to get hospital care more quickly by going privately at their own expense, provided that the public patient has a reasonable service and is not disadvantaged as a result of the private patient's access.  It is the scope for such a disadvantage, through the possible queue-jumping of private patients into public beds, which is being specifically addresed in the new measures.</P>

      <P>The public patients have a reasonable service, £1,543 million has been spent this year &mdash; the largest amount ever &mdash; and there are 59,000 people working in the public service, 2,000 more than two years ago and they provide a reasonable service.</P>
      <P>The balanced mix of public and private health care will continue &mdash; the programme contains a commitment to ensure that the public hospital system continues to cater adequately for the needs of private patients and that the important role and contribution of voluntary health insurance is not diminished in any way.  The announcement by the Minister for Finance in this year's budget that income tax relief on voluntary health insurance subscriptions will be maintained is a practical and positive demonstration of this commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Hospital Consultants' Assocation on a revision of the hospital consultants' contract, in the context of the report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, took place in the light of the possible effects of the change in eligibility on the income of consultants from private practice. the medical organisations are currently considering substantive proposals from management on <Col N="128" /> both remuneration and conditions attaching to consultant appointments.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with one aspect of eligibility which did not arise from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The opportunity presented by the need to amend the eligibility provisions in the Health Act is being taken to provide a statutory basis for operating a residency qualification for access to services under the Act.  For reasons which I will now explain, it is necessary to do this in order to ensure that groups such as young Irish emigrants and persons working temporarily abroad are catered for fairly and on the basis of standard guidelines.</P>
    <P>It has long been the practice to operate a residency qualification for entitlement to health services in Ireland and, indeed, this is the practice in most of other countries also.  A person is regarded as &ldquo;belonging&rdquo; to the health care system of the country of residence.  If he needs health care while in another country he is subject to whatever arrangements that country makes for non-residents.  This would never, of course, mean being denied necessary treatment, but it can mean being liable for the cost of providing it.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a statutory basis for the residency qualification, it has not been possible to have any statutory or uniform criteria for determining when a person should be regarded as qualifying. The Commission on Health Funding pointed that this can lead to uncertainty, and the operation of different criteria in different areas.  Under the Bill's provisions, the sections of the Health Act dealing with the two categories of eligibility will both be amended to insert &ldquo;ordinary residence&rdquo; as a qualification. There is also a provision to empower me to issue guidelines on uniform criteria for regrading a person as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; for this purpose.  These guidelines will be for the use of the health boards in deciding on eligibility, and also for appeals officers under the new appeals system on health eligibility maters which is currently being established.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides certain safeguards in <Col N="129" /> relation to this issue.  Section 9 specifies that the new provision will not in any way affect the arrangements under which residents of European Community member states may obtain necessary services, while temporarily in another European Community country, on the same basis as if they were living there.  The Bill also provides that the powers of a chief executive officer of a health board to award full eligibility on hardship grounds to someone who would not normally qualify, will extend to giving eligibility, where it is warranted, to persons who do not meet the criteria for &ldquo;ordinary residence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Before formulating guidelines on the criteria for being regarded as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;, I propose to arrange for discussions between my Department and the health boards on the common problems which arise at present in the interpretation of residence.  My intention is to ensure that anyone with a reasonable case for being regarded as eligible for health services here is able to avail of them.  In particular, persons temporarily abroad must be catered for.  I am thinking here, for example, of recent emigrants who may not yet have established permanent residence elsewhere, and of people who go abroad to work on short term assignments but would still be regarded as maintaining their permanent residence here.  The case of foreign students in Ireland is also one which has given rise to differences in interpretation, and I have in mind to specify, following the relevant consultations, that registration for courses of study beyond a specified duration can be taken as qualifying the student as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the amendment of the Health Contributions Act, 1979, to abolish the income ceiling for payment of health contributions.  In the budget speech, the Minister for Finance announced that this contribution would, from the 1991-92 tax year, apply to all income, as is already the case with the employment and training levy.  As the income ceiling was £16,700, the effect of its abolition is that 1.25 per cent of all gross income over that amount will now <Col N="130" /> be payable, in addition, of course, to 1.25 per cent of the first £16,700.  A person earning £20,000 per annum, for instance, will pay an additional £41.25, or approximately 80p per week.  Persons earning less than £16,700 will not be affected in any way.</P>
    <P>There is no direct relationship between the income limit for category 3 health services and the income ceiling for health contributions.  They have differed from time to time and, although they have usually been the same, there is no legal or technical reason why this should have been the case.  It is certainly not the case that the income ceiling on health contributions is being abolished as any kind of a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the removal of the category 3 income limit.  The purpose of the measure is to provide some of the very substantial cost of the development of community-based services under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  As I outlined earlier, this will involve capital investment of £100 million over the next seven years, and will also involve yearly incremental increases in the level of current expenditure so that annual current spending on these services will be £90 million higher in real terms in seven years' time than would have been the case in the absence of the programme.</P>
    <P>The total amount of additional spending over the seven years will thus cumulate to several hundred million pounds, and this will enable us to transform our community-based services along the lines recommended by the various working parties and study groups in recent years. In this context, I believe that the decision to draw a greater yield from the health contribution, without in any way affecting those earning under £16,700, is more than justified.  This income will also enable any costs to be met which arise from the eligibility extension, although I should stress that it is by no means certain at this stage that the eligibility measures should give rise to any significant extra costs, for the reasons which I discussed earlier.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to return to the primary purpose of the Bill, which is <Col N="131" /> to provide for the new eligibility arrangements which were agreed with the social partners as part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  These measures address the difficulties with the present system which were highlighted by the Commission on Health Funding and by the National Economic and Social Council, both of whom recommended changes along the lines now being introduced. They will work in the interests of equity and of the public patient, while at the same time maintaining the important balance of public and private care in our public hospital system.  Deputies opposite have said that we have a two-tier system and suggested that this is a new development but it is not.  That has been the position since the foundation of the State and this system, with its integrated mix of public and private care, has served the nation well.</P>
    <P>Since the announcement of the programme in January, my Department have had very extensive discussions with the health boards, the voluntary hospitals and the medical organisations, in order to devise detailed arrangements for the implementation of the new measures.  I feel that this approach was most justified in view of the importance of getting the new system right.  The operation of the new arrangements will be continuously monitored to ensure that they work fairly, and are seen to work fairly.  In the light of the analysis of the commission and of the NESC, and particularly in the light of the discussions with the social partners, I am satisfied that there is a wide measure of support for the course of action being taken.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann declines to give the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1991 a second reading for the following reasons:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="132" />  (1)  it represents a totally wrong set of priorities, when those already eligible for hospital services cannot get an acceptable level of care;</P>
    <P>(2)  it will worsen existing services, because no extra money has been allocated to match the further eligible patients; and</P>
    <P>(3)  it accepts and reinforces the two-speed health services by abandoning the fundamental principle of a common waiting list for core services where priority in access to services is decided on the basis of greatest medical need.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a serious error in this move.  It is clear he has the wrong set of medical priorities.  He is proposing in this measure that we extend eligibility for free consultant care to those earning between £500 to £700 a week, including top business executives who have not asked that this change be made.  We should have a different set of priorities in the health services given that there are many on public waiting lists for operations. For example, 1,700 people are awaiting hip replacement operations, 2,400 for tonsillectomy operations, 3,000 for cataract operations and 1,000 for heart by-pass surgery.  They are but a few of the people who are not being adequately served under the present system of care.  The Minister should concentrate his resources on dealing with their problems and then, by all means, extend eligibility for free consultant care under category 3 to the top 15 per cent of income earners.</P>
    <P>The reality is that those who depend on public health care have to wait in line without adequate services being provided. The Minister, and Deputies sitting behind him, must be aware of the plight of 66,000 carers who are not being provided with the resources they need, who cannot obtain any respite and who are trying to cope in silence under fierce pressure.  That is the reality.  He must also be aware that there are 103 haemophiliacs who have been waiting two years for a crumb of compensation as a <Col N="133" /> result of having been infected by the HIV virus.  People are not being properly served and I believe the Minister is wrong to extend this entitlement to the top category of income earners.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted selectively from the report of the Commission on Health Funding and the views of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  He grossly distorted their position.  Both congress and the commission have strongly endorsed the fundamental principle that access to our hospitals must be on the basis of priority medical need &mdash; those with the greatest need must get first call.  That is a fundamental principle of health care.  It is what people on all sides of this House, I believe, regard as necessary from our health services, but the Minister has turned his back on that recommendation. We have had a golden opportunity in the past 12 months to deal with the problem of the common waiting list.  That is what Gleeson addressed himself to in this report, No. 32.  The reason the taxpayer is being asked to pay an extra £35 million to hospital consultants is so that we would have a service we could stand over and where we knew that the consultants would be delivering care to public patients.  This is stated in one of the fundamental recommendations of the Gleeson review body report.  It states there should be a contractual provision for a review of the actual mix of public and private patients treated, based on the principle that medical need should be the overall criterion for health services.  That was the fundamental principle underpinning Gleeson and also the report of the Commission on Health Funding.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2.61 of the report of the Commission on Health Funding states:</P>
    <P>An objective system of assessment for access to public hospitals should be introduced for all planned (as opposed to emergency) admissions, involving a common waiting list for both public and private patients, from which cases would be taken in order of medically-established priority.</P>
    <P>That is the fundamental principle underlying these two very valuable reports <Col N="134" /> which the Minister had commissioned. He is turning his back on them although he is attempting to claim their endorsement for what he is doing.</P>
    <P>The reality is very different.  The Minister is extending cover to a new category of people although he is not providing any extra money this year.  There will be fewer hospital admissions this year because the Minister while preserving the number of hospital beds has endorsed health board moves to extend closures for the summer months.  Ultimately we will have fewer admissions to our hospitals.  What the Minister is doing, by segregating for all time the public and private sections is institutionalising a two speed health service where those seeking public care will be on hopelessly long waiting lists while there will be quick access for those seeking private care and that is completely contrary to the principle underlying these reports.  We had decided to pay extra money to the consultants and to deal with the problems with the common waiting list, because we all knew it was not working, although, the Minister until very recently insisted that access was solely on medical need. We were provided with a vehicle to deal with this problem but the Minister did not take it up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister caved in to the consultants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This move in the long run will have very damaging effects on our public health service because it condemns it to permanent inferior status. The Minister is at pains to insist that this new service will not be taken up, that there will be no diminution of private care and that people who are now being offered something for nothing, according to him, would not dream of taking it up.  There is only one reason that these people would not dream of taking it up and that is because the service will not be there for them and they are not willing to join the long queues for service which are a feature of public health care at present.  The Minister seems determined to have ordinary workers scrimp and <Col N="135" /> scrounge to try to get the cost of VHI cover together so that they can get care when they need it.  That is the system he is going to perpetuate.  Furthermore what the Minister is saying, in effect is that not only is he not content that they should scrimp and save for VHI cover but he is insisting they will have to pay another £20 million in health levies to the Exchequer which works out at £120 for the average earner.  They will have to pay this levy in addition to the VHI, their only option being to abandon VHI cover in favour of this new cover which in reality is not there for them.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about how the health levy would be applied to developing community services.  Anyone who recalls the last budget will recall grimly that this year the extra £4 million to be raised by the health levy was clawed back by the Exchequer in extra savings.  That is what has happened to the health levy and that is what is likely to happen in the future.  The Minister for Finance sees this as a new cash cow and I believe that is the real hidden agenda behind this move. It has nothing to do with solving the problem of unfair access to our health services or of providing equity in our system, the real agenda is that the Minister wants cover for abandoning hospital admission on the basis of need and wants to cover himself for the claim on extra revenue insisted on by the Minister for Finance. The extension of cover which the Minister time and again insists will be taken up is only a smokescreen which fools no one as to the real agenda he is pursuing.  Indeed the Minister had not the sense to abolish the health levy at this stage.  The health levy is meaningless in the system the Minister is proposing and is one of the most iniquitious forms of taxation because there is no threshold such as we have in income tax and people are paying on the very first pound.  The Minister is retaining a cumbersome assessment system where people will have to pay regardless of income.  I think that was a bad day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amused to hear the Minister suggest that to deal with queue jumping he <Col N="136" /> would withdraw private rights to use of public beds.  This is what the Minister has talked about all the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is condemning people to queues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole policy the Minister is pursuing is to create separate queues.  There will not be queue jumping because there will be no need for it as the Minister is enshrining in our system a permanent separation, a fast lane for those who can afford and a slow lane for those who cannot.  The only way the Minister will be able to keep this new category out of the public service will be by maintaining that inferior service.  If there was a decent public service the Minister knows right well that the 30 per cent at present in the VHI would be availing of that service.  The way he is going to keep the 30 per cent who dip into their pockets to pay the VHI is by maintaining an inferior public health service. The way to deal with the problem of an inferior public service is not to extend cover but to channel the moneys into the areas we could have dealt with so as to provide a decent level of care to those who have to avail of public care and have nowhere else to turn to.</P>
      <P>Anyone who considers the issue of queue-jumping &mdash; that is what the Minister was describing &mdash; realises that the only way people jump the queue is that they have the money in their pockets to pay for the service and not what ward they are in.  That is what is determining the differnce.  Making people eligible for a service that will not be available to them will not change that.  People who have the money to pay will still get priority access under the Minister's proposals whereas the commission are going out of their way to say that core services must be available on the basis of medical need. That recommendation has been abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another big deficiency of the Bill we are considering today is the complete silence on another issue mentioned in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> but which did not receive any <Col N="137" /> mention here today, that is the question of a patients' charter.  That was one good proposal in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> a proposal which we, on this side of the House would have endorsed.  We would have been very pleased to see a patients' charter enshrined in our health Acts.  We had hoped that the charter would not be a pious aspiration but a legal underpinning so that we would know that people could demand legal redress if the terms of the charter were not being honoured.  It is very sad that we do not see a proposal in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is sad that the Minister made no mention of any such move.  A proper charter would go well beyond what the Minister has listed in the PESP.  The fundamental issue for a patients' charter is the one mentioned in the health commission report, that is, a fair system of access to health care when people need it.  The fundamental proposal to back the common waiting list was that there would be regular publication of criteria for hospital admission and there would be a maximum waiting time that people would be expected to wait.  That would give a patient in the public sector something real to look forward to.  If we had in this Bill a guaranteed level of public service, a guarantee that they would not have to wait unacceptable lengths of time, then we would have a Bill that we could start talking about, giving guarantees to our public patients and providing a better service for them, not this proposal we have here today to extend care to people who are not a priority at the moment, who could not by any measure be considered as people who are in need of our health services.</P>
    <P>The reasons offered by the Minister for this change are remarkably weak.  One of those reasons is an anomaly in the income limit.  The Minister seems to have some sort of problem with conducting a means test for access to free hospital care.  That is not an adequate reason for abandoning the idea that we should concentrate our resources on the people who need it.  The Minister also mentioned queue-jumping. <Col N="138" /> Queue-jumping enables people with money in their pockets to gain preferential access.  The Minister has endorsed that principle by having a completely separate private waiting list.  We will now have private waiting lists and public waiting lists.  The Minister is institutionalising queue-jumping.  We will live to regret this move.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have made an effort to concentrate resources on public patients.  I would have warmly supported one of the elements in the Minister's programme, namely that people who are getting private care cannot occupy a public bed.  We on this side of the House would have no problems with that whatsoever. It is a sound principle.  If it had the beneficial effect of freeing beds, that would be great.  However, that is not what we have today, and that could have been done without all this smokescreen of extending cover.  That is just an administrative rule the Minister could have provided for.  It was envisaged in the Gleeson report that it would be there.  One of the principles in the Gleeson report was that consultants would declare patient eligibility status.  Gleeson was at pains to make that system work so that private patients would not be able to jump queues, and the Minister has sold that.</P>

I mentioned the haemophiliacs already.  Once again I want to take this opportunity to say it is high time we had a decent settlement for those people.  Already 18 have died and those left are facing a grim future.  The Minister should have the good grace to have a settlement for them.  They had to have another public meeting last week which was pathetic in the extreme, and there was no representative from the Department at that meeting.  It was depressing, and it is not acceptable.</P>

    <P>Another issue which disturbs me enormously at the moment is the future of the <Col N="139" /> Tallaght Hospital in the constituency the Minister of State represents.  I have heard &mdash; and I would like to hear the Minister's confirmation &mdash; that that project has not only been delayed but has been scrapped. It is not just on the back burner, it is off the burner altogether.  That proposal was fundamental to the reform of the hospital services in Dublin.  The Minister makes great play with the various commissions and managerial manuals he has on his desk.  However, this is an area of the city which is larger than Limerick which has no hospital and has been waiting for years for action to build a hospital.  There has been a hospital board in operation since 1980 but nothing else.  This is one of the priority needs that is being asked to wait in the queue, and that is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>On the question of priority cases, once again the nursing home problem is raising its head.  The Eastern Health Board are running into difficulties paying subventions to people in nursing homes, people who can no longer be cared for at home and for whom the subvention on which they were depending has not come through.  The Minister was to have had, by April of this year, a new system of subventions giving high, medium and low levels of subvention to different categories of care.  The Minister has been silent on that but he comes into the House with this Bill which is, by no stretch of the imagination, a health priority at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister must address much more fundamental reforms if he wants to see our health services develop and bring equity into the system.  There are many people who are marginally above the medical card limit and they do not have access to primary care.  They have to dip into their pocket for every penny needed for primary care.  If the Minister was to extend cover, here was the very worthy case of people on very low incomes who had to dip into their pockets for the first £32 per month for drugs and for all their hospital costs.  There was the place to concentrate money and set about giving people a chance to avail of primary care and keep them out of the hospitals.  The Minister has always publicly endorsed the <Col N="140" /> idea of developing care for people in the community and giving them a chance, but that has not come about.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House.  Our views on this side of the House have been quite clearly spelled out.  The Minister has fluffed what was a real opportunity to provide decent levels of care for the many people dependent on the public service who have nowhere else to turn. We would have endorsed moves such as taking private patients out of public beds or giving public patients a charter that would be legally underpinned but that is not what came up.  This is only an effort to raise extra finances and to extend cover to people who have not even asked for it and who, the Minister is insisting, will not take it up; and people will not take up a free scheme because it will not be there for them.  People will not be able to get access and we will have a permanent second class public service under this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with this legislation and when the Minister announced it earlier in the year I intimated this.  I felt it did not really address issues of access to public beds in public hospitals for those who are entitled under the existing medical card system.  If beds, consultants, doctors and nurses were available to provide the service, those long waiting lists would not exist.  The only reason we have waiting lists for beds is people's inability to gain admission.  I may give further details during the afternoon of what we are talking about.  It is obvious the Minister is unaware yet of some of the difficulties in relation to health, health care and particularly acute hospital care.  We told him so in the election campaign in 1987.  Shortly after that there were slight improvements.  In 1989 we continued the message and we continue it now on the eve of local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation means we are asking more people to pay more money for services which are not available.  That is categoric, true.  Any Member who is a member of a health board will be aware that those who are entitled to the service cannot get it but this Bill purports to <Col N="141" /> make beds available to other categories who up to now were considered to be private patients.  Beds are being promised to everybody in spite of the fact that no additional beds are made available in any hospital and no funding is being provided. It is as if somebody driving down the road in a small car with four seats offers four people a drive because he has four seats available and suddenly tells ten people on the road that they are all entitled to a drive in the small car with the four seats, but it is not possible to accommodate them.  Any acute public hospital that can say it has not a waiting list for acute beds is concealing that fact. On a weekly basis we receive information about their difficulties in trying to live within their allocations identified by the Minister at budget time.  That is coming to light each week from the Southern Health Board, the South-Eastern Health Board, the Eastern Health Board and other boards.</P>
    <P>Recently the Labour Party introduced the Ethics in Government and Public Office Bill which provided that people should declare publicly their interests. We suggest today there ought to be a new law for cynical politicians which we would call the O'Hanlon law.  It could take its place alongside Murphy's law or the Peter principle and it would work on the following lines: whenever the essential social services for which a Minister has responsibility are going through a deep crisis everybody's attention should be diverted by unveiling a gimmick.  Irrespective of the support the Minister says he has from the various organs, trade unions, negotiators, NESC or anybody else, this legislation, and its implications, are a gimmick.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the Bill in detail I would like to mention related matters when I talk about gimmicks because we hear many of them nowadays.  Deputy Bruton referred to a matter which I was the first to announce in this House, the postponement of the new Tallaght hospital project.  I said then and I say now that the decision to postpone that was a disgrace considering the urgent need for <Col N="142" /> this acute facility for the people of Tallaght. The site development was initiated in the mid-eighties to provide essential hospital services for up to 150,000 Dublin citizens living in Tallaght and the surrounding district.  The 1991 health capital programme showed no provision for the hospital in Tallaght.  As a result all the work, planning and development suddenly came to a halt.</P>
    <P>Yet another public scandal arises from this and Deputy Bruton has asked the Minister to reply to it.  I understand the Minister is about to compound this scandal with yet another cynical stroke by calling the hospital board together next week for their first meeting in over a year. I have no doubt that on that occasion the Minister will suggest that, although no provision has been made for it and even though all the planning and development has been halted, the hospital has got the go ahead from the Government.  There is no doubt that the local elections on 27 June are a magic wand.  If we had a local election every year we would have magic cosmetic local government reform as we had last week.  We would have other promises like that about the river crossing in Cork which I am sure Deputy Allen will confirm is another gimmick.  Next week we will hear promises about the new hospital in Tallaght to suit the local government election candidates of the Minister's party in that area.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that, in spite of the difficulties of canvassing in the constituencies and attending at the House, we should have elections more often because they would help solve some of the problems confronting all of us, including the Minister.  However, we will solve no problems with this gimmicky Bill.  It is not even a three card trick.  On occasions in the three card trick game one can see two of the three cards.  In spite of the best gloss the Minister puts on it, this Bill will create major administrative problems in all hospitals and health board areas.  Hospital administrators throughout the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;have said there will be major difficulties in putting this Bill into operation.  Even the Minister identified the difficulties in his speech.  On numerous occasions he said he will review it after it is in operation for a number of years.  He said he will continuously monitor the operation of the new arrangements to ensure they work fairly and are seen to work fairly.  There should be no reason to review the operation of the Bill if it is as easy as the Minister implied when he said that everybody is entitled to a hospital bed and public consultant services.</P>
      <P>In all this smooth talk the Government are now claiming to enshrine in the Bill an important and fundamental principle, that of universal access to health care.  I would support the Minister if that was the case but this Bill does not do that and we do not want to create the impression in peoples' minds that it does.  The Government are making a mockery of the principle of the fundamental right of access to health care.  They are introducing legislation against a background of health services that are in deep crisis. The end result of the extension of this access will be that fewer rather than more people will receive proper care when they need it.</P>
      <P>Of course, the Bill will act as a useful fund raiser for the Exchequer.  Although the Minister admitted that there will be an increased take as a result, he did not identify what the take will be.  We will not hear much about that from the Fianna Fáil or Progressive Democrats activists on the doorsteps in the next weeks. According to the calculations we have made, and the figures published by the Minister for Finance, the net effect is that this Bill will raise an additional £19 million in taxation through PRSI contributions next year.  That amounts to additional taxation and is achieved by removing the present income limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will people get for this £19 million extra taxation?  What are they being offered under this Bill?  It is not an extension of a free consultant service as we understand it.  What they are being offered is a choice, to stay in the VHI or <Col N="144" /> join the queue of medical card holders and others.  At present those entitled to free consultancy service are not entitled to access to the consultant of their choice just as they are not entitled to a hospital bed when they need one.  They are only entitled to access to whatever consultant is available in the hospital to which they are referred and to a bed when it becomes free.  Our free system of health care now means that if you have an income you jump the queue, but if you do not have an income you join the queue.  The Bill we are now debating is offering people in the VHI a chance of joining the queue. Technically speaking, a large number of people in the VHI do not need to be in it but they will have to remain in it if they want to jump the queue.  Why should they opt out of the VHI if no public health care system is available at present?  When one thinks about it, this is a bizarre offer by the Government.  It is even more bizarre when one considers that Fianna Fáil have described this as progress.</P>
    <P>In order to understand why this Bill is little more than a gimmick, it is necessary to consider part of the background to it. We in the Labour Party have always been totally committed to a comprehensive health care system, free at the point of access to all our people, and funded by general taxation.  For the last number of years, particularly over the past four years, we have fought against the principles brought in by the Minister for Health in this Government and in the preceding Government.  The Minister has presided over the destruction of many of the health services which had been put in place.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State was not in the House at the time most of the damage was done but I will itemise the decisions taken by the Minister so that he will be aware of them.  It was by no means a perfect service, and we never said it was, but at least it had been protected from the worst cutbacks implemented during the previous years.  During the <Col N="145" /> four years the Minister's predecessor, Barry Desmond was in office &mdash; when he was much maligned by the present Minister and his colleagues &mdash; he kept spending on our health services as constant a proportion of our national wealth as possible.  Whenever the Government talk about borrowing, on the Exchequer borrowing requirement, or the current budget deficit or any other excuse they want to make, they always point out how they are reducing these factors as a proportion of the national wealth or GNP. However, when one applies the same measure to the health services, then the root cause of the crisis becomes abundantly and immediately clear.  When Barry Desmond left office £7 out of every £100 of our wealth was being spent on our national health service.  In 1987 this amount was reduced by the present Minister to £6.60 and to £6.30 in 1988.</P>

      <P>I appreciate your protection, a Cheann Comhairle, as it is very difficult for Ministers to accept these statistics. As I have done many time before, I want to put it on the record that 4,000 health workers have been made redundant, sacked or otherwise in our health services since the Minister came into office.  Charges were introduced in a range of essential services.  Yet the Minister talks about free consultant services and free hospital beds.  In 1987 the Minister introduced charges for these beds of £10 per day for the first ten days. However, like Scrooge, the Minister increased this charge to £12.50 during Christmas week last year.  Yet the Minister says that these beds are free.  They are not free; they cost £125 for ten days. Two thousand beds have been removed from the acute hospital services while 300 geriatric beds and 700 psychiatric beds have been removed.  The Minister says that there are no patients for these beds as they are all now living in the community. What funds has the Minister allocated to the community for these patients?  Twenty four hospitals have been closed by the Minister.  Some of them have been reopened under the guise of day care centres, etc but they have been closed as hospitals.  The threat of further closures still hangs over us.  As a result of pressure, some of these acute beds were restored in recent years.  The Taoiseach told the Minister that he would have to do something about this matter as the Government of the day were running into difficulties.  Even though some beds have been restored, there are still 1,000 fewer beds in our hospital services since Deputy Rory O'Hanlon was appointed as Minister for Health.  That is some statistic for the Minister to preside over.  I acknowledge that the Minister has had to work within his budget and argue with the Minister for Finance at the Cabinet table for more funds.  Yet 1,000 beds have been lost in our hospital services since he came into office.  If his Minister of State <Col N="147" /> believes that that is overspending, then God help us.</P>

      <P>We have repeated those statistics in virtually every debate we have had in this House on our health services and the destruction of health care.  As we have emphasied, statistics convey only a cold impression of the human suffering caused by these cutbacks. People who suffer from any abnormaly or disease, for example, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, mental handicap, physical disability, psychiatric illness, asthma, AIDS or haemophilia, are particularly vulnerable in a host of ways and they have to depend on the Minister and the Government for help.  It is those people and their families who have been the victims of the health cutbacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil put up posters at election time saying that cuts would hurt the old, the sick and the underprivileged.  They would not dare to publish such posters for the forthcoming local elections as they know they have hurt those people more than they were ever hurt previously.  The Minister is shaking his head but he cannot deny that this is what has happened.  I told the Minister that during the run-up to the 1989 general election we would have to bring home to people on their doorsteps the reality of the situation in regard to the health service.  Politicians are accused of causing this suffering.  We in the Labour Party consistently opposed the Health Estimates.  Even when other parties supported the Fianna Fáil miniority Government, we opposed them on the basis that we believed we were doing a service to the people we represented. At least we had the courage to bring this matter to the floor of the House.  We have been unequivocal in adhering to the fundamental principle that health care is a basic human right.  Everybody, bishops, priests, Catholic associations and so on believe that this basic human right puts an explicit obligation on the community to discriminate positively in favour of the <Col N="148" /> poor.  The Minister of State is shaking his head.  Obviously he does not believe that health cuts discriminate against the poor. However, the Minister of State probably does not know what it is like to be poor.</P>

      <P>The policy adopted by the Government has discriminated against the less well off in our community and has made it increasingly difficult for people on low incomes to secure any access, not to mention equal access, to our health service.  We will never be able to describe health care as a basic human right until such time as all of us in this House, particularly the Government, face up to the need for an adequate level of resources for this service.  One needs to have priorities in allocating resources. If you say there is not sufficient money in the kitty, let us come back to the House on this issue so that we can decide with you on the priorities, of which health care is certainly one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to do that.  We will never be able to describe this health care as a basic human right until this Government face up to their responsibility in relation to resources.  They have had access to a wide range of reports which have been commissioned by the Minister.  These include the Commission on Health Funding report, the Kennedy report and the Fox report.  This Government and this Minister have had more reports than the number of hospitals that have been closed and that is 24.  At the end of the day the decision must be made as one of principle.  No final decision can be made on how much is to be spent on our health services until we decide whether health care is a basic human right.  If we decide that it is a basic human right, we must take the necessary steps to give effect to the principle.  Instead, the effects of the cutbacks are visible all around us.  After the 1989 general election the Minister for Health charged the health boards with providing the same level of service as they had been providing. The current budget provision will not allow any of the health boards to maintain that level of service and will result in their being forced to cut back severely on services, and that will result in further waiting lists for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I attempted to raise in the House the problems faced by the Southern Health Board where there is £7 million in unpaid debts, where travelling expenses to workers, public health nurses and community care workers remain unpaid.  This was not denied by either the Minister or the chief executive of the Southern Health Board.  While people supplying the health board have to suffer <Col N="150" /> delays in payment as have people providing a service to the health board, the boards are told that they must maintain the level of service at the same rate as applied in 1989.  In the South Eastern Health Board area, though the allocation was increased only by a fraction to take account of inflation, services were not only maintained but increased.  Nurses at Waterford Regional Hospital have been parading on the streets to demonstrate the problems there because of reduced numbers.  Activity at that hospital during 1990 increased by 5 per cent, patient days increased by 12 per cent and day-care cases increased by 33 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>During the same year the number of patients treated at Wexford General Hospital increased by 3.5 per cent, and there was a 5.4 per cent increase in patient days.  There was an increase in St. Luke's Hospital of 5 per cent in patient numbers.  In St. Joseph's, Clonmel, the corresponding increase was 2 per cent.  The number being treated at Clonmel General Hospital was about 6,500 with the same number or even fewer nurses than was the case previously.  In Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, surgical operation numbers increased by 8 per cent in 1990 where no additional staffing or funding was made available and in Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital there was an increase of 31 per cent.  These figures are published by the health boards themselves.  I will quote from the <i>South Eastern Health Board Annual Report 1989</i> which reported on 8 March 1990 as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation of funds from the Department of Health to health boards and health agencies continues to be mainly historically based adjusted for the revenue consequences of capital schemes rather than on any objective or equitable basis.  However in 1989 the report of the Commission on Funding was published.  The Commission was established to advise on the very complicated issue of how health services <Col N="151" /> should be funded in Ireland.  Much of the board's criticism of the allocation procedure was echoed in that report. </P>
    <P>  This was a health board elected by the people, nominated by the professions, telling the Minister at the end of the year that they agreed with the report of the Commission on Funding.  The report continued:</P>
    <P>The Commission was given the additional task of advising on the type of organisation required to deliver health services in future.  The Board, at a special meeting welcomed this report with certain important reservations, especially in relation to the recommendations on organisation.  There are many recommendations which should, if implemented, effect marked improvement in both the system and the services. </P>
    <P>Following the emergency introduction of the Health Estimate in the House on 18 December &mdash; Official Report, column 15 &mdash; the Minister said:</P>
    <P>While there are many needs for capital to enable the existing services to be maintained and to allow for very desirable developments, it is not possible for the Government in the current financial climate to provide other than for contractual obligations and essential works, such as fire precautions. During 1990, I have conducted a very thorough review of the capital needs of the health services and I remain committed to introducing a five year programme for capital expenditure. </P>
    <P>Yet at the same time he is telling us he will make more beds available to more people at the same hospital without additional capital.  It cannot be done unless the Minister is a magician.  We will give him the opportunity to prove whether he is a magician.  I have a problem because all the health boards have been in constant contact with us. We appreciate being told exactly what is happening on the ground.  Only today we read in the newspapers that health boards <Col N="152" /> are planning to close down beds during the summer.</P>

      <P>They closed because the Minister did not give them sufficient funding to remain open.  It is nonsense for the Minister to attempt to tell us that bed numbers will be maintained at the same level as last year.  How can the level of service be maintained at last year's rate?  Who will provide the nursing, the medical care and round the clock service even in the summertime when the beds are closed and when people need them? The majority of health boards are over-budgeted at present and are unable to meet their obligations.  The Minister is presiding over deficits of £20 million to health boards all over the country.  With the cutbacks on the way this year, the crisis in our health service has once again become a major political talking point. The Minister was able to bring such matters to the fore when he was in Opposition. Now he should take the consequences of what is happening in the area of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other areas have also been drastically affected including community care services which in some cases have been damaged beyond repair.  Action must be taken to allocate new resources to the community care area.  The £8 million allocation to which the Minister referred in his contribution is a joke.  It represents <Col N="153" /> about £1 million, on average, for each health board.  Such money will go nowhere towards alleviating the crisis that exists.  It is very difficult to understand how he can accept that a sum of £8 million is sufficient.  Women in particular will bear the burden.</P>
    <P>Services for people with mental or physical disability have deteriorated in recent years.  The individuals and groups caring for such people have occupied the Minister's offices to protest.  They have held public meetings at the Mansion House.  The report of the Minister's review group, published in the past couple of weeks, graphically demonstrated that there has been a standstill in this area in real budget terms.  In the meantime the handicapped and their families have grown older and their demands are more pressing every day. The crisis in the area of mental handicap covers many aspects but the most worrying feature is that there appears to be little or no planning for the future.  A great deal of lip service is paid by the Government to the concept of planning. The reality is that the agencies and their staff in the field are so busy dealing with the crisis in our current services and worrying about next year's financial allocations that they cannot even look ahead to plan.  The human hardship involved in mental handicap and physical disability will take a great deal more planning, and the planning would need to start now.  It must take place in the knowledge that resources will be made available.  If these resources are not made available the Minister will be reneging on his responsibilities. That is the reason we believe it is imperative that the Minister for Finance and the Government commit themselves for a period of years to improving the funding available in the areas for mental handicap at least to the amounts recommended by the review group.  This would go some way towards alleviating stress and anxiety for thousands of families.</P>
    <P>The current crisis in our health service is inexcusable.  Whatever Government came into office after the 1989 election, the one thing they could not claim was that the people had failed to give them <Col N="154" /> a mandate in the area of health.  The message from the electorate was clear and unequivocal but it has been totally ignored by this Government.  The health service has been pared to the bone in the past three years and I wish I had the words to convey to the Government the anger in the community at the scale and extent of these cutbacks.  The anger arises not just from the inconvenience of queueing or the hardship of pain and suffering while on a waiting list or the frustration of having to pay, often from very small incomes, for essential services to which we have all become accustomed as a right.  My colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, tells me there is a waiting list of eight years for varicose vein treatment in Dublin.  It can take years to get a hip operation.  There are also waiting lists for ENT services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been long enough in Government to do something about it instead of referring back to his predecessor in the previous Government. The Minister is unable to take this criticism at a time when he is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a real sense the anger in our community springs from the loss of dignity involved in seeking access to services to which people no longer feel they are entitled.  In Victorian times charity was inflicted on the poor.  People who had nothing were made to feel they belonged to a lower order by the way in which charity was doled out to them.  There was no concept of rights and no feeling that decent shelter, a good education and basic health care were part of the citizen's entitlement and the community's obligation. We are rapidly approaching that concept again under this Government and we have already reached it where health care is concerned.  I never thought that in my time in politics I would see a day when I would have to argue for the right of access to health care, but as I work in my constituency I come in contact every day with people who are <Col N="155" /> hoping for their turn to get some basic treatment.  People are becoming resigned to the fact that they do not have a right to treatment because their income does not warrant it.  Other Members can also see this happening if they care to look. There is growing anger at a Government who have chosen to undermine the right of every citizen.</P>
    <P>The bottom line after this year's budget is that there is £2.3 million less in the Health Estimate in real terms than before the budget.  That is the background against which this Bill is being debated and guillotined.  The changes in health care eligibility announced in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are enshrined in this Bill but they must be regarded as a sick joke.  How we will cure the sick joke I do not know, except by voting.  These changes were announced on the basis that they would be broadly welcomed in principle but in practice they cannot be delivered.  To expect things to happen without negotiation and without resources makes nonsense of the principle.  The Minister has had meetings with the consultants and it is obvious that they have a problem about this.  Let us hope that there may be some light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>The number of people entitled to a free hospital bed will be exactly the same after this extension as before.  The shortage of beds will still exist and will be at least as acute as in recent years.  The measures proposed have been decided upon without any meaningful consultation.  The consultants were perfectly entitled to object on such a fundamental issue which affects their conditions of employment. A group on remuneration sat down to deal with this problem.  They have made their objections known to all of us.  They are, after all, essential public servants and we have no way of knowing whether they will ballot in favour of this.  Let us hope they do.  If they do not, that is the potential for chaos.  We are legislating for something which we are not certain can be carried out.</P>
    <P>What difference will it make to people who are already entitled to services and <Col N="156" /> cannot get them?  Doctors who believe in treating all their patients to the highest possible standards, fully backed by their junior doctors in training, have effectively been told that they are no longer to be encouraged to see patients who pay in a public facility.  This will drive many consultants who now see private patients in public hospitals to do more and more work in private hospitals.</P>

      <P>If that does not happen, the only possibility is that more private beds will be allocated to consultants within public hospitals.  On 27 February this year we discussed this matter in the House and I suggested that the Minister intended to open up beds in public hospitals to private patients.  This would mean that health boards would be forced to redesignate public beds as private beds.  The Minister replied that this was not necessarily so.  I went on to say that this would be one of the actions taken to ensure a continuing income from VHI. Today the Minister said that when the Bill is enacted he will immediately make regulations to provide for the redesignation of public beds as public and private. The Minister is contradicting himself.  He will do it within a matter of months.</P>

      <P>I could name the programme in question.  The Minister said he intends to designate private beds in public hospitals.  This is already happening. Officers of health boards are going around to see which beds they can cordon off in order to call them private beds.  Of course that will interfere with the rights of people who are currently entitled to a public bed.  I believe there will be trouble, but I hope I am wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The net result will be the separation of medicine into private and public and this will be enshrined in law as a permanent feature of our health service. This is the classic two-tier system. If the top echelon of income earners take up the entitlement extended to them, for which they are paying an extra health levy, without any extra resources being put into the system, the only possible result will be longer queues.  If, on the other hand, the top income earners maintain their VHI cover in addition to paying the extra health levy which will amount to £19 million or £20 million per year, it simply means that they want the capacity to jump the queue.  If this happens the Government will be formally sanctioning and subsidising the practice of queue-jumping. That would be the net effect of section 5 of this Bill.  It would undermine the morale of the providers of a service and reduce the quality of that service. The position with medicine is no different. The net effect of these measures is that the Government are further underwriting private health care in private hospitals and discriminating in favour of the owners of these buildings and the professionals who work in them.  Quite clearly this plan will fail, but if it does not I will be pleased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have tried to be as constructive as possible in studying this plan which was <Col N="158" /> supported by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  We have tried to find out what it would mean in reality, and quite clearly we are concerned that it will fail.  When that happens, the Minister will come back to the House, some time in the near future, and make a scapegoat of somebody, probably the consultants.  As a person who carries no brief for any interest group, I believe that the consultants are not the problem in this legislation; the problem is the Minister.  He is living in a world where nobody suffers, nobody has to wait for treatment, nobody seems to get sick and charity is a substitute for rights.  In other words, the Minister is living in a world the rest of us have left behind.  He has ceased to represent the people who elected him.  I have heard the Minister speak at demonstration marches, but I am not sure how long ago it is since he knocked on doors and learned of some of the difficulties people have to face.</P>
    <P>The principle of separating private beds and private hospitals from public beds and public hospitals is a good one, but here we are proposing to redesignate private beds in public hospitals, thereby depriving public patients of their right to those beds.  This redesignation is being carried out to suit the Minister, the consultants and the VHI, at the expense of the poor who have medical cards, who have a right to hospital beds, who are on waiting lists and cannot jump the queue because they cannot afford to do so. Some people have waited years for acute hospital services but the beds are not available.  We are proposing by this measure to remove the beds which up to now have been available to those on an income below £16,700.  We are now removing that income limit and with it we are removing the beds.  This is a gimmick. I am disappointed in the Minister for introducing this type of legislation because it does not address the real problem. We are not providing a health service to the people who need it and are entitled to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of this Bill is a good one but the reality is that unless <Col N="159" /> the decision to extend eligibility is accompanied by the provision of extra finance, resources and personnel, the Bill's aims will not only be rendered meaningless but will also contribute to chaos and to waiting lists for our health services.  For a long time I have recognised the anomalies that existed in that part of the service which provided for category 3 patients.  At present the people in that category are eligible for all hospital services except consultant services which they must provide for themselves. In practice the vast majority of these people insure themselves against this liability with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  However, in recent times, VHI cover, especially for certain consultant fees, has not been sufficient and in many instances there has been a very substantial shortfall.  There is insufficient cover for children of people in category 3 if the income of the parent exceeds the threshold and, unlike the position for people in category 1, no account is taken of differing circumstances, such as family size or the exceptional costs involved.</P>
      <P>In 1989 the Minister and the Department decided to make additional funds available when the Taoiseach discovered there was a great shortfall in the health services.  In the Southern Health Board area an extra £1,090,000 was made available. A letter issued at that time stating very clearly that there would have to be an assessment of the spending of this money as between public and private health services.  Many times since I have asked what is the ratio of spending in that regard but I have never received an answer for the simple reason that no co-operation has been forthcoming from the consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the statement that it will be an essential element of the new arrangements that the status of the patient must be specified on admission to hospital and that a patient identified as a private patient will be liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care.  The fact that private patients have been treated in public hospitals, especially in <Col N="160" /> orthopaedic hospitals, has been a matter of contention over the years.</P>
    <P>We have to consider the background against which this Bill is being introduced. Events over the winter have shown that the crisis in the health services, especially in hospitals, is as acute as ever.  Last year the flu epidemic was blamed for the chaos in our hospitals. This year there is no epidemic but the health boards and patients face a crisis every bit as serious as that of a year ago, and it is clear that the cutbacks will continue throughout the summer.</P>
    <P>A letter to the Southern Health Board outlined some of the measures that are required to contain expenditure, such as a reduction in the level of activity in acute hospitals to end-1989 level; longer holiday and seasonal closure of beds; an increase in the range of surgical and medical procedures to be performed on a daily basis and substitution of more day beds for seven day beds.  Health boards simply cannot maintain the services on the funds provided by the Government.  The inevitable outcome has been longer waiting lists, more beds in corridors, the early discharge of patients, a longer closure of beds and wards during the holiday period, a worsening of the plight of the physically and mentally handicapped and less money for child care services and facilities for the elderly.  The Minister is totally ignoring the problems experienced every day in the health services by doctors, nurses and administrators who have to cope with the chaos resulting from the Minister's disastrous policies, and especially from his refusal to acknowledge the need for increased funding.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the reality of the situation. As I said, at the end of January the members of the health board in my area were informed that following a meeting with the Department it was proposed to reduce the level of activity to that operating at the end of 1989.  This is in clear conflict with the commitment given by the Minister in the Dáil before Christmas that all health board services would be maintained at their 1990 level. Other proposals included, as I have said, <Col N="161" /> a longer holiday closure period, the elimination of what were described as unnecessary tests, the temporary deferment of filling some vacancies and there would be no additional money for the physically handicapped or for child services.</P>
    <P>The same problems are being experienced all over the country.  <i>The Irish Times</i> of 19 February carried a report signed by the chairman of the Mater Hospital's medical council which gave a graphic account of the problems facing that hospital.  One section of the report stated:</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, the number of patients awaiting admission and remaining overnight in the accident and emergency department has increased.  This in turn has given rise to inadequate supervision of patients who are left unattended on trollies in various cubicles whilst the nurses and medical staff attend to other patients.</P>
    <P>Arising from this, staff numbers in the department are unable to monitor patients appropriately.  It is not unusual to find two patients per cubicle, either being assessed for admission or awaiting admission.  This practice is humiliating for the patient, the patient's relatives and is an extreme embarrassment for all the staff concerned. </P>
    <P>How far removed all this is from the comfort and convenience available to those who can afford places like the Blackrock Clinic.  No person in need of medical care and attention should be asked to endure those conditions, and we have no right to call ourselves a civilised society, while we continue to systematically inflict those conditions on the bill.  What a great contrast there is between the reality of those conditions and the myth of the &ldquo;comprehensive, equitable and efficient health care system&rdquo; promised in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>The indisputable fact is that the health services have never recovered from the severe cutbacks imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987-88 &mdash; with the active support of Fine Gael &mdash; and will <Col N="162" /> require significant additional funding to be even restored to the levels operating in mid-1980.  We must certainly look for the most efficient and effective use of taxpayers' money spent on health, but we have to accept that a decent health service cannot be provided on the cheap. When we see a Government who can allocate more than £17 million to provide a presidential palace for the Taoiseach but can come up with only an extra £1 million for services for the mentally handicapped then serious questions must be asked about our values and our priorities as a society.</P>
    <P>Recently I read the auditor's report for the year ending 31 December 1988 for the Southern Health Board and I should like to remind the House of a comment made by the auditor.  He said that because of the serious shortage of funds the board had to meet £280,162 in interest and bank charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The banks win again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that on present-day figures that would equate to £400,000 being spent on interest and bank charges.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party have never suggested that additional spending on its own would create better health services.  Combined with a restructuring of the health services, additional funding can give the Irish people the quality and range of the services they need.  The fact is that the proportion of gross national product we have been spending on public health has been declining steadily, and unless there is a commitment to bring the level of spending back up in a planned and phased way the problems will continue.</P>
      <P>Public health spending in 1983 accounted for 7.61 per cent of GNP and was gradually brought down to 7.1 per cent by 1986.  It declined to 6.6 per cent in 1987 and to 6.24 per cent in 1988.  By 1989 it was down to less than 6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average spending on health in OECD countries is about 8 per cent of GNP.  We believe that spending on health here must be brought up in a steady but phased way to that level.  Even with that <Col N="163" /> increase, there must, of course, be the need to control expenditure and plan the most efficient use of our resources, not least because demands for health services will change and grow as the age structure of our population changes, with the proportion of elderly people increasing.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have also preached the virtues of community care as an alternative to institutional treatment, but they have failed to provide the resources to allow this become a reality. Running down institutional care without providing the additional resources to develop community care is a recipe for chaos and for suffering and distress for patients.</P>
    <P>This was to be of particular value in the reorganisation of the psychiatric services and the care of people with mental handicaps. Yet five years after the publication of <i>Planning for the Future</i> the alternative community care services are nowhere near as developed as they should be.  And this is almost entirely a question of resources, especially capital resources, to open up new community-based facilities.</P>
    <P>The same principles apply in relation to general hospital services.  If we want to ease the strain on hospital services, community care facilities must be developed.  It is no good wishing for them: resources must be allocated to provide them.  We need a substantial increase in the number of district health nurses, home helps, health visitors, domiciliary physiotherapists and occupational therapists.</P>
    <P>The health services have been an issue that Fianna Fáil have shamlessly exploited when in Opposition and tried to ignore when in Government.  Back in 1984, when the health cuts introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour Government were still at a relatively minor level, the Fianna Fáil leader, Deputy Haughey, gave an interview to the <i>Irish Press</i> in which he said: &ldquo;the health services have been reduced to dangerously inadequate levels, and I think that, if it has not happened already, people will die because of the unavailability of particular services in certain areas&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach says little <Col N="164" /> enough about the health services these days, but perhaps at some stage he might come into the House and let us know how many people he believes have died as a result of the health cuts introduced by his Government.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil should remember that public concern at the health cuts may well have denied them an overall majority in the 1989 general election.  Health cuts, and the quality of our health services, are still very major political issues.  Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats candidates in the local elections will face the wrath of the electorate unless urgent remedial action is taken and the health boards are provided with the funds required to put the health services on a satisfactory footing.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now in more detail to the provisions of the Bill.  As I said, we welcome the decision to extend eligibility for hospital services to the entire population. That is something we have sought for many years.  However, against the background of the chaos in the health services, what is going to happen if eligibility is extended to an additional 15 per cent of the population without the provision of additional resources?  We must provide additional doctors, nurses, ancillary staff, beds, medical equipment, catering facilities and so on or else we will have longer waiting lists.</P>
    <P>There is no reference in the PESP, the budget or in the Estimates to a plan to provide money to pay for the extra numbers who will now be eligible.  Perhaps the Minister has made a calculated decision not to provide additional resources in the expectation that if waiting lists are not reduced those who qualify for eligibility will continue to be private patients.  If this is the case an outrageous confidence trick is being played on the public &mdash; on those who will now pay extra contributions and on those who cannot afford the private service.  The only people in the health sector who will get anything extra from this will once again be the consultants.  Nurses, junior doctors and hospital administrators will be expected to administer the new eligible <Col N="165" /> 15 per cent without a penny compensation. Such a commitment was not expected from consultants.  Consultants have been awarded generous new contracts which include once-off payment of between £13,000 and £17,000 as well as salary increases of between 30 per cent and 50 per cent.  This apparently was the consultants' price for agreeing to allow extended eligibility to go ahead from 1 June.  As usual the consultants flexed their muscles and have been allowed to get away with it.</P>
    <P>We welcome the fact that private patients will no longer be able to use public beds.  The Minister for Health has claimed that this will mean an end to queue jumping.  It remains to be seen whether or not it will.  However, it is worth asking why the Minister has decided not to introduce the common waiting lists for public and private patients as recommended by the Commission on Health Funding.  We believe very strongly that a common waiting list should be introduced, and that consultants with public appointments should be obliged to see and treat all patients, whether public or private, in the same manner, that is, in the same room or outpatients' department under the same conditions and from the same waiting lists.  It should be a breach of contract to do otherwise.  GPs in the General Medical Service are obliged to do this.</P>
    <P>I note that under section 5 patients will, effectively have to opt for either public or private status.  This needs clarification. Will a patient have to opt for public or private status for a particular period of time?  Will it be for a specific illness?  Will it be possible to transfer from one status to another while in hospital? These matters need clarification.</P>
    <P>The Bill also restricts the right to hospital services to what are described &ldquo;as those ordinarily resident in the State&rdquo;.  What does this mean?  Does it mean that a person who has emigrated for a number of years and then returned home will not qualify for services for a certain number of years?  How long will a person have to reside here to be considered ordinarily resident in the State?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> The enactment of this Bill also has serious implications for the future role of the VHI.  If everyone is entitled to free hospital services, what is the point in having a State-owned company which helps provide private services?  Certainly there is now no justification for providing tax relief on contributions to the VHI, when everyone is entitled to public cover.</P>
    <P>Despite our serious reservations about the willingness of the Government to provide the resources necessary to implement their provisions, the extension of the principle of eligibility for hospital cover is something that we have sought for a long time, and we will therefore not vote against the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government recently provided £1.5 billion for health. We have more money in the health system than we have ever had yet there are many problems in the system.  It seems to be unable to deal with the pressures. There is particular pressure on acute beds.  Too many people are still waiting for beds and we are all aware of overcrowding in the hospitals.  It is the purpose of the Bill to deal with the problems.</P>
      <P>We are all well aware of the two-tier medical system.  Perhaps it is unofficial but it is certainly there.  There has been a positive relationship between ability to pay and the time spent on waiting list, so I welcome this Bill in its approach to public patients being given access to consultants free of charge.  This is worthy of the support of all Members.</P>
      <P>Every Member of the House would agree with the point made by the Opposition with regard to medically established priority.  The Minister was accused of trying to underpin the two-tier system rather than underlining that it will be medical assessment that will establish priority.  The Minister in this Bill is trying to ensure that public patients have free access to consultants in order to establish the principle that medical assessment establishes the priority.  That should be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried about one aspect of the Bill.  It has been argued that the fact that <Col N="167" /> there will be more public beds available will mean smaller queues for those who wish to make use of public beds.  This may be true in the larger hospitals but I find it hard to see how it will affect local hospitals and smaller general hospitals, such as Ennis General Hospital.  Out of 78 beds in Ennis General Hospital, excluding day beds, 63 are public.  The highest demand in that hospital is for public beds and the vast majority of those who wish to use that hospital are public patients.  Will the Minister tell us how he would see the positive effects of this Bill as regards hospitals such as Ennis General Hospital?  It is important to point out that a large number of the patients in Ennis General Hospital are geriatric. There are rumours that 50 geriatric beds in St. Joseph's Hospital, Ennis are to be given over to psychiatric patients.  The percentage of geriatric patients in Clare is far higher than in many other areas, the effect of reducing the number of beds for geriatrics in St. Joseph's will have a knock-on effect on Ennis General Hospital and will slow down the turnover of beds available for acute patients.</P>
    <P>The intention of the Bill is to expand the system, which poses a number of questions.  With the options now available to patients, will we be able to cope? Will it mean more demands on public beds?  It has been said that the number of public beds will not be decreased; if so, how will the private patient fare under this system?  Will the Minister clarify whether there will be a common waiting list?  Will the Minister also clarify section 6?  I should like to know the implications for medical card holders and public patients.</P>
    <P>I am also very pleased that there will be a monitoring system because the point of the Bill is to prevent queue-jumping and eliminate the two-tier system in our medical services which has been the case over a number of years now.  I understand that the Minister wants to break with that system, which is what the Bill is intended to do.  The monitoring system is very important because it will give an opportunity to the Minister to see whether it <Col N="168" /> works.  I should like to see &mdash; as I believe every Member in the House would like to see &mdash; universal access to health care. I hope the Bill will clarify this and put us on the right road to access to health care for everyone; anything less would be reprehensible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxpayers are being taken for another ride by the Minister because, essentially, this is a mini-budget. The removal of the ceiling on health contributions means that the person earning £21,000 per annum will pay £60 more in health contributions; the person on £25,000 will pay £120 more and the person on £30,000 will pay £160 more per annum.  What will these people get for their increased contributions?  They will get a health service which is at present a shambles; they will have to wait their turn and there is a two year waiting list for many of the specialist treatments.</P>
      <P>The individual paying substantially more for health care will remain in the VHI, it will be the passport to private medicine on which he will remain very dependent.  I am not here to defend the man earning £25,000 but I am pointing out that he will be paying much more and getting nothing for it.  The person with a medical or hospital services card will be in a worse position.  The Minister has not answered a simple algebra question: if he has X amount of beds in the public service and he takes Y of it he is left with a decreased amount of X minus Y.  The Minister tried to tell us today that the person on a medical or hospital services card will get a better service and that the same applied to the person paying more. The Minister is trying to cod us, he is shaking his head but he should be ashamed of himself.  I know it is election time but he should not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Although it is election time the Minister should not be practising such cold callous tricks on the taxpayers.  Of course, in his speech, the Minister did not quantify the percentage of beds which will now be earmarked private in public hospitals and, therefore, we cannot judge the real effect on the health services.  We are still unaware of the level of private practice which existed in the health services up to now because the Minister did not have the political will to quantify it.  A Southern Health Board report of recent vintage showed that, in certain specialist treatments, up to 40 per cent of private practice was in public wards, utilising public resources, staff and equipment. In other specialist areas it was zero; there are many honourable and hard working consultants in our public hospitals but a few need to be weeded out and the Minister has not done it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not do it, the Minister is conning the people; the Minister confronted the consultants and blinked, an expensive blink for the taxpayers in the years ahead.  It is worse than the deal the Taoiseach made in 1979 when he gave them a free hand.  The Minister is doing the same and giving them a bonus to go with it.  The result of the Minister's eyeball to eyeball confrontation with the consultants will cost the taxpayers about £35 million straight away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently debt collectors were knocking at the doors of medical card holders and hospital service card holders but now the tax collector will be pounding on the doors of taxpayers to ensure that they pay the extra money.  There is no extra money for what the Minister termed &ldquo;extended cover&rdquo; and I cannot see how he will give an improved service.  The people who will now pay £100 more annually will see a service in which there are waiting lists for almost every operation, two years for a tonsillectomy or a simple operation for adenoids.  Of course, if one has the resources the operation will be done by the same consultant in two or three weeks.  The Minister failed to deal <Col N="170" /> with that issue.  The same problem exists in relation to hip replacements, a fact which was brought home to me recently. I saw a person in agony because of the lack of membership of the VHI.  The Minister has not addressed that problem either and he need not tell us that the proposals in the Bill will rectify it.  The coldest con job of all is to give hope to people who think there will be an improvement.  The Minister is merely joining the Minister for Finance in taking more money from the people.</P>
    <P>What about cancer patients in hospitals?  The Minister has been warned time and again that equipment in the Cork Regional Hospital is obsolete. Patients in the throes of cancer are being taken by bus to Dublin for treatment because the Minister failed to deal with the problem of capital resources for our hospitals.  He has allowed hospital equipment to run down to a dangerously low level and now he is trying to tell us that everyone will have free hospital treatment and that everybody will be able to avail of free consultant care, but I would remind him that when the holder of a medical card or a hospital services card visits an out-patient clinic in a regional hospital, say, the Cork Regional Hospital, he will see a registrar or a junior doctor &mdash; only rarely will he see the same doctor twice &mdash; and not the consultant. Is the Minister seriously trying to suggest that by extending this entitlement to an extra 200,000 people that they will suddenly get to see the consultant and that he will have time to see all of them?  It is a shame that the Minister has tried to use this con trick.</P>
    <P>We face the prospect that the number of beds available in Cork city will be reduced.  For instance, the Mercy Hospital which was supposed to fill the gap created following the closure of the North Infirmary may have to close 40 beds during the summer months because an inadequate allocation has been provided. For a long number of years the staff of that hospital have tried admirably to resolve the crisis being faced on the north side of Cork city but now they find themselves under even greater pressure <Col N="171" /> as adequate resources have not been made available which would allow them to deal with the problem.  The hospital is bursting at the seams but the Minister is unwilling to provide it with the resources it needs. I hope the Minister will give it the necessary resources&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's backbenchers made him aware of this problem at a parliamentary meeting and also made sure that the press became aware of it.  I hope the Minister will take action.  Last week in reply to questions put by me the Minister pointed out that 10 per cent of the staff in Southern Health Board hospitals are temporary nurses and doctors, who do not know from one month to the next if they will be retained, and trainee nurses.  In addition, haemophialiacs are being treated in a disgraceful, uncharitable and pathetic way but the Minister has washed his hands of the matter and has said he is not in a position to reply to questions because the matter is <i>sub judice.</i>  These people are suffering and are dying but the Minister has been callous and ignored their rights.</P>
      <P>Given the pressures on the health service, I would have thought the Minister would have won his battle at the Cabinet table to have extra resources made available, but I have constantly made the point that this is not the complete answer.  The Minister should have tried to introduce reforms in the health services during the past few years.  A number of groups suggested ways in which this could be done but the Minister had not the political will to act.  In his contribution earlier today he promised to make changes in the management structures and I await hearing what these will be.  I hope he will not play around with the system but rather will introduce changes which will enable us to tackle the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the run-up to the local elections, Government Deputies are going around the country announcing, for cheap political gain that sums of £500, £750 or <Col N="172" /> £1,000 will be allocated for particular ventures, at a time when no attempt is being made to address the real issues. The philosophy seems to keep the people happy: give them a few bob and they will stay quiet or even vote for them, but that is not the answer to our major problems.</P>
    <P>During the past few years our people have suffered heartbreak and tragedy.  I have already referred to the suffering being endured by those awaiting hip replacement operations and by those who have to travel to Dublin for cancer treatment. In addition, many parents are heartbroken because they do not have the money to send their children to hospital to have a serious defect rectified, and lives have been lost because of the cutbacks of recent years.  The Minister should not pretend otherwise.  Indeed, the position is getting worse.  Millions of words have been spoken about the issue and horror story after horror story has been told.  The position is frightening but what is even more frightening is the Minister's insensitivity to those who are suffering and his pretence that today everybody will get something for nothing, when it is clear they will not.</P>
    <P>The Minister is remote from the problem and is insulated by statistics, strategies and the many reports on his desk. Things are bad but they could be far better if the Minister tried to remedy the problems.  As I said, there has been a callous and calculating attempt to con the people of the country by claiming to extend eligibility for free consultant care to 200,000 people when the system is already overloaded.  He has promised that there will be more reports but what we need is a plan and more resources.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would remind the Minister that he is dealing with people's lives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The only thing that will be of help to them is the will to bring about change.

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to express the hope that this Bill marks the beginning of a process which will eventually remove the worst aspects of a two-tier health service.  We are only too aware of the simple fact that patients who are listed for what are described as elective hospital procedures can be accommodated at much greater speed if they can present themselves as private patients.  This is the case also in Britain, a country which boasts of having the finest health service in the world.  In virtually every country there are waiting lists and <Col N="174" /> we all have the same problems.  Even as matters stand, and in spite of our deficiencies our general population are very much better served than those in the United States, where the very thought of hospitalisation causes nightmares, and hospitalisation may even lead to bankruptcy.</P>
      <P>In an ideal situation everybody would be a member of the VHI.  This prompts an idea which may or may not be practical in the long run.  The VHI Board have been advertising for several years in an effort to enrol as many people as possible, and they have succeeded to a considerable degree.  A question that occurs to me is, what would happen if the VHI found themselves with a membership composed of the entire population?  I have a picture in my mind of a scenario where those who could afford it would pay their VHI premium and those who could not afford it would have their premium paid by the State with perhaps a partial payment for those people caught in between.  This would, of course, highlight the necessity for sufficient hospital accommodation and medical and other personnel to service that demand.  The market would indicate the need and the VHI could use their undoubted skills in controlling the day-to-day expenditure involved.</P>
      <P>In recent years we have seen the development of a third tier, in my opinion a sort of super-tier, led by the Blackrock Clinic and others.  Indeed, it has been suggested that the introduction of an insurance category to cater for this tier was largely responsible for the financial difficulties within the VHI which they had never experienced before, and the lower groups were called upon to subsidise those in the higher groups as a result.  I suggest that these higher groups designed to give cover for the super clinics should be financed out of a single fund and the premium should be adjusted accordingly, if necessary.  The people who opt for this type of treatment are not the people about whom the Minister or the rest of us are too concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, on this side of the House, have been accused of ignoring or not being <Col N="175" /> aware of the problems in the health service. Nothing could be further from the truth.  The record of Fianna Fáil in this area is there for all to see.  The present Bill is about eligibility for treatment in hospitals and one must immediately recall that many of the fine modern hospitals we are talking about would not be there were it not for the building programme initiated by our present Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, when he was Minister for Health.  Since he came into office in 1987 the present Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, has engaged in the most comprehensive examination of the entire service ever undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all he has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>He has outlined in his speech many of the improvements brought in as a result of extensive consultation with medical and administrative personnel as well as the social partners. This Bill has resulted from similar consultation. The Minister is a patient man, as he should be when dealing with such farreaching and complex proposals.  Prior to 1987 many of those on the opposite benches were silent on those matters when they were in a position to do something about them.  Of course, even if they had had the ideas it would have been impossible to activate them for the simple reason that they had brought the country to bankruptcy.  I have very little patience with the criticisms of Deputy Bruton or anyone else from the parties which formed either of those two Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two points arising from the Minister's speech which I would like to have clarified.  First, let me refer to the present system where private patients who opt or find themselves in public beds are not charged for such beds, apart from the restricted daily fee of £12.50.  Should such a situation arise after the enactment of this Bill what would the position be? From my reading of the Minister's speech, it would appear that such a patient would be charged for accommodation. I am aware there will be a phasing in period of three years to take <Col N="176" /> account of needs and deciding what proportion of the beds can be designated as public or private.  If a private patient, through no fault of his own, finds himself in a public bed will he be charged, or, to be more precise, will the VHI be charged?  At present the VHI premiums are adjusted to take account of the fact that there is no charge for public beds regardless of the circumstances, but what I am concerned about is whether the VHI will seek an immediate increase in premiums to take account of the extra costs that would be involved.  I know the Minister has consulted with the VHI Board on matters concerning the Bill and I would be interested to know whether this aspect had been discussed with them.  I am aware that the board do not anticipate a head-long rush of people out of the VHI and into public beds as Deputy Bruton seems to expect.  I do not believe for a moment that it will worsen existing services, as he suggested also.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, some Opposition Members treated the Minister's efforts with their usual contempt but before they go too far they should remember that this Bill is not the work of the Minister alone but derives from the combined submissions of the health authorities, medical personnel, the ERSI, the VHI, the trade unions and all those who took part in the negotiations leading to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> If they seek to ridicule the Minister they do likewise to the representatives of a broad spectrum of society.</P>

      <P>First, I thank the Deputies for their contributions. Despite the fact that we have explained the rationale behind the change in eligibility over a number of months, it appears, from listening to the <Col N="177" /> Deputies opposite, that they do not seem to have grasped the simple facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at present is that there are three groups of people: people in public hospitals, private patients who pay for private beds and public patients who are treated as public patients or patients in a public bed who pay their consultant's fees.  This last group will no longer exist because patients in public beds who pay their consultants can in future opt for a full public service or for a private service.  Indeed, it was Deputy Allen himself who said &mdash; I am quoting him because I do not have the evidence &mdash; that in some hospitals 40 per cent of the patients in public beds were private patients.  That is the very situation this Bill will eliminate, and I am sure Deputy Allen would agree with me on that.  This Bill will eliminate that problem because no longer will it be possible for a patient to get a public bed and pay a consultant.</P>

Surely, Deputy Bruton can see that you cannot have it both ways, you cannot have a common waiting list and keep private patients out of public beds. A common waiting list means that the next patient goes into the next available bed.  The Deputy would keep them out of it if it was another public bed, but still he would tell the people that there was a common waiting list.</P>

Let me remind the Deputy that the entire <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was agreed and endorsed by the ICTU and the other social partners.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to paragraph 48, on page 28 of the programme, which refers explicitly to the new arrangements for accommodating private non-emergency patients in private or semi-private beds only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen referred to politicians going around the country currying favour.  I listened last week while Fine Gael's spokesman in the Seanad said there were two ways we could run the <Col N="180" /> health services.  One was to balance the books at the end of the year and make sure to only spend the money one gets. The other was to provide a good education service with no reference to money, and good health services.  That was his choice.  Does that represent Fine Gael policy?  It appears from what Deputies Allen and Bruton said this evening that it does.  One has to mix the two.  One has to provide good health services and a good education service and do so within the limits of the money available.</P>

I admire Deputy Ferris for giving us facts and figures and identifying the increase in the level of services and the number of people in the South Eastern Health Board region. Deputy Allen should know that something similar is happening in his own area. The waiting list for cataracts was reduced by 12 per cent last year.  There has been <Col N="181" /> a 14 per cent increase in the number of hip operations performed and an increase of 40 per cent in Cappagh Hospital for hip operations.</P>

      <P>I want to assure Deputy de Valera that we are in discussion with the Mid-Western Health Board about hospitals such as Ennis.  The number of public beds will be maintained at their present level and the number of private beds in the smaller hospitals, as in the larger ones, will reflect the existing demand for private beds.  I would add, because the Deputy raised the point about geriatrics, that a new post of geriatrician was advertised recently for Ennis Hospital.  This will make a big difference to bed needs and the use of beds because it is important when talking about beds to look at the use they are put to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have increased considerably the <Col N="182" /> amount of day surgery which has brought us into line with other developed countries. We were very far behind in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is how the beds are used that is important, not the number of beds.  Indeed, it is no harm to point out again in regard to allocations to health boards that we have provided £1,543 million, the largest amount ever provided by an Irish Government for the health services in this State, in the current year. It is important to recognise that there has been an increase of 21 per cent in our allocation to the health boards since 1988. Deputy Allen did not tell us that.  Allocations to voluntary hospitals have increased by 36.9 per cent since 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Their debts have increased too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>That reflects the increasing demand for high technology in our hospitals.  It is the hospital element of the services that results in the demand for more and more money.  Reference was made to those suffering from mental handicap.  There was a 40 per cent increase in the amount of money allocated to voluntary organisations who are the main providers of service for those with mental handicap here.</P>
      <P>I want to refute entirely the suggestion that the extension of eligibility is a cover for seeking extra resources.  That is an outrageous suggestion.  This change in eligibility arises directly from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which was agreed between the Government and the social partners at the start of the year.  It was recommended initially by the Commission on Health Funding and was supported by the National Economic and Social Council.</P>

      <P>The health contribution <Col N="183" /> has often been criticised as being a regressive tax.  It bears proportionately more heavily on people earning lower incomes.  Because of the income ceiling a person earning, say, £30,000 has been paying the health contribution at an effective rate of 0.7 per cent, dropping to only 0.4 per cent for someone earning £50,000.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Deputy Ferris asked what amount would be brought in by the change.  In a full year it will be £19 million.  Reference was made to hospitals closing.  I do not know whether Deputy Ferris would suggest that Beaumont Hospital should remain closed as it did for four years.</P>

      <P>We closed Jervis Street and the Richmond hospitals.  Every time Deputy Ferris speaks on a health motion here he refers to the fact that we closed those two hospitals.  It appears that he objects to that.  If anybody wants an <Col N="184" /> example of trying to drive a wedge into our health services and separate public and private health care, Beaumont was a classical example.  The Minister for Health at the time, former Deputy Barry Desmond, refused to allow the consultants to have a private facility on the campus of Beaumont Hospital.  Now Deputy Ferris complains that we will drive the consultants out to private hospitals which is what the then Minister wanted.  What we are doing is providing the facility and we will keep the consultants on campus because that is in the best interests of the public patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <P>What we will ensure is that if one wants to be a public patient in a public hospital that facility will be there. If one wants to be a private patient one can be a private patient in a private bed. Again, I come back to the point Deputy Allen made.  He knows that in some instances 40 per cent of the beds were used by patients who took their maintenance as a public patient and paid the consultant.  That will be eliminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have been strongly committed to this Bill for a considerable period of time.  My determination to introduce this Bill at the first available opportunity was fashioned between 1979 and 1985.  Having become a county councillor for the first time in 1979, I also became a member of a vocational education committee.  On scanning the assembled membership of Mayo County VEC, I immediately noticed the absence of teacher representation. The committee was composed of 14 members &mdash; eight county councillors and six others.  They included farmers, a journalist, ESB workers, car salesmen, national teachers and a priest, in addition to two nominees from each of the three urban district councils in the country.  These were all worthy people but there was not a vocational teacher in sight.  This is not strictly true as they were present as observers, sitting demurely at the back of the meeting to observe; they could not participate or contribute but could simply observe and report back to the next meeting of their union.  They had no involvement in the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They could only participate on rare occasions when matters of particular interest were under discussion.  In such circumstances, one of the union observers could raise his hand, in an &ldquo;an bhfuil cead agam&rdquo;?  approach, and beg the permission of the Chair and the meeting to make an observation on the subject under discussion.  On occasion the meeting did permit the observation but not very often before reminding the observers, as if they needed reminding, <Col N="188" /> that they could only make an observation, and not a recommendation.  A recommendation would have been seen as interference with the work of the committee. Having been afforded the concession to make the oral observation the observers then lapsed back to observe and behold while the decision-makers got on with the job of running vocational education in the country.</P>
    <P>There were times when observers' requests for the concession to comment on the issue under discussion were not acceded to and observers continued to gaze in amazement as important decisions involving the vocational education system in the county were taken. These decisions often affected the members themselves or their union colleagues and on occasion were taken literally over their heads.  Sometimes such decisions did not always represent the best interests of vocational education but still the observers could only sit and observe.  It was a bit like being a dumb spectator at your own wake.</P>
    <P>Things have not changed that much.  I accept that every vocational education committee is an independent, statutory autonomous authority in its own right and it can decide to extend the observer status of the union representation.  Some VECs allow observer status only with no right of comment while others allow observer status with full right of comment, but comment only.  There are some vocational education areas where the welcome practice has developed that the Teachers' Union of Ireland is written to and asked to nominate representatives on the vocational committee.  These vocational education committees are to be commended because they are recognising the fundamental necessity of worker participation and the importance and desirability of input by the very people at the coalface.  They are, therefore, displaying a willingness to be advised on matters educational by the practitioners themselves, the people who have daily hands-on contact, the people qualified to advise, namely, the teachers themselves.</P>
    <P>There are VECs in which there are <Col N="189" /> vocational teachers, members of the union, and, indeed, in some cases officers of the union nominated, unfortunately, by the political party who control the VEC and, of course, by implication compromised and obligated to the wishes of his or her political nominators.</P>
    <P>The more I read the 1930 Vocational Education Act &mdash; section 8 of which I now seek to amend &mdash; the more I realise that the scope of the Act was broad and far-seeing enough to almost wish and invite a specific amendment, the nature of which Fine Gael have produced in this Bill.  Section 8 (3) states:</P>
    <P>The VEC for a county vocational education area shall consist of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Fourteen members elected by the county council.  ...of whom not less than five nor more than eight shall be persons who are members of such council;  </P>
    <P>The most interesting part of the Act is the advice given in section 8 (4) which deals with the additional minimum of six co-opted places.  Section 8 (4) states:</P>
    <P>A local authority electing under this section persons to be members of a vocational education committee shall have regard to the interest and experience in education of the person proposed to be so elected and to any recommendations made by bodies (including associations or bodies of employers or of employees) interested in manufacture or trades in the area of such committee and shall, where it appears desirable and circumstances permit, so make such election as to provide for the representation of such bodies on such committee. </P>
    <P>I cannot think of any group or body more qualified to meet the spirit of the recommendation of having &ldquo;interest and experience in education&rdquo; than the teachers themselves, and yet they have absolutely no right whatever &mdash; and this is the important distinction &mdash; to sit on VECs. The spirit of section 8 (4) of the 1930 Act is quite clear: the authors of the Act were endeavouring to accommodate as broad <Col N="190" /> a range of experience as possible in order to have as representative an element of input as possible.  It is clear that the thinking behind the Act was light years ahead of its time in that it was quite obviously allowing for the evolution of the type of worker participation which has become very much the norm today.  Here we are in 1991, 61 years later, on the brink of entering the 21st century and there is still no statutory right of teacher participation on VECs.</P>
    <P>One has to examine how the six co-opted vocational education places have been assigned.  Over the years they have largely become the preserve of the political parties who make up the county council.  Indeed, sometimes they are the sole preserve of the dominant party on the council, particularly where a winner-take-all philosophy is the order of the day.  Apart from the occasions when a teacher is co-opted and indeed in the case of County Dublin VEC, where a third level student representative is given membership, most of the six places go to either defeated county council candidates or strong party affiliates.  I am afraid that if the truth is told, the recommendation of the 1930 Act, that such co-opted members should have &ldquo;interest and experience in education&rdquo; has not been given much of a priority when the county councils of the country sat down to make their choices.  I know that there is the odd exception.  The occasional county council do genuinely seek to pick non-aligned people of calibre whose expertise and perspectives can improve the quality of decision-making.  I suppose it is quite understandable, politics being politics, that if a party candidate loses in a county council election by a handful of votes or if he or she has been instrumental in electing a colleague, that candidate feels that the tradition of rewarding such service by a co-opted place on one of the county council committees should be retained.  However, education has been the biggest loser in this, in that the associations or bodies of employers or employees &mdash; the people with expertise &mdash; the people intended within the spirit of this Bill, have not had the opportunity <Col N="191" /> to give of their experience and expertise to the VECs over the years.  I want to make it crystal clear that I am not being political in this.  I am not casting a slur on any particular political party.  I am not suggesting that it is a Fianna Fáil phenomenon. Councils dominated by my own party have very often adopted the same attitude.</P>
    <P>I want to refer here to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  One of the major players in the talks leading to the signing of the new programme was, once again, one of the main social partners, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  One of the major successes of the trade union movement has been the breakthrough in worker participation &mdash; the recognition of the right of employees to participate at the highest level in management decisions affecting State companies. There are worker directors in Irish Rail, Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus, the Gas Company, the Sugar Company.  All of these have in their own way added a vital perspective to management affairs. This is democracy at work &mdash; industrial democracy.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> states that 35 State enterprises have introduced participation arrangements for their workers in accordance with the spirit and terms of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is quite clear in its commitment to &ldquo;determining how progress can be made in relation to employee participation in the public service&rdquo;. This Bill does exactly what the Worker Participation Act envisaged and what the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> enshrines.  It is a clear, simple, uncomplicated, prescriptive Bill. It gives the teachers in each vocational education committee the right to elect two of its members on to the VECs.  In doing so it does not in any way infringe on any of the core eight positions reserved for county councillors.  It simply reserves two of the co-opted places for teachers and changes the selection process from co-option by county councils to <Col N="192" /> direct elections by the teachers themselves.</P>
    <P>There is no valid reason whatever for not accepting that system and accepting it now.  Indeed, I would emphasise that it is vital that it be accepted now.  The local elections take place on 27 June next. Two weeks later the county councils and corporations of the county meet and elect their chairpersons and committees.  The vocational education committees which will be put in place in July 1991 will remain <i>in situ</i> in each county and each corporation area until 1996.  Unless this legislation is enacted before the local elections, then the right of teachers to direct representation to VECs cannot become a reality for the next five years at least.  There has been a tendency latterly to extend the remit and term of office of county councils from five years to six years &mdash; as on this occasion &mdash; and seven years on some occasions.  No amount of tinkering around with <i>ad hoc</i> advisory structures, no amount of recommendation to county councils to allow teachers one or two places can substitute for fully fledged membership of VECs by right as this Bill proposes.</P>
    <P>The Teachers Union of Ireland have supported this Bill.  I thank them and welcome their support.  The Teachers Union of Ireland which has managed to combine this trenchant defence of its members' rights with a very broad and enlightened approach to all education matters is one of the paramount trade union examples in this country.  The TUI have shown tremendous willingness and capacity to adapt to new developments and changes in education.  They have been to the forefront in proposing and welcoming positive educational innovation. Latterly their attitude to school based assessment was but a further example of their positive and forward-thinking approach.  From next July I want to see vocational education committees harnessing that wealth of knowledge, talent and expertise which the TUI and all vocational education teachers have.</P>
    <P>Vocational education has been a good servant of the Irish people.  Over the <Col N="193" /> years vocational education has broadened its scope of involvement.  It has shown that it is receptive, imaginative and adaptive.  It has taken in its stride the leaving certificate and the intermediate certificate.  The community college concept operates very successfully under the aegis of the vocational education committees. Two VEC members play important roles on boards of management of community schools.  The VEC system has shown tremendous adaptability in its involvement and management of a large sector of third level education. Vocational education committees manage and operate very effectively the nine regional technical colleges, the provincial colleges of music and the six DIT colleges in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is one provision of the Bill which I propose to seek to amend on Committee Stage if we get that far.  That is the reference in section 1 (b), line 30, to the ballot being that of the teachers in second level schools.  I will propose that this should read &ldquo;schools and colleges&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;second level schools&rdquo;, thereby enabling teachers in third level colleges run by VECs to vote and be elected as members of VECs.</P>
    <P>Article 42 of the Constitution acknowledges the role of parents as the primary and natural educators of the child.  I welcome recent statements by the Minister for Education about the need for greater parental involvement in the whole education process.  The use of the term &ldquo;parent power&rdquo;, however, in my opinion was an unfortunate choice of words in that power has connotations of conflict or struggle whereas education is about partnership, participation, trust and mutual confidence.  The selective use of the words &ldquo;parent power&rdquo; caused some unease and was welcomed neither by parents nor teachers.  I realise that the Minister was talking about greater parental involvement and participation, but as invariably happens on such occasions the strongest terminology used receives the geatest highlighting.</P>
    <P>I fully support the concept of maximum participation by parents.  Their participation is fundamental to the whole <Col N="194" /> spirit of the Constitution, apart from being the very essence of natural law. The involvement of parents on boards of management of primary schools in particular has been extremely successful, with the election of their members to the various management boards inviting a very high level of parent participation. Where such management structures are in place, by and large the parents' participation on such boards has been extremely constructive.</P>
    <P>The growth of the National Parents' Council has put the role and participation of parents very much at centre stage in all aspects of education.  I want to see that role and involvement consolidated and enhanced in years to come.  It is good that private secondary schools are increasingly accepting the need for management boards involving parents' representatives. One hopes that in the not too distant future every secondary school will have a board of management involving at least two parents.  At community school and community college level parents' representatives play full and active parts in the school management boards.</P>
    <P>While there are individual boards of management in vocational schools with parents thereon, such management boards in themselves have very little real power.  I sat on one such board.  Because the vocational education committee are the local autonomous statutory body for the regulation of vocational education within the county, it is in the VEC that the real power rests.  Every VEC get their annual budget from the Department of Education and they decide how to disburse that money.  Every VEC organise teacher allocation and deployment within their area.  Every VEC meet on a monthly basis to oversee the entire operation of vocational education within the county or borough area.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined the numerical composition of the VEC.  I am asking the Minister for Education, in the same vein as I appealed for a logical and fair-minded approach to the issue of teacher participation, to accept the absolute right <Col N="195" /> and necessity of giving two of the currently co-opted places to two parents elected by their own members.  Literally no member of a VEC, neither politician, priest nor anybody else, has as much right to membership as have the parents because their position is constitutionally provided for.</P>
    <P>One of the features of Question Time and debates on education in this House has been the inevitable recourse by the Minister to the contents of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Paragraph 75 of section iv of the programme urges that there should be &ldquo;an active parents' association in connection with each individual school, to promote and develop effective and positive participation by parents in education at school level&rdquo;.  This Bill supports this concept and would encourage the organisation of parents in each individual school so as to enable them to participate in the electoral process of two of their members to a vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 77 of the programme states:</P>
    <P>Positive parental interest is crucial to the child's educational attainment. It must, therefore, be an essential strategy of educational policy and practice to promote parental involvement in the education of their children.  To this end, the Department of Education proposes to support development programmes of the National Parents' Council aimed at increasing the level and quality of involvement by parents in education, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  It proposes to pay an annual grant of £25,000 to each of the two tiers of the Council to assist them with such programmes. </P>
    <P>I laud the Minister for such financial assistance and encouragement.  It is good, positive and extremely helpful, but the Minister knows from speaking to the Vocational Parents' Association that their first priority is the right to elect two of their members to the vocational education committees.  Such a move will cost nothing but will certainly mean a lot.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> On Saturday, 6 April 1991 addressing the annual delegate conference of the National Parents' Council &mdash; Primary in Wexford the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Power in such a partnership has to be shared in some way.  In this sharing process parents tend to be the weaker partners. </P>
    <P>In the VECs not alone are they not the weaker partners &mdash; they are not partners at all.  There is no partnership and they are simply not involved.  The Minister went on to say that parent power, in order to create an important necessary balance in the education system, is needed.  Of course it is needed but there is neither power, participation nor representation on VECs for parents.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued by saying that partnership for parents in education is the stated policy aim of the Government. If the Minister is serious, then the acceptance and enactment of this Bill should be welcomed as giving practical expression to what she has been saying in recent weeks and months.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that &ldquo;positive parental interest is crucial to a child's educational attainment&rdquo;.  We agree and one cannot have involvement at a higher level in the vocational education sector than on the ultimate management authority, the vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>I fully realise that the Minister's Green Paper on Education will attract submissions on teacher and parent participation in education.  I am sure the Education Act, when it emerges, will give a statutory basis to various management structures, again involving participation by the parties in education.  However, I do not want a Green Paper, White Paper or any other paper, or indeed the Education Act, to be used as an excuse to defer the rights of participation by parents and teachers in VECs.  If these rights are not established now they cannot and will not be established for another five years.  That is the bottom line.  The teachers in vocational schools, vocational colleges and regional technical colleges will feel badly let down, and rightly so.  Equally the parents of pupils <Col N="197" /> in vocational schools and community colleges will feel justifiably let down, disappointed, resentful and very much left out in the cold.  You cannot be a partner in education or in any other area if you are left outside looking in.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me &mdash; politicians of various persuasions have come under pressure from members of the public &mdash; that by designating four of the six places &mdash; two for parents and two for teachers &mdash; we are encroaching on what has been seen as the traditional preserve of members of county councils, that is, giving places to party affiliates and so on. I want to make it perfectly clear that although I would prefer the four places to come from within the existing scope of the 14-member VEC, I would be prepared, irrespective of my reservations, to accept an amendment to this Bill increasing the VEC membership from 14 to 18. That would allow for participation by two parents and two teachers and at the end of the day, it would establish the ratio I am proposing here.  Rather than accept any move that would hinder the involvement of teachers and parents in VECs I would be prepared, as the author and sponsor of this Bill, to accept such amendments.  I have great pleasure in recommending this Bill to the House and I look forward to a positive response from all the Opposition parties not least from the Minister.</P>

      <P>First, I congratulate Deputy Higgins for bringing forward this Bill.  I also thank the Teachers' Union of Ireland and the parents of pupils in vocational and community colleges for their support.  It is a very forward looking proposal and one that should be supported by all sides of the House.  I am a participating member of Kerry VEC, <Col N="198" /> which is probably one of the best in the country.  That committee is composed of very committed and dedicated people. By a stroke of political luck four members of the Teachers' Union of Ireland were appointed to the VEC six years ago as a result of a deal made with the Minister's party and an independent candidate who has since joined that party.  These four members have made an enormous contribution to the working of the VEC.  I am casting no aspersions on the other members of the VEC &mdash; they are not experts in the field of education &mdash; when I say that the major contributions on most subjects have come from these people. The chairman, who is a member of the Minister's party, has often expressed the view that we are lucky to have such experts on the committee.  Very often the agenda is completed in two hours and every item is discussed by people who know what they are talking about.</P>
      <P>There are 30 VECs throughout the country which manage vocational schools, community colleges, regional technical colleges and the Dublin institutes of technology.  As Deputy Higgins explained, the committees are composed of 14 persons of whom a minimum of five and a maximum of eight must be elected councillors.  The balance of the representation is made up of nominees of the local authority, usually representatives of the various political parties, and this is where the problem arises. Inevitably, either defeated candidates or party workers are nominated to the VECs and to other committees, and this ruins the spirit of the committees.  In many cases it adds a lot of dead wood to what could be very effective committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Higgins also explained, this Bill seeks to amend the Vocational Education Act, 1930, to allow for the statutory representation of two parents and two teachers on vocational education committees.  Both the Parents' Association of Vocational Schools and Community Colleges and the Teachers' Union of Ireland support the proposed Bill, and I thank them sincerely for their support. The Bill seeks to establish the statutory <Col N="199" /> right of teachers and parents to be represented on the committees.  I hope the Minister accepts the Bill.  Neither the parents nor the teachers' unions are prepared to accept promises.  They want a commitment and a guarantee.  The only way they can be guaranteed representation is through the legislative process and this is an opportunity to provide for that.</P>
    <P>It is very important that teachers are represented on VECs.  They have the expertise to make a major contribution to policy making and curriculum content and development.  Indeed, the TUI sought the right of representation for many years.  From my experience teachers can be very effective on vocational education committees.  They are chosen by the unions, probably have a record in union representation and an understanding of issues and what is relevant at a particular time.  If the Minister is genuine about her commitment to involve more parents in direct decision making on education, she will provide for two representatives nominated by parents as proposed in this Bill.  This would give parents a greater insight into how education is administered at local level and would enhance their knowledge and understanding of education.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Higgins has pointed out so eloquently, the Minister promised parent representation on many occasions in recent times.  Direct involvement is the order of the day, and this Bill provides an excellent opportunity for that.  Parents of pupils in vocational schools and community colleges are very concerned about their children's future.  At one time concerned parents were associated with secondary schools, the college or convent sector, but parents of children attending vocational schools are now very concerned about their children's future. They want to participate and be involved. That is what I have experienced in Kerry. Next Friday for the first time there will be a prize-giving ceremony at a school in Listowel for which the Minister herself provided a very important extension last year.  The prizes are being awarded <Col N="200" /> because parents requested that.  I was being complimentary to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is composed of people who directly represent parents' interests.  Parents as members of a committee, being people who have an interest in respect of their children, would be more forceful on issues that affect parents directly than perhaps an ordinary member who might not be aware of such issues or might not care about them.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Higgins pointed out, representation of teachers on the VECs is in line with the aspirations expressed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, which seeks to extend employee participation.  As Deputy Higgins has already dealt with that point, I shall not pursue it at length.  Employee participation was one of the central themes of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> document.  The Government could now make that aspiration a reality.  In education there is no place more appropriate than the VECs in which to give that participation to employees, to those who administer education, and impart knowledge.  The proposal would also give a major boost to the VECs, who have made great strides in the tackling of education problems at all levels throughout the years since 1913 and especially in recent times.  Direct involvement in the VECs by parents representing the consumers of education and by teachers representing the central figures in education, themselves, would help the VECs to continue in the expansion of their services to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be amazed if the Minister <Col N="201" /> rejected this forward-thinking proposal. That would be most unfortunate.  In keeping with the spirit demonstrated by the Government in accepting Deputy Shatter's Bill, the Minister should do likewise tonight, and thus endear herself to the parents and the teachers.  That is something that she has, so admirably, tried to do at times.</P>

      <P>No, I shall not succumb. First, I thank Deputy Jim Higgins for bringing forward the Bill and providing the House with the opportunity to debate education.  I have always maintained that the House has too few such opportunities.  The fact that there will be four nights of debate on education laid out in specified time is in itself a very good thing, no matter what the eventual outcome of the Bill.  The commitment shown by Deputy Higgins and Deputy Deenihan to the cause of education and to its debate is admirable.  I do not wish anything that I might say to take from that, because I genuinely mean it.  In the House questions, adjournment debates and general debates are laced with much commonsense, good ideas as well as lots of argy-bargy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins said that teachers in the counties that had teacher representation were usually teachers who followed the persuasion of the political party in power.  That is not so.  As Members have all paraded their own counties, let me parade my own county. In County Westmeath there has for many years been a teacher representative nominated by the TUI, not by any political party.  In fact, the same representative was nominated in the time of the Fine Gael Government &mdash; as Deputy McGrath will know &mdash; and in the time of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins contended that in bringing forward the Bill he was not being <Col N="202" /> political, but I would dispute that point. Anybody who brings forward a measure such as this within four weeks of local elections is obviously being political, in the correct meaning of the term.  Deputy Higgins took the meaning of the term as being party political, but I take the correct English translation of the word &ldquo;political&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said that the Bill was a clear, simple, uncomplicated, non-prescriptive Bill.  I shall show clearly, on the legal advice that has been obtained &mdash; the best legal advice in the country &mdash; that the Bill is precisely the opposite of that description.  He also claimed that when each VEC was <i>in situ</i> after the local elections it would remain static for the next five years.  That is not so, and I shall elaborate on that point later.</P>
    <P>Although Deputy Higgins said the Bill was simple and clear, before he had finished his Second Stage speech he had already proposed two startling amendments. It is completely at variance for any proposer of a Bill to say that it is clear, simple and non-prescriptive but then to put forward two startling amendments to it being concluding their Second Stage speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, what I did say was that I would consider such amendments only in the event of the measure not being acceptable to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the Deputy put forward two startling amendments and it struck me as showing a rather odd enthusiasm for the Bill.  However, I shall take it in the light of what he has said, but my speech will cover that issue, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan, as a long term member of a very valued and valuable VEC, spoke of his commitment to the Kerry VEC and related what has happened there.  I am well acquainted with the way in which members of that VEC do their business; of the many demands they make, correctly, upon central Government, and of the way that they seem never to take &ldquo;No&rdquo; for an answer. I have met them recently about their <Col N="203" /> various activities in Causeway, Cahirciveen, Kinsale and other places.  Yes, they are very active.  Those I met from the deputations &mdash; who, I think, were two of the people mentioned by the Deputy &mdash; were also very active and put forward their brief with great acumen.</P>

This is something to which I am deeply committed and it gives me the chance to detail to the House my views on partnership in the education process.</P>

      <P>The Bill is a very short one which seeks to give representation in VECs for two parents and two teachers. I am in sympathy with the thinking behind the proposals in the Bill, but on the best legal advice available to me the Bill is flawed and inoperable.  I should be glad to show this legal advice privately to the Opposition spokesperson at any time he wishes to see it.</P>
      <P>Membership of VECs is governed by the terms of section 8 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  Under the terms of the Act membership of VECs consists of 14 members, or more where the vocational education area contains one or more urban districts which were not scheduled urban districts under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act further provides that not less than five and not more than eight <Col N="204" /> members of the VEC shall be members of the electing county council.  There is scope, therefore, for the election to the VEC of up to nine persons who are not members of the relevant county council. In electing such persons the local authority shall have regard, among other things, to the interest and experience in education of the persons it proposes for election.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that considerable scope exists for the election of persons, including parents and/or teachers, to the VECs without recourse to amending legislation.</P>
    <P>The basic intent of section 1 of the proposed Bill is wholly incompatible with the existing provisions of the 1930 Act which it proposes to amend.  As it stands, it proposes that VECs shall consist of &ldquo;(a) not less than two parents...&rdquo; and &ldquo;(b) not less than two teachers...&rdquo;.  In other words, each VEC will be composed not only in this way.  This totally ignores the existing provisions relating to the composition of VECs which are explicitly spelled out in the 1930 Act.</P>
    <P>To achieve what the drafter of the Bill apparently wants to achieve, the Bill would have to provide that in addition to the membership already specified in the Act there should also be additional membership not less than two of which will be parents, etc. and not less than two of which will be teachers, etc.  Therefore the provision is fundamentally flawed and inoperable.</P>
    <P>The use of the phrase &ldquo;not less than two ...&rdquo; in the proposed new section (3A) (a) and (b) means there would be no limit to the number of parents or teachers which would make up the membership of the VECs.  It allows for the possibility of ten, 20, 50 or any number of parents or teachers.  Contrast, for example, with the existing provision of section 8 (2) which specified that there shall be 14 members of the Committee &ldquo;of whom not less than five nor more than eight shall be persons who are members of such Council&rdquo;. Flaws in this are obvious.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill proposes only a minimum and not a maximum number of parents <Col N="205" /> and teachers to be members of the VEC, who is to decide the actual number of parents or teachers?  No one or any group of persons is given power to decide this in the proposed legislation.  This was one of the matters which was brought strongly to my attention by my legal advisers.  Therefore, nobody has power to decide whether membership should consist of the minimum two in each case or more.</P>
    <P>There are many other serious flaws in the way the Bill is drafted, including the format of elections &mdash; first past the post or proportional representation &mdash; or the termination of appointments of teachers/parents representatives.  For example a teacher could be on the VEC for ten or 20 years with no opportunity for altering the membership.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to labour the drafting inadequacies of the Bill.  However, I hope the Deputy will accept that the Bill as drafted is fundamentally unsound. Indeed, it is not possible to redress these deficiencies by simple amendments.  Fundamental policy issues have not been thought through sufficiently.</P>
    <P>Naturally, as Minister for Education, I must ensure that legislation is fundamentally sound and not open to challenge in the courts.  This Bill would not only be open to major continuing challenges but is basically inoperable.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> emphasised the importance of the role of parents in the education of their children and recognised the promotion of parental involvement in the education of their children as an essential strategy of educational policy and practice.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of this commitment, I recently sent a letter to the authorities of all schools, both primary and post-primary, asking the authorities to take whatever steps are necessary to establish a parents' association in connection with each school where none existed.</P>
    <P>In the course of this letter I pointed out that parents have a right to be assured that their children's needs are being met by the school and that parents, as a body, are entitled to know whether the school <Col N="206" /> and the education system are meeting children's needs.</P>
    <P>The National Parents' Council, consisting of primary and post-primary tiers, have provided representation for parents as partners in education on various Government appointed bodies.  Through their representative function, the council are making a most valuable contribution to the central planning and policy development in education.  In the letter to which I have referred, I suggested that an individual school's parents association should affiliate to the appropriate tier of the National Parents' Council.  As Deputy Deenihan pointed out, for many years now parents have been represented on boards of management of primary schools and community schools along with teachers.</P>
    <P>These developments signify the increasing recognition of the role of parents in the education of their children. I have spared no effort to bring this message home and I am sure the House will freely acknowledge my enthusiasm for the involvement of parents in the management of the educational system.  My first concern is that they be involved where it really counts, and that is at the level of the individual school itself, where the decisions are taken with regard to running that school.  I have yet to meet either parent or teacher who disagrees with that.  Decisions are taken on the local board of management.  It makes sense that devolution of power should be where the influence of parents and professionals can be clearly recognised and amplified.</P>
    <P>Teachers will readily acknowledge, I am sure, that they are afforded every opportunity of having their views represented. The negotiations on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provide a good example of this. The three teacher unions were engaged in all the discussions on the education aspects of the programme.  The programme represents a consensus on educational policy reached between the teachers' unions and the Government and I would like to take this opportunity <Col N="207" /> to acknowledge again the positive contibution made by the teachers in ensuring that education was one of the main priority areas for attention in the programme.</P>
    <P>There is not a council, a committee or a working party established under my Department's aegis which does not have teacher representation on it so that the teachers' viewpoints are clearly represented and enunciated in respect of every educational development.</P>
    <P>When dealing with worker participation in VECs, the Bill appears to be deficient as it limits representation and fails to involve other staff employed by VECs.  I know that is rectified in an amendment about second and third level colleges, but it has been put to me that there are other unions involved with other staffs in the VECs who also seek inclusion.  The people in those unions give very good service and many of the schools and colleges would not be able to operate properly were there not such dedicated members of other public service unions on their staffs.</P>
    <P>When the former Deputy Hussey was Minister for Education, in the July following the local elections she wrote to local authorities about parental representation. Prior to the local elections I will write to each local authority reiterating my commitment to meaningful parent/teacher involvement in education decision making.  In this context I will bring to their attention the desirability that the membership of each vocational education committee should include a representative of teachers and parents of pupils attending their schools.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, I will shortly be introducing two Bills in relation to VEC third level colleges &mdash; one covering the Regional Technical Colleges, the other covering Dublin Institute of Technology. These Bills, among many other provisions, will propose formal staff representations on the governing bodies of the Regional Technical Colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that I will be publishing later in the year a Green Paper <Col N="208" /> on education which will deal with all important issues in the education field. The Green Paper will provide the opportunity for those interested in education to consider and debate the issues and to express to me their views on the various aspects of education.  This wide-ranging debate will provide the background to the issuing of a White Paper and, later, will culminate in the provision of an Education Bill.  I have no doubt that one of the issues to be debated will be the role and membership of VECs in the future.</P>
    <P>While not wishing in any way to preview the contents of the proposed Green Paper, I have spoken recently to the annual conference of the Irish Vocational Education Association on what I see as the important elements to be contained in a post primary school of the future.</P>
    <P>Each school will have a board of management who will be responsible for the running of the schools.  This policy is based on the premise that the State should take only those decisions it needs to take and that all other administrative decisions should, as far as possible, be passed to the school.  Local management of schools is a central plank of education reform in many countries and is based on the conviction that decision making at a local level with parental and community involvement, when backed up by control over resources, will lead to a better service.</P>
    <P>I spoke very clearly to the Irish Vocational Education Association in relation to the management of schools.  I said that they would be the deciding body for the activities of that school and that if it was a vocational school it would be a sub-committee who would do their business in a proper fashion.  I want to have teachers, parents and local democratically elected people on that committee. I cannot stress how important it is to recognise that they will have responsibility for their own school.  There are 38 VECs who vary in nature.  The town of Wexford VEC comes to mind. They run a fine school and they were well able to lobby me in a proper fashion. VECs vary from that to those who run a huge number of schools or colleges at <Col N="209" /> third level.  Therefore, on a large committee, parents' and teachers' representatives at the seat of power &mdash; as it will be perceived in the VECs &mdash; would not have very much impact on their individual schools if it was a far flung and diverse scheme.  They would not have a sufficient &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; approach in relation to their own school and I do not think their concerns could be properly expressed, promulgated and thought through under this legislation.</P>
    <P>VECs have a big range of other activities and the Opposition Bill is limited because it is concerned with second level schools only.  I know an amendment is now proposed to take in third level colleges but there are many other activities in which teachers and parents are involved.  There is a huge growth in back to school activities which cannot really be related to second level or VEC level. People are coming back for a second chance; Youthreach caters for the early drop-out and VTOS caters for people who, for one reason or another, are unemployed and want to get back to furthering their certificate type examination, sitting formal examinations and, thankfully, going on to third level.  There are also sports activities under the aegis of VECs; there are community and training workshops and the disadvantaged areas of speciality.  These are huge areas of responsibility and the VECs, under the 1930 Act, took them very seriously, expanded on them and responded to the flexible needs of the community.  They are not catered for in the Bill and there is far more scope for a much wider debate in this area.</P>
    <P>The questions which I posed recently to the conference of the Irish Vocational Education Association &mdash; the representatives of the VECs &mdash; were what form of authority should be delegated to the individual school and its board of management to enable them to discharge their delegated responsibilities and what is the nature of the broader role and control function to be performed by the VEC &mdash; in relation to their schools and the multiplicity of educational and training services within their respective areas. <Col N="210" /> These issues will be further and publicly debated.  These issues will, as I have stated, be addressed in the Green Paper and will be debated at length as a result.</P>
    <P>The questions of school management and where the authority for management will lie and who is to exercise that authority are, therefore, at issue at this point. The introduction now of this Bill is premature.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate about partnership in education and have always advocated it.  What I say is that this is part of a wider picture.  We should await the Green Paper and the debate which will follow it before making any decisions on matters affecting school management and administration.  The introduction of the Bill, apart from it being, according to my legal advice, inoperable and flawed, is premature.  We must look to the future school structure and to legislation which will govern it rather than tinker with existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> reiterates the central role of parents in education, which was freely stated by the Opposition in putting forward the Bill.  I acknowledge, welcome and endorse it and indeed always pursued it.  I was glad to give expression to it by way of financial commitment, which was welcomed by the parents' associations. The teachers are integrally involved in all aspects of decision-making.  They were key players in the negotiation for the education package in the programme.</P>
    <P>A Green Paper is currently being prepared for publication this autumn which will open for debate further key issues in education.  One of its key purposes will be to involve all the partners including, obviously, parents and teachers, in a full and open debate on the future strategic direction of our educational system. Therefore, it is clear that, in future, the position of membership will not be final and static but can be altered in a planned, logical and correct legal fashion.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that I make it clear that I and the Government, who are committed to implementing the proposals contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreed <Col N="211" /> with the social partners, are in sympathy with the thinking behind the proposals in the Bill but, on the best legal advice available to me, I again repeat that the Bill is flawed and inoperable.  However, as I said at the outset, it presents us with an opportunity to have a reasoned and open debate over four nights on education. While we must confine ourselves to dealing with vocational education there is much we can speak about praise, challenge and improve on but the one thing that we cannot improve on is the quality of our teachers and their commitment to their cause and the lively interest of parents in their children's future.  I want to further this and in pursuing this aim I will introduce a Green Paper and enshrine in a proper legal framework what Deputy Higgins has put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Higgins for bringing this Bill before the House as it provides us with an opportunity to debate two very important matters in education the first of which is industrial democracy in relation to teachers and the second the need for meaningful parental involvement in the education of their children.</P>
      <P>I was taken aback by the Minister's statement that even though she is in sympathy with the thinking behind the proposals in the Bill, on the best legal advice available to her the Bill is flawed and inoperable.  I would also like her to clarify what she meant by her statement &ldquo;indeed, it is not possible to redress the dificiencies by simple amendments.&rdquo; What I would like to know is whether it will be possible to redress them by way of more complex amendments put forward by either the Government or the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister <Col N="212" /> to clarify what she meant by that statement. If changes are not made now it will take a minimum of five years and a maximum of seven years to introduce them.  The question I am asking is whether the Minister is amenable to the suggestion that discussions be held as the debate progresses to reach agreement so as to ensure that the principles enshrined in the Bill before the House, which the Labour Party agree with, are given effect. We have to be pragmatic, the Bill will not reach Committee Stage unless the Government agree to it on Second Stage. However, with good will an all sides, the Vocational Education Act, 1930, can be amended to reserve places for teachers and parents.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins dealt with two matters during the course of his contribution about which I am concerned, the first of which is that the Bill deals only with second level education and not with third level education.  He also said he would be prepared, if the Bill reaches Committee Stage, to introduce changes.  I wish to instance the position in the two vocational education committees of which I am a member.  The agreed representative of the TUI regional college branch and the city branch, which represent the two second level schools, on the City of Waterford Vocational Education Committee is a third level lecturer. If the Bill is enacted in its present form I would be concerned that that person would not be able to act as one of the teacher representatives.</P>

      <P>I would also like to consider &mdash; this matter was addressed by Deputy Higgins &mdash; whether there is merit in the argument that we should extend the membership of the vocational education committees.  I would, once again, like to instance the position in the City of Waterford Vocational Education Committee.  It has long been the tradition that the representatives of the Waterford Council of Trade Unions and the Waterford Chamber of Commerce and the nominees of the Catholic and Church of Ireland Bishop's be members of the committee. A place is also reserved for the TUI representative.  The same is true in the case of County Waterford Vocational Education Committee.</P>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that as the vocational education system has advanced great advances have been made at the interface of industry and commerce and the vocational educational system.  It is also important that the social partners get involved.  In Waterford the local authority invite the council of trade unions and the chamber of commerce to participate and in the case of County Waterford Vocational Education Committee a couple of national teachers in the catchment area of vocational schools are also members of the committee.  Quite frankly, I do not want to know what their politics are, they are good people who have contributed well and have done a very fine job during my time on the vocational education committee.  My concern is that four out of the possible six places&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £19,968,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1991, for the salaries and expenses of the Central Statistics Office. </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate for 1991 for the Central Statistics Office of £20.0 million represents an increase of £12.7 million or 177 per cent on the provisional out-turn for 1990. This exceptionally large increase is required almost entirely to provide for the costs of two censuses, the 1991 census of population and the 1991 census of agriculture. Around 3,500 temporary field staff were recruited for the census of population.  Approximately 1,500 of these have been retained for the census of agriculture.</P>
      <P>The census of agriculture was originally scheduled for 1990, but was postponed until 1991 and for reasons of efficiency and economy is being carried out as an extension of the 1991 census of population field operation thereby saving approximately £1.5 million.  There were also strong statistical grounds for linking the two censuses, namely, the increased scope for analyses of the farming community.</P>
      <P>The census of population was taken on Sunday, 21 April.  The majority of the million census forms have now been collected by the census enumerators.  The House will be glad to hear that reports from the field staff indicate that the whole operation went very smoothly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to <Col N="215" /> place on record the Government's appreciation of the efficiency of Central Statistics Office staff in conducting the census and the wholehearted co-operation received from the public.</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office have already started the processing work to ensure the early publication of the preliminary results.  Population estimates, classified by sex for each county and county borough, are expected to be released towards the end of July.  This will allow firm estimates of net migration for the five-year period since the 1986 census to be derived.  A further preliminary report to be issued by the end of September will, for the first time, provide an age breakdown of the preliminary population figures.</P>
    <P>The definitive population results for 1991 will be published on a county by county basis in two series of local population reports according as the results for individual counties are finalised.  The traditional series of detailed publications relating to particular topics will also be produced and the detailed small area statistics will again be made available.</P>
    <P>I have gone into this topic in some detail so that the House will be aware of the extent of the work involved in processing the census returns.  The distribution and collection of the completed forms is only part of the operation. Behind the scenes a massive amount of work goes on in advance of the census in designating enumeration areas, preparing maps, recruiting field staff, etc. The processing of returns will continue for some time in order to provide a detailed analysis of the population.</P>
    <P>The census of agriculture is also a very large operation, exceeded in size only by the census of population.  The reference date for this census is 1 June 1991.  The fieldwork will commence on 4 June and continue until the end of July 1991.  It will cover approximately 200,000 farms. Details will be collected by personal interview.  The questionnaire was drawn up after consultation with users in Government Departments and other relevant interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> Preliminary results from the census are expected to be available around the middle of next year.  As I have already mentioned, the linkage between the census of agriculture and the census of population will facilitate the preparation of an expanded range of analyses relating to the farming community.  The census of agriculture will also be used to construct an up-to-date statistical register of farms which will act as a basis for subsequent regular sample farm surveys.</P>
    <P>The two censuses account for more than half of the Central Statistics Office's Estimate for 1991.  The remainder covers all the other Central Statistics Office activities.  These are almost all of an ongoing nature, comprising a variety of monthly, quarterly or annual inquiries in the following areas: agriculture; services; industry, building and construction; national accounts; balance of payments; labour statistics; tourism and travel; external trade; transport; prices.  Apart from these regular activities, the Central Statistics Office also undertake perodic inquiries such as the household budget survey and labour costs survey.</P>
    <P>I will briefly describe some of these activities so that the House will have an appreciation of the extent of the statistical services provided by the Central Statistics Office.  Before I do this I would just point out that the statistical programme of the EC is being adapted significantly to provide an effective information system for the post 1992 Internal Market.  These developments will bear heavily on the Central Statistics Office but I am confident that the office will cope efficiently and professionally, as they have done in the past.</P>
    <P>Deregulation arising from the completion of the Internal Market will result in the disappearance of some statistical data sources, (for example intra-EC trade data from customs sources and balance of payments data from exchange controls).  New systems will be put in place to ensure the continuance of these statistical series.  Inter-departmental committees examined the alternative data collection systems and reports <Col N="217" /> recommending adoption of new procedures are almost complete.</P>
    <P>Let me start with agricultural statistics. Apart from the census of agriculture, which I have referred to already, there are other farm surveys and agriculture inquiries.  In addition to meeting national needs, much of the output also goes towards complying with mandatory community information requirements.</P>
    <P>In 1990 all farm surveys were conducted by post.  This included the major June and December surveys, which covered more than 25,000 farms and achieved good response rates of around 80 per cent.  The introduction of this more cost effective postal survey system in place of the former enumerator-based system is part of an overall programme to modernise and develop farm surveys in Ireland.  This programme is partly funded by the EC and will conclude this year with the taking of the census of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The services sector has been one of the engines of employment growth in recent years and a number of statistical inquiries have been undertaken here.  The 1988 census of services incorporated for the first time a census of employment for service sectors in general together with a detailed census of distribution, which collected traditional details on turnover, purchases, stocks, wages and salaries, etc.  Retail and wholesale trades were last covered in the 1977 census of distribution. Other services were surveyed for the first time because of their increasing importance to the economy.  First results for the retail and wholesale sectors were published last November.</P>
    <P>The results of a new quarterly inquiry covering the financial services sector were published in January 1990.  These consist of estimates of total employment and indices of weekly earnings for the sector as a whole and for three main sectors.</P>
    <P>A wide range of statistics are compiled for the industrial and building sectors. There is an annual census of industrial production, an annual census of building and construction, various monthly and <Col N="218" /> quarterly inquiries, and a quarterly analysis of planning permissions granted.</P>
    <P>Last February the CSO inaugurated a new quarterly statistical release containing results from the quantity surveyors' inquiry, which is conducted jointly by the CSO and the Department of the Environment.  The aim of the inquiry is to monitor output of the non-residential building sector.</P>
    <P>A major area of activity within the CSO relates to the preparation of national accounts and associated statistics. This draws heavily on the results of many other CSO inquiries and additional information from a wide range of sources.  The national accounts results for 1989 were published in October 1990.  It is planned to improve this publication schedule and provision is being made to allocate additional staff to the area so that results can be published within six months of the end of the reference year.</P>
    <P>A critical point has been reached in the development of balance of payments statistics because of the progressive disappearance of data from exchange control sources.  A new system is under examination which will take some time to implement and, in the interim, it is necessary for the CSO to undertake additional direct inquiries to replace, as far as possible, the data being lost through exchange control liberalisation.</P>
    <P>Another important area of activity for the CSO is the production of statistics on employment, unemployment and the labour force.  The end-month live register count is the most widely known indicator of unemployment because of its monthly frequency and timeliness of publication. The live register statement is compiled by the CSO from returns received from the 130 local employment exchanges throughout the country.  It provides a valuable short-term indicator of the trend of unemployment between the results of successive annual labour force surveys. However, because of the complexity of its administrative regulations and contribution conditions, it should never be regarded as an objective measure of the absolute level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> The results of the annual labour force surveys provide the definitive measure of employment and unemployment.  These surveys are carried out as part of an EC-wide programme of surveys designed to give comparable information on employment, unemployment and the labour force in all member states.  In Ireland the labour force survey covers over 45,000 households.  Preliminary results for 1990 were released in October 1990.  The detailed results for 1990 are expected shortly.  Fieldwork for the 1991 labour force survey has just concluded.</P>
    <P>Tourism and travel statistics are compiled from continuing sample surveys at the principal air and sea ports.  The survey results, in conjunction with passenger numbers provided by airport authorities and carriers, are used to estimate the numbers of visits to Ireland by non-residents and their expenditure in this country, and the corresponding figures for Irish residents visiting other countries.</P>
    <P>Extensive statistics on imports and exports at detailed commodity level are compiled each month from customs documentation.  This data source for intra-EC trade statistics will disappear on the completion of the Single Market in 1993.  An interdepartmental committee will shortly make recommendations on the most effective and economical administrative arrangements needed for the compilation of reliable trade statistics post-1992.</P>
    <P>Central Statistics Office statistics are published immediately they become available in regular statistical releases issued through the Government Information Services, periodicals and detailed publications.  Custom designed special analyses are also provided on a fee basis. Selections of data from the Central Statistics Office data bank, officially inaugurated in 1987, are also available on diskette for micro-computer users.  Considerable improvements have been made in Central Statistics Office dissemination services in recent years and a more commercial oriented approach has also been adopted.  The existing dissemination and <Col N="220" /> marketing strategy is currently being assessed by external consultants.  The Central Statistics Office have, of course, a fully networked computer system linking their three separate offices based on the most up-to-date technology.  The improvement of the system in recent years has resulted in greater efficiencies, improved publication schedules and increased flexibility in statistical analyses.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to make a brief reference to the National Statistics Board who were established in 1986 in line with the proposals contained in the Government White Paper <i>A New Institutional Structure For The Central Statistics Office.</i>  The board's function is to guide the strategic direction of the Central Statistics Office and to establish priorities for the compilation and development of official statistics.  The board have met regularly since their foundation.</P>
    <P>The first major task the board undertook was to decide on priorities for official statistics, timetables for achieving them and a recommendation for Government approval concerning the resources of staffing, equipment and finances that should be made available to the Central Statistics Office over the five year period 1988-92.  The results of this assessment appeared in the May 1988 board report <i>Strategy For Statistics 1988-1992</i>, which was accepted by Government.  Progress on the implementation of this strategy was reviewed by the board in their 1989 and 1990 reports.  Their 1991 report is being prepared.</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office operate under the provisions of the Statistics Acts, 1926 and 1946.  New legislation is being prepared.  This will provide the legal basis for the National Statistics Board and for other provisions in the Government White Paper mentioned earlier.  It will also update aspects of the existing legislation.</P>

Linehan, the outgoing Accounting Officer.  I did not realise the last time he came before the Committee that it would be his last appearance, and I want to take this opportunity to place on the record of the House my appreciation and the appreciation of the Committee of Public Accounts of his excellent work in his capacity as Accounting Officer.  I hope the Minister and his colleagues will pass that message on to him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister correctly states that the Central Statistics Office currently operate under the 1926 and 1946 legislation.  Confidentiality is legally guaranteed under the Statistics Act, 1926, where it is made an offence for officers to disclose information subject to a fine not exceeding £50 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months or to both fine and such imprisonment.  I am quoting from section 14 (2) of the Statistics Act, 1926.</P>
      <P>Since the Government will be updating the legislation concerning the compilation of statistics and introducing a new statistics Bill, I think the fine of £50, which was a very significant sum in 1926, is no longer significant and a more substantial fine should be considered.  It is not that I have any doubts about looseness in the confidentiality surrounding the compilation of statistics but I do feel that is a derisory sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that a new statistics Bill which is at an advanced stage of preparation will include institutionalising the National Statistics Board, assigning greater power to the Central Statistics <Col N="222" /> Office for co-ordinating statistics and reinforcing the confidential basis of data and other provisions.  It would seem that whereas penalties are very easily applied and the confidentiality of statistics, to my knowledge, is certainly protected, there are certain loose ends which I feel should be addressed.  For instance, when the persons in the field are collecting these statistics forms from persons in public life or who are well known, they leave the form and write the name of the person on top of it.  It asks for some very confidential information indeed in relation to religion, personal family matters, income, etc.  It would be better if, instead of scribbling on the envelope the name of the family or the person returning the form, the complier got back the form in a sealed envelope and that those envelopes would only be opened by a senior official of the Central Statistics Office.  That is a minor weakness which should be addressed.</P>
    <P>When the legislation is addressing the question of the correct use of statistics and the institutionalising of the National Statistics Board it is going to be very difficult to lay any grounds for planning here which is the whole purpose of statistics, because of the level and type of emigration we have.  There are already 750,000 people of Irish birth living in Britain.  The source of that information is evidence presented to a committee of this House and I think in reply to a question in this House, but that figure is correct. That figure does not take into account the huge number of emigrants who are moving in and our of the country regularly.  Statistics as currently compiled take no account of the enormous number of Irish citizens living in such close proximity to this island who could return here in given circumstances, such as an economic boom, a security crisis or a serious decline in the British economy or the economy of other countries.  It is time statistics took account of the emigrant population and some provision was made in the calculation of statistics to take <Col N="223" /> account of the possible needs of Irish emigrants.  There is little point in planning for the future of a country with so many people abroad, some of them in such proximity to the State, without taking into account their needs, age structure and possible future abroad or in this State.</P>
    <P>There is a further gap in the compilation of statistics.  As will be evidenced by the <i>CSO Guide to Publications and Information Services 1991</i>, published by the Central Statistics Office, the compilation of statistics seeks all kinds of personal information.  It seeks information about religion, fertility in marriage, marital status, income and matters of that kind, but in my view it makes no provision for census of ethnic groups.  It is possible that ethnic groups could be identified by, for instance, the Moslem religion.  In the inner city part of my constituency there has been a significant growth in the Moslim community.  There are more Moslems in my constituency now than there are Jews and, possibly, than there are Protestants.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the statistics will indicate, but Dublin is becoming a multi-racial city of people of various colours and religions or none, and no provision is made in our planning and compilation of statistics for that.  I want to make it clear that people, no matter what colour, religion or background, who are entitled by law to be here are welcome but we are wrong not to take account of it statistically, not to plan for it, not to plan for the integration &mdash; not assimilation &mdash; of those people so that their traditions, religions and ethnic character can be provided for.  They are not being planned or provided for.  We do not want to see a Brixton situation develop or the numbers growing, particularly in certain parts of the capital city, or any other city, without planning and providing for their needs.</P>
    <P>Because in the compilation of statistics some very personal questions are asked we should try to measure the multi-racial <Col N="224" /> development in Dublin and its likely future evolution.  If we do not do that we are undermining the whole purpose of statistics, which is to plan for the proper evolution and development of this city.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from <i>Irish Official Statistics Background Details and Data Sources</i>, published by the Central Statistics Office, which states:</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office has coped well with EC demands despite its limited resources.  Because of Community membership Ireland is required to develop a sophisticated statistical system appropriate to a world trading power.  This is something which a small country would not normally aspire to. Although welcome from a statistical viewpoint EC statistical requirements give rise to disproportionately high resource requirements in the Irish context mainly because:</P>
    <P>*Economies of scale in the compilation of statistics are such that it is relatively more expensive for small countries to conduct surveys;</P>
    <P>*Small countries have to survey a proportionately higher number of statistical units than larger ones to produce estimates in the detail normally required by the EC.</P>
    <P>An increased momentum for the further development of the Community statistical system has recently commenced in the context of the post-1992 Single Market.  The Commission's intention is to move national statistical services towards a single integrated federal system of the standard required for the efficient operation of the Single Market.  These developments will be underpinned by Community legislation to measure conformity.  A number of initiatives have already been taken to set these developments in train.  The result of this will be a further increase in EC statistical demands on the Central Statistics Office. </P>
    <P>I apologise for the length of that <Col N="225" /> quotation but I wanted to get it on the record because it is clear that for the size of the country greater demands are being put on our statistical compilation resources than on other EC member states in order to meet EC membership requirements, particularly post-1992 Single Market statistical requirements.</P>
    <P>This should be accompanied by a greater allocation of resources for the compilation of the statistics by direct transfer of resources from the EC to this country in order that we can meet this disproportionate part of the burden which has been placed on us by these requirements.  We already receive certain EC support and backing in the Central Statistics Office, but where disproportionate requirements are being placed on the shoulders of the Central Statistics Office and the statistical compilation systems, here the EC should take account of that and make resources available accordingly.</P>
    <P>The NESC in 1985, on information for policy said, as recorded in their report that their &ldquo;consultant in his report, identified a lack of any central focus for decision-making in relation to statistics as a whole which could set standards, monitor performance, help allocate resources and give policy advice across the range of statistical output&rdquo;.  The report stated that the Council recommended that the Central Statistics Office should prepare both a short-term programme and also a longer term rolling programme to provide a coherent planning framework.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to assure the House that such a short-term and long-term rolling comprehensive programme has been put in place.  That NESC report continued:</P>
    <P>The ability of computerised systems to process rapidly large amounts of data greatly enhances the potential for using administrative records in providing valuable information which might otherwise be available only at considerable cost.  Both the Revenue <Col N="226" /> Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare, for example, have in their administrative records a vast amount of data on incomes and patterns of employment.</P>
    <P>The Council has previously drawn attention to the lack of information on the changing distribution of income and also on the altered structure of employment, particularly in respect of the services sector.  There is clearly great potential in using administrative records to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information for policy, particularly by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare. </P>
    <P>The NESC identified an area which clearly could be used to enhance the statistical compilation role of the CSO. However, it would have to be made very clear that the use of any information by the CSO which is extracted from the files of the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Social Welfare must be bound by the section of the 1926 Act and the new Act to be introduced governing confidentiality.  In other words, if the recommendations of NESC are to be taken up, clear safeguards must be put in place to ensure that the confidentiality of a social welfare return or a return to the inspector of taxes, the Revenue Commissioners, is not in any way watered down, interfered with, identified or made public.  On that basis and on the basis that the normal fines are increased, as I have suggested, the NESC report has much to commend it.  I wanted to enter that caveat.</P>

      <P>I have given the Deputy some latitude on the matter.  We are debating an Estimate and the debate would more appropriately be confined to that Estimate and the events of the year to which it refers.

      <P>The appointment of a director general for the Central Statistics Office whose salary is provided for in the £20 million Estimate moved by the Minister of State seems to be a little unusual in so far as, I understand it, he will be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Government but the Taoiseach will continue to retain responsibility.  It seems to be unusual to say the lease that we should be providing in this Estimate for a salary for a director general who will be appointed by the President but who will continue in some shape or form to be under the supervision or direction of the Taoiseach of the day. Perhaps the Minister in his reply will explain the thinking behind this proposal.</P>
      <P>With regard to tourism and travel, the Minister in his speech said:</P>
      <P>Tourism and travel statistics are compiled from continuing sample surveys at the principal air and sea ports. The survey results, in conjunction with passenger numbers provided by airport authorities and carriers, are used to estimate the numbers of visits to Ireland by non-residents and their expenditure in this country, and the corresponding figures for Irish residents visiting other countries. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every time any one of the 750,000 Irish-born people living in Britain or other emigrants living abroad visit this country they are recorded as a tourist.  Every time Jack Charlton and the Irish football team visit Ireland they are recorded as tourists.  If you have a niece, nephew, brother or sister living in London and they come home for a family occasion, a funeral, wedding or birthday, or for any other reason they are recorded as tourists. Our tourist statistics, based on the calculations outlined by the Minister, clearly overstate our level of tourism and are allowing the industry to build on shifting sand.  Based on what the Minister has said and our high level emigration, it is very clear that our tourism statistics do <Col N="228" /> not give a true view of the actual number of tourists who have visited this country in recent years.</P>
    <P>It can be argued that this method of calculation is used in other countries. However, other countries do not have the same shifting population we have.  I doubt very much if a person who lives in Brussels, who has to take a train to Paris to work and another train home at weekends or <i>vice versa</i> is recorded as a tourist. People coming through our ports are recorded and are included in the statistics on the number of people visiting this country.  Based on these statistics, we are told that there has been a 15 per cent increase in tourism already this year and that there will be a further increase as this year progresses.  However, our tourism statistics are inaccurate.  The wrong system is being used to calculate the number of tourists coming here and it does not reflect the correct level of tourism to this country.  In so far as the £20 million we are voting here tonight provides for staff to go out and calculate tourism statistics, I say to the Minister that they should be given a different way of doing this job.  They should be given a more factual brief and be allowed to calculate tourism on the actual number of tourists coming here.  It is not fair to them that they should have to use the present system.</P>
    <P>The <i>CSO Guide to Publications and Information Services</i> under the heading &ldquo;Volume 6 &mdash; An Ghaeilge/Irish Language&rdquo; states:</P>
    <P>This volume gives the number and percentage, distinguishing males and females, of Irish speakers in each province, county and county borough classified by age group and highest type of educational establishment attended full-time with separate information for the Gaeltacht areas of each county The number of Irish speakers is expressed as a percentage of the total in each group and are also classified by occupation.  Additional information on a household basis is also provided. </P>
    <P>In so far as we are spending money in <Col N="229" /> compiling, computerising and processing information about the number of people who can speak Irish, I would have to say that the present statistical information is very ambiguous, open to over and understatement and does not properly calculate the ability of people to speak Irish. This is an issue which needs to be reexamined because &mdash; if I am permitted a passing remark &mdash; the future of the Irish language lies in Dublin and other urban areas and not so much in the Gaeltacht. There is a mushrooming of all-Irish primary schools in our capital city and we need to more accurately calculate the statistics in relation to Irish so that we can provide the necessary secondary schools as pupils come on stream.  I do not believe the present figures allow for this.</P>
    <P>I want to mention in passing the early release of unemployment figures last year.  Even though a thorough investigation was carried out it was never discovered from where the leak emanated. This leak of information benefited some people on the Stock Exchange and those who were able to take advantage of the early announcement of those figures. It is worrying that the leak could not be traced.  If we are voting £20 million for the Central Statistics Office, this House is entitled to believe that if there is a recurrence of this type of leak or if there is any other leak it should be possible to trace it.  The numbers of people who have availability of information on pre-publication basis should be such that it is easy to trace a leak.  This is an area of concern and one which should not go without mention in this House.  If statistics of the kind in question can benefit people financially that should give rise to those figures being jealously guarded and protected and to any leaks being easily pursued.</P>
    <P>I want to make one appeal.  In the use of the moneys we are voting for statistical research persons, temporary field staff and people who are in any way involved <Col N="230" /> on a temporary or other basis in employment in the Central Statistics Office, sufficient priority is not being given to unemployed persons.  There is a large number of unemployed who would be very happy to have one of these 3,500 temporary field staff jobs which the Minister referred to in his opening remarks. Most of the time those jobs are given to people who got them last year or the year before, some of whom already have jobs or are married to people who have good jobs.  Given the present high rate of unemployment, we should make a very special effort to include the maximum possible number of unemployed people in the 3,500 temporary field staff when they are being recruited.  That should be to the forefront of our planning and our consideration when we are taking on these staff.</P>
    <P>I have made some critical remarks about what I consider to be weaknesses in the compilation of statistics, weaknesses which need to be strengthened.  As main Opposition spokesman in an adversarial system, that is my duty.  Nonetheless, I would not wish to take from the good work being done by the Central Statistics Office, which is greatly appreciated.  I do not want to take from their great efforts, and I compliment them on the efforts they make to keep their work confidential and on the manner in which they go about modernising their work.  Where there are weaknesses they need to be put right and where there are shortcomings they need to be redressed.  I trust the Minister will take account of the areas I have mentioned in this context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House very long.  I congratulate the staff and the officers of the Central Statistics Office.  All political groupings use statistics provided by the CSO so we are indebted to them.  The most common monthly live register figures, released particularly over the last three consecutive months, have shown an increase in the numbers joining dole queues.  These <Col N="231" /> monthly figures drive home the stark realities of where Irish society is going today under the present Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>Why does the Estimate come so late in the day, particularly the portion to pay for the census that is being carried out? One would have imagined that as the census was planned by the Department, the costs would have been built into the budget of last year so that it would be more than adequately catered for when the enumerators undertook the task for the Central Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask about the method of recruiting the 3,500 field staff.  There is much confusion, particularly in the Dublin region, as to how the people who arrived on our doorsteps were recruited. Can the Minister of State tell us it is all above board and that some form of favouritism is not shown to people in contact with the Central Statistics Office? Perhaps he would give us a breakdown of the method of recruiting these people, particularly the 1,500 who are being retained for the census of agriculture which is badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister tell us how successful the census has been?  We are told that the majority of the one million census forms have now been collected by the census enumerators.  That is very encouraging but it is what would have been expected. Will the Central Statistics Office be pointing out areas which proved to be very difficult in terms of getting returns?  It is my information that there are parts of our city where enumerators would have had some difficulty in getting the co-operation that would be expected from citizens of the State.  For obvious reasons, some people feel threatened by officialdom and by the questions on the census form.  Will the Central Statistics Office give a breakdown of areas that have proved particularly difficult?  The Minister stated that the whole operation was carried out very smoothly.  I am aware there are areas in which there are factors <Col N="232" /> which are causing difficulties for the Minister for the Environment, not least of which are pit bull terriers and other sizeable dogs that made life very difficult for the enumerators.  If the majority of forms are returned, what happens to those people who refused to make a return even though the enumerator has returned two, three or four times?  Often it is extremely difficult to find people at home.  Obviously, a percentage of people are on the move around the country for various reasons.  I am aware there was a given time by which the form was to be filled in on 21 April.  However, that would not necessarily cover adequately the number of people who are in transit or those who might not be as diligent about filling in forms as citizens would be expected to be.</P>
    <P>The census on this occasion was fairly lightweight in the number of questions asked.  Given that it is a major undertaking and given the labour costs and the number of people involved, is the Minister satisfied that sufficient use is made of the census procedure?  Could not substantially more questions have been asked of a varying range and nature that would have given us a deeper understanding of the structures of Irish society? Presumably the officials felt sufficient questions had been asked.  If you are putting 3,500 people out on the roads in such a major campaign the statistics sought should be more elaborate and the questions more broadly based to bring in further information.</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office are involved in the area of building and construction in that they produce figures showing the average cost of both new and secondhand houses.  Has it ever been a task of the Central Statistics Office to include the net loss of housing stock, particularly in city areas?  Dublin inner city has a huge amount of old housing stock which is falling into disrepair, being purchased under CPOs for road-widening projects or abandoned by elderly owners.  The derelict state of the private <Col N="233" /> housing stock in inner city areas is clearly evident.  Statistics on the loss of residential units, houses or other forms of accommodation such as rooms over shops would be as interesting and important as the number of new houses built in the inner city.</P>
    <P>The monthly employment statistics are very important but by their nature they do not give a true picture of employment and unemployment.  I hope one day we will hear that the numbers in employment are up and the numbers of unemployed are down.  Would it not be fairer to include among the unemployed those on early-retirement pensions?  It is farcical that the Government seem to have recognised 58 years as the age to which one works, as against the traditional old age pension age of 65.  The Minister for Social Welfare has reduced to 58 years the eligibility threshold for early-retirement pensions. People who sign on at labour exchanges are counted as unemployed because they are on the live register.  That register does not, however, give a full picture because 5,000 people are involved in pre-retirement schemes.  Would it not be more honest to include these people in the numbers of unemployed along with those signing on at labour exchanges? Members of the workforce in short-term employment or involved in FAS schemes should also be included.  The figures can easily be manipulated or incorrectly assessed if these people are excluded from the numbers of unemployed.</P>
    <P>I have asked a series of questions rather than make any serious criticisms.  Perhaps the Minister will give some answers to the questions I have raised.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Tá an díospóireacht seo an-oiriúnach toisc go bhfuil an CSO i mbun na hoibre faoin daonáireamh atá ar siúl faoi láthair.  Is dócha nach mbeadh maitheas ar bith i mbailiúchán na bhfoirmeacha mura mbeadh an CSO ann chun achoimre a dhéanamh ar na figúirí ata bailithe.  Chuir sé áthas agus ionadh orm nuair a dúirt an <Col N="234" /> tAire go mbeadh an achoimre réidh i mí Iúil na bliana seo, agus tá moladh ag dul don CSO as ucht an obair thábhachtach sin a dhéanamh chomh tapa.</P>
      <P>It is a compliment to the CSO that they can produce these figures by July.  It is marvellous that the figures will not gather dust in some office until the end of the year.  I pay tribute to the staff of the CSO, of whose existence I was for a long time unaware.  Of late I have been contacting them for facts and figures.</P>
      <P>Inflation figures are very important.  In 1981 the figure was 20.4 per cent but by 1986 it had fallen to 3.9 per cent and in 1987 it was 3.2 per cent.  These figures should be known by every Government Minister because they continually claim credit for getting inflation under control. The difficult part was to get down from 20 per cent to 3 per cent.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Statistics are a very important indicator of inflation.  I often quote from <i>The Deserted Village.</i>  The children laughed with counterfeited glee at all the school-master's jokes but then they saw the frown on his face.  I knew you were coming for me.</P>
      <P>We are familiar with the phrase &ldquo;lies, damned lies and statistics&rdquo;.  It would be a pity if the CSO were producing statistics which were worse than lies.  It is important that they should have the best research facilities and full backing for their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised to learn that the farm survey was carried out by post.  Perhaps that is the customary method but I would be doubtful about getting accurate returns by post.  We are all inclined to leave things aside and not fill in forms. There may be a tendency to exaggerate or minimise the size of farms or stock. The fact that only 80 per cent make <Col N="235" /> returns is an indication that this is not an ideal form of survey.</P>
    <P>The 1926 legislation setting up the CSO provided for a guarantee of confidentiality. The importance of this was highlighted during the recent census and there were several discussions about it on radio.  Some people are very sensitive about age, education and the work they do and it is important that they have confidence that their privacy will be guaranteed in the compilation of these statistics.</P>
    <P>The enumerators not only deserve to be well paid but also deserve to get a gold medal at the end of the day.  Perhaps the Minister would consider rewarding the enumerators who face all kinds of hazards apart from dogs.  It can be a very difficult job when people are awkward to deal with.  Deputy Byrne referred to enumerators having to go back to a dwelling three or four times.  I have heard of enumerators having to go back eight times because people have been uncooperative about giving information.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is independence from political pressure in the setting up of the CSO is very important.  It would not be acceptable if Governments were able to distort or suppress figures.  When the CSO issue figures they should be the correct figures in their view, and nobody should change them.  If I look for figures I should be given the same figures as would be given to the Minister or anybody else.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell mentioned tourism.  I am concerned about the accuracy of our tourism figures.  Whether one is counting the number of people going to a football match or going on holidays it should be done properly.  We are sometimes given fictitious figures in relation to the number of people visiting Ireland.  I have discovered that figures on the live register can be different from labour force figures. This is a matter that the Central Statistics Office deal with quite well.  If like is compared with like it should not matter much <Col N="236" /> from where we receive the figures. People who want to know what the trend is and how things are going may look for figures from the live register, but maybe the labour force figures are more accurate. I had an argument with the Central Statistics Office on one occasion because I felt their figures for the labour force were incorrect.  Perhaps the problem arose with the way the survey was conducted, but that is a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I am glad that forms handed out by enumerators are not left hanging around in dusty boxes and also that, having received the results of a census, the Central Statistics Office publish the figures.  Some people amuse themselves immensely by studying statistics, and it is important that this information be given to the public.</P>
    <P>I am glad £20 million, an increase of 12.7 per cent, is being given to the CSO. I assume the extra money will go mainly towards the census of population and the census for agriculture.  It would be a very sad day if the CSO were short of money. They should be asked to do only what they can do efficiently and well.  They should not be asked to take short cuts which would result in inaccurate figures being given.  I welcome this Estimate and I pay tribute to the CSO.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who have contributed to the debate and put forward suggestions and proposals.  All the points made will be considered and kept in mind.  I will first refer to the retired director of the Central Statistics Office, Mr. Thomas P. Linehan, whom I did not mention in my opening speech.  I am delighted Deputy Mitchell referred to Mr. Linehan, who joined the CSO in 1949 on the first day of its establishment. He gave tremendous service to the CSO.  He was appointed director in 1967 and for over 24 years served with distinction both nationally and internationally. He also served as chairman of <Col N="237" /> the Conference of European Statisticians at the UN.  He was honoured with the award of a Schuman medal from the European Commission in November last in appreciation of his contribution to European Community statistics.  He has certainly served with distinction, and I am delighted Members referred to that fact.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell was concerned that we are not compensated financially for statistical information given under European Community requirements.  We expect to receive £1.1 million from the European Community in acknowledgment of the work carried out internationally in relation to information given under European requirements.  In the course of their work the CSO certainly use all available documents and information available in the compilation of their statistics.  Live register unemployment statistics, to which Deputy Byrne referred, statistics on births, deaths and marriages motor car registration and external trade, all data received by the CSO, are treated in strict confidence.  There is no question of that confidentiality being breached.  There has never been any evidence of that and I assure the House that that position will continue.</P>
      <P>We as a Government have been very forthcoming over the last number of years in complementing EC funding.  As all Deputies will agree, it is vitally important that the best possible statistics be made available to the House.  Government set their plans for the future on figures made available, and if statistics are inaccurate planning for the future will be affected.  Inaccurate information is of no value to anybody.  It is a waste of time and money.  The Government do not dilute or interfere with figures for their own political purposes.  It would be of no benefit to any Government to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the field force.  The following number of posts have been filled: five census liaison officers, 30 regional supervisors, 299 field <Col N="238" /> supervisors and 3,200 enumerators.  All the posts in question were advertised in the press and also in the local employment offices of the Department of Social Welfare to encourage suitable persons on the live register to apply.  The advertisements indicated that preference would be given to those not in paid employment.  Senior CSO staff either conducted or chaired the interview boards which selected the supervisory grades.  The temporary supervisors in turn interviewed applicants for the enumerator posts.  The CSO made the enumerator appointments following detailed examination of returns from the various interview boards.  About 800 of the 3,500 part-time jobs were filled by applicants who were on the live register.  It might be argued that that is a small percentage, but in the 1986 census preference was given to suitable persons who were on the live register but following an action taken against the CSO by an unsuccessful applicant an equality officer found that, under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, such preference discriminated against married women.  It was agreed in advance on this occasion that to give preference to those not in paid employment would not discriminate against married women.  I should like to emphasise that the selection procedure is based entirely on merit, but every encouragement is given to people on the live register to apply.  If they are suitably qualified they will be employed on the basis of merit and qualification.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell also referred to the appointment of a director.  The 1985 White Paper proposed the appointment of a director in the manner suggested by Deputy Mitchell.  The new legislation will address that important point, but the House may be assured that whatever method is chosen the selection will be absolutely impartial and in keeping with the standing and profile of the post.  In fact, it will enhance, if that is possible, the independence of the office in statistical matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> Deputy Byrne expressed concern that in some areas, and I imagine that he had some areas in his constituency in mind, there may be unsatisfactory co-operation in the completion of census forms.  The CSO have found through experience that even the most difficult households in terms of complying with the requirements of the census eventually comply after very patient explanation on the part of the enumerator.  The whole ethos of the census is to seek and obtain co-operation from the public.  The experience of the CSO has been that such co-operation has been forthcoming.  There has never been a need to employ any other method in order to obtain compliance. The experience of those involved in the CSO has been excellent in that regard.  I should like to place on record the appreciation of the CSO to the public for the co-operation and support the CSO received at all times to ensure that an accurate census is compiled and that the figures produced can be accepted as being completely accurate.</P>
    <P>A very important activity of the CSO is the production of statistics on employment, unemployment and the labour force.  As I pointed out, the live register is a very valuable short-term indicator of the unemployment trend between the results of successive annual labour force surveys.  However, because of the complexity of its administrative regulations and contribution additions, it should never be regarded as an objective measure of the absolute level of unemployment. Participants of pre-retirement schemes have already declared themselves as being retired and they are, therefore, properly excluded from the live register.  Deputies will understand that although the live register does provide a very good short-term indicator of unemployment figures, the labour force survey has in the past always proved to be the most reliable pointer.  I express there the viewpoint expressed over the years by CSO officers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> I should like to thank Deputies who contributed to the debate and officers of the Central Statistics Office for the very valuable contribution they have made over the years.  Theirs is not a very easy task.  It is one that becomes more difficult as, with the advance of technology and so on, greater demands and greater requirements are put on them.  The Central Statistics Office have filled their role in a very satisfactory way and I should like to record the Government's thanks to them.</P>

One could describe the town as a new version of the old wild west, with hundreds of horses roaming the streets and the town environs, destroying property, damaging crops, breaking ditches and fences and so on.  During the last four weeks, Enniscorthy has been completely overrun by itinerant's horses.  Landowners and householders have been intimidated, harrassed and abused by the owners of the horses.  The Kirwan family, who have a small 50 acre holding, have had their farm destroyed by these horses. The people responsible totally disregard the law and, despite the best efforts of the county council, the urban council and the Garda, the situation is completely out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for new legislation to control such animals.  The owners of horses should have them registered and <Col N="241" /> tagged with owner identification and they should have to prove that they own the land on which they keep the horses.  One person owns up to 100 of the horses in Enniscorthy but owns no land.  He can maintain the horses in first-class condition at the expense of others in the Enniscorthy area.  The Minister should take immediate action to have the horses rounded up, to have the owners arrested and compelled to pay for the damage caused.</P>
    <P>The people of Enniscorthy are fed up to the teeth with this situation.  The problem has been ongoing for the last number of years but it got worse in the last few months.  It is time the Minister stepped in and amended the legislation to make sure that people with animals are made responsible for them and to ensure that gardaí can take immediate action to impound stray horses and charge the owners the appropriate costs involved.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for raising this matter and allowing me some of his time.  The devastation that has been visited upon some of the local farmers in Enniscorthy is unacceptable.  One can imagine having a crop of corn destroyed by 17 or 18 horses.  Only last year a young infant girl in a housing estate was kicked by a horse.  The residents of Enniscorthy are fed up.  The gardaí should be empowered to ensure that the owners of the horses are not above the law and that the horses be impounded and dealt with. There should be legislation to ensure that a person who owns a horse must register it and registration should not be granted unless a person has land which is either rented or owned on which to put the horse.  The real problem is that the horses are of no fixed abode.  They are allowed out on the road to roam and are causing untold damage.  The Government Departments should take this seriously and come forward with legislation to deal comprehensively with the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for <Col N="242" /> the absence of the Minister for Justice, who is unavoidably absent.  I will take this debate on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to outline to the House the limits and the extent of the responsibility of the Minister for Justice in relation to wandering animals. I will begin by defining the situation and then I will deal with the specific issues outlined by both Deputies about the problem in Enniscorthy.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has a narrow statutory function in relation to the impounding by local authorities of wandering animals.  Essentially, that function relates to directing local authorities to provide pounds and to fixing the various fees which the pounds charge the owners of impounded animals.  I also have responsibility for certain aspects of the general law of tort.  This includes the legislative provisions in regard to civil liability for damage caused by animals.</P>
      <P>The law in relation to wandering animals was updated in recent years by the enactment of the Animals Act, 1985.  This Act covers the question of impounding in three ways.  First, it gives increased powers to local authorities and the Garda to impound animals.  Second, it improves the effectiveness of the impounding procedure by giving local authorities power to order the sale, disposal or destruction, where appropriate, of impounded animals.  Third, it increased substantially the fines for turning animals loose or allowing them on the public road and for poundbreaking.  This Act also abolished the then immunity of occupiers of land adjoining the public road in relation to damage caused by animals straying on to the road.  As a result, ordinary laws of negligence now apply in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the issue raised by the Deputy about the situation in Enniscorthy.  The Garda authorities told the Minister that a large number of horses owned by members of the travelling community are grazing on <Col N="243" /> lands owned by the local authority and private individuals in the vicinity of the town.  Because this land is unfenced, the horses are able to move on to the public roadway and trespass on private property in the area.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed the Minister that both the local Garda and staff of the local authority have impounded horses which have wandered from this land on numerous occasions in the recent past.  In fact, both hauliers from the area and outside the area have on occasion been used to transport these horses to the local pound.  The Garda have also prosecuted the owners of these horses, where they have been able to establish ownership, on several occasions.  The Minister also understands that the local Garda have assisted landowners and householders in the area in impounding horses and in obtaining compensation for damage caused by these horses to their property.</P>
    <P>The Garda have been extremely active in tackling the problems of wandering horses in Enniscorthy.  They have assured the Minister that they will continue to deal with this problem as best they can. However, the solution to the problem does not rest solely with the Garda.  The owners of the land, including the local authority, would appear to have a responsibility to fence off their property to prevent these horses from wandering onto the public road or adjacent land. There is also the question of the council hiring hauliers at short notice to enable them to impound these animals.</P>
    <P>The setting of pound fees is the Minister's responsibility.  The 1985 Animals Act enables him to raise these by regulation. The fees have already been raised from paltry amounts to the present charge of £23 per day for the upkeep of each horse impounded.  Owners of impounded horses are now required to pay a minimum of £23 when they retrieve their animals from the pound.  In addition to the pound fees, the owners of <Col N="244" /> impounded horses also face transportation costs when they retrieve their animals from the pound.  Depending on the circumstances of the impoundment, these can be substantial.</P>
    <P>The Minister is having the present fee structure for pounds reviewed by my Department.  I assure the Deputies that their comments will be given the utmost attention by the Minister, who has promised to make an additional effort to try to deal with this problem.  It is an unusual problem in that it happens to this significant degree; for that reason I accept that existing legislation is inadequate to deal with it.  With the co-operation of the Garda and the local authorities, the Minister is anxious to deal more effectively with the problem.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity of raising this important &mdash; and potentially explosive &mdash; issue tonight. Given the seriousness of the problem, I regret that the Minister is unable to be present.</P>
      <P>The problem in regard to education in River Valley is like a broken record, it goes on and on.  However, the parents of the area, an estate with nearly 2,000 houses, do not appreciate this record, particularly as the lessons of the past never seem to be learned or heeded by those in authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for additional classrooms was established in early 1989, it clearly defined a need for eight additional classrooms up to 1993.  On the basis of this information an application was submitted by the board of management of the school to the Department in October 1989.  In a reply received from the Minister in June 1990 &mdash; one year ago &mdash; she confirmed to me that, in the circumstances, she had approved the provision of four standard classrooms and that these would be available as a matter <Col N="245" /> of urgency.  A year has now passed and there does not seem to be any urgency.</P>
    <P>In March 1991 &mdash; about nine months later &mdash; the plans were eventually handed over by her Department to the board of management to enable them to seek planning permission.  These are the bones of the history of the application to date. At the moment there are 220 new applications for admission to the school in September next.  If the four classrooms are not available the school can only accommodate 70 children, leaving no places for 150.  Even if these classrooms are available &mdash; and I hope the Minister can confirm that they will &mdash; only 175 of the 220 children can be admitted.  This is a scandalous situation; it is not as if the information had not been available to the Department to provide the facilities at this location.</P>
    <P>The education of the children in this estate has been disturbed on an ongoing basis over the years, indeed when different Governments were in office.  We witnessed the experiment of a dual day system which had such a disastrous effect on children, teachers and parents.  These children at present are being educated in overcrowded conditions.  They also do not have a library as this most important educational resource is being used as a classroom.  The parents have been very constrained in regard to this issue.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the parents and children of the area, I ask the Minister to guarantee that these places will be available for the children next September.  I ask him, furthermore, to state categorically what type of accommodation will be available. When will the new building commence and what is the projected finishing date? Given the plight of the children in the area and the history of the problem, I ask the Minister and the Department to give this matter priority.  He should also acknowledge that there is a further need for additional accommodation in 1992. We should get our act together and cater for the needs of the children of that area. I hope the Minister of State will tonight <Col N="246" /> give the commitment sought by the parents and teachers.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline my Department's intentions in relation to the provision of an extension consisting of four classrooms for the Holy Family national school, River Valley, Swords, County Dublin.  I am fully aware of the need for extra accommodation in the Swords area.  Unlike other urban and city areas, this area has developed to such an extent that enrolments in the school are such that four classrooms will be needed in September 1991 and four more classrooms are planned for later.  This shows a rapid growth in population despite the national demographic decline in other city areas.</P>
      <P>The present facilities at the Holy Family senior and junior schools consist of 32 classrooms and a general purpose room.  There are 500 pupils on roll in the senior school and 615 pupils in the junior school.  There is a staff of a principal, 15 assistants plus a remedial teacher in the senior school and a staff of a principal, 18 assistants and a remedial teacher in the junior school.</P>
      <P>On 1 June 1990 I gave approval for a four classroom extension to progress to planning stage.  In February 1991 sketch plans were completed and forwarded to the chairman so that planning permission could be obtained from the local authority. Planning permission was received in my Department on 20 May 1991. Tender documents have been completed by the architectural staff.  I assure the Deputy that further progress will be made on this project as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the House that my colleague the Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, has taken a very keen interest in this project and has been in constant touch with me on the urgent necessity to make progress at the Holy Family national school at River Valley.

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried on at least ten occasions to raise this matter in the Dáil and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise it this evening.  I have five minutes in which to outline the serious problems being encountered by the youth service at present and to ask the Minister of State at the Department of Education with special responsibility for youth and sport what he is prepared to do in an effort to solve the deepening financial crisis facing the service.</P>
      <P>At the outset I should like to give the Minister of State some background information. The youth service has been the subject of a variety of policy statements since the mid-seventies.  The Minister of State's bible, according to himself, is the Costello report first published in 1984.  I agree with the Minister of State that this comprehensive and far reaching report should form the basis of our youth service. Notwithstanding this avowal of support for the Costello report and the guarantee given by the Minister of State on taking office that the Costello report would form the basis of the youth service structure, to put it mildly the youth service now find themselves in a financial mess through no fault of their own but rather as a result of mismanagement of the money allocated to the youth service by both the Minister and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1988 the youth service were allocated £10 million, £8 million in 1989, £8.3 million in 1990 and the proposed allocation for 1991 is £9.761 million. While it can be said that increased allocations have been made since 1989, we should have regard to the key 1988 figure, £10 million.  At no stage since then has the allocation exceeded that base figure <Col N="248" /> and it is only now, two and a half years later, that the consequences of not giving the youth service the £10.6 million they need to maintain services at their 1988 level are being felt.  I wish to emphasise that this sum amounts to only half the figure recommended in the Minister of State's bible, the Costello report published in 1984.  At present day values the Costello report would recommend that at least £25 million be allocated to the youth service.</P>
    <P>Another point which has not gone unnoticed on this side of the House is that the allocation for the youth service from national lottery funds dropped from a figure of 27 per cent of the total in 1988 to 17 per cent in 1989 and to a mere 16 per cent in 1990.  Equally, the allocation under the heading sport, recreation and youth decreased from 50 per cent of the total at the end of 1988 to 45 per cent at the end of 1990.  The question I would like to ask the Minister of State is what criteria were used in arriving at these decisions.</P>
    <P>What are the consequences of this lack of sufficient funds for the youth service? First, they will lose 35 staff by the end of the year.  The National Youth Council of Ireland today briefed the Minister of State on this matter but it should be remembered that funds have already been allocated and job losses are imminent.  It would appear, therefore, that face-saving is the order of the day and I challenge the Minister of State to tell us how he is going to solve the problem, rather than what was discussed, given that decisions have already been taken and funds allocated to the youth service.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that it is disadvantaged young people who will have to bear the brunt of the cutbacks and forced job losses.  For example, Voluntary Service International have had to abandon their teenage workcamp programme and Foróige have had to abandon their summer programme and events for this year.  Both programmes were targeted specifically at disadvantaged young <Col N="249" /> people involved in those youth organisations. I expect the Minister of State to say in reply to these charges that the allocation for the youth service has in fact remained unchanged &mdash; I know and accept this to be true &mdash; but he must realise that mainstream youth organisations are to the forefront in providing youth services for disadvantaged young people.  The report on disadvantaged young people commissioned by the Minister in 1988 and undertaken by the National Youth Council of Ireland underlines the comprehensive response of the youth service to young people suffering from socio-economic disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister of State to undertake immediately the following steps&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State should allocate the extra funds that the service need to ensure that they do not lose 35 jobs by the end of 1991.  I have no doubt that the National Youth Council will be able to give the Minister of State the exact figures involved.  I also call on the Minister of State to give youth organisations their youth service grants now. Up to today they had been only allocated 50 per cent of their total allocation for 1991.  This is not good enough.</P>
      <P>I believe that the funding problems being encountered by the youth service could have been avoided if proper planning had been undertaken back in 1988. Furthermore, what does the Minister of State intend to do in relation to the increases guaranteed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> for 1991?  Does he not realise that the workers in the youth service will not get the increase agreed with the social partners? That is a disgrace.  The guarantee given in the programme that youth services will continue to be provided will be reneged on if the Minister of State does not do something and I challenge him to respond on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss in the House this evening the funding for the youth services. The allocation in any one year under the youth service grants scheme takes many factors into account, including the total allocation available for youth services in general and changes in emphasis between services funded through the youth service grants schemes and other schemes, including special schemes for the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>Grants paid to individual organisations under this scheme do not therefore necessarily represent the full funding available to them in the youth service programme nor do they fully reflect the priorities set out within the programme as a whole for the provision of services. In allocating resources for 1991 my Department have continued with the realignment of priorities as between the youth service grant scheme and other schemes.  Any reductions in the grants to individual organisations under the scheme are a reflection of this reordering of priorities and do not in themselves represent a value judgment in absolute terms on the services provided by those organisations.</P>
      <P>I am holding an ongoing series of consultative meetings with national youth organisations to discuss funding allocations generally.  These discussions will have particular regard to flexibility between various budget headings while maintaining an emphasis on disadvantaged youth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly concerned also that employment level in the youth service will be maintained at the maximum level possible conductive with the delivery of <Col N="251" /> the most effective service possible within the resources available.  In this regard there is a need for positive open exploration among youth organisations of means to improve co-ordination and co-operation. Competing and overlapping headquarters structures which lead to duplication in training, computerisation, secretarial facilities, accountancy, publication and maintenance costs could well be integrated, for example, without loss of the independent identity and ethos of the various volunteer networks which they serve.</P>
    <P>It should not go unsaid, indeed, that the 1991 allocation for youth services of £9.8 million is £6.041 million, that is 260 per cent greater than the expenditure of £3.765 million in 1987.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

There is absolutely no difference whatsoever.</P>

Let me say that I am deeply concerned about the fact that we have had to make cutbacks despite the fact that we had £1 million over and above what we had last year.  The fact remains that we now have almost £10 million as compared with £3.7 million when the Deputy's party left Government in 1987.</P>

      <P>In late 1990 the Minister for the Marine made an order revoking the 1975 agreement between the Department of Communications &mdash; then the appropriate Department &mdash; and the farmers' local development association and the golf club in Ballybunion which allowed individuals to take sand from the beach in Ballybunion under certain conditions.  As these conditions were not being complied with the Minister, after considerable pressure, made a prohibition order last year.  However, it was later discovered that a licence existing since 1977 allowed two individual farmers to take sand from the beach.  This was not covered by the order made in October. This licence has given rise to the problem and the indecision of the <Col N="254" /> Department of the Marine, which allows the beach to remain open and sand to be taken at present.</P>
      <P>The local people are very concerned. Ballybunion beach lost its blue flag last year and failed to regain it this year because of bad beach management.  This is a serious blow to the morale of the people of Ballybunion village, which has suffered a decline over the past ten years. The people are fighting back and doing their best.

      <P>Is mian liom tagairt don díospóireacht sa Teach seo ar 20 Feabhra a chuaigh thart. Ag an am sin chuir mé béim ar an bfíric go raibh mé buartha mar gheall ar dhaoine bheith ag tabhairt gainimh ón trá ag Ballybunion agus go mbeinnse ag iarraidh fuascailt na faidhbe seo a fháil.</P>
      <P>I pointed out that in accordance with the provisions of the Foreshore Prohibition of Removal of Beach Material (No. 2) Order, 1980, which was made by me on 1 November 1990 and to which the Deputy referred, removal of beach material from the area in question is prohibited at all times, save in accordance with a licence issued under the Foreshore Act, 1933.  The order does not, as I indicated to the House on 20 February, invalidate the foreshore licence granted in 1977 to the trustees of the committee of the farmers of six parishes in North Kerry.  That licence authorises the removal of beach material from Ballybunion, subject to certain conditions, and is due to expire on 31 December 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the licence and in relation to the state of the beach generally, I have received various statements alleging breaches of the terms of the licence.  I have accordingly notified the solicitors representing the trustees that I propose to revoke the licence in question.  The <Col N="255" /> licensees were given 21 days in which to respond to the notice and this response has now been received in my Department. I am assessing this response in consultation with the Attorney General before making a final decision on the <Col N="256" /> matter.  The Deputy will appreciate that I may add nothing further at this stage and that I aim to be in a position to reach a decision as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 29 May 1991.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which problems in obtaining motor insurance cover can cause in particular cases.  Because of these difficulties and the awareness of the problems that can arise, arrangements exist within the insurance industry to assist in such situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Motor insurers have advised my Department that there is no question of their discriminating against members of the travelling community in terms of the availability of motor insurance.  The Irish Insurance Federation have stated that their information service provides assistance to motorists, including members of the travelling community, having difficulties in obtaining cover.  Such insurance is available through the declined cases committee.  This committee, established under the declined cases agreement, is comprised of representatives of the authorised motor insurance companies.  It examines cases <Col N="42" /> referred to it where motorists have been declined cover by five or more insurance companies, and nominates a company to quote for the risk involved.  Before a case can be submitted to this committee for consideration it is necessary to approach and obtain written letters of refusal from five insurance companies.  These should then be referred to the Irish Insurance Federation, Russell House, Russell Court, St. Stephen's Green, Dublin 2 indicating the order in which they were approached together with details of any previous insurance held in the last three years.</P>

      <Quest>whether his attention has been drawn to the extreme difficulties created for small companies by reason of the sudden withdrawal of the short term export credit scheme; and if he will either arrange for a continuation of the scheme for small companies or its replacement by another export credit financing support scheme specially designed for small companies.</Quest>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to my recent decision to phase out the short term finance scheme under which guarantees are issued to commercial banks in respect of exports insured under the export credit insurance scheme. These guarantees have enabled commercial banks to advance short term finance to companies holding policies of export credit insurance in respect of goods or services exported on credit terms normally not exceeding one year. Exporters who currently avail of such guarantees have been notified of my decision to phase out the scheme.  Those whose guarantees expire within a short period have been told that, on expiry, their guarantees may be extended for a limited period to allow them to make alternative financing arrangements for their exports.  In no case have guarantee facilities been withdrawn suddenly from an exporting company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> My decision to phase out the short term finance scheme was prompted to a large extent by the relatively low usage of the scheme among Irish exporters and by my belief that short term finance can be provided to exporters by commercial banks without recourse to State guarantees.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years, only about 20 to 35 exporters out of a total of approximately 450 exporters holding policies of export credit insurance have availed of short term finance guarantees at any one time.  The scheme therefore has not played a significant role in export development and I am satisfied that its discontinuance will not adversely affect Irish exporters, be they large, medium sized or small, and that exporters in general will be able to benefit from the increasing array of facilities available from the financial services sector.</P>

      <P>PRISMA is an EC Commission initiative which will be jointly financed by the EC and members states. It is intended to help small and medium enterprises in Objective 1 Regions adapt to the completion of the Internal Market The main priorities are the development of certification and testing infrastructures, particularly calibration and metrology services, and public procurement.</P>
      <P>A draft operational programme setting out criteria for eligibility under the PRISMA initiative is at present being prepared by my Department.  I hope to submit the draft to the EC Commission for approval in June.  It is proposed, when the draft operational programme is approved by the EC Commission, to assess eligibility of all proposals received, based on the approved criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission have indicated that Ireland may benefit by up to 9 MECU, <Col N="44" /> approximately £7 million, under the PRISMA initiative depending on the quality of the proposals made.  It is likely that the bulk of the EC support will be available in 1992 and 1993 rather than in the current year.</P>

      <P>Honorary consuls are appointed essentially to respond to a need for the provision of consular services for a significant body of Irish citizens in a particular country or region and to promote Irish economic interests in the area.  Ideally, the person appointed should be well established and be of good repute in the <Col N="51" /> area in question.  He or she should be known to the Irish community and to the local administration, and should have business connections which would be beneficial to Irish economic interests. The successful candidate would normally be the one, among those interested in the position, who is considered to come closest to this ideal.  Not all of our honorary consuls are Irish but, other things being equal, preference would normally be given to a suitably qualified candidate of Irish nationality or background.</P>
      <P>Candidates are invited to complete a standard application form.  Their background is then verified and they are interviewed by the Department or by the appropriate Irish Embassy.  When a decision is made as to which of the applicants appears best suited for the position, the consent of the host government is sought and when that has been obtained, I make the appointment.</P>
      <P>As indicated in this House on 1 May this year, I am currently considering candidates to fill the vacant post of Honorary Consul of Ireland in Peru.  All applications received to date are being examined on their merits and applications from other suitable candidates would be welcome. Any representations received on behalf of a particular candidate will be borne in mind when I come to make the decision on the honorary consul appointment in question.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer is in receipt of two pensions, a social welfare contributory pension and an occupational pension in respect of her late husband's employment in Coillte Teoranta.  Both pensions are taxable. <Col N="52" /> There has been no reduction in either pension and in fact the social welfare pension will be increased in July.</P>
      <P>The social welfare pension is paid gross, i.e., without deduction of tax, and the tax attributable to it is collected by reducing the taxpayer's tax-free allowances against her occupational pension. The increase in the social welfare pension will result in an increased tax liability for 1991-92.  Accordingly, the tax-free allowances against the taxpayer's occupational pension have been reduced, in order to collect the increased liability in a manner evenly spread throughout the tax year. As a result, the net, i.e., after-tax occupational pension received by her has been reduced.  The taxpayer is being correctly taxed on the occupational pension in excess of £209 per annum, i.e., £17.41 per month.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the monitoring and control of absenteeism in the public service is a matter for local management, local authorities, health boards, Garda Síochána, etc., and data on absenteeism throughout the public service is not recorded centrally.  However, the nonindustrial Civil Service for which I have direct responsibility numbered about 27,300 on 1 January 1991 and on the basis of a survey carried out in 1986 it is estimated that approximately 3.3 per cent &mdash; 2.7 per cent certified, 0.6 per cent uncertified &mdash; of working days per person are lost annually due to sickness in the Civil Service.  I have no information on the actual number of medical certificates issued.</P>

      <P>The Killery River enters the Bonet at a point downstream of Dromahair, County Leitrim.  In the preparation of the Bonet catchment drainage scheme a number of these downstream areas were excluded for practical and economic reasons.  During the course of scheme works a number of representations were made on behalf of the landowners concerned to have this river included in the scheme and it was decided to re-examine the feasibility of carrying out some works in the area when the scheduled works of the scheme had been completed.</P>
      <P>Early indications for a scheme of works were relatively promising and it was decided to process the matter further. However, more recently it has proved necessary to re-examine the scheme as a whole on environmental and economic grounds, and this review is expected to be completed shortly.</P>

      <P>While I am aware of the caution with which insurance companies quote for motor insurance to those aged under 25 years as a result of their claims experience for this age group, I do not accept that there is any general refusal to quote for cover.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind the Deputy of what I have said in this House on numerous occasions, in that, as the insurance supervisory authority, I have a responsibility to ensure that insurance companies meet their statutory solvency and reserve requirements.  I do not have responsibility for the day to day operations of insurance companies.  Therefore, I must respect the right of insurance companies to make their own underwriting decisions in the light of their particular circumstances and assessment of the market.  No legal obligation can be placed on any individual insurer to quote in respect of any risk, to quote at any particular premium or to quote in any particular manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where motorists, including young drivers, are refused quotes for insurance, cover is available through the declined cases committee.  This committee, established under the declined cases agreement, is comprised of representatives of the authorised motor insurance companies. It examines cases which have been declined by five or more motor insurance companies and nominates one of the companies to quote for the risk involved.  Before a case can be submitted to this committee for consideration, it is necessary to approach and obtain written refusals from five motor insurance companies. These should then be forwarded to the Declined Cases Committee, Irish Insurance Federation, Russell House, Russell Court, St. Stephen's Green, Dublin 2 indicating the order in which they were approached, together with details of previous insurance, if any, held <Col N="62" /> in the last three years.  It should then be possible to have the necessary cover arranged and thus ensure that motorists can comply with their legal obligation to have motor insurance.</P>

      <P>However, the annual returns which insurers provide in the context of my statutory function as the insurance supervisory authority, indicate that in 1989 the average cost per claim incurred by motor insurers was £3,921.  The equivalent figure for public liability insurance was £4,836.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would add that it is clear that the cost of personal injury claims, including compensation paid to claimants and legal costs associated with such claims, is a significant factor in the overall level of <Col N="63" /> motor and liability insurance costs.  The inter-ministerial group on motor insurance, comprising of the Ministers for Justice, Environment, the Attorney General and myself, have been examining ways and means of improving the environment for motor insurance in particular.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>The data available to my Department relating to school leavers is derived from the annual survey on the economic status of school-leavers, conducted by the economic and research institute on behalf of the Department.  The results of the survey are based on a national sample of approximately 2,000 leavers drawn from the estimated total of 67,000 who leave second-level education annually.  The survey does not cover those leaving primary or third level education.</P>
      <P>As the survey traces the career paths of leavers approximately one year after they have left school the relevant data regarding school leavers for the academic year 1989-1990 are not yet available.  The fieldwork to trace the career paths of this cohort has only begun.  The results will not be available until the end of the year.</P>

      <P>My Department are continuing their examination of the means of implementing the recommendation in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that the live register requirements in the case of women applicants should be relaxed to facilitate women who wish to return to the workforce.

    <P>I am satisfied that FÁS are making significant progress in the area of training <Col N="65" /> for women who are eligible to participate under current eligibility requirements. One of the aims of its positive action programme in favour of women is to encourage them to take up the full range of training opportunities available, particularly in non-traditional areas. Their participation has increased from 34 per cent in 1986 to 41.4 per cent of all those completing training in 1990 and it is hoped to make further progress during 1991-92.  CERT also have a return to work course which is aimed at mature people interested in returning to work.</P>

      <P>A great variety of arrangements currently exist in the public sector in relation to employees who are elected to local authorities. Civil servants above clerical grades are required to resign on standing for election to a local authority.  Virtually all employees in semi-State bodies are free to engage in political activities including standing for election to and sitting on local authorities.  In all other areas, the arrangements are based on custom and practice, but generally public servants are granted leave of absence on election to local authorities.  In most other areas, employees are granted unpaid leave of absence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no legislative requirements in relation to this matter for private sector employment.  Normally, employers and employees, on the basis of good sense within the employment relationship, work out mutually suitable arrangements to allow for any time off needed by the employee in connection with candidature for or membership of the local authority. In general, the matter raised by the Deputy does not appear to cause a widespread problem and would not warrant <Col N="66" /> legislation.  Members of local authorities have been drawn from a great variety of employments and the absence of legislative provisions in this area does not appear to have impeded individuals from coming forward for election.</P>

      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme enables the long-term unemployed aged 21 or over, to attend a leaving certificate type course while continuing to receive an allowance equivalent to their unemployment payments. This scheme was originally administered by my Department and was known as the education opportunities scheme.  Since January 1990, the scheme has been administered and funded and allowances paid by the Department of Education.  The scheme is principally financed through the European Social Fund.</P>
      <P>I have made separate arrangements with the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee for places to be made available under the vocational preparation and training programme to the long-term unemployed.  Under that programme the long-term unemployed can attend education courses while continuing to receive a payment equivalent to their unemployment assistance entitlement. Payment is made on a weekly basis by the VEC who are reimbursed by my Department.</P>
      <P>There are certain differences between the two schemes, particularly in relation to the payment of additional expenses to participants.  My Department are at present involved in discussions with the Department of Education with a view to standardising the arrangements under the two schemes.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed by a deciding officer with effect from 16 April 1991.  The grounds on which this decision was based were that, by failing to make himself available for interview and furnish details of his means to a social welfare officer, the person concerned had failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit for receipt of a qualification certificate which would entitle him to apply for payment of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>He appealed against this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office and his case has been referred back to the social welfare officer to allow the person concerned a further opportunity of being interviewed and disclosing his means.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that lone parents should be given every encouragement to take up paid employment where it is possible for them to do so.</P>
      <P>Existing provisions already take into account the situation of lone parents who continue to work, while raising a family. For example, in assessing the means of persons claiming the lone parent's allowance, all reasonable child-minding and travel to work expenses are allowable and are not assessed as means.  In addition, the widow's contributory pension continues to be payable where the claimant is working.</P>
      <P>I am considering what further measures might be taken to facilitate lone parents in taking up employment.  The role of the family income supplement scheme will be taken into account in that context.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the reported £13 million national coronary prevention plan which has been proposed by the Irish Heart Foundation and which has been the subject of discussions between the Department and the foundation.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have expressed publicly on many occasions that smoking, unhealthy dietary habits, stress, lack of exercise and the abuse of alcohol have been identified as the major risk factors to the health status of the population.  The Irish Heart Foundation's draft national coronary prevention plan also implicates these risk factors and describes the dramatic changes in coronary heart disease mortality in other countries in recent years.</P>
      <P>I met with representatives of the foundation recently to discuss their draft plan and I expressed my support in principle for the plan and the general thrust of its content.  I recommended that the plan be submitted to the Advisory Council on Health Promotion for consideration.  The foundation have recently submitted the plan to the council.  It is appropriate that the advisory council consider this plan as it is the national body which provides advice to me on health promotion matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the core issue of implementation, the plan considers that the Kilkenny Health Project should serve as <Col N="88" /> the prototype for a nationwide programme for coronary heart disease prevention.</P>
    <P>This pilot project which is largely funded by the Department's health promotion unit is a demonstration and research project which aims to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease in respect of the people of the city and county of Kilkenny.  Its success in that regards is currently being evaluated and this major evaluation exercise is also being funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>Important strategic decisions will be required following the results of the evaluation of the Kilkenny Health Project, in terms of replication on a national scale, organisation and implementation of any national programme and the resoucing of any such programme.  To explore these strategic issues my Department engaged the Health Policy Research Centre of the ESRI to examine the potential of such a model for positively influencing lifestyle on a national basis and the implications of organising a lifestyle programme within the existing care delivery structure having regard to such matters as feasibility and cost effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Our policy on a national lifestyle programme within the existing health board structures will largely be influenced by the outcome of this research.</P>
    <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that we are already actively tackling the various risks factors for cardiovascular disease.  In relation to smoking we have comprehensive anti-tobacco strategy covering both the legislative and educatinal areas.  In relation to legislation, we have regulated the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products and in May last year we introduced regulations prohibiting or restricting smoking in certain public places.  A working group consisting of representatives of the trade unions, employers, the Irish Cancer Society and my Department are currently examining the possibility of extending these restrictions to the workplace, preferably on a voluntary basis.  On the educational front, separate health education <Col N="89" /> materials dealing, <i>inter alia</i>, with smoking are being developed for use in primary and second level schools.  The health promotion unit also runs an annual multi-media anti-smoking campaign.</P>
    <P>In relation to nutrition, I will be launching very shortly a five year framework for action on nutrition with the aim of improving the nutritional status of the Irish people and reducing the incidence of diet-related diseases.  The implementation strategies for this plan will concern the education of the general public but will also target sub-groups of the population, for instance the young, the elderly and certain disadvantaged groups.</P>
    <P>For adults generally the health promotion unit are promoting the lifewise project, a health education programme which focuses on promoting healthy behaviour.  The programme consists of an exercise routine, stress management training and a health topic.</P>
    <P>At present five health boards and the Irish Countrywomen's Association are participating in the project and arrangements are in train to develop a national structure to oversee its development.</P>
    <P>On the question of the abuse of alcohol the health promotion unit and the National Youth Council are participating in a national drink awareness for youth programme which aims to inform and educate young people in relation to a responsible attitude towards alcohol and its proper use.  To date over 300 youth leaders have been trained under this programme. The unit have also produced a video &ldquo;Handle and Care&rdquo; in conjunction with the Catholic Communications Institute which is accompanied by a comprehensive teaching guide for use in schools.</P>
    <P>On a broader front the Deputy will be aware that the Advisory Council on Health Promotion are currently formulating a national alcohol policy to cover such matters as advertising, education, social and cultural aspects of alcohol together with treatment and management strategies.</P>

    <P>The North Eastern Health Board continue to experience difficulty in recruiting dental surgeons.  The Local Appointments Commission have been asked to fill a number of dental vacancies in the North-Eastern Health Board region and the process will continue until suitable candidates are found.  In the meantime, the North-Eastern Health Board are making continuous efforts to appoint temporary dental surgeons where there are vacancies in the permanent staffing and they are also examining various options in relation to extending the use of services of private dental practitioners. When additional dental personnel become available to the Cavan-Monaghan Community care area, arrangements will be <Col N="91" /> made to provide a dental service in the Clones health centre.</P>

      <P>Details of the number of recorded deaths by suicide during the period 1970-90 are set out in the following table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The table indicates that there have been some considerable fluctuations in the number of recorded suicides over the last decade.  The number reached a peak of 283 in 1986 but fell in the three subsequent years before rising again in 1990. While the figures are significantly higher than those for earlier years, particularly during the early seventies, it is generally <Col N="93" /> accepted that there was a large degree of under-reporting of suicide at that time.</P>
    <P>The problem of obtaining accurate statistics on suicide is recognised internationally. The stigma associated with suicide and a desire to spare relatives further anguish are factors in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> Recent Irish studies in which the Central Statistics Office has co-operated suggest that, in the areas examined, the official Irish statistics understated the actual number of suicides by, at most, 15-20 per cent.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 to 161, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Vehicles used for the carriage of goods with a maximum weight capacity of over 3.5 tons and passenger vehicles with a capacity of more than 17 persons are required to carry tachograph instrumentation and comply with all other provisions outlined in EEC regulations nos. 3820-85 and 3821-85.  Responsibility for statistics on vehicle registrations is a matter for the Department of the Environment which estimate that 27,000 vehicles currently registered in Ireland have tachograph equipment installed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enforcement of these regulations is carried out by a special corps of nine transport officers of my Department and by the Garda Síochána.  All allegations of breaches of the regulations reported to my Department are investigated.  I am satisfied that the ongoing enforcement of these regulations by the transport officers and the Garda Síochána is effective, both in the road haulage and passenger transport sector.  The most recent statistics on the number of prosecutions successfully pursued by my Department in relation to tachograph offences are as follows: 1987-1988, 56; 1988-1989, 169; 1989-1990, 77.  In addition, of course, prosecutions in relation to tachograph offences are continuously pursued by the Garda Síochána.  Responsibility for statistics on such prosecutions is a matter for the Minister for Justice who has advised me that the information sought by the Deputy in respect of prosecutions for tachograph offences initiated by the Garda for the years 1987, 1988 and 1989 is contained in the commissioner's report on crime for these years, copies of which are deposited in the Oireachtas Library. The commissioner's report on crime for <Col N="107" /> 1990 is not yet available.  As far as my Department is aware, no prosecutions in respect of tachograph offences have been taken by Customs and Excise officers.</P>

      <P>As part of their recent package of tariff proposals, Telecom Éireann proposed to reduce call charges for the Eircell service by 10 per cent and rental charges by 20 <Col N="108" /> per cent.  These changes would result in a reduction in revenue of about £3 million in a full year and I asked the company not to implement them as I felt that a reduction in revenue of this order would benefit a greater number of people if applied to reducing trunk call charges and expanding local call areas.</P>
