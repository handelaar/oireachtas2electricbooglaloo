      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 2, 12, 13 17, 3, 18, 19, 20, 21, 4 and 22.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that Nos. 2, 12 and 13 shall be taken without debate; (2) the proceedings on Committee Stage of No. 17, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Justice; (3) the Seanad amendments will be debated together, not more than 30 minutes being allotted to such debate, and the proceedings on the amendments shall be brought to a conclusion by one question.</P>
      <P>Private Members' Business shall be No. 26.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of Item No. 12 which proposes that the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General be referred to the Committee of Public Accounts, there is no objection to that proposal but this item was not discussed at a Whips' meeting.  While we agree that it should be referred to the Committee of Public Accounts, I would like to put down a marker that this should not preclude a debate taking place in the Chamber. We are anxious to request the <Col N="266" /> Taoiseach at the next Whips meeting to have a full debate on that important report in the Chamber at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that item is agreed?  Agreed.  May I ask if the proposal for dealing with No. 17 is satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with the Seanad amendments to the Sea Pollution Bill, 1990 agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the debate which has been promised before the summit at Maastricht takes place in regard to matters that are to be discussed there, may I ask the Taoiseach if he would agree that such a debate should be founded on a motion tabled by the Government in which they state their policy on the subject rather than have a series of bland statements?  May I further ask the Taoiseach if he would agree that this debate should take place very soon in view of the fact that other parliaments in Europe are already giving their governments their views in time to influence the result?  The danger is that our debate here will be so late as to have no influence.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that the local authorities are trying to put together their estimates for this year in the absence of a notification of the rates support grant.  May I ask him when the Government will be in a position to notify the local authorities of the rates support grant?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if either he or the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications will take time to address the House today with regard to the collapse of Century Radio and whether some indication will be given as to what the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications intends to do with regard to future broadcasting policy? May I also ask the Taoiseach if he will advise the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications that any proposal to distribute State revenue through the licence fee will lead this House into major rows similar to those we had a short time ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not specifically ask me about the broadcasting legislation but the position is that <Col N="268" /> proposals are before the Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he would clarify a comment he made earlier in reply to a question concerning Friday week's business which I gather is to be the debate on the Maastricht Summit?  Did he say that if the Opposition were to propose motions in relation to that debate he would favourably consider them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that <Col N="269" /> the form of the debate could be discussed by the Whips.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could clarify, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, what a discussion with the new Whip actually means perhaps those discussions might prove more fruitful than previous discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>One always seizes the chance when one has it.  Did the Taoiseach say that if we were to propose a motion for Friday week, with the vote to be taken at another time, which is the norm, he would favourably consider such a motion as distinct from the meaningless series of statements which, again, is the norm?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little disappointed at the trend emerging this morning in respect of this matter.  I had hoped that there would have been a constructive discussion and I deplore an attempt to turn it into a party political type debate, which is not called for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My suggestion is, as usual, an eminently reasonable and sensible one, namely, that the Whips would discuss the form which the debate might take.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Taoiseach that it is not our intention to do any such thing.  We want to try to strengthen his rather weak hand in Maastricht by giving him a resolution of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the enthusiastic response of the Fine Gael group to reports in the newspapers over the weekend in regard to the bus competition Bill, will the Taoiseach say whether the Bill will be produced in the very near future? Will the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications assure the House that he will meet the CIE group of unions before the Bill is introduced in the House?</P>

      <P>The amendments we are currently considering, No. 14 in the name of the Minister and No. 14a in my name, attempt to address the problem of enforcement of compensation orders and how they should be collected in circumstances of default.  In the Bill the Minister basically proposes that the compensation order be reduced to a civil debt and the consequences of that, as I explained the last day, are that a person can be brought before a court and committed for failure to pay compensation.  I have argued in this House many times &mdash; and I repeat the arguments this morning &mdash; that it is, in principle, wrong and inhuman in its consequence that a person be imprisoned simply because they are unable to raise a sum of money.  As I pointed out the last day, the statistics clearly show that the majority of people <Col N="274" /> who go to prison for non-payment of a debt go in circumstances where they are living in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I came into this House last night to deal with a very important issue relating to the custody of a Liberian national who had been in prison since 25 June for no other reason except that he sought asylum here.  There was no sign of a Minister for Justice and he has not been in the House this session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making was that the statistics and information available indicate that in the vast majority of cases the reason for failure to pay a fine or more particularly, for failure to pay a civil debt, was inability to pay due to poverty.  It is wrong in principle that such a person be sent to prison, and it does not represent any form of humane or enlightened attitude on the part of Government or the Minister for Justice who has responsibility.  In amendment No. 14a I propose that a clause be inserted stating that no commital to imprisonment or detention shall be ordered where the court is satisfied that non-payment of a compensation order arises from the inability of the person affected to pay.  That is a very reasonable proposition to include in this legislation.  No-one should be sent to prison for failure to pay a compensation order where the court dealing with the application is satisfied that the person simply cannot pay.  I ask the Minister of State to convey this view to the Minister for Justice to see if it is acceptable.</P>
      <P>A point was made in this regard on 6 November when we debated the Bill and another Minister of State was present, that a person who comes before a court could be ordered to a term of imprisonment, say six months for committing damage, and in addition ordered to pay a sum of money by way of compensation. I proposed that one order should be exclusive of the other, that if someone was ordered to pay compensation that should be as an alternative to a prison sentence.  I made that proposal in amendment No. 6a which we dealt with on 19 June last.  However, that amendment was not acceptable to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly there is the possibility in this legislation that a person could be sent to prison and ordered to pay compensation, the idea being that once the term of imprisonment is served as a punishment compensation would be paid as a retribution. Having served the term, of <Col N="276" /> imprisonment the person may be unable to find employment or to get the money together to pay the compensation.  In that case the defendant could be brought back to court and could face recommittal to prison for failure to pay the compensation. Consequently, under the provisions of this Bill a person could be sent to prison on two occasions for the same offence.  That raises very important issues of principle with regard to our penal policy.  Is it proper to punish twice for the one offence, particularly with the ultimate sanction of imprisonment?  That is more objectionable in principle where a second term of imprisonment is imposed upon a defendant because he or she, through reasons of poverty, is unable to pay the compensation ordered by the court.</P>
    <P>This point was taken up by Deputy Barrett the last day.  On that occasion I asked the Minister to realise that there are ways and means of dealing with noncompliance with a compensation order other than sending the person to prison. It should be open to a court &mdash; it is not contemplated under this legislation or indeed under the legislation dealing with community service orders &mdash; to order, in lieu of payment of compensation, that the person be required to do community service work or to engage in some other voluntary work scheme that would repay at least to the community if not directly to the victim some of the loss caused by the original act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe on the last day made the point that the courts should have this sanction but I ask him, and the Minister of State, in the event of the Government adopting that attitude to differentiate between the method of collection of a fine, which is the primary penalty imposed by a court, and the collection of an order for compensation.  There is a qualitative and substantive difference between a fine imposed by a court by way of penalty and a compensation order imposed by a court by way of retribution to the victim.  The same code of enforcement and sanctions for non-payment should not apply in both cases.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I hope the Minister <Col N="277" /> of State will be in a position to at least indicate a willingness on the part of the Minister to accept the proposal in amendment No. 14a or, alternatively, to bring the provision back to the House on Report Stage.  It will not substantially take from the idea enshrined in the section, mainly that of compensating a victim in so far as is possible.  There has to be a balance.  We have argued in some respects that the section be broadened to make it more embracing, but on the other hand there is a need for balance.  We are introducing a new concept, that statutory power be given to a court to order that compensation be paid to a victim.  It is reasonable to ask in this englightened era as we approach a new century that at least we adopt in principle the concept that no one be sent to prison simply for reasons of poverty or because they do not have the means to make the payment ordered by a court.  I am not saying it should be a matter of the defendant walking into court and saying: &ldquo;I am sorry, I do not have the money&rdquo;.  The amendment provides that the court should decide whether reasons of inability to pay exist.  Therefore I hope that this amendment will receive the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have argued that the provision in relation to the making of a compensation order is a huge step forward in criminal law.  We are getting away from the traditional options of imposing a prison sentence or a fine.  I welcome the Minister of State who is taking the Bill this morning.  I do not mean to cast aspersions on him or his ability but I find it frustrating that when we are making an argument on Committee Stage, Ministers keep changing.  It is an insult to this House that the Minister for Justice is not here to deal with this important matter &mdash; I cannot think of anything more important to the public in his area of responsibility.  He has not found time to come into this House on any occasion during the course of Committee Stage of this Bill to consider serious amendments or arguments put by the Opposition to try to improve the legislation.  Without <Col N="278" /> meaning to be provocative or insulting to the Minister of State one feels one is just blowing hot air into the ceiling and that it makes no difference what is said because the Department of Justice, and the Minister, have decided that the Bill will go through as it stands.  I feel we are just going through the process and that is a terrible shame.</P>
      <P>I will give an example of what I am talking about.  A deserted wife I spoke to on the phone recently asked if I would make representations on her behalf. A fine of £50 had been imposed on her for non-payment of a television licence. She did not have the money to pay it and was being committed to prison for five days for non-payment of the fine.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State listened to what I have to say.  It would be better if we had another Minister if the Minister of State does not wish to take part in this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Sir, lest the tenor of the debate continues as at present, let me say that I have studied the entire record of this debate, and I know what Deputy McCartan, Deputy Seán Barrett, Deputy Ben Briscoe, and the then Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy have said.  It is wrong to assume that I came into his House this morning not knowing the subject under discussion. I would appreciate if this atmosphere would disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might listen to the argument I am trying to <Col N="279" /> make.  This deserted wife was fined £50 for non-payment of her television licence.  As she did not have the money to pay the fine, she was sentenced to five days' imprisonment.  She explained her case to the Garda Síochána, and outlined the difficulties she would have in making arrangements to find somebody to look after her children while she would be in prison.  She had made arrangements for the care of her children, but as her father was very ill, the arrangement was cancelled for the time being.  She was afraid that the Garda would come to take her to prison before she had made alternative arrangements.  She asked if she could pay the fine in instalments but she was told no.  Will anybody tell me in 1991 that our penal system is working when a deserted wife who does not have the television licence and wishes to pay the fine by instalments, cannot do so because there is no system that allows her to pay the fine by instalments, and she must be hauled off to Mountjoy Prison to serve five days' imprisonment at a cost of £400 to £500 to the taxpayer &mdash; as a form of punishment.  This is utterly and totally absurd.  I am not suggesting for one moment that anybody who does not adhere to a court decision should walk away scot-free.  Under the criminal law code a person is either fined or sentenced to prison.  I have to admit that the community service order is a forward move. When one looks at all the criminal legislation one sees punishments in terms of 12 months imprisonment and/or a fine of £500 or whatever, and this Bill continues in the same vein.  We are trying to introduce a new concept, that is compensation orders, which I absolutely and totally support.  I have made the argument over the course of the debate that the victim of malicious damage would far prefer to be compensated by the offender rather than seeing him spend five days or a week in prison.  This new method of imposing a compensation order is more likely to stop vandalism than putting the offender in prison for a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this subsection we are going back to the old concept, that someobdy who does <Col N="280" /> not honour the compensation order would end up in prison.  It would be better if we could find alternative punishments if they do not pay the compensation order. Prison should be seen as a deterrent for those who have committed serious offences, which gives them the means to integrate into society.  It is a nonsense to put a person in prison for five days for the non-payment of a television licence. We should be able with modern technology to provide ways for the payment of fines by instalments.  This subsection proposes to restrict to 12 months the period in which compensation can be paid.  It should be left to the court to decide on the period of the compensation order.  If somebody explains to the court that they cannot afford to meet the terms of the compensation order, the court should be able to decide whether to reduce the amount and extend the period or impose some form of community service, instead of the old method of putting an offender in prison.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy McCartan's proposal in principle, but I would be concerned that we would not give the impression that the person who pleads inability to pay would walk away scot-free.  We should be able to ensure that the person who is unable to pay carries the liability or does something for the community instead of serving a prison sentence.  I urge the Minister to change this narrow way of thinking which defeats the whole purpose of the compensation orders. Why should the taxpayer be asked to pay £400 to keep somebody in prison for five days, as in the case I instance where somebody did not pay their television licence?  In this case, the person accepts that she must pay the fine but she cannot afford to pay £50 in the required period. In fairness, I suggested to her that she contact the Minister's office and petition the Minister, but it must be appreciated that a great many people in this position do not know about this procedure and will end up in prison.  I am quite certain that if the Minister &mdash; indeed any Minister no matter of what party &mdash; knew of the circumstances, he would reduce the fine or strike it out altogether.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> I agree with the principle outlined by Deputy McCartan and I ask the Minister to consider seriously, as I asked the Minister of State previously, a number of amendments I have tabled on Report Stage to improve section 9.  He should go ahead at full steam with the concept of the compensation order and leave it flexible. It is a good principle and it should be supported.  Likewise, if people get into trouble and cannot meet the terms of the compensation order the courts should be able to be flexible to extend the period or say that in lieu of imprisonment the person must do so many months of community service work.  At least the person would be giving something back to the community rather than taking all of the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to intervene very briefly in this debate.  I have listened carefully to what Deputies McCartan and Barrett have said and I recognise an amount of logic in their arguments.  I am a little hesitant about the fact that an instalment order will have to be paid within a period of 12 months.  I assume that the thinking behind the imposition of that time limit relates to compensating the victim.  If, for example, a person does damage worth £2,000 to property and a District Justice decides that the best sanction would be to ensure that the offender compensated the victim to the extent of £2,000 and there was no time limit within which the £2,000 compensation order had to be paid, could it be said that the victim was being properly compensated?  Is it proper for the District Justice, having considered the means of the accused, to decide that the accused could afford to pay £5 per week and thus compensate the victim over ten years? That is probably the thinking behind the time limit, but I agree a little more flexibility could be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan made the point that under the Bill a person could be the subject of a compensation order and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  I do not see how that could happen under the Bill as drafted.  Section 9 provides for <Col N="282" /> compensation orders and the main determinant of whether a District Justice will order a compensation order is the means of the accused.  Deputy Barrett does not agree, but section 9 (4) states:</P>
    <P>In determining whether to make a compensation order against a person, and in determining the amount to be paid by a person under such an order, the court shall have regard&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) to his means, </P>
    <P>Unless the person against whom the order has been made has capital that would constitute sufficient means to make a compensation order against him or her it is difficult to see how a court could, properly applying the provisions of section 9, send a person to prison while at the same time impose a compensation order upon him or her.  If a person who does not have means is sent to prison that person will be deprived of income for the time he or she is in prison and, therefore, his or her means would be nil.  Taking into account the person's means at that stage, how could a District Justice order the payment of compensation?  I cannot envisage that situation arising.  I do not want to mention names, but if a member of one of the recognised crime families of Dublin or, indeed, my own city who has plenty of means is convicted of damage to property and the District Justice knows from that person's means that he or she can compensate the victim out of capital terms I can see no harm in the District Justice having power to sentence that person to a term of imprisonment also.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan made the point that there is a qualitative difference between a compensation order under this legislation and a fine imposed for a specific offence. I agree with that, but Deputy McCartan will also agree with me that on the other hand there is a qualitative difference between civil damages awarded as a result of a civil action and a compensation order made under this legislation.  A person who suffers an award against him or her for civil damages is presumably liable in contract and so on but a person <Col N="283" /> who is made the subject of a compensation order is someone who went out deliberately to damage property in a criminal manner.</P>
    <P>If the ultimate sanction of imprisonment applies to a person who was liable only for a civil debt surely there is a very strong case that it should be applied to a person who had been made the subject of a compensation order because that person would have been criminally prosecuted to conviction.  To suggest that the ultimate sanction should be taken out in this regard when it continues to exist in civil law is putting the cart before the horse.  I find it outrageous that people who cannot pay small fines or civil debts because of poverty should be sent to prison but it is an outrageous necessity because at the end of the day there must be some sanction.  We have all come across people who have been fined or who have had an order made against them by a civil court for a certain amount of money and who recognise the courts and the legal system and pay whenever they get the money.  However, there are those who never want to pay.  If at the end of the day there is no sanction on those who do not pay, why should everybody not get away with that?  I may be wrong in this, and I do not doubt that the Minister of State will clarify the position for me, but as I understand the civil procedure now being applied to compensation orders is that of committal order stage if a convicted person can satisfy a District Justice that he or she is unable to pay, the District Justice has discretion not to impose a sentence of imprisonment on that person.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett asked why should we send people to prison, why should we not do this, this, or this.  That is fine, but what is &ldquo;this&rdquo;, &ldquo;this&rdquo; and &ldquo;this&rdquo;?  We would like some positive suggestions about what could be done by way of an alternative. Community service orders have been developed.  As far as I know, in the case of a person who has been made the subject of a committal order a District Justice has no discretion to impose a community service order on that person, the District <Col N="284" /> Justice has to decide to either send that person to prison or not.  I agree with Deputy Barrett in that regard, the law should be changed.</P>
    <P>I agree that we should look towards other types of orders.  If Deputy Barrett has suggestions of further options to imprisonment, an issue which has exercised the minds of penologists and writers for many decades, the Government would be delighted to hear them. Obviously, the sentencing of a person to give a specific number of hours a week to community service is one alternative to imprisonment.  However, when a civil action comes to committal stage the sanction of a community service order should be available to a District Justice, a District Justice should not simply have to make a decision between imprisonment or non-imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that where a compensation order has been made a person may say, before he or she has fully complied with the compensation order, that his or her means do not permit payment and in those circumstances a District Justice may reduce the amount remaining to be paid or may order repayment if the victim has been over-compensated in the light of the most up-to-date evidence.  On reflection, I agree with some of the points made by Deputy Barrett.  There is room for some flexibility; it should not be a question of automatically reducing an order.  Perhaps District Justices should be given discretion to allow people pay over a longer period rather than to simply reduce the amount remaining to be paid.</P>
    <P>Looking at the section it would appear there are adequate safeguards included. In all honesty I do think that the sanction of a community service order should be available as an alternative to imprisonment at committal stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their contributions on this important section. I see that Deputy Bell has arrived.  I forgot to mention him in my earlier litany of speakers whose contributions I read in preparation for taking this item this morning.  I should like to deal with the various points raised by Deputies on <Col N="285" /> amendments Nos. 14 and 14a.  which were discussed on the last occasion we debated this Bill and again this morning.</P>
      <P>I do not think there was any objection to the official amendment, No. 14, which aims at simplifying the enforcement of compensation orders.  It does so by treating these orders as if they were instalment orders made by the District Court under the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment is that, compared with the existing provision in the Bill, the victim of the damage does not have to undertake the first stage of the normal enforcement procedure, that is he or she does not have to get the court to grant an examination order followed by an examination of the convicted person as to his or her means so that the court can decide on what should be the appropriate instalments or indeed whether the debt should be paid in one sum.  There should be no need for this first stage of the procedure in the case of failure to pay under a compensation order.  That is because the means of the convicted person would have been fully taken into account by the trial judge when making the order.  Therefore, under the provisions of the amendment, the victim can go directly to the court requesting the court to enforce the compensation order.  What happens then is that the convicted person is summoned to appear at the hearing and is given an opportunity to explain why he or she is not complying with the order.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the powers of the court to enforce an order and to Deputy McCartan's amendment No. 14a.  which seeks to ensure that a person cannot be imprisoned for failure to comply with a compensation order if he or she is unable to pay.  However, I should say that that objective is being secured by amendment No. 14 which applies the general law governing enforcement of instalment orders to compensation orders.  That law contains the necessary safeguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1940 provides for the case where a debtor fails to comply with an instalment order and the creditor applies <Col N="286" /> to a district justice for the arrest and imprisonment of the debtor.  Section 6 (c) prohibits the justice from ordering arrest and imprisonment and reads as follows:</P>
    <P>...if the debtor... shows, to the satisfaction of such justice, that his failure to pay was due neither to his wilful refusal nor to his culpable neglect. </P>
    <P>That subsection meets the Deputy's concerns with which I am sure we all agree, that is that nobody should be imprisoned for a debt he or she is unable to pay.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer specifically to some of the points raised this morning, in particular that by Deputy Seán Barrett about the woman imprisoned for failure to pay a television licence.  All of us public representatives will be aware of these types of cases.  What the Deputy said is quite true as far as it goes.  What was surprising to me was the fact that the Garda did not advise nor inform this woman that she should write to the Minister for Justice explaining her circumstances when the warrant for imprisonment would have been suspended. The Garda do this regularly when confronted by hardship cases.  If I may say so, there should be more of that common sense type of approach to circumstances or cases such as those.  Of course it is unacceptable that somebody should go to prison, somebody whose circumstances do not allow for payment of a fine, for the non-licence of a television set in one payment.  If there is no provision obtaining under which such a fine may be paid in instalments we legislators, combined, would want to see to it that such provision is made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>We could continue to say whose fault it is or is not.  At this point if we ascertain that something needs to be done we should do so.  It is not acceptable that somebody should be imprisoned for their inability to pay a fine in one sum or should be refused payment by way of instalments.  Perhaps the remit of the Garda does not permit them to do so but <Col N="287" /> whatever is required should be attended to.  Members will be aware that the Minister for Justice regularly accepts that fines be paid by instalments in hardship cases.</P>
      <P>As regards compensation orders, often these will be ordered to be paid by instalments. Therefore, it will be seen that there is a parallel here in that people who are unable to pay fines in one sum should have that instalment facility afforded them.</P>
      <P>Deputies Seán Barrett, McCartan and O'Dea asked whether a community service order should comprise an alternative to imprisonment where people refuse to pay compensation even in cases where they were able to do so.  I pose that question. That may be an interesting idea and I am sure will be considered in the context of legislation dealing with fines and compensation, in other words, within the general context.  I do not think it would be proper or appropriate to deal with it solely in relation to compensation orders.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea made the point that a district justice has discretion not to send a person to prison for the non-payment of a debt if he or she cannot pay &mdash; I go along with that &mdash; but it is more than that. Under section 6 (c) of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1940 he is obliged not to do so and for example, can vary the order, to reduce the amount of the instalments.</P>
      <P>I think I have dealt with all of the points raised on this and the previous occasion and that what I have said meets Deputy McCartan's concerns.</P>

      <P>With respect it is <Col N="288" /> important that the Minister listen to what has been said.  I do not think any Member said that anybody who can afford to pay under a compensation order, and who does not, should not be committed to prison or be meted out some other form of punishment; nobody said that.  We are talking here about people who cannot afford to meet the compensation order and the terms under which it was made. I accept absolutely the principle that somebody who refuses to adhere to the decision of the court should not walk away scot-free.  We must remember we are in 1991, using modern means to deal with people who commit offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea spoke about the 12 months provision and explained why he thought it had been inserted in this Bill when, with respect, I would maintain he was contradicting himself.  The restriction to 12 months will have a greater effect on the victim of crime than the extension beyond 12 months.  If damage to the extent of £2,000 is caused and the court is obliged to take account of the means of the individual, who in this case may be able to afford only £5 or £10 a week, then the court may make a compensation order for £500 since that is all the person will be able to repay within 12 months. If the order were extended over two or three years the victim might get back the full £2,000.  It is time to grasp the nettle. We are talking about malicious damage and I do not accept that anybody in receipt of some form of income should be able to cause malicious damage to property without being penalised in some way for that act of vandalism.  He may take a torch to five or six cars parked outside local authority houses whose occupants are paying high rents or mortgages for those houses and are repaying loans to the credit union or the bank for their cars.  Surely the culprit should have to pay compensation.  Nobody thinks about the unfortunate victim who still has to repay the loan for the car which has gone up in smoke.  It is time to be realistic.  If we have to attach the unemployment assistance or benefit which the culprit is receiving and he has to forfeit a couple of pints a week, so be it.  We <Col N="289" /> should not water down this legislation or pussyfoot around this growing problem in the Dublin area.  Perhaps the same is true in Cork and Limerick.  It is best to make people contribute to society by imposing a compensation order and/or a community service order rather than imprisoning them at a cost to the taxpayer of £800 a week.</P>

      <P>We should be as flexible as possible.  I do not know the technicalities of the Act the Minister of State has quoted, but I hope Deputy McCartan received a categoric assurance.  If a person is not meeting the requirements of the compensation order on the grounds that he cannot afford it, it should be possible to amend the order or to provide for some form of work in society in lieu of imprisonment.  If that is provided for in existing law, I presume it meets the point made by Deputy McCartan. He is saying that a person should not be imprisoned on the grounds that he cannot afford to pay but I am saying that the person should not walk away scot-free.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  He has not given any categoric assurance or an emphatic &ldquo;no&rdquo;' to the proposal put forward in my amendment No. 14a.  Perhaps that is to allow some scope for manoeuvre.  I am happy to have heard from a representative of the Government the unambiguous statement that everyone, including those on the Government side, agrees with the principle that a person should not be put in prison for failure to pay a debt or fine if he is unable to do so.  Despite the fact that this matter has been pursued time and again in this House, there has never been a concession to that effect from the Minister for Justice. If my amendment does nothing more than draw a Minister of State from whatever Department in this direction, I am quite happy.  In time the view will percolate through.  I acknowledge that some progress has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> The Minister has said there is no contradiction between what I am proposing and his own amendment No. 14, because of what is provided for in section 6 (c) of the 1940 Enforcement of Court Orders Act.  If there is no contradiciton, why not accept my amendment?  While it might seem on the reading of the 1940 Act that there are adequate safeguards and that a court should not send a person to prison on account of inability to pay, the working has not worked in practice as a safeguard. I must ask the Minister to accept my word on this, based on my experience as a solicitor in the courts for some years. It is provided in the Act that a judge should not imprison a person for failure to comply with an instalment order where the court is satisfied that the failure does not arise from wilful refusal on the one hand or culpable neglect on the other. The 1940 Act does not provide, as my amendment does, that a person should not go to prison where the court is satisfied that the person is unable to comply with the order due to inability to pay. There is a difference in wording and emphasis and in interpretation and practice.</P>
    <P>Arising from basic class differences between those who seek work and those who sit on our benches, many judges consider persons unemployed and unable to work as being culpable and neglectful. They cannot seem to understand that there are almost 300,000 people who cannot find employment, no matter what effort they make, and cannot appreciate that between 30,000 and 40,000 people are forced to leave this country each year to seek work abroad.  Judges will often not accept that a person is unemployed due to reasons beyond his control, and they will deal with such a person as if he were culpable and neglectful and wilfully refusing to pay.</P>
    <P>I have often heard an arrogant judge ask what efforts a person has made to find work and when it appears that the unfortunate defendant had not spent 24 hours a day crawling from one premises to another looking for employment the judge says that is not good enough.  When a person in receipt of unemployment <Col N="291" /> assistance or benefit from the State is before a court and states that he has such commitments that he is unable to pay, the judge often cannot realise that there is no wilful refusal.  The statistics show that between 200 and 300 people a year are sent to prison for failure to pay civil debt.  More than 1,000 people are sent to prison every year for failure to pay fines, the vast majority of whom live in abject poverty.  For some reason, the wording of the 1940 Act and the practical considerations which should exist do not, in reality, seem to be brought to bear in such cases.  If, as the Minister says, what I am arguing for in my amendment exists in the law at present, why is Deputy Barrett's constituent, a separated women, who was not able to pay the fine for not having a television licence now facing five days' imprisonment?</P>
    <P>I do not want to be over-critical in my remarks about District Justices and say they do not realise what is going on in the real world because many of them do, but on occasions the wording of the 1940 Act on the civil side does not work to keep people in genuine poverty out of prison.  Therefore, I am asking the Minister to update the wording of the legislation so that we say exactly what we mean.  I contend that a person should never go to prison if the court is satisfied he or she is unable to pay the amount being ordered, and that discretion should be left to the judge to make inquiries in that regard.  The wording of the 1940 Act does not work in the way I think the Minister of State wants it to work, and the way in which we as legislators believe it should work.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to Deputy O'Dea's remarks for which I thank him and which I found helpful to some degree.  I think we all agree that there is a substantive and qualitative difference between a compensation order on the one hand and a fine on the other.  A fine is a penal sanction imposed by way of punishment whereas a compensation order is qualitatively different.  The Minister takes this into account in his amendment which provides that: &ldquo;A <Col N="292" /> compensation order and an order under subsection 7 (b) shall be treated for the purposes of enforcement as if they were orders made by the court concerned in civil proceedings... &rdquo;.  Therefore, a fine is being given the status of a civil imposition and not a penalty.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea determined very colourfully that there is this outrageous necessity in the area of civil debt.  I have to take issue with this because I do not believe we should ever bind ourselves into the clear contradiction of saying that something is necessary on the one hand while conceding on the other hand that it can be outrageous.  Deputy O'Dea's argument is that there will always be people who will never want to pay.  I agree that there are people who never want to pay &mdash; but my answer is to ask the credit companies and other leading institutions to put their house in order and ensure that they never lend money to people who &ldquo;never want to pay&rdquo;.  These people are well known to credit institutions which keep and pass this information between them.  I have no doubt that credit institutions in Dublin, Limerick, Cork and eleswhere maintain lists of names which enable them to assess people seeking finance, particularly those who have defaulted or who fall into the category of those who never want to pay.</P>
    <P>In this context it is worth putting on the record the experience of one of my constituents who needed money coming up to Christmas.  Because of a family bereavement he had major problems meeting his financial commitments and thought a loan of £300 would tide him over the Christmas period.  He went to a credit company &mdash; which I will not name for the moment &mdash; and was interviewed by a girl who said he could get a loan. However, when he said he needed only £300 he was told they did not give loans of that amount; they gave loans of £1,000 or nothing.  Because he badly needed money he accepted a loan of £1,000.  A few days later he received a cheque for £1,000 in the post but there was no covering letter on the terms of the loan.  This man now has major difficulties making his repayments.  He got money he did not <Col N="293" /> need and he was not prepared to say no when it was offered to him that easily. Loan companies seem to have a tendency to push money at people and from this they run up massive debts and then are classed as people who &ldquo;never want to pay&rdquo;.  Such people should never get money in the first instance because they do not have the capacity to repay it.</P>
    <P>This is the way we should approach the phenomenon about which Deputy O'Dea is concerned.  I do not think we should ever send someone to prison to collect a civil debt.  While I have argued this before I want to again make the point that this system is totally inefficient from the point of view of getting value for taxpayers' money.  At the end of the day, we spend five times as much keeping people in prison for the non-payment of civil debts than we collect on behalf of creditors. We are just throwing good money after bad and we do not get any return on it. We must bear these considerations in mind in the context of this amendment. The Minister proposes in his amendment that on the civil side, compensation orders should be dealt with by way of enforcement.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the point made by the Minister.  His amendment would cut out many of the preliminary stages &mdash; there would be no examination order or instalment order as on the civil side.  The matter would come back before the District Court based on the existing order for compensation as though it were an instalment order <i>per se.</i>  The issue which will have to be addressed by the District Justice in the court on that day is whether a person will pay, and if not, why not, and should be imprisoned.  The alternative is for the judge, having asked for an explanation, to decide whether to send a person to prison.  This is a very limited process.</P>
    <P>While the Minister's amendment will bring that day nearer in a single move, if the section was left as originally drafted in the Bill as circulated, the matter could be converted from an order of the court on the compensation side to an order of the court on the civil side so that an examination notice could be served, an <Col N="294" /> examination would take place and there would be an instalment order.  This would allow for that extra process.  I have no particular difficulty with the Minister's amendment but it would speed up the process and bring the proceedings to a very quick conclusion.</P>
    <P>The option being left to the District Justice is far more critical.  Time and again case hardened judges frustrated and disappointed with the working of the law and having thought the payment of compensation was a good idea six or nine months earlier may be faced with time running out on the 12 month period and may say, &ldquo;I will not let this guy get away&rdquo;, take what might be crudely disguised as a knee-jerk reaction and may send him back to prison because &ldquo;I am not going to be bested&rdquo;.  In that context considerations like wilful refusal or culpable neglect do not feature and it is a net issue for the judge, who will ask &ldquo;are you paying or not and, if not, you are going where I put everyone else like you, into Mountjoy&rdquo;.  I accept the Minister's point that in essence there is no contradiction in what we are talking about, but in practice the contradictions will and do emerge. Therefore I ask the Minister to insert a positive statement in our law that a court should not put some person into prison for reasons of inability to pay.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment in the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the debate on this very important subject, I was of the impression that the purposes of the Bill was to put the emphasis on compensation to the person who was injured, the person whose property was damaged, the person whose house or car was burned and there are many examples of that.  I thought we were trying to strengthen the law and discourage people from wilful destruction of property and damage against the person.  I would much prefer to be dealing with ability or inability to pay on the basis of the social welfare legislation rather than on the basis of legislation dealing with this subject, because we all know in this House that the question of ability to pay can <Col N="295" /> often be arranged and abused.  For example, I have seen cases where the maintenance payment to a wife and her young children was reduced because the guy who was supposed to pay the maintenance order at a certain level arranged to go on the dole or did not work any overtime or had his income reduced to such a degree that the court had no alternative but to reduce the level of maintenance. I have no doubt the same type of situation would arise here.  We have to consider that whether the person has the ability to pay, that is the person who has committed the crime against the other person and that the main thrust of this Bill should be to ensure that there is a disincentive for people to injure and damage the person and people's property.</P>
      <P>If we talk about ability or inability to pay &mdash; I will not talk about people in receipt of social welfare because very often they may have, in terms of total income, as much if not more than the people who start work in the morning at 8 a.m. for seven days a week in a shop or wherever &mdash; we must conclude that it would then be deemed to be OK to set somebody's house on fire or to wreck or steal somebody's car or run it up against the wall, in the knowledge that when this eventually comes before the court, because his income is low, he will not be sent to prison.  If that concept was to develop you would sentence a person for murder based on his level of income.  The vast bulk of criminal law is based on the crime, not on whether the person can pay the fine.  There is no justification for this new concept that because one is on a low income, for whatever reason, one can break the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, I would have sympathy with a person on a low income but the legislation to deal with that is social welfare legislation to assist people on low income or by some other means of State subsidy. We should not say: you should not go to jail, you can do whatever you want, you can commit a crime against somebody which will cost them up to £50,000, £60,000 or £100,000, and because you <Col N="296" /> cannot pay you go down the street because the judge said: &ldquo;Sorry, this man cannot pay&rdquo; and the hard working person has to pay.  That would be bad law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see Deputy O'Dea is taking an interest in this matter. I think we are getting into very dangerous territory here because we are beginning to mix up the arguments in relation to civil law and the circumstances that may prevail where somebody enters into a contract in civil law cannot afford to meet the requirements and where, perhaps, the lending institution was somewhat at fault for giving the money in the first place.  There is a hell of a difference in that scenario in civil law from what we are talking about here.  This is a question of compensation orders in relation to malicious damage which is a different ball game altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we should get back on the rails. We are talking about people who go out and damage other people's property.  It is not a question of whether they should or should not have got involved in this particular contract or whether they were 50 per cent right or 50 per cent wrong. This is malicious damage and this is what the punter outside is complaining of bitterly day in day out and rightly so, where people are going around damaging other people's property for no good or genuine reason, going into our courts at present <Col N="297" /> and, perhaps, walking out under the provisions of the Probation Act or else finding themselves in detention for a given period and not even serving that sentence because of overcrowding in our prisons and so on.  This is a new concept.  This is where we might say, we may send you to prison, or we may send you to prison and you must pay compensation or, perhaps, we will just make you pay compensation. I am totally in favour of making people who damage other people's property compensate that person for the damage they caused.</P>
    <P>As I said here the last day, the real deterrent in this type of crime is when you hit people in the pocket, where they themselves suffer for what they have done.  Whether it is a community service order with compensation or compensation on its own, the victim is entitled to be compensated.  What is wrong with our debate this morning is that we do not know what the Minister and his Department are going to do about the other amendments on which we got a commitment that they would be considered further on Report Stage, such things as the period of payment of compensation. The options vary if the period of compensation changes.  For argument sake, if it is open-ended it gives the judge more discretion.  If somebody comes before him and says: &ldquo;I cannot afford at the moment to meet the requirements of the compensation order&rdquo; and the judge knows that he can extend the compensation order over two or three years, he can reduce the level of payment so that the person can pay the compensation over two years and he can direct the person to come back to him in six months to see how things are going.  With that sort of flexibility what we are talking about here this morning becomes a different case, but we do not know what attitude the Department of Justice will take to our amendments relating to the period over which compensation must be paid.</P>
    <P>It is important for us to try to persuade the Minister and the Department, in introducing this new concept of compensation order, not to put obstacles in <Col N="298" /> the way before they start.  They should leave the discretion to the courts.  It should hurt a person to have to pay under a compensation order because we are talking here about malicious damage and not about a civil action.  If a person vandalises a car or breaks a window just because he feels like doing it and is only getting £40 odd a week from the State in unemployment assistance, I do not want to be told that he cannot afford to pay for some of the damage that has been caused.  If such a person has to forego one or two nights in a local pub for six months to make good the damage, so be it.  There is a difference in judging whether someone can afford to pay under those circumstances rather than under some other circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am arguing for the principle of Deputy McCartan's amendment not because I want a person to be able to go into the court and plead inability to pay and have the appeal accepted.  If a person goes into court to plead that he cannot pay, instead of being put into prison, the court should have the discretion to alter the compensation order, to extend the period, impose community service work or something like that.  The culprit must have to do something to repay.  The same criteria need not apply in a civil case, but only in cases of malicious damage.</P>
    <P>The only way to combat the sort of vandalism which occurs in towns or cities is by being tough with compensation orders.  We should not be afraid to stand up to the thugs who have no consideration for other people's property. We should not compare the circumstances of a person who commits malicious damage with the circumstances in which perhaps a person takes out a loan at Christmas time and then finds he cannot repay it.  That is a human aspect which I can understand.  However, I cannot understand somebody lobbing a brick through a plate glass window for no apparent reason.  The circumstances in these cases are totally different.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister of State to use his influence to persuade his Minister and the officials in the Department not to <Col N="299" /> water down the provisions of this compensation order by including unnecessary restrictions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking here about new legislation on damage to property. Section 9 provides that a district justice or a judge may order a person accused of causing damage to compensate the victim to some degree.  In determining the compensation order the judge must take into account the means of the accused.  If the accused can satisfy the court that he cannot pay anything, the court is compelled not to make a compensation order against him.  The level of the compensation order will depend on the extent to which the judge is satisfied that the person has means to pay it.  A judge can be satisfied that a person can pay £500 over a 12 month period, but if during that 12 month period the person's means change, he has the right under subsection (7) to appeal to the court for a change in the compensation order.  In those circumstances the court will consider the matter and will say, for instance, that a person can pay something and can reduce the payment to perhaps half what it was before, and the total amount of the compensation order will accordingly be reduced.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett suggested that I was contradicting myself when I referred to the 12 month period.  I hope he did not misrepresent me intentionally.  I went out of my way to agree with Deputy Barrett. I am not happy with the 12 month restriction. There should be more flexibility with regard to it and to what the court may do under subsection (5).  It seems that the only discretion the court has is to reduce the amount.  The court should also have the power to extend the repayment period.  My reference to a ten year period was in an effort to find some theory as to how the 12 month period was arrived at by the parliamentary draftsman.  My theory may be wrong and there may be some other thinking behind it.  If there is, I would like to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that there should be more flexibility.  One would have to be pretty <Col N="300" /> dense not to see that if all a person can afford to pay is £5 a week and he can only be ordered to pay compensation for 12 months, that amounts to only £260, whereas if he could be ordered to pay it for two years the victim would be compensated to the extent of £520 under the compensation order.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the wording of the 1940 Act.  I do not know if the superior courts have ever given any directions or guidelines on how district justices should interpret these words, but perhaps Deputy McCartan who is more experienced in this area might enlighten us.  With regard to Deputy McCartan's statement about some district justices adopting a class attitude, or a biased attitude, and not accepting that unemployment can cause people not to be able to pay fines, civil debts and so on, if there are such district justices who are so blinkered, so out of touch with reality, they will equate obvious abject poverty with wilful refusal to pay.  It will hardly be possible to satisfy such a district justice that non-payment arises from inability to pay.  Therefore, even if the amendment is well intentioned and even if the wording of the 1940 legislation should be updated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy agree that it is at least more explicit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>On reflection, I do not.  I would like to know if the superior courts have ever considered the wording of the 1940 Act or commented on exactly what it means.  If there is such a case I would like to be referred to it because I would be recommending amendments based on the outcome of the case and on what members of the Judiciary may have said.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan referred to certain credit companies.  I take his point.  We have a serious problem with credit companies and moneylending organisations down in Limerick.  I do not want to stray from the amendment but some of the moneylenders I have had dealings with in Limerick do not resort to the courts to collect their debts.  However, we will deal with that on another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> Even if there is some provision to deal with the credit companies who have undoubtedly acted irresponsibly over a period, it is only addressing a small part of the problem.  There are multitudinous other areas where people are liable for civil debts either in contract or tort which will not be dealt with if we put some restrictions on the credit companies.  We will still be faced with a dilemma; there must be some sanction at the end of the day.  As Deputy Barrett says, there is a world of difference between a credit company irresponsibly pushing too much money on somebody and a person going out to wilfully and maliciously damage the property of another.</P>
    <P>That is the situation as I see it.  We have to bear in mind at all times that under subsection (7) a person can come back at any stage to the District Court if his circumstances change and he cannot pay.  Even though that subsection is there it will not impress a district justice with the attitude so colourfully described by Deputy McCartan earlier on.  All we can do here is write the best law we can.  We must then depend on the Judiciary to apply that law in a logical and sensible manner.</P>

      <P>We now have an opportunity to deal a blow to the mindless vandals in our society by making them pay for the damage they commit.  I also am one of those who feel that this compensation should not be restricted to 12 months.  It should go on.  A person who destroys somebody else's car should pay that person compensation.  I do not care if he pays only £1 a week for 20 years but he should have to pay something so that he will think twice before putting a brick through another windscreen or setting fire to another car.  Here is an opportunity <Col N="302" /> to finally deter some of these criminals. For years I have been calling out for compensation to be made payable to the victims of crime.</P>
      <P>What about the poor man who has a car worth only a couple of hundred pounds which, because he happens to be a good mechanic, he is able to keep on the road? What about that man who cannot afford insurance to protect his car against fire and theft, who has the minimum of insurance, third party only?  How is he to be compensated when he has to pay more money in bus fares to get to work because he may not be able to get another car? At least if some fellow is paying £5 a week into a fund that man might be able to eventually buy another car, perhaps on the basis of a loan.</P>
      <P>I am very fervent in urging on the Minister that here is the opportunity we have been waiting for.  We will not get an opportunity like this again for a long time.  As we all know it takes years for legislation to come before this House, before we can enact it.  Let us put teeth into this one.  If we just introduce a hopeless Bill so that lawyers can go into court and plead on behalf of their client, who is getting free legal aid for which the State is paying, who has no job and has only £60 or £70 a week in unemployment benefit or assistance and who is not in a position to pay, we will not be achieving justice.  Justice comes into it; justice is relative.  If the person has a job and is earning £20,000 a year or £16,000 or £17,000, he can afford to pay more and it should be that way.  The person who is receiving money from the State, from the taxpayer, and who sets out to persecute the taxpayer by destroying his property, should be made liable before the law, and I do not care if 10 per cent of his welfare has to be taken away from him. We should make him pay and I can assure you, a Chathaoirligh, that will be the best deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of these people could not care less about going in and out of jail.  It is a way of life for them.  Sometimes they get caught and other times they do not.  They go to jail.  They have heat in the winter. They have good food, shelter, probably <Col N="303" /> better living conditions than many of them have in their own homes.  Jail does not hold any hardship for those people and anyway they are out in a couple of months because the jails are full.  If we make them pay that sting will stay with them every week that money is missing out of their income.  That will sting, and every time they contemplate picking up a brick with which to damage someone else's property, or putting a match to a car they will think again.</P>
    <P>This is what the people want.  We are here to interpret as best we can what the wishes of the people who elect us are. Without any hesitation I can say that the wish of the people who elect me and my colleagues in our constituency is that we should do something about this problem of criminal damage.  This is an opportunity to do so.  I would urge the Minister to be brave and to take this problem on board.</P>
    <P>The people who are always calling for a reduction in this kind of penalty are often the people who benefit from crime, who have cornered the market in crime.  I am not casting any aspersions on Deputy McCartan, in case he thinks I am.</P>

      <P>The first thing I want to say is that I am not accepting amendment No. 14a, and I gave the reasons earlier. It is already covered in law; I quoted the Act for the Deputies.  As regards the <Col N="304" /> suggestion that Deputy McCartan's amendment is a better safeguard than section 6 of the 1940 Act because of the way it may be interpreted by judges, it is difficult to see any difference in substance between inability to pay and failure not to due to refusal or culpable neglect.  We could end up with the same result &mdash; that is, misinterpretation &mdash; if the amendment were to be accepted.  We cannot make provision for the fact that some judges take a narrower view than others of how the formula in the 1940 Act should be applied in a particular case.  I suggest that no matter what formula is used that problem will always be there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett mentioned that a compensation order may provide for the payment of compensation by instalments during a period not exceeding 12 months. This period is specified in subsection (5). Previously the Minister of State gave an undertaking, and I repeat it now, to bring in an amendment on Report Stage to make this provision more flexible &mdash; such period as the justice in any given set of circumstances would consider reasonable. I do not know whether there was telepathy at work but before Deputy Barrett spoke I had written down my own assessment.  I agreed with him or anyone else who suggests that we should not water down the proposed legislation to make it ineffective in striking a balance between the offender and the offended.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe, Deputy Bell and others made the point that we must not lose sight of the deterrent aspect.  It would be very bad if at the end of the day people could say they could not afford to pay compensation and therefore could do what they liked.  The opportunity is being given to us in this legislation to either maintain the existing deterrent or to establish a stronger one.  While provision must be made for a person's inability to pay, it should be our objective to provide a deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make a small point on the question of inability to pay.  As has been suggested by Deputies Bell and O'Dea, a debtor can arrange to go on the dole or not to work overtime so that when the hearing comes up they can prove they <Col N="305" /> are unable to pay.  However, they would be less likely to get away with this under the culpable neglect formula which reads &ldquo;neither to his wilful refusal nor to his culpable neglect.&rdquo;  Evidence could be given to show that a person had entered into an arrangement, such as going on the dole, for the time being.  The existing law covers this aspect much better than the way many Deputies have suggested. As I have already said, the principle outlined in Deputy McCartan's amendment is already covered.  Therefore there is no need for me to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I thank the Minister of State for his reply and accept that he is not accepting the amendment. I will be asking you, Sir, to formally put the question.  The Minister of State made the point before other Deputies came into the House that there was no disagreement between him and myself in principle on this issue.  He had made the point also that the issue I am talking about is covered more comprehensively by section 6 (c) of the 1940 Act but I believe we should make a firm statement in this Bill.</P>
      <P>It was with great regret that I had to listen to the intervention of Deputy Briscoe who, because he arrived late for the debate, clearly missed the central point that there was no disagreement.  I take issue with him when he says that I am seeking in this amendment to take teeth from or to water down the section.  As the Minister of State has already said, this has been the law since 1940, in statute form at least.  I do not know whether this point has escaped Deputy Bell's attention but the point my amendment is attempting to address is that the vast majority of people who come before our criminal courts on these charges are living in abject poverty and do not go to court believing there is one law for them on the basis that they can pay or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday at the meeting of the Select Committee on Crime I sat beside Deputy Briscoe.  I almost had to console and help him hold back his tears in the face of a submission from Fr. Paul Lavelle who spoke for a few moments about people <Col N="306" /> living in abject poverty.  He described them so aptly as &ldquo;no tomorrow's children&rdquo;. That is the matter I am trying to address in this amendment.  Yesterday we had the opportunity to utter pious and polite platitudes on the horrible plight of these people, today we can suggest that the only option is to stick the boot in and make them pay when they cannot do so.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that that element of inconsistency and unnecessary remark has been made in this debate &mdash; that there is a double standard on behalf of The Workers' Party.  There is not.  What I and every other Member of The Worker's Party have tried to do is to maintain consistency.  If the Deputy had listened to the debate he should have taken the point that the Minister of State and I were talking about the same issue, that we were in agreement, in principle, and that it was only a question of whether we repeated in this Bill the law which has been in existence since 1940.  To suggest that The Worker's Party are trying to water down, to go soft on or to take from the legislation is to ignore what I have said and to introduce contention unnecessarily when there is none.  Having clarified the record perhaps the question can now be put to the House.</P>

He stated &mdash; Deputy Barrett was present and is a witness &mdash; that we were living in two different worlds, where people &mdash; the losers &mdash; were not given a chance in life but, he said, this did not mean he was against centres of detention.  With the best will in the world, Deputy McCartan is trying to render this Bill useless.  Let me read his amendment to remind him what is in it:</P>
      <P>...&ldquo;save that no committal to imprisonment or detention shall be ordered where the court is satisfied that non-payment of a compensation order arises from the inability of the person affected to pay&rdquo;. </P>

      <P>Compensation must be made payable to the victims of crime, based on the person's ability to pay.  It can be as low as 50p or £1 per week but they must pay something; the alternative of prison will be imposed in very few cases because, as I said in an earlier contribution, many of these people are used to prison and do not regard it as a bad way of life.  Perhaps the Minister will say on Report Stage whether he will review the 12 months' limitation.  It should be extended and the court should decide whether the period should be longer.  I would not limit it to 12 months in the case of a person on very low means paying 50p to £1 over 52 weeks for damage costing hundreds of pounds.</P>
      <P>Recently there was a lot of damage to houses in my constituency as a result of the corporation carrying out works and knocking down a wall.  People came streaming through and threw rocks at windows in houses in the neighbouring streets.  These people should be compensated if the perpetrators of the crimes are caught.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan is quite clear in his objection to parents or guardians of these children being held responsible for their crimes.  However, we will come to the section in the Bill dealing with that matter in due course&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan is a lawyer and he can quote sections of the law which most people do not understand. The problem is that very often, in legislation of this type, the lawyers take over.  I am not saying that lawyers here do not represent ordinary people but they see things in terms of black and white; there are no grey areas.  However, there are grey areas in all legislation and we must allow manoeuverability by the courts and judges, trusting to their wisdom.  I hope that the majority of judges are wise and will use the law in such a way that justice will be served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I often wonder how charity is acquired. Is one born with it or is it acquired <Col N="309" /> through experience?  I think of the people who destroy property mindlessly; perhaps if you took something very precious belonging to a person &mdash; a bicycle, radio or record player &mdash; and you ran a steamroller over it, you could then tell the person that you know exactly how he or she feels and that they should try to understand how other people feel when their property is destroyed.  Many of the people who commit those kinds of crimes in society do not have any compassion or feelings for the victims.  They feel they are entitled to damage property.  Of course it is dreadful that they are born into a society where they have to grow up like this, nevertheless the community must be protected.  Our legislation must be strong and flexible so that the courts may administer it in a humane, just manner.</P>

      <P>Any views I have in relation to this matter are coloured by the fact that we are speaking about malicious damage.  I have views on matters outside that area but I will confine my remarks to malicious damage.  I argued the last day we debated this Bill that under subsection (7) if the convicted person had the right to come back to the court to plead that his or her circumstances had changed, the victim should have the same right.  That would be good, common sense legislation.</P>
      <P>We are in trouble here because we are dealing with the technicalities of the 1940 Act.  We should legislate for the nineties. I would prefer if the Minister withdrew this amendment and came back on Report Stage with a new provision where, if compensation orders are not being complied with, the courts will deal with the matter in a certain way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are copied from other legislation.  Under subsection (7) a person has the right to go back to court and plead that he cannot comply with the terms of the compensation order <Col N="310" /> as outlined by the court and seek to have it altered.  If someone refuses to comply with a compensation order, after attempts by the court to extend the period for payment or to reduce the amount to facilitate the convicted person, the court, instead of putting the person in prison, should extend the compensation order for two years or make the person do community service.  I do not want the person to be sent to prison because it is a total waste of time.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the 1940 Act and all the flowery language here, will the Minister tell me that if the judge is satisfied the person cannot afford to make the payments or can afford to make the payments but will not, what options the judge or court has to deal with that person?  Is it the same old story of putting him in prison?  Can the judge order the person to do six months community service work?  At present the only option open to the court is to put the person into prison.  I do not think that any Member of the House wants that alternative.</P>
    <P>The Minister should draft his own provisions where as a result of a person failing to comply with a compensation order, the options open to the court would be to extend the period, to alter the compensation order or to impose a community service order.  We should spell it out.  There is no point in trying to deal with this in the same way as civil proceedings or under Part I of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1940, 51 years ago.</P>
    <P>Let us think about today.  Are we not capable of drafting legislation to deal with today's world rather than referring back to the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1940?  To the point of being boring I would remind the House that in this instance we are talking about malicious damage only, and we should not confuse any other issue with that.  I would like the Minister to consider this provision rather than continue with the traditional practice of sending people to prison after everything else fails.  The Minister should not lose the opportunity that arises in this instance.  The period should be extended to ten or 20 years or, if that is not done <Col N="311" /> a community service order should be left hanging over the head of the individual. If the person is released from prison after a couple of weeks it is of no benefit to society, to the individual or to the victim. It has been proven that a short prison sentence is not a deterrent.  We are talking about malicious damage.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barrett has put the case better than I could.  I want to deal with two items of misinformation on the part of Deputy Briscoe.  Out of six Deputies in the Chamber at present there are two lawyers, one on the Government side and one on the Opposition.  The proposition which relates to section 6 (c) of the 1940 Act was introduced by the Minister of State who is not a lawyer, but he was not here when that was dealt with.  The principle with regard to making parents liable for a compensation order was dealt with in section 4 of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barrett anticipated a point I wished to make in relation to the victim having the right to go back to court.  It seems unfair and unbalanced that the accused can go back to court as many times as he wishes to seek a reduction of the compensation order whereas the victim has no similar right.  I ask the Miniser if there is a restriction on the number of times the victim can go back to court?  If people can go back to court practically every week seeking a reduction in the compensation order because they cannot afford to pay the full amount the position will become ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his flexibility in this matter and on his clear understanding, given that he is not a legal person, of the issues involved.  He has given an undertaking that he will consider this point between now and Report Stage and I welcome that.  I hope that the parliamentary draftsman comes up with more suitable proposals which will provide for more flexibility in this area.  I would point out to the parliamentary draftsman that when considering this issue, he should take into account the <Col N="312" /> provisions of section 11 which we will deal with subsequently.  I want to make sure that if there is flexibility which will allow the district justice to make an instalment order for compensation over, say, ten or 20 years, it does not affect the victim's right to gain full compensation from his insurance company.  For instance, where property is damaged to the extent of £2,000 and is covered by insurance and the victim has to take proceedings in court to establish that the damage falls within the terms of the insurance policy, and if a compensation order has already been made for the payment of £2,000 over ten or 15 years, is the victim thereby placed at a disadvantage? I would like the parliamentary draftsman to consider that question.</P>

      <P>The general consensus of opinion is that the timescale of 12 months mentioned in subsection (5) is unacceptable. I will ensure that some flexibility is introduced in that regard.  For obvious reasons it is necessary that the justice in any case has flexibility in setting the timescale beyond 12 months.  The underlying aspect of the debate on this section is that the offended person is compensated, and if it takes one day or 20 years the offender is obliged to pay for the damage caused.</P>
      <P>I have already given my views on the amendments.  The question of giving the victim a similar right to have the order reviewed is being considered.  That answers the question raised by some Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion was made that a provision be introduced on Report Stage to give greater effect to section 9 and I will certainly pass on that request.  I should indicate that the Attorney General is being consulted on this matter.  In summing up, the general thrust of the debate <Col N="313" /> has moved a little from what is in the section.  Deputies are suggesting that we are giving over-protective powers to the offender and not enough to the offended. The Deputies have indicated that we should not water down this legislation but rather that we should strengthen it on Report Stage.  However, they should keep in mind the important deterrent aspect of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 9, before section 10, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&mdash;No order made against a parent or guardian under section 9 (4) (b) shall be construed as attaching any civil liability to that person for the damage done.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with a simple statement of consequence, that &ldquo;No order made against a parent or guardian under section 9(4)(b) shall be construed as attaching any civil liability to that person for the damage done&rdquo;.  Under section 9(4)(b), in circumstances provided under the Children Act, 1908, the court can require a parent or guardian to pay any fine, damage or cost imposed on a child or young person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While in principle I have no difficulty in accepting that parents are made answerable to the criminal court for the activities of their children, that should not be the basis of extending answerability to the parent or guardian on the civil side.  I hope exception will not be taken by Deputies to the fact that we are talking about an Act that predates 1940 by 32 years.  It is not my difficulty that Governments do not introduce up-dating or amending legislation.  We are dealing with a regime that makes parents and <Col N="314" /> guardians answerable under a provision of legislation that predates the founding of the State, but that is not my fault.  It is a good working regime that parents can be answerable in a court for the actions of their children.  However, the civil law is a different matter.  Section 9 (4) (a) deals with the means of the person.  The section also deals with other factors surrounding the well-being of the child, and ability and culpability of the family.  A court in making an order under subsection (4) would have regard to the parents' efforts to deal with problem children in the family and their attempts to seek guidance or assistance outside the home.  I am concerned that if a civil liability is to be attached to the parent or guardian they may be made responsible in a way we, as legislators never intended. I hope the Miniser of State will respond by saying that this could not arise under existing law or, alternatively, if it is so, he will accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>I will illustrate what I am worried about by way of a putative case.  Let us suppose that a problem child sets fire to the property of another, causing damage of the order of £20,000 and is brought before the courts.  Under section 99 of the Children Act, 1908, the court may attempt to draw in the parents and involve them in some scheme of compensation or repayment, if that is possible.  Given the circumstances of the accused, and the scale of the damage, the court may design a scheme under which some token compensation would be paid.</P>
    <P>In many cases that come before the court, the notion that the young person, or the parents, can pay back £20,000 over a period is not on.  Nonetheless the court, in applying the principle of hitting people in the pocket, may decide it would be of advantage to make a compensation order and have the parents and the young person pay something out of their pockets. That would be useful.  However, under the 1908 Act the court is able to make the parent or guardian responsible for the actions of the child and as a result the victim may pursue a civil action and compensation in full, that is £20,000 could be levied against the parent or <Col N="315" /> guardian.  That order would stand against the person or be put against, for example their family home or other property.  I do not think we envisaged this scenario in the legislation, especially when one considers we are dealing with people who are one step removed from the incident and who are not the primary perpetrators of the crime.  For those reasons, if the law is unclear or uncertain in this area &mdash; I hold the view that it is &mdash; the Bill should have succinct statement as I propose in my amendment, &ldquo;no order made against a parent or guardian under section 9 (4) (b) shall be construed as attaching any civil liability to that person for the damage done.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is doubtful if any civil liability for the damage done could be attached to the parent or guardian of the offender in the circumstances referred to in the Deputy's amendment.  I was waiting to hear the case the Deputy made for his amendment.  His concluding remarks that the point is somewhat complex sums it up and I agree with him.  I will have the matter examined in conjunction with the law officers of the Attorney General. I should like, therefore, to have the opportunity of considering the point further to see if an amendment is necessary. I suggest that the Deputy withdraws his amendment.  We will return to it on Report Stage.  I agree with him that it warrants deeper examination and consultation.</P>

      <P>If a person against whom a compensation order is made wishes to appeal against the order but not against the conviction to which the order relates or the sentence imposed, he may appeal against the order to the court to which he could have appealed against the conviction, and subsections (1) (b) and (3) shall apply as if he had appealed against conviction or sentence. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is that under section 9 (4) (b) an order for compensation can be <Col N="317" /> made against a parent or guardian, but the right of appeal in a criminal case reposes exclusively in the hands of the defendant, namely the child or young person before the court.  It appears that the Minister of State has been distracted for a moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the right of appeal because in a criminal case that right reposes exclusively in the hands of the convicted person, to the extent that the prosecutor, the Director of Public Prosecutions, has no right of appeal except in very limited cases. Under section 9 (4) (b) orders for compensation can be levied against a parent or guardian.  My concern is that we have to provide for them the right of appeal when the order is made against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 (4) provides &ldquo;If a person against whom a compensation order is made wishes to appeal&rdquo;. That may well include a parent or a guardian but the general law at the moment is that the right of appeal in criminal cases rests only with the defendant, and a parent or guardian is never the defendant in these circumstances.  Therefore, if we wish to extend the right of appeal in these areas, it is important to name the parent or guardian against whom orders can be made.  By and large, section 10 deals with appeals and the way in which compensation orders are suspended pending an appeal.  There could well be circumstances in which there is a difference between the parent or guardian and the defendant in the dock and in which the defendant in the dock is quite happy to <Col N="318" /> have his or her parent or guardian caught with a compensation order.  It might happen that a parent or guardian says: &ldquo;Listen, Johnny, this is over the top.  We cannot deal with this&rdquo; and Johnny says that he is not going to appeal, that he is happy that his parent or guardian has to pay.  In those circumstances the parent or guardian is left without the right to a hearing in a higher court.  Parents and guardians should be entitled to that.  I am concerned that because the general principle of law is that the right of appeal in criminal cases is with the defendant only, parents and guardians may in some way find themselves in difficulty.  There is a right for a parent or guardian to come back to the court to seek a review under section 9 (7) but this is a completely different matter.  Earlier contributions made by several Deputies confused the two: first the right to reapply back to the original court for a review of the amounts to be paid, and second, the right to appeal to a higher court.  The position should be clarified by specifically referring to the right of a parent or guardian, as I suggested in my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this section provide that if, for example, a compensation order is made for a figure of £5,000 to cover damage to a vehicle and the person who suffered the damage subsequently takes a civil action for damages, the civil court cannot award damages in excess of the £5,000 because £5,000 was the cost of replacing the actual damage done to the vehicle?  Am I reading that correctly?  In other words, does a person's right to a civil action disappear if they have received the maximum compensation that can be awarded under a compensation order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. Section 11 (b) (i) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the damages, as so assessed, exceed any amount paid under the compensation order, the damages to <Col N="320" /> be awarded shall not exceed the amount of that access, </P>
    <P>It is quite simple.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we not getting into very dangerous territory?  There are all kinds of measures to take into account. We had a long debate about section 9 (3) which states that both the owner of the property and the approximate cost of making good the damage done to it must be readily ascertainable.  In a civil case is there no provision for loss of earnings or loss of use?  If I were to go into a criminal court and tell a judge that the actual damage caused to my vehicle amounted to £5,000 and the judge made a compensation order for £5,000, that £5,000 would not take into account a loss of possible future earnings, the loss of the use of my vehicle and so on, that I might suffer.  It also does not take into account the fact that if the Minister decides to accept an extension of time limit then the compensation order may be paid over a period of three to five years.  I could lose the value of my money because it would not be received for three or more years. I would therefore be deprived of a civil action that I could take within, I think it is two years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Surely I should not be deprived of that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is stated in that subsection &ldquo;(or, where appropriate, of replacing it)&rdquo;, so if a vehicle is replaced that does not take into account the loss of use of that vehicle for a period, it does not take into account the payment period and any other losses.</P>

      <P>My understanding is that Deputy Barrett is right in his interpretation of section 9 (3).  It relates to the damage of the actual property in question. If there is a difference between what the accused is ordered to pay and the actual damage to the property in question, then the plaintiff can be awarded only the excess.  However, that does not in any way affect the plaintiff's right to consequential damages such as a loss of earnings.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 10, lines 30 to 32, to delete subsection (3). </P>
      <P>It is regrettable that we have such a short time to dispose of this amendment because, while it is the last on the list, it is crucial.  It may well be that the Minister will indicate at an early stage that he is accepting my amendment.  If not, we will lose the opportunity to debate a fundamental point of principle.</P>
      <P>I quote section 12 (3) because it is as important as it is pernicious in its provisions:</P>
      <P>Where an offence to which this section applies has been committed, any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects to be guilty of the offence. </P>
      <P>It will be seen that this subsection gives to anyone the power of arrest equal to that held by a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>I hope people will not take exception to the law being quoted here, though we be law makers, but the principle of the law always has been that the power of arrest of a citizen, that is on the part of a non-police officer, shall arise in cases where a felony has been committed in the presence of or witnessed by a citizen. In other words, it is saying that a citizen in the street can apprehend an offender in the course of the commission of the crime; for example, if they have their hand in the till, lobbing the brick through the window, or setting fire to a property and are caught in the act.  Then, because there is certainty of accusation on the one hand and an element of prevention on the other, the law has allowed the citizen power to intervene and arrest, that power being to detain the person until the police arrive or, alternatively, take them to the nearest police station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> What the law always said is that, once the perpetrator got away from the scene of the crime and the element of investigation enters, or where the element of suspicion or reasonable cause arises, those elements can and should only be dealt with by a member of the Garda Síochána, trained, responsible officers who know how about reasonable suspicion, who know what is reasonable cause and who know how to investigate and pursue the offender.  The provisions of this section allow a citizen, myself and anybody else &mdash; I might add it is a power I do not want or, I contend, one anybody else would want to have on serious reflection &mdash; become detectives because it allows anyone whom he or she suspects of being guilty of the offence to make an arrest.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the overall position. As I understand it in a town in my home county of Wexford, Bunclody, a group of businessmen have appointed themselves as law-keepers.  While I did not hear them I understand that one of them on the national airwaves recently suggested they would be using shotguns in the course of their law enforcement.  I understand also that a very responsible Deputy from that side of the House representing that constituency described them for what they are, that is, vigilantes. There is that phenomenon developing in our community, coupled with the type of power being provided here.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the concept of a citizen apprehending an offender in the course of committing a crime where there is certainty of accusation &mdash; in the sense of, you were caught doing it; I held you until the police arrived.  Where there is the element of deterrent in that it prevents the person completing the crime or getting away with the swag.  But I have great difficulty with people in their committee saying: &ldquo;someone broke a window the other day in the main street of Bunclody; we are now calling a committee because we suspect a stranger that was seen passing through the town that day, or we know the person who is committing the crime though none of us saw him; <Col N="324" /> we have the suspicion; let us arrest that person and lodge him in the local police station.&rdquo;  That has never been contemplated by our law.  It is a very dangerous departure from long-established principles, that we allow citizens or, as the subsection says &ldquo;anyone&rdquo;, begin to form suspicions and act on them.  If people have a suspicion then they should do what we have always expected them to do, go to their local police station, their local garda, or community officer and say a crime of malicious damage has been committed in their area.  Then one tells them why one suspects it was so and so, and allows the detectives and their colleagues to investigate that suspicion. When there is reasonable, probable cause, one allows the police officer to arrest without warrant and when he has evidence to prosecute the offender.</P>
    <P>It is an extremely dangerous departure from the principles of law to allow as do the provisions of the subsection, anyone to arrest without warrant somebody whom he or she suspects to be guilty of an offence.  I am extremely concerned about this.  We have very little time to tease out the implications of the provisions of this subsection &mdash; that was not my design; we did agree to a guillotine question being put at 1.30 p.m. &mdash; but this subsection worries me profoundly.  I hope the Minister will be prepared to reexamine it, if not now, at least that he will give a firm undertaking that it will be re-examined on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reasonably happy with the remaining sections of this Bill but I have very definite reservations about this one.  Many of the relevant points have already been made by Deputy McCartan. I had been hoping to hear what the Minister would have to say about this section. It had been my hope to table a fairly strong amendment on this section because I am worried about its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, if a property is damaged by a male who is six feet tall, and the owner of the property is a woman it would not be reasonable to assume that <Col N="325" /> she would be able to arrest that man. There, the physical element might very well determine the effectiveness of the arrest.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned also that a solid rumour factor would enter into the law, in other words, that a neighbour might suggest that they had reasonable suspicion that X had committed a crime. In such circumstances there would be an arrest carried out by a citizen virtually on hearsay.  It would be introducing a very dangerous element into the law.</P>
    <P>I agree that there should be some strengthening of the law in this area but this provision is going overboard and I would be extremely worried about it.  It appears to allow a member of the Garda Síochána to walk into somebody's home, without warrant or notice, perhaps on foot of a suspicion or a rumour of an alleged suspicion, and carry out a search. We are going somewhat too far here. I am concerned about a person being arrested who would be innocent of any such crime.  I am not suggesting that the emphasis of the law should not be placed on the person who commits the crime, but we must also safeguard against possible abuses of the law in circumstances where people are innocent.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that there is no caution required in this operation, that people could be arrested simply without their being advised under what section of an Act or for what reason they were being arrested.  A person might very well be arrested simply because somebody did not agree with his politics, with the football club of which he was a member or did not like the colour of his eyes.  A very definite explanation is required in relation to this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartan makes the point that this section allows private citizens to become detectives.  It is certainly not envisaged that anyone will be compelled to become a detective, whatever about being allowed.  My recollection is somewhat hazy on the common law position, but there is a common law right for a citizen to arrest <Col N="326" /> a person on suspicion that a felony has been committed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding was that common law covered the case where a crime had just been committed.  There is a fine distinction between a crime which is in the act of commission and an act which has just been committed.  In the UK the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours has been abolished.  In this case the citizen must have reasonable cause and have very definite grounds for suspicion that the person he is apprehending has actually committed the crime.  It is not envisaged that people will become amateur detectives, Agatha Christie characters, forming committees of investigation.</P>

      <P>If I were advising a citizen as to his powers under this section, I would tell him he would need to have witnessed the crime and have very good grounds for arrest, otherwise he would run the risk of action being taken against him for wrongful arrest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartan made a powerful argument but I concur with the points made by Deputy O'Dea. The intention here seems to be that if a citizen sees a person throw a brick through a window and run down the street he can apprehend him after the event.  The technical argument is as bad as the loophole in the Extradition Act where a person in possession of a submachine gun cannot be extradited because he is regarded as having committed a political offence, but if he was caught in the act of pulling the trigger he could be extradited.  This is the ridiculous situation under our law.</P>
      <P>We are talking here about malicious damage and it is often very difficult to apprehend a person actually throwing a brick or setting fire to a car.  If he drives a stolen car into a wall and jumps out he is no longer in the act of committing the crime.  Can citizens not arrest such people, having seen them setting fire to a car, throwing a brick through a window or driving a stolen car into a wall.  It would be ridiculous not to have this provision. The person who would wrongfully apprehend someone would expose himself to an action.</P>

The Minister might consider the case where a citizen, in the course of making a citizen's arrest, calls for help from another citizen who has not seen the crime being committed but is helping in the chase.  The second citizen may have a gut feeling that there are sufficient grounds for this arrest but he has not witnessed the crime.  The Minister might comment on that point.</P>

It is evident from what Deputy McCartan has said that one can arrest a person before the brick hits the window but not afterwards. How do we deal with the person who is running down the driveway having thrown a brick at the window?  What is the experience in other countries and what is the view of the gardaí.</P>
      <P>There are safeguards in the section and we do not want the public to abuse them. The phrase regarding reasonable cause provides a safeguard.

      <P>I cannot accept that subsection (3) should be dropped.  Section 12 extends to criminal damage offences the present power of a civilian to make an arrest where certain serious offences have been committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) of the section provides that any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects to be in the act of committing criminal damage.  This corresponds to the common law rule in relation to felonies and the position under the Malicious Damage Act, 1861. Subsections (3) and (4) confer powers to arrest a person without warrant on suspicion that he has caused criminal damage.  If the offence of criminal damage has in fact been committed, then anybody, whether a member of the Garda Síochána or not, may arrest anyone who is guilty of the offence or whom the person arresting suspects, with reasonable cause, to be guilty of it.  But <Col N="329" /> in the case of a member of the Garda Síochána it is not necessary that the offence should have been committed: it is sufficient that the member suspects, with reasonable cause, that it has been committed by the person in question. The civilian some distance from the place where the offence is alleged to have been committed has no protection if it should turn out that no offence was, in fact, committed.  That could happen if the person concerned had a lawful excuse for causing the damage and the civilian who made the arrest would then be liable for damages for unlawful imprisonment.</P>
    <P>These, as I have said, are the rules governing arrest without warrant for felonies and they correspond with those given statutory effect in section 19 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, in relation to certain offences under that Act.</P>
    <P>Regarding citizens' arrest, the present law is that any person can arrest anyone who is &ldquo;found committing&rdquo; malicious damage.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that this be extended to cases where there was a reasonable belief that such an offence had been committed and that the arrested person had committed it.  The Government felt this went too far because it would give a citizen a greater power of arrest than he has now in the case of a felony because he would be protected even if no offence had actually taken place.  The Bill instead provides that civilians should have the same powers of arrest and the same liabilities if they are wrong as apply in felonies.</P>

      <P>&mdash;a net increase of 25,000 in employment;</P>

    <P>&mdash;capitation grants increased in 1990 from £24 to £28 for primary schools and from £140 to £150 for secondary schools;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a plan for social housing published in February 1991 with the potential to provide for 5,000 extra households each year;</P>

      <P>I would expect the Taoiseach to say that.  I found his response breathtaking.  I put it to the Taoiseach that in terms of social and economic progress he has been extremely selective in the figures and items he has given in his reply.  One of the key essentials in making progress is to identify our problems. Surely those problems are the record level of unemployment at 265,000 and emigration which has increased by 136,000 since he became Taoiseach.  May I further put it to the Taoiseach that even the targets the Government have set in their programme will go nowhere towards advancing economic or social progress.  At best they will maintain the <i>status quo</i> and will not in any way significantly erode the cancers of unemployment and emigration in Irish society.</P>

      <P>Out of the 26 counties, 19 experienced a decrease in population over the years 1986-91.  Notable exceptions to this were Dublin and its surrounding counties and the regional centres of Galway and Waterford.  The average annual estimates rate of net migration per 1,000 of average population in each of the four provinces is quite similar.  The fact that these figures are derived estimates means that it is not clear whether migration is to another county or abroad.  The figures for individual counties may, therefore, reflect movement within provinces over the period, as well as movement elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I am circulating a statement which compares the population figures to which the Deputy refers to the corresponding figures for each of the Census periods since 1966.  The statement shows that the 1986-91 experience is very similar to that of 1966-71.</P>

      <P>I disagree to some extent with what the Taoiseach said because I believe one would have to go back to the period 1951-56 to get figures similar to those issued by the Taoiseach.  Would the Taoiseach agree that this is in great measure a manifestation of the failure of regional policy, the policy of cohesion, which we must take on board as part of the Single European Act?  It is because regional funding which would strengthen areas is not being applied by the Government to areas which have very weak structues that we get this result.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that.  In so far as the infrastructure is concerned, there has been very considerable progress, particularly under the recent National Development Plan, financed to a large extent by the Structural Funds. There is a very major element of decentralisation in many areas of our administration. For instance in the health services there are regional hospitals in the major provincial centres and there have been considerable improvements in infrastructure such as airports, major roads and so on.  I do not think the decline in rural population can be attributed to a lack of major infrastructure.

      <P>The functions of the National Heritage Council include working closely with and making representations to Government Departments, planning authorities, public bodies and State companies in relation to all matters coming within the council's general area of responsibility and ensuring the co-ordination of all activities in the heritage field, and deciding on the distribution of moneys allocated for heritage work subject to the approval of the Taoiseach and deciding on the priorities for such expenditure. Consequently contact with any of the organisations listed should be viewed as ongoing, is frequently at the instigation of the council or a committee of the council and can be to discuss general or specific issues.  In addition, the council meet many organisations or individuals who have sought grant assistance for heritage projects.</P>
      <P>Schedule &mdash; Organisations which the National Heritage Council have met from September 1990 to date.</P>
      <P>Association of Professional Archaeologists; Bord Fáilte; Board of Visitors of the National Museum; Board of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham; Board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art; Cork Corporation; Department of Education; Director, Down County Museum, Downpatrick; Dublin Corporation; Federation of Local History Societies; Foras Áiseanna Saothair; Galway Corporation; Galway West Tourism; Irish Heritage Education Network; Irish Professional Conservators and Restorers Association; Roundwood National Park Committee; School of Architecture, UCD; Tralee UDC.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, given the dispersion of actual executive responsibility for heritage matters among a number of Departments, what role the National Heritage Council have performed in the area of co-ordination? Can he give an example of how matters have been co-ordinated by the existence of this council where they would not have been co-ordinated prior to their coming into existence?</P>

      <P>I could give the Deputy many examples but not off the top of my head.  This is a very important part of the work of the National Heritage Council. For instance, the list of bodies they have met would give an indication of the sort of co-ordinating work they do.  The schedule includes the Board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Cork Corporation, the Director of Down County Museum, Downpatrick, Dublin Corporation, Galway Corporation, Galway West Tourism, the Irish Heritage Education Network and so on.  They have met with State bodies like Coillte and organisations of that kind which either have a role or whose activities have an impact on the heritage.  The council are very active in arranging round-table discussions with different bodies where there might be some conflict of activity in regard to heritage matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 5, 17, 18, 19, 23, 25, 43, 46, 48, 55, 65, 67 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the last Joint Energy/Environment Council, held in October 1990, agreed on stabilisation of CO2 emissions by 2000 at 1990 levels in the Community as a whole based on equitable burden sharing.  Recently the EC Commission approved a communication to Council on &ldquo;A Community Strategy to limit Carbon Dioxide emissions and to improve energy efficiency&rdquo;. The document contains many proposals to achieve stabilisation of CO2 emissions by 2000, including policies such as energy efficiency and conservation and switching to cleaner fuels.  It also suggests consideration of a new fiscal initiative in the form of an energy CO2 tax.</P>
      <P>The communication has been presented by the Commission to Councils of Environment Ministers, EcoFin Ministers and Energy Ministers.  An <i>ad hoc</i> Energy/Environment Working Group has begun consideration of the communication preparatory to a Joint Energy/Environment Council scheduled for December.  I have every intention of participating in the Joint Councils deliberations. A fiscal working group has been set up also to complement the work of the joint working group and to report to the EcoFin Council in December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues raised in the document are fundamental and extremely complex and must be considered from many angles. They range for example, from elements of existing policy such as energy conservation and efficiency and renewable energy policy to new emphasis away from carbon fuels, particularly solid fuels on which we are substantially dependant. They also include proposals for a tax on energy which would have serious consequences for industrial development, transport and the economy generally. The implications of such proposals, particularly the taxation element, for the cost of energy, security <Col N="343" /> of supply, effects on the development of our own indigenous resources of peat and gas, investment in fuel switching and the competitiveness of the Irish economy will all have to be considered and weighed against the contribution towards reduced CO2 emissions and improvement in the environment.  Specifically, their contribution towards the target of stabilisation of CO2 emissions by 2000 at 1990 levels will have to be considered very carefully.</P>
    <P>An assessment of these far-reaching proposals is taking place at present between the relevant Departments including the Department of Energy.  The ESRI are also examining the proposals separately and have published their preliminary findings.  Indications at this stage are that the tax proposals would significantly increase energy costs and prices particularly for electricity consumers, transport users and for low income households and have only modest direct effect on limiting CO2 emissions.  The overall impact on the national economy would depend on the nature of measures taken to utilise the proceeds of the tax.</P>
    <P>The stance adopted by the Community in relation to the Commission's proposals must also take into account the position likely to be adopted by other major industrial countries.  As there are many uncertainties affecting this question, it is important that the community should adopt a flexible strategy and avoid a position which might be incompatible with that of other major players, and put the Community at a disadvantage in terms of competitiveness, job creation and energy security.  I have said at the Energy Council on 29 October last that this is a global problem and solutions must be of a global nature and broadly acceptable to all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has the advantage of having been at these councils, but is it not now a racing certainty that we will have to cope with a tax of this nature on the scale being proposed at the moment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is strange in the context of the level of work going on with the ESRI in anticipation of such a tax. Does the Minister think, in the context of the discussions going on, that it will be possible to achieve a derogation for Ireland in relation to this because of our unique dependence on carbon-based fuels and because unlike many of our EC partners we are at a growth stage in demand for energy?  In the context of the discussions to date does the Minister believe that our position and that of some other developing countries in the EC will be looked at sympathetically and will the Minister seek that actively?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals are at a very early stage and only represent part of the idea the Commission have put forward for achieving the 2000 target of stabilising the 1990 level of emissions. These proposals in their current form, as the Deputy suggested, would have serious consequences for our economy because we are so heavily dependent on some of the carbon fuels the use of which is to be reduced.  We have relied heavily on developing indigenous fuels such as peat, and we rely heavily now on coal to produce electricity.  In view of this we are obviously greatly concerned to keep a careful eye on developments in this area. This proposal has a long way to go before it ever becomes a reality, if it ever does.</P>

      <P>Very well, but other Deputies will insist that their questions are also of great importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I do not share the Minister's optimism in relation to the likelihood of this not coming to pass.  We will have to cope with it in some way or another.  The Minister in his reply said that how we would apply the proceeds of the tax would obviously make a great difference as to how any such tax would affect our economy.  In the context of thinking in relation to this, can the Minister give any indication of what might be Government policy in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The implications of these proposals are fundamental and will have far-reaching effects on our economy. They will have to be carefully examined here.  Our approach is to seek maximum flexibility in the Commission and the Council attitude to the proposals, and to carry out the maximum amount of research into the possible implications of the proposals if implemented.  The initial results of, for instance, the ESRI study on the macro economic impact of the proposals, with regard to the domestic sector which were published recently, indicate that the tax proposal will increase energy prices by 15 per cent with an associated reduction in consumption of only 4 per cent.  The study also shows that such a tax would bear most heavily on the low income groups in our society and that is also a matter of very great concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Relatively speaking the proposal has more far-reaching implications for us than for any other country.  I am not optimistic about the outcome.  I do not know what the outcome will be, but I foresee certain difficulties with regard to this proposal as there is not ready agreement among the member states to adopt it at an early date.  We are anxious to deal with the CO2 emissions and their effect on global climate but any move which the Community might make on its own which would result in serious economic disdvantage for the Community <i>vis-à-vis</i> its trading competitors in the world would have <Col N="346" /> a very serious effect while perhaps not having such a dramatic effect on the overall level of CO2 emissions on a global scale.  This is a global problem and all the major countries should come together to find a global solution.  If there is to be a global energy tax, so be it, but there are particular problems for us and other member states if it is to be advanced solely as a European contribution to the solution without our trading partners making a similar move in that direction. That is fairly clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 10, 12 and 90 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning for this gas interconnector is now at an advanced stage.  There are <Col N="347" /> various aspects to the project which are scheduled for execution at different times throughout the period up to the target completion date in October 1993.</P>
    <P>The pipeline route will run from North County Dublin to Moffat in Southern Scotland and engineering design is now well under way.</P>
    <P>I expect to put the project before the Government for final approval soon so that the major procurement and construction contracts can be placed.  Construction should commence in March 1993.  Notices on the forthcoming award of contracts have been placed in the Official Journal of the European Communities in compliance with the procedures laid down in the EC Directives on Public Procurement.</P>
    <P>A formal application has been made for assistance under the European Commission's REGEN initiatives, but no decision has yet been taken on the amount of the allocation to the Irish project.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention that the pipeline will be controlled and operated by Bord Gáis Éireann.  An initial effect of the availability of the inter-connector pipeline will be a guarantee of supplies, both short and long term, irrespective of the results of the new drilling programme I announced a few days ago, and to ensure back-up supplies.  The imported gas, initially, will be used mainly for electricity generation, but as indigenous reserves are depleted, increasing amounts will go to BGE's other markets.  Gas will be distributed via Bord Gáis's distribution network.</P>
    <P>The issue of third party access is currently the subject of intensive discussion within the EC.  These discussions may well, in time, translate into policy decisions on access which would, in turn, affect the way in which the pipeline was operated.</P>
    <P>As the electricity sector in Northern Ireland is about to be privatised, gas may be used to fuel one or more of the power stations there.  The possibility of a Northern Ireland link with our project would, therefore, be a matter for the Northern <Col N="348" /> Ireland authorities and the eventual owners of the power stations to decide on.  My Department maintain close contact with the Northern Ireland authorities on the question.</P>
    <P>Concerning the new drilling programme already mentioned, I have substantially reached agreement with Marathon Ireland, Ltd., on a new programme of exploration activity to cover the period 1992 to 1996.  In addition, Marathon and BGE have almost reached agreement on an arrangement for additional gas production from Kinsale Head through the installation of enhanced compression facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the cost of the project yet been estimated?  In addition, what stage have the discussions with regard to the apportionment of that cost reached?  What percentage of the cost does the Minister feel he will have to come up with and what funding is expected from the European Community? Finally, am I correct in interpreting the Minister's reply to me that the inter-connector, when in place, will be facilitating the importation of gas rather than the exportation of gas?  I would like the Minister to comment on that.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that the gas resource which is being supplied through the Kinsale Head gas field and the Ballycotton field has a limited life and it is prudent that we make arrangements for alternative sources of supply.  Unless there is a substantial further find of gas, of course, the whole purpose of putting down the pipeline is to give a guarantee of security of supply into the future to all the gas customers domestic, commercial and industrial, who are using gas extensively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the cost of the construction of the pipeline, the preliminary estimates are that the cost will be about £240 million at 1990 prices.  I have already confirmed that we have made an application to the Community for financial assistance under the REGEN programme and I am hopeful that we will <Col N="349" /> get substantial financial assistance from the Community towards the total cost of this project.  The project itself has already been approved for funding under this programme but the amount of the financial contribution from the Community has not yet been determined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 36, 40, 53 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The growing accumulation of nuclear waste at Sellafield is a matter of great concern to the Government and the public and is not acceptable as a long term arrangement.</P>
      <P>Construction of an underground repository for final disposal of waste is seen by the British authorities as a solution to this problem.  The risks from these proposals depend on many factors such as detailed design of safety barriers, the geological characteristics of the selected site and the arrangements for conditioning, packaging, monitoring and, if necessary, retrieval of waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 23 July 1991, UK NIREX Ltd, the British nuclear industry's waste disposal executive, announced that it has chosen Sellafield as the site at which it will concentrate its further investigations for the development of an underground repository for intermediate and low-level radioactive waste.  With a view to ensuring that we are fully informed of developments, I immediately arranged for officials of my Department to meet that day on the matter with their British counterparts in London.  It was agreed at that meeting to bring forward a meeting of the intergovernmental Ireland/UK Contract <Col N="351" /> Group on Nuclear Matters, scheduled for later in the year, for a full exchange of views and information in the matter.</P>
    <P>In recent months I have written to the Secretaries of State for Energy and for the Environment expressing the strong opposition of the Irish Government to the continued operation of Sellafield and expressed deep concern in relation to the proposed repository.  Also, I recently reiterated our concerns in the course of a recent meeting with the British Ambassador.</P>
    <P>At the Contact Group meeting which took place on 9 September my Department again covered Irish concerns about the proposed repository to the UK side. Information was provided to my Department's officials on on-going site investigations and repository design studies and further information will be obtained in due course when the results of those studies and investigations are available.</P>
    <P>The UK representatives said that it was envisaged that an application for planning permission would be submitted in autumn 1992 and that a public inquiry would be an intrinsic part of this process. My Department and the Nuclear Energy Board will carefully study any such application, of course, and advise me of their views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister and his Department share the Fine Gael view that an underground repository is essentially unproven, experimental technology? What advice has he received from the Nuclear Energy Board in relation to that means of disposing of or storing waste as compared with the over ground system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>What the United Kingdom authorities have done is selected a site where they will carry out extensive research into the potential of the site to be used as a repository for waste.  The studies they intend to carry out may in time show that the site, for geological and other reasons, is not suitable but I am not in a position to form an opinion along those lines.  As the Deputy is <Col N="352" /> aware, the reason we are objecting to this nuclear waste repository is that we are legitimately concerned about the danger it would pose to our community given its close proximity to us.  We are continuing our campaign to make known to the United Kingdom authorities the Government's opposition to what they have proposed. As I explained to the House, as a sovereign government they can ignore our campaign, pleadings, arguments and requests in this matter and proceed.  As a member of the European Community, we are trying to have a European-wide approach adopted to these matters.  We are continuing our efforts in that regard also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the British Government and NIREX are giving him a bum steer in that on the one hand, they are saying they are going to carry out extensive research but, on the other, they are telling him that they will initiate an application for planning permission?  Will the Minister accept that NIREX have their sights firmly fixed on the Sellafield site and that, irrespective of our objections, they intend to proceed? Has the Minister consulted his legal advisers and the Attorney General with regard to the provisions of the EUR-ATOM Treaty to ensure that the Government's view is not ignored, as he suggests it might or possibly will be given previous experience?  There is power and authority under the Treaty to insist on consultations and that regard be had for the interests of the Irish community in any developments in the atomic area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined to the House on numerous occasions the position with regard to the Government taking legal action on this matter.  That position would obtain with regard to the NIREX proposals and the other facilities at Sellafield.  Given that they are proceeding to make an application for planning permission, an environmental impact statement will have to be submitted by them.  An assessment can then be made of the environmental implications of the proposals they have made.  We will keep <Col N="353" /> a careful eye on any information made available on this project.  Extensive planning will be required on the British side before they arrive at a position where they will make a decision to proceed with this facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reconsider his view that it would be inappropriate for him to hold a view as to the scientific soundness of the new method of dumping?  Only last week we heard from some of the scientists of the Nuclear Energy Board who are to the forefront in the latest experiments in nuclear science. That could be a very useful weapon.  I ask the Minister to review his approach and seek the advice of the Nuclear Energy Board in relation to this means of storage as against existing methods. This is the first opportunity I have had to press the Minister on this issue largely because these questions follow questions to the Taoiseach which take up most of the time available.  Will the Minister say why he turned his back on the possibility of taking a legal case at any level, either in the European Court, the World Court or under the various treaties?  I accept, because the level of emission has reduced substantially, we would find it hard to have Sellafield closed.  If we could prove that existing pollution of the Irish Sea can be directly related to Sellafield, and is of such a nature that substantial compensation is warranted, we might be in a position indirectly to make Sellafield and its expansion in particular uneconomic. Would that be worth pursuing even if we do not achieve our objective of a total shut down through direct legal means?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

I have extended an invitation to the spokespersons of the other parties to present me with the case they think I could take and I have assured them that I will have it studied carefully by the Attorney General to see is a case could be brought.</P>

      <P>They did not.  I went to the trouble of arranging for the Greenpeace legal adviser to sit down with the staff of the Attorney General to discuss what they were suggesting we might do but they did not indicate that they believed there was any possibility of us winning such a case.  They did not present the specific grounds or evidence on which we could take such a case.  It is pointless repeating this every time I answer Parliamentary Questions on this matter.  I do not mind repeating it but I am sure the general public must ask what is the point playing this record continuously.  I have an open mind on the matter but neither I, the Attorney General's office or Greenpeace have been able to establish a case.  If Deputies who continue to raise this matter here want to present me with the bones of a case I will be happy to take action but they have not done so.  Other than raising the matter with me at Question Time they have not come forward with any specific or substantive case, backed up with evidence, which would justify my taking such a stance against another sovereign state.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the Minister's statement with regard to Greenpeace. My information is the contrary and I will produce evidence to that effect. On the question of planning permission which, as the Minister said, NIREX will have to obtain from the British planning <Col N="355" /> authorities in September next year it is not quite clear from his reply whether we will have a formal input into the planning process.  Will he tell the House whether we will have a formal input and, if so, does he propose making a formal protest or lodging an objection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amused at the Deputy suggesting that he is going to come forward with a case because this is about the fifth occasion on which I have invited him to do so but he has not.  I should like to go into this matter in more detail with regard to NIREX, the position on planning and when the decision will be made.  As I understand it, the United Kingdom side clearly see, on current indications, the area around Sellafield as suitable but it is too early for them to come to conclusions pending the receipt of further information on many aspects which have to be considered in regard to the site's suitability for that type of storage.</P>
      <P>These kind of aspects include faulting, fractures, permeability, relationship of host rock with surrounding rock, water gradient and a whole series of other relevent matters.  This repository, as proposed, will comprise 26 vaults located 800 metres underground; four would be built in the first instance and others added as required.  That is the proposal &mdash; if it ever comes into being.  The repository will be 600 metres long, 25 metres wide and 35 metres high; each vault will be progessively sealed and the waste will be grouted in a special concrete mix which will allow for retrieval, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is envisaged that a multi-barrier approach will prevent the migration of radioactivity from the waste, that is waste in drums, drums in an overpack, over-packs in a vault, and back-filled vaults in a body of rock.  An environmental impact assessment must be submitted with the planning application and that, of course, with all the other documents, will be open to public inspection.  Our officials will have free access to the documents and will be able to study them carefully.  The <Col N="356" /> Secretary of State will call in the application and he will initiate a public inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>He has indicated that he will initiate a public inquiry.  If the planning application was granted it would still be necessary to satisfy the requirements of various licensing authorities before construction and operation could proceed. These would include the Health and Safety Executive, the Department of the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture and Food and Fisheries.  That is the extent of the kind of information which has been made available to my Department by the United Kingdom authorities in regard to their proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state succinctly if he will take a lead from Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation who were represented at the Wilva B and Hinkley Point inquiries?  Will he now ensure that our Government will be represented at the forthcoming inquiry in to the NIREX proposal given the scale of the proposal, its profound implications on the whole security and future safety of the Irish Sea and his own belief that, in any event, our Government's views could well be ignored by either the British Government or NIREX&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have responsibility to operate in a Government to Government arena and it would be inappropriate for me, as a representative of the Government with responsibility in these matters, to participate at the other level.

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann have promoted combined heat and power (CHP) projects since their inception in <Col N="358" /> this country and the board have agreed pricing proposals on all projects that have been completed.  I am aware of problems in regard to gas supply negotiations which arose in connection with one current CHP project.  I understand, however, that those problems are now very close to resolution.</P>
      <P>With regard to general pricing policy for CHP projects, it must be borne in mind that Bord Gáis have a statutory obligation to earn a reasonable return on capital employed.  They cannot, therefore, price gas provided for CHP at a discount below alternative uses for natural gas.  Gas provided for CHP is, however, priced competitively in relation to alternative fuels for co-generation.</P>
      <P>As regards grant aid for CHP related projects, I might mention that demonstration projects in this area may compete for grant aid under the European Community's THERMIE programme for the promotion of energy technologies in Europe, and several Irish projects have benefited from this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that measures of this kind often require substantial capital imputs and that heat and power combination schemes have been identified as one of the major areas of possible contribution to the reduction of emissions referred to earlier, does the Minister anticipate that he will be in a position to provide grants in the years ahead to give an impetus to these desirable developments?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, in the present financial situation I cannot see how I would be in a position to introduce grants to support CHP projects.  I have indicated that there is finance available for certain projects which qualify under the THERMIE programme.  Of the six Irish projects approved from the first call to tender for the THERMIE programme in 1990 one was a gas fired CHP project involving a hotel group.  In the second round announced recently seven Irish proposals were approved, including two CHP projects, one of which involved a gas turbine.  Prior to the introduction of <Col N="359" /> the THERMIE programme, Bord Gáis were involved in the installation of two CHP projects in the Cork area.  Both of these received EC assistance under an earlier programme.</P>

This consideration is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement in the near future.  The purpose of the changes, which are entirely of a procedural nature, will be to ease the burden on the minerals industry and to speed up the application and renewal system.

I have adhered to that since becoming Minister.  The Department issue prospecting licences and it is up to the successful prospector, if he makes what he considers to be a commercially viable find, to come forward with a proposal to develop a mine.  The only projects I have had to deal with so far have been very small ones.  One can read in the media about certain finds but until the promoters of those &ldquo;finds&rdquo; come forward to my Department with an application for a mining lease I am not involved.  When I am asked to deal with a mining licence application, I am very careful to consider the environmental aspect involved.</P>

      <P>Accepting entirely that we are trying to marry two competing issues, each very valuable, would the Minister accept that a Green Paper might be of assistance in bringing these issues to the fore and having them resolved so that everybody would understand the ground rules and there would be some clarity and direction in that area?</P>

      <P>I am not clear as to what the Deputy is getting at.  If she would be specific I would deal with the matter.  I have made it quite clear that in regard to environmental concerns which may be legitimately held by any citizen arising from possible proposals for a mining development, the assurances are there that no mining licence will be granted without an independent body, with whom I would have to be satisfied, confirming that the project complies with all modern-day environmental requirements of the highest possible standards. The applicant would then have to obtain planning permission which would also involve an assessment of an environmental impact statement.  Therefore there is a double protection for the community against any major mistakes being made in the mining development arena. I am fully supportive of the need to <Col N="361" /> develop our mineral resources to the advantage of the economy and of our people, but I will support such developments only where they comply with the strictest possible environmental requirements. The mining industry have clearly indicated that they will willingly comply with whatever environmental requirements are laid down by the State or local authority.  Therefore, every assurance has been given to the people and to the industry that great care will be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the whole procedure in the way we deal with mining is incorrect in that the first stage involves the obtaining of a prospecting licence?  These licences are given without having to go through an objection procedure?  When a mining company gets a prospecting licence considerable environmental damage can be done to an area even if no mining takes place, as happened in Croagh Patrick. Surely the Minister would agree that there should be an input from the public at the prospecting stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the Deputy's suggestion that prospecting activity damages the environment.  He quoted the only known case in the Department of Energy where any serious complaints were legitimately made after some interference with the local environment which was not capable of being properly restored &mdash; the case of the Croagh Patrick development.  Prospecting involves boring a very small hole in the ground to see what is beneath the surface.  It cannot be deemed to be an activity which takes from the environmental or scenic amenity or from the value of an area from an environmental point of view.  It is wrong of Deputies to support the notion that that is so.  There is no history in the files of the Department of Energy to confirm any great public concern about the activities of prospecting companies other than the one mentioned.  The State has very clearly excluded certain areas from ever prospecting and consequently from mining by stating that no licences for prospecting will issue in the national <Col N="362" /> parks and the Croagh Patrick area.  Every reasonable step required has been taken in this area.  It is wrong to suggest that prospecting is an activity about which one should be greatly concerned.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's response.  I tabled the question as a result of a number of encounters with constituents regarding this scheme, and I am sure the Minister empathises with these people.  First, an increasing number of part-time farmers are excluded from benefit under this scheme, and second, a large number of non-farmers wish to reside in rural areas but the cost of installing electrical facilities is prohibitive.  I would have thought that the Minister could consider introducing some grant aid, perhaps even on a means tested basis, for certain categories of people, particularly those to whom I referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, this scheme which was sponsored by the EC was introduced to assist those involved in the agriculture industry and living in disadvantaged areas where the cost of installing electricity to the house or to the farm enterprise was substantial.  The grant was a generous one, covering four-fifths of the cost of installing the electricity. The scheme was designed to help and promote those whose principal source of income was farming, and any person, 50 per cent of whose income was from another source, would not qualify.  That rule has been in operation since the scheme was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may know that the Community scheme ceased last year and due to special measures which I took, to <Col N="363" /> which the Minister for Finance and the Government agreed, the scheme has been continued, funded solely from sources within this country &mdash; the Department and the ESB.  It is designed to help those in farming who are without electricity but need it to improve their farm enterprise. The scheme is now operated without any assistance from the Community.  It would not be possible for me to extend it beyond the limits for which it was originally introduced. I am merely continuing what was a good EC scheme but which is now totally Irish-funded.  It is not possible in present circumstances to concede the Deputy's point.  There will always be special cases but there has to be a cut-off point.  This is a fair scheme geared to help those in agriculture.  These people can have an off-farm income but it must not exceed 50 per cent of the gross income.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 32 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>My Department have already issued a press statement regarding this matter on 18 October 1991.  On the same date, at my request, the ESB also issued a full and comprehensive statement giving the full details including the information requested by the Deputies.  I can provide copies of both statements to the Deputies if they so desire.  In my statement I made it clear that my Department had no input into the decision, nor were they consulted or advised about the matter.  The decision to go ahead with the wind power project was taken by the ESB management in 1988.  The ESB have assured me that the Inismhicealáin project was at all stages carried out fully in accordance with their standard procedures in relation to expenditure, authorisation of work, cost management accounting and invoicing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister satisfied himself that this was the most suitable site for the experiment in question?  It seems extraordinary that with a coastline of some 2,000 to 3,000 miles from Malin Head to Mizen Head, the most suitable site for a windmill experiment &mdash; which I fully support &mdash; should be an off-shore island.  Surely, there are many landheads accessible by road which that could have been chosen to locate the windmill &mdash; because regular monitoring is part of the experiment &mdash; rather than an island?</P>

      <P>The ESB had been involved, and they chose the location to carry out this experiment.  I am not an expert on wind energy.  I am, however, very anxious to promote sources of renewable energy and I am actively involved in promoting a wind farm in County Mayo, with the assistance of Community funding.  I am deeply involved in trying to get that project off the ground following public advertisement of the project last year.  The ESB have informed me that the wind energy experiment projects in which they are involved are divided into two categories: one, wind energy potential for off-shore islands and two, a research project into mainland based wind projects. The choice of island was a matter for the ESB and I was not involved in that choice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept it was necessary when carrying out tests on the windmill to go to an off-shore island? I would have expected the Minister to satisfy himself about this.  The Minister will accept that the public have questioned this because the Taoiseach owns the island in question and the choice of location appears to be odd to many.  I thought the Minister would have availed of this opportunity to assure the public that there was nothing wrong with their choice and that it was the correct thing to do.  However, the public still question why, out of all the available coastline the ESB chose an unoccupied, not very accessible island owned by the Taoiseach. I think the general public would welcome a statement from the Minister on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be critical of the ESB but I think they acted imprudently in this matter.  I do not think an off-shore island was the wisest choice of location to carry out a wind energy experiment. That is my personal view and I have held it for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> I was involved some years ago in advocating a wind experiment on Inis Thiar off the Galway coast when the islands were about to get an electricity system. The late George Colley, the then Minister for Energy, proceeded with the erection of a windmill on Inis Thiar which was never a success.  The main difficulty was that whenever it broke down there was the difficulty of gaining access to the island to carry out repairs.  This was ten or 12 years ago when wind energy was at the developmental stage and there were a great many teething problems.  Happily technology has developed greatly since then and the problems which arose at that stage would not normally arise now. The lesson I would have drawn from those earlier experiments in which the ESB were involved was that an island was not the wisest choice or the most beneficial place for an experiment because of the difficulties of access.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has it wrong. The wind driven electricity generator on Cape Clear is, I understand, owned by a private German-based company and it was they who decided to withdraw that facility from the island.  They were selling electricity into the ESB grid on the island and, of course, the ESB were supplying the island with electricity from their own generators.  There is no threat to the electricity supply to the islanders of Cape Clear because the ESB supply is adequate and there are a number of stand-by generators.  The supply is safe and secure.  The owner of the wind driven electricity generator decided for his own reasons to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>On a point of Order, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I seek your guidance. I sought an Adjournment debate on the disposal of lands at Kilsealy by Teagasc.  I was informed by the Ceann Comhairle that it did not have ministerial approval.  Given that the disposal of any asssets such as land requires the approval not only of the Minister for Agriculture and Food but also of the Minister for Finance, I ask whether that could be brought to your attention?  I want to place on record my objection to that decision made by the Ceann Comhairle.</P>

The advice is that the decision of the Ceann Comhairle cannot be overriden, nor is it in any way unacceptable to the present occupant of the Chair.  Consequently I must ask Deputy Ryan to reside patiently and quietly with whatever disappointment he has.  Thank you.</P>

    <P>In relation to amendment No. 1, section 11 (a) provides that the general prohibition or regulation on discharges of oil or other substances under section 10 shall not apply in situations in which a discharge is necessary to secure the safety of a ship or the saving of life at sea.</P>
    <P>Section 11 (a), as originally drafted, was intended to apply to tests to decide whether a discharge is permitted under the provisions of this section &mdash; (1) whether the discharge is necessary and (2) whether it is reasonable.  The original wording read:</P>
    <P>...if such discharge was, having regard to all the circumstances, reasonably necessary; </P>
    <P>I am most anxious to require that not only does the particular master of the ship in question believe a discharge is necessary but that his belief be shared by all reasonable masters having regard to all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Seanad objected to the wording on the grounds that the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; could not be qualified and that the phrase <Col N="405" />&ldquo;reasonably necessary&rdquo; might be interpreted as not entirely necessary.  Therefore, to meet Senators' concerns on this and, after consultation with the Attorney General, the wording of this amendment was proposed by me and accepted by the Seanad.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendments Nos. 2 and 3 to the First Schedule is to repeal section 448 (2) of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  For the information of the House I should say that section 448 (2) of the 1894 Act reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Where any dangerous goods or any goods which in the judgment of the master or owner of the vessel are dangerous goods have been sent or brought aboard any vessel without being marked as aforesaid or without such notice having been given as aforesaid the master or owner of the vessel may cause those goods to be thrown overboard together with any package in which they are contained and neither the master nor the owner of the vessel shall be subject to any liability, civil or criminal, in any court for so throwing the goods overboard. </P>
    <P>The power under this subsection to the owner or master of a vessel to throw dangerous goods overboard is considered subversive of the provisions of this Bill and ought to be repealed.  A master may, under section 11 of this Bill, discharge harmful substances for the purpose of securing the safety of a ship or safety of life at sea if such discharge was, having regard to all the circumstances, necessary and reasonable.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendments to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for having defined the amendment and the necessity for it.  I have been informed by our colleagues in the Seanad that this is really a matter of accuracy of language and of syntax in so far as one does not qualify the phrase &ldquo;if necesary&rdquo; which could lead to a certain amount of confusion of definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We accept these amendments.  I would <Col N="406" /> say merely that perhaps this is one of the tasks undertaken by the Upper House when they are afforded an opportunity of examining in depth the language and its accuracy, not merely in regard to legal definition but also in regard to the syntax.</P>

      <P>I too am delighted to note that there is a much higher standard of English in the Upper House than here. Sometimes I wondered what was the purpose of the Seanad.  Now I know; they are there to correct our English.  I am very glad to support this amendment.  I was particularly glad to hear the Minister's definition of the term &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in that he defined it as a condition which would have to be shared by all reasonable master of vessels.  That is a good precaution.</P>
      <P>I presume &mdash; perhaps the Minister would confirm this &mdash; that if that is the definition of the term &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in section 11 (a) it would also be the definition of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in section 11 (b), that it would have to be a view shared by all reasonable masters of ships.  I support the amendments tabled.</P>

      <P>I too support the amendments.  When I first read amendment No. 1 I felt it was simply a matter of juggling with words.  I can see the necessity for it.  Nonetheless we did scrutinise this section in the House when it was first before us and gave an indication that we were somewhat concerned about it.  It must be remembered that we are talking about reasonable people doing reasonable things.  Unfortunately, there are masters of ships who are not reasonable and can be unscrupulous, as has been witnessed on many occasions.</P>
      <P>I fully support the three amendments before the House.  While we felt we had teased out these matters, obviously our grammar was not correct and in that respect we are grateful to the Upper House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir.  I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1), lines 19 and 20, to delete the definition of &ldquo;patent&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `patent' means a patent pursuant to Part II or Part III of this Act, except where the context otherwise requires;&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an extremely difficult, complex Bill that is being dealt with in the wrong place if you do not mind me saying so, Sir.  This is a Bill being dealt with in this <Col N="408" /> House by amateurs whereas it warrants a professional approach.  This is definitely a Committee Stage type Bill that should be debated within a small committee of this House with Members backed up by the relevant expertise, including civil servants who would be allowed contribute to the debate.  Because of its complexity and importance I have grave fears that our lack of knowledge may will mean that, at the end of the day we will produce a Bill that does not fulfil the purpose for which it was designed.  I merely want to make that point.</P>
    <P>A patent is a property right granted by the State authority which excludes others from the use or benefit of that patented invention without the consent of the patentee. A patent does not confer a positive right to use the invention because freedom of use may be dependent on other rights.  It has been put to me that this method of interpretation would make it easier for those who will be operating the Act and applying for patents under the Act.</P>

      <P>The amendment tabled by Deputy Barry is the same as amendment No. 2 in the Minister's name.  The wording of the Minister's amendment is more accurate and has been vetted by the parliamentary draftsman.  In the circumstances I am not accepting Deputy Barry's amendment. Two of the amendments relate to the definition of &ldquo;patent&rdquo; and &ldquo;patent agent&rdquo; respectively and make each definition more technically precise.  This is a very technical Bill but we have given it a considerable amount of thought and time. The points put forward by Deputy Barry are relevant but we have accepted the advice of the parliamentary draftsman.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The words which I propose to delete do not appear to be appropriate as the amendment of the European Patent Convention does not necessarily require an amendment to national law.  The European Community member states agreed to the resolution annexed to the CPC that they would bring their national laws into conformity as far as practicable with the corresponding provisions in the three patent conventions.

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 13, paragraph (b), lines 6 and 7, to delete &ldquo;other than a micro-biological process or the products thereof&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Like the proceding section, section 10 comes under Chapter II which deals with patentability.  This section refers to the two basic exceptions to patentability. Section 10 (b) provides that a patent shall not be granted in respect of a &ldquo;plant or animal variety or an essentially biological process for the production of plants or animals other than a micro-biological process or the products thereof&rdquo;.  I have serious reservations about the last part of this subsection.  Therefore, my amendment proposes the deletion of all words after the word &ldquo;other&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I have proposed the deletion of these words is that there is a principled basis for objection to the concept of patenting any life form.  This concept is symptomatic of a society who are lacking in the proper respect and understanding for the natural world and consider it to be merely a resource of our industrial society.  The basic justification for patents is that they encourage the development of new scientific techniques. Given the level of our understanding of micro-biological science and genetic engineering, and our limited understanding of the fundamental science and environmental effect it is not appropriate that we should use such techniques. The Green Party, Comhaontas <Col N="413" /> Glas, believe that this represents a manipulation of the natural world by genetic enginnering and that it is a very serious manifestation of human arrogance. I call upon the Minister and the House to support this amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment would run counter to the European Patent Convention which we will ratify after enactment of the Bill. It would also create legal problems in that applicants making an Irish application would be disadvantaged <i>vis-à-vis</i> those seeking an Irish patent through a European application.

      <P>The Minister seems to be presenting us with a <i>fait accompli.</i>  He said that because section 10 is required by the European Patent Convention and we must accept this convention he really has no function in the matter.  I put it to the House that this is another example of the way in which our soverenity is being infringed by our membership of the EC and our involvement in a Europe which is increasingly going down the wrong road.

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 15, lines 22 to 24, to delete subsection (3). </P>
      <P>Section 18 (3) states: &ldquo;Every application shall be accompanied by the prescribed filing fee unless the Minister prescribes a later date by which such fee may be paid&rdquo;.  I cannot see the necessity for this provision which runs counter to the practice throughout the world of not demanding fees when an application is made for a patent.  I do not think any other signatories to this convention require an application for a patent to be accompanied by the prescribed filing fee. When I understand the concern of the Government to ensure that they get the money and that everything is in order, the international practice, which has been followed here up to now, should be continued. The World Intellectual Property Organisation have published an applicants guide to the Patent Co-operation Treaty in which they state that all fees can be paid within one month after the date of receipt of the international application by the receiving office.  This means that people who apply for a patent right outside this country or to any international body will not have to pay a fee until one month after the date of receipt of the application, whereas in this country the Government are asking people to accompany their applications with filing fees.  This will hurt the small person more than the big person, the large chemical companies will not mind accompanying their filing application with a fee, regardless of the size of the fee the fee probably varies &mdash; but perhaps the Minister would expand on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small person whom we want to encourage to be innovative, to be inventive, to register new patents, new inventions, etc., will be affected because he is probably devoting a considerable period of his time &mdash; he is certainly devoting some of his capital &mdash; to getting something ready for patent and now he is being <Col N="416" /> asked, against what has been the custom up to now and which is not the custom in other parts of the world, to pay up front. I do not see why the Minister should write into an Act the fact that somebody must accompany his filing with a fee; I do not think that is necessary.  My amendment suggests that this be deleted and the matter of fees could be done by regulation rather than included in an Act.  I am not sure whether there is any Act on the Statute Book which states that an application must be accompanied with a fee as is prescribed here.  I suggest to the Minister to continue what has been the practice up to now, not to take us out of conformity with what is happening internationally and in Europe which is a member of the co-signatories of this convention in Europe.  In fairness to the small inventors the Minister should accept my amendment which seeks to withdraw subsection (3) of section 18 and allow what has been the practice up to now to continue.</P>
    <P>The World International Property Organisation which has published a guide to the Patent Co-operation Treaty draws attention to the fact that all fees must be paid within one month.  This is actually written into the guide.  This is the practice under the Patent Co-operation Treaty and is endorsed by the World International Property Organisation.  It is not obvious to me what the reason is for demanding fees up front and perhaps the Minister would explain.  I know there is a let-out for the Minister in section 18 (3) which states:</P>
    <P>...the Minister prescribes a later date by which such fee may be paid. </P>
    <P>I think that subjection is unnecessary.  If the Minister intends to provide a later date surely he would do it with conformity with the World International Property Organisation.  What he appears to be doing in this instance is a backdoor method of allowing himself the possibility at some stage in the future, if the funds of Government so demand, to get money up front.  At present, in the Patents <Col N="417" /> Office, there are 19,600 to 20,000 applicants for patents, some of which are waiting for years to be adjudicated on.  Under the Minister's proposal they are out of money but under this proposal they would be short of money much sooner.</P>
    <P>If the filing fee is £100 and if the number of applications is 6,000 or 7,000, as the Minister said in reply to a parliamentary question some months ago, that would amount to a considerable sum of money.  In fairness to the small person who would be one of the beneficiaries under the provisions of this Bill and also not to have us out of step with the rest of Europe and in order that we would not break a tradition that has been in existence for a number of years I would ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to inform Deputy Barry that there is no tradition at present for a delay in putting in a filing fee.  There are about 4,500 applications per annum.  We are allowing flexibility here for the Minister and future Ministers of the Department to decide on this issue. It is necessary at this stage bearing in mind the future of the Patents Office that the fee would be required on filing an application.  The situation is that the subsection does allow the Minister to charge the filing fee at a later date than the filing date if he so decides.  We are only confirming the present situation which is that the fee is provided on the day the application is filed.  Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 seek to interfere with the arrangements to charge a filing fee as discussed above and they are not acceptable.  Needless to say it is absolutely necessary that there would be funding to pay for the services of the Patents Office.  It is appropriate that we should retain this flexibility for the Minister now and in the future, he requires a fee to be paid on the day but if he so desires he may decide to delay it if representations are made in that regard.</P>

      <P>I must admit I have some doubts about Deputy Barry's amendment. It is not inappropriate that some fee could reasonably be charged on making an application and lodging the papers for an application &mdash; I do not know why a patent should be different from everything else one applies for.  If a fee is charged it is probably required for no other purpose than to avoid frivolous applications being made and much time being taken up and a lot of &ldquo;try-ons&rdquo; being made.  It is important that these applications should be bona fides and genuine.  Staff have to be paid and provided for in the Patents Office.  If an application fee is not paid then the general body of taxpayers have to pick up the tab instead. This at least would make some contribution towards the cost of running the Patents Office.  The amount of the fee might be a matter that could more appropriately be debated as to whether the fee of £80 is too high or too low.  Deputy Barry's amendment appears to take the general view that it should be open to any person to put in an application and have no fee paid whatsoever to the Patents Office.  I do not think that is realistic or would bear a common position with other comparable situations. The fee should not be so high that it would discourage any person who may bona fides think they have a suitable invention they want to patent or so low that it would encourage abuse of the process, &ldquo;try-ons&rdquo; and a large number of <Col N="419" /> frivolous applications being put up which were not genuine.  In those circumstances I would not be in a position, unfortunately, on this occasion, to support Deputy Barry's amendment on this issue.</P>

      <P>My understanding was that the present position was that the fees were not looked for on filing but I accept the Minister's word on that.  We are out of step with virtually all of western Europe.  I believe that at the conference in The Hague in June of this year we were rather embarrassed in this regard and that we were the only people who wished to put this fee up front and that everybody else in Europe agreed, as I said, with the guide to the European Patent Convention.  It is not a major point whether the fee is paid up front but it seems unnecessary that on this occasion, given all the signatories of this convention, we should be out of step in looking for fees with the filing rather than as is the case in other countries, accepting the fees 12 months after the date of filing.</P>

      <P>In page 20, before section 31, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;31.&mdash;Where an applicant makes the request provided for in section 29 (1), <Col N="424" /> or submits as evidence under section 30 (1) (a) the results of a prescribed search, the Controller shall cause the patent application to be subjected to such examination as is necessary to determine whether the patent application complies with the requirements of the Act in the light of the search report, or the results of the search, as the case may be.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will bear with me while I try to get my point across.  This is an important commonsense amendment and should be accepted.  What we are asking is that in cases where Irish patent specifications do not conform with European and United Kingdom patent specifications, technical examination should occur in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The suggestion in this Act is that a number of patents should be just nodded through without examination on the word of a patent controller.  This is probably, in many cases, quite satisfactory. However there are cases of a very technical nature where they should be examined and where more than the controller himself should be satisfied that the patent can be put through.</P>
    <P>The Minister should undertake to assure that there would be another examination of a technical nature besides that of the controller.  If a member of the public brings it to the attention of the controller that something needs examination then it should be done.  If any outside person, a third person, who may have an interest is involved, it would not be sufficient for the controller to rubber stamp and nod through a number of these patent applications.  Most of the time he will be absolutely correct to do this but in cases where somebody may feel they have a similar patent pending or a similar patent already filed that this new application would interfere with, these people should have the right to request the controller to have an outside examination. This is reasonable and I would hope the Minister would accept it.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to accept the amendment put forward by <Col N="425" /> Deputy Barry.  This amendment seeks to impose duties on the controller which would be in contravention of the provisions of section 31 (1).  The duties are ones appropriate to the applicant himself in consultation with his patent agent.  I would like to make the point that there are roughtly 20,000 applications pending at the moment and anything that would in any way inhibit the work of the controller would be detrimental to the speedy processing of these applications.  That is why, in the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment put forward by Deputy Barry.</P>
      <P>I must make it clear that the applicants themselves, in consultation with their patent agents, are in a position to make a case to the controller without the need to have this amendment in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed by the reaction of the Minister.  This appears to have been forced on the Minister because of the backlog that has been allowed to build up in the Patents Office over the last seven or eight years.  If the staff of the Patent Office had not been reduced to unrealistic levels, in spite of an increase in the number of applications for patents, then we would not have this section in this Bill and the Minister would not be looking for these powers for the controller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be other ways of getting rid of this backlog which, I accept, has built up over the last ten years and which must be dealt with in fairness to those people who have made applications and must be dealt with speedily.  However, it is not right, as is happening in this case, to throw out the baby with the bath water.  In the interest of getting a quick resolution and removing the stockpile that has built up, the Minister is unnecessarily lowering the standards to be applied to future patents.  I do not think he should do that.  He should seek some other temporary way of getting rid of the backlog and then put the necessary controls into the Patents Office for the future.  Accepting my amendment to insert this new section would allow him to do that and would give the necessary <Col N="426" /> assurance to people, including patent agents, who are making lodgments and seeking to have what would have involved a considerable amount of work and expense handled properly and efficiently so that what they think of as their intellectual property is not taken from them by a flaw in this legislation.</P>

      <P>The purpose of section (2) is to enable the Minister at a future date to make rules which would entitle the controller to scrutinise an application by reference to the sections of the Bill excluded above in subsection (1).</P>
      <P>Experience will show whether it is necessary to do this and, of course, the question of the necessary staff resources to perform such additional tasks will also have to be considered.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that the reasons we cannot go along with this amendment are quite reasonable in the circumstances. Experience shows that where difficulty arises the applicants and their agents have a good relationship with the controller himself in this regard.  My main concern is to ensure that we would not impose any requirements that would delay the processing of these applications in the future.  That is my main concern at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

      <P>I have no doubt but what the Minister says is correct.  The agents have a good relationship with the controller at the moment.  However, these agents and that controller will not be there forever whereas this legislation will have implications into the next century. We cannot pass legislation here on the basis that people have a good personal relationship.  We have to pass it in a cold calculating way that would apply to all circumstances in the future.  I do not think the Minister's explanation in that regard is at all satisfactory no matter how affable the controller is and no matter how understanding the people who file patents are.  We should legislate here on the basis of the worst possible case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears now from what the Minister has been saying that what we are doing here is being done because of the backlog <Col N="427" /> of applications and that, because the present controller has a good relationship with the patents agents, there is no danger of anything happening.  With due respect to the Minister, that is not a good basis for legislation.  We want something much firmer and much more clinical than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) generally will allow the Minister or future Ministers to make provisions as suggested by Deputy Barry if required.  We feel at this stage that they are not required and it would be cumbersome to include those at this stage.  I accept the Deputy's point that present relationships would not be relevant in the future.</P>
      <P>However, I am also satisfied that what is provided for in the Deputy's amendment is not required.  We are not ruling out the possibility that in the future under subsection (2) there is nothing in subsection (1) which would preclude the controller, at his discretion, from refusing or suggesting amendments to a patent application by reference to any requirements of a section mentioned in that subsection which will be specified in rules. We could generally allow for that situation in the future.  In the circumstances I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>To be fair to the Minister of State I should read it again to make sure that I am not misquoting or misunderstanding him but I do not think the explanation given by him is satisfactory. Subsection (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing in subsection (1) shall preclude the Controller, at his discretion, <Col N="428" /> from refusing, or suggesting amendments to, a patent application by reference to any requirement of a section mentioned in that subsection which may be specified in rules. </P>
    <P>It brings me back to one of the points I am objecting to, that the controller may suggest amendments, and it does not satisfy the point I made earlier that there is a danger that patents will be passed by the controller on a blanket basis without him giving, in a minority of cases, sufficient attention to them to allay the genuine concerns of people who feel that a patent is theirs as of right &mdash; this is one example and it is not necessarily the only one &mdash; and that their interests are not being preserved in that regard.  I do not think the Minister of State's explanation on subsection (2) satisfies my concerns in regard to subsection (1).</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the points which have been put forward by Deputy Barry in defence of his amendment which are very reasonable but I have to bear in mind the fact that at present there is a backlog of 20,000 applications and we cannot put up any barriers in having those applications dealt with.  I am very conscious of that fact.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill the Minister will bring forward rules and regulations when he will take into account the Deputy's amendment and the proposals he has put forward.  When we clear the backlog of 20,000 applications the Minister will be in a position to look at the section and bring in whatever regulations may be required which take account of the point the Deputy is making, which I accept is a reasonable one.  The main reason I cannot accept the amendment, even though I accept the spirit of it, is that a major difficulty faces us at present and we cannot accept an amendment which would delay the processing of these applications. That may not be the best reason in the world but it is the one I am putting forward at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will have discretion under the Bill to bring in rules and regulations <Col N="429" /> which take account of the point the Deputy is making and the concerns he is expressing now which may or may not be found to be relevant at that stage.  That is the reason I am not accepting the amendment.  I should point out that section 31 is exactly the same as the section being dealt with in France although that is no great reason why it should be accepted here.  However, it is an additional point which may be of assistance to Deputy Barry in this regard. I accept the points being put forward by him and I will look at the amendment before Report Stage.  What I am trying to say is not now, not yet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State accepts my point of view but I think the section is bad.  While I do not want to drag the matter out and accept that he will look at the matter before Report Stage and perhaps do something, it is a bad principle to write into legislation a flawed section on the basis that we have a lot of work to do because of mistakes made outside this House.  The Minister of State should find some way of dealing with the backlog of applications for patents very quickly.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the answer is but I understand he is very short of technical staff and that the staff of the Patents Office has been cut by almost 20 per cent during the past ten years even though, as he himself has admitted, the number of applications received has risen considerably during that period.  If he is short of technical staff there must be some way of recruiting these on a temporary basis to deal with the backlog.  He could then make the legislation more permanent given that he has given us the impression that it amounts to fire brigade action to deal with the problems created under other circumstances.  I hope he will look at the Patents Office to see what can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put it at its crudest, it is a money earner.  I heard it suggested some months ago that because they were not operating at 100 per cent efficiency they could have lost as much as £8 million.  I am aware that the standard figure is about £3 million but <Col N="430" /> one commentator has said that it could be as much as £8 million.  The Minister for Justice should find some way of dealing with the backlog and not leave it hanging over him ominously or allow it to dictate the type of legislation he should introduce.  Perhaps he will accept my amendment on Report Stage so that we can have legislation we can all stand over. As I said earlier, this is not legislation which will apply for 18 months only.  Am I right in saying this is the first Patents Bill we have had since the 1964 Act?  This Bill could have a similar lifespan.  We should therefore make it as near perfect as we can, given the lack of talent in this House to deal with such complex legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The losses can be calculated at between £300,000 and £500,000 a year.  I accept that that is an enormous amount of money and that it accumulates over a long period.  As the House is aware, the Government are considering establishing the Patents Office as a semi-State autonomous body which would be in a better position, commercially, to react to market forces.  I therefore accept the point made by Deputy Barry.  Given the contributions that he has made to the Bill I would prefer to look at the matter before Report Stage.  He should bear in mind the reason I have put forward is that I wish to expedite the registration of the 20,000 applications in an effort to deal with the backlog.  I accept the Deputy's point and I will look at the matter again.</P>

I am willing to postpone discussion of these amendments until Report Stage as I am aware the Minister of State only got these amendments late last night and may not have had a chance to study their implications.

      <P>I gave the wrong impression when I was speaking earlier. It is in the Bill and is much more fundamental than I stated earlier on.  The Bill provides that nothing in subsection (2) shall preclude the controller, at his discretion, from suggesting amendments to a patent application by reference to <Col N="432" /> any requirements of the section.  It seems extraordinary that a controller should suggest amendments.  I can understand how, in a friendly informal way, he would talk to people who applied for a patent and give advice.  However, to write into legislation the right of the controller to suggest amendments to an application for a patent seems to be extraordinary.  I know that in relation to planning laws an applicant is spoken to by the planning officers and the local authorities.  In some cases the planning officer may give a reason for not granting the application but if a revised application is submitted it might be looked at again.  Section 31 (2) goes further because it says that nothing in subsection (1) shall preclude the controller, at his discretion, from refusing or suggesting amendments to a patent application by reference to any requirement of a section mentioned in that subsection which may be specified in rules.  I do not know any other Act in which that provision is contained although I know it happens frequently. It can save a lot of time and heartbreak if there is a discussion between the applicant and the controller in this case so that an application will be submitted which is acceptable to the controller and which he feels has a better chance of being agreed to.</P>

Section 90 requires the controller to give a hearing on the matter to the applicant.  It seems rather contradictory and strange to me because the section makes it mandatory on the controller to refuse the application if those conditions are not met, subject to hearing the applicant.  It is no more than a mere formality: he hears the applicant and, when he has come to his conclusions, he is obliged to refuse the application.  I have not tabled an amendment in this regard but it would be more prudent and consistent to substitute the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  In other words, the controller, having heard the applicant, may change his mind and may refuse the application.

      <P>In page 21, subsection (1), line 31, to delete &ldquo;twenty years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;ten years&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now moved on to Chapter V of the Bill which deals with provisions as to patents after grant.  My amendment deals with subsection (1) which provides that the patent period be extended from 16 to 20 years.  As I mentioned on Second Stage, not only am I opposed to extending the patent period but I would like to see it reduced from 16 years to ten years. The whole principle of patents is dubious in that it gives businesses a competitive-free 16 years to exploit an invention.  This has enabled many large private companies to exploit consumers and rip them off.  The present law is bad enough but to consider extending the period to 20 years is unacceptable.  One of the areas that particularly impinges on patents is the pharmaceutical industry which is a major beneficiary of patent law.  It is a typical example of large profits being protected by patents legislation, to the detriment of people unable to pay exorbitant <Col N="437" /> prices and of the State which, through the general medical services, has to pick up the tab for 75 per cent of the drugs bill in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another reason I am opposed to this section &mdash; this matter has not been referred to in the House previously &mdash; is that it would affect the indigenous pharmaceutical industry here which, I would remind Deputies, employs 1,000 people. It supplies 10 per cent of the drugs market here and has a growing and substantial export business.  The survival of this industry is threatened by this legislation. We should not forget that the indigenous chemical industry is owned by local people and the profits are ploughed back into the economy rather than exported into the black hole as is the case with multi-national companies.  It is interesting that the former Minister for Finance admitted that the policy of encouraging multi-national companies to come here has been an abject failure and that what this country should be doing is developing indigenous industry, particularly indigenous pharmaceutical industry.</P>
    <P>This section will be a death knell to this industry.  Up to now the industry had to accept a patent period of 16 years and they were gearing up their product line to take on new lines which were formerly protected by patents.  They now find that after the passing of this Bill they will have to wait another four years.  It is appalling that no other Deputy has taken up this extremely important point.  I am very anxious to hear the Minister's comments on the matter.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that my party and I are not very enamoured with the chemical industry because it has been responsible for enormous pollution problems. However, we need a pharmaceutical industry and it should be home-based rather than multi-national.  I ask the Minister to give this matter very serious consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>

In the circumstances I cannot accept Deputy Garland's amendment.  It would have a detrimental effect <i>vis-à-vis</i> the patent convention.  I see no good reason for reducing the period.</P>

I raised it on Second Stage when referring to indigenous companies &mdash; I do not like using the word &ldquo;indigenous&rdquo; because I do not know what it means any longer.  It has no bearing on the industries that exist now. There is a conflict in relation to adjustments to the Bill to suit different circumstances. The conflict arises with what I would call generic companies &mdash; I am speaking purely of the pharmaceutical industry even though this applies to a range of other companies who will be affected by this Bill.  The generic pharmaceutical industry has been manufacturing drugs which are sometimes 20 per cent cheaper once the patent of the original drug expires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The patent of a drug manufactured anywhere in the world is protected in this country for 16 years at present but after that any pharmaceutical company can manufacture the generic product, which is exactly the same product and sell it to the health boards or to the public.  In other parts of Europe the patent is protected for 20 years and the purpose of the Bill is to bring us into line with the practice in the rest of Europe. Various <Col N="439" /> industries have made representations to the patent agencies throughout Europe to increase the life of the patent.  Because of the enormous cost of research and development into new products, whether pharmaceutical, engineering, motor parts, companies will not carry out the research if the patent is not protected for longer than 16 years.  If the pharmaceutical companies do not carry out research, world health will suffer unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>I understand it takes approximately eight years from the time the patent is registered before the drug is put on the market.  The pharmaceutical company, for example, have to recoup their costs in the remaining eight years life of the patent.  I acknowledge, however, that they make huge profits in these eight years when the only expenses they have is manufacturing and distribution of the drug but they had incurred major expense in the first eight years of the life of the drug.  While it is argued that pharmaceutical companies make hefty profits in fairness it must be said that we benefit greatly from the research they have carried out over the centuries. When one considers the number of drugs that has been developed, it must be remembered that the pharmaceutical companies were prepared to invest in research before they could ever hope to benefit financially from the manufacture of the drug.  That kind of effort must be rewarded and indeed encouraged.  As I said previously on Second Stage, there was an interesting article in <i>The Economist</i> about a month ago which shows that the profit-life of a drug is shortening all the time and that a drug has a life of two or three years before another drug comes on the market.  Research is also becoming much more expensive. However, the article also puts the counter-argument that an element of the high cost of drugs is that very few people in the world pay for drugs out of their own pocket and it is generally the Government, by one means or another &mdash; for example, the VHI, the health boards &mdash;<Col N="440" /> in fact, the tab is picked up by the taxpayer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The necessity for better and better drugs, which by definition are invariably dearer and dearer, is being generated by the taxpayer through the Government, who write the final cheque to the pharmaceutical company.  There are countless examples of drugs that have wiped out diseases all over the world. Mankind has benefited.</P>
      <P>No doubt Deputies Taylor and Garland and I might have differing views about the amount of money that should be kept by shareholders in pharmaceutical companies throughout the world, but by and large I believe the pharmaceutical companies have reinvested their profits in research that has been good for mankind.  Undoubtedly, as Deputy Garland has said, some companies have behaved disgracefully towards the environment.  Some Deputies are much more conscious of the environment than others.  I happen to live in an area where there is a concentration of pharmaceutical industries but there is also a very active environmental lobby who feel as strongly as Deputy Garland about the potential damage to the environment as a result of this industry. However, I consider that the number of controls on the chemical companies and the level of expertise in the planning section of Cork County Council and the number of staff available to oversee the implementation of the planning controls will ensure that the environment is protected. Indeed, I hope the Environmental Protection Agency will underscore this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not forget that pharmaceutical companies provide high quality jobs.  Indeed the pharmaceutical generic industry employ somewhere in the region of between 1,500 and 2,000 people but the international pharmaceutical companies that are located here employ in the region of 16,600 people, nearly ten times as many.  That <Col N="441" /> is not to say that we should not protect as far as possible the generic drug companies so that they can continue to expand.  In fact, the experience all over the world is that the generic drug industry is expanding and is creating more jobs and we should ensure that this trend continues. However, I am not sure we should do that, as Deputy Garland has suggested, by not ratifying this convention. That is probably the wrong way to do it. The IDA have solved the problem of job creation before and I am sure they will not be found wanting in this regard.  I have a certain sympathy with the generic drugs industry because I think they keep the brake on the international pharmaceutical companies and ensure that drugs are available in some instances at 15 per cent lower than the price of the patented product.</P>
    <P>I, like most Deputies, have had representations from both sides and I have given some thought to the matter.  Should Deputy Garland wish to press his amendment I will not be supporting it because I believe we have to ratify this convention. Given the fact that there are six, at most, generic drug companies, the Government should undertake a study through the IDA of how the industry can be helped not just to survive &mdash; it has been said that some will fold when this legislation is enacted &mdash; but to expand and develop because there is a big market for generic drugs outside of this country. Patents run out at different times all over the world.  The IDA should assist the generic drug companies to identify patents that are coming to the end of their life under this convention which would allow the generic drug companies to cash in on a lucrative market.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not the only place where there is a gap between the price of the generic drug and the branded product and health boards want to buy the generic product for budgetary reasons, because it is the cheapest possible drug.  That is not to say it would be of a lower standard than a more expensive drug.</P>
    <P>The only policy political point we have on the Bill is the one we are making on <Col N="442" /> this amendment tabled by Deputy Garland. We should not accept the amendment. I understand the reason it was put forward and I have a certain amount of sympathy with those on whose behalf the Deputy speaks, but it is in the long term interests of the country to ratify the convention. It is also the Minister's responsibility as a marketing Minister to undertake to ensure that the three, four or five companies involved &mdash; I am not sure just how many there are in the country &mdash; can discuss with the IDA the way in which they can be helped to increase the range of drugs they manufacture and increase their market share in this country. The convention was ratified and signed in 1973 and I think that this might be the third version of the Bill to come before the House, previous Bills having fallen on Governments going out of office.  If I understand correctly, the companies may face a difficult time though it is hard to understand why they should be taken by surprise by this Bill.  At the same time there are drugs patents that would have been expected to run out of their 16 year time limit within the next few years but will now be protected for a further four year period.  There is definitely a difficulty in that regard and the Government should consider means by which they might help what I could call the generic drug manufacturing companies but what Deputy Garland calls indigenous drug manufacturers to get through that period.  The companies must be encouraged to expand because there is no doubt that generic drug manufacturers all over the world are expanding. That is a legitimate area in which the IDA should interest themselves in helping the companies to expand and is assisting them to find new markets for their products.  Deputy Leyden, in the context of the Irish Marketing Board, could also assist the companies in finding new markets for their products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish first to make a preliminary point on the issue of the ratification of the European Patent <Col N="443" /> Convention.  Is that the convention that we want to ratify?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we do not want to ratify that convention, but we can get by without ratifying all of these conventions. It is not the end of the world if we do not ratify them and we are not ratifying all the Community conventions anyway.  There is another Treaty, the Patent Co-operation Treaty, which we have not ratified and have given no indication of setting about ratifying for various technical reasons.  It does not necessarily follow that it is the end of the world &mdash; there is life if the European Patent Convention is not ratified; we could get by.  If economic constraints are strong enough perhaps we should put up with that if we have to.  We should be very cautious about the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has to draw a distinction between two categories of terms for patents.  One is the category covered by this section, that is, new patents.  The patent period for new patents that will be granted under this Bill is being extended from 16 years to 20 years.  I agree with Deputy Garland and I support his amendment.  The 20 year provision is too long and should not be agreed to.  I accept the point made by Deputy Barry that those firms and companies that invest very considerable resources in researching and developing new products, chemicals and drugs must be rewarded.  That is true, it is a fair point and I accept it.  They must be rewarded, but the question that next arises is what is fair reward.  For how long should companies be given the benefit of patent rights on their product?  Why stop at the proposed 20 years?  Why not make the period 30 years, 40 years or any other period?  It is not just a matter of saying that those companies must be rewarded. It is true, they must be rewarded, but one has to strike a balance in these matters and take into account other pressures and other factors.  There must have been an enormous degree of pressure brought to bear on the EC in this convention to have <Col N="444" /> the period extended from 16 years to 20 years.  Of course, the powers that be in Europe have agreed to that.  If, as Deputy Barry says, in the overwhelming majority of cases those drugs lose their major efficacy and benefit after only two or three years anyway &mdash; and I am sure he is right on that point, he has researched the matter &mdash; why is there a need to increase an already very long period of 16 years to 20 years?  I myself should have thought that a period of 16 years was over-generous and for the life of me I see no basis for agreeing to an extension of the period on new patents to 20 years.  I should regard that as a strong argument.</P>
    <P>Deputy Garland has talked of the importance of having drugs available at reasonable prices, at prices people can afford, disconnected from the artificial patent rights benefit element that is included in those products.  In the price of any drug product there are two elements, there is the actual cost of production &mdash; which is usually insignificant &mdash; and there is the profit element to the pharmaceutical firms which in many cases, probably makes up 98 per cent of the cost.  This hits consumers badly, and it is no good for Deputy Barry to say that most people do not pay for drugs, that they are mostly paid for through health boards, the VHI or by way of medical cards.  Of course the consumer pays, there is no free lunch.  The taxpayer and the people pay for the drugs in one way or another &mdash; through taxation, PRSI or whatever.  Therefore, the argument that one need not worry too much about the issue because payment is made by way of these various channels is not a sound argument.</P>
    <P>However, this Bill goes even further than that.  In my view it introduces a provision that is completely unacceptable. Not actually in this section, but in the First Schedule &mdash; and I had intended to address the issue when speaking on the schedule &mdash; the Bill provides that existing patents granted years ago will be extended automatically from 16 years to 20 years.  The holders of patents that were granted ten or 12 years ago must be very surprised and gratified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> When they did their research, made their applications and had their patents granted originally all that they wanted, all that they asked for and all that they expected was a time limit of 16 years. Now, unasked for, for nothing and for no consideration they are being given an unexpected present.  What kind of arrangement is this?  Where is the possible justification for taking such a step? What is the other side of the coin?</P>
    <P>Small producers of generic drugs who have been waiting patiently for years for the opportunity to manufacture certain drugs, to distribute them and to sell them where they are needed at 10 per cent or 5 per cent of the patent protected cost, now see that a patent that might have been due to expire next year will be extended by four years.  Admittedly, they were getting themselves all geared up to do themselves a favour by manufacturing the generic product when the patent would expire next year but also to do the entire country and members of the public a favour by producing the drug at 5 per cent or 10 per cent of its present cost. Now they discover that, completely out of the blue, for no sensible or logical reason whatever, an extra four years is being tagged onto that.  That is unacceptable. There is no morality in that; there is no legality in it.  How the EC ever accepted that I will never understand. How our Minister out there agreed to it and did not veto it or vote against it is utterly beyond me.  It is a disservice to the country, a disservice to the thousands of people who are employed in the pharmaceutical industry here.  It should not be accepted.  The Labour Party will not accept it and will vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I missed Deputy Garland's reasoning for this amendment.  I devoted a large part of my contribution on Second Stage to the whole question of generic drugs and the arguable contribution they could make to limiting costs on our national health service and so on.  I must say I am not sure that I carry whatever wisdom is in that argument to support this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> It may be correct for Deputy Taylor, as he has done, to draw a distinction between the duration of application for a patent in future and the retrospection that is involved in this section.  But, in terms of making application for a new patent and extending the time from 16 years to 20 years, I thought that was part of the essence of what this entire Bill was about.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to reassure me whether I am right in the advice that I have that there is a very considerable time span between application being made for the patent and the licence being granted.  For example, I understand it can be as long as ten years from the date on which a patent is applied for to the licence actually being granted.  If that is true it seems to me that it is a relatively short period of time within which to provide major companies involved in major research, development and expenditure in order to recoup that cost.  If that is true we are reduced to having a look at the employment content.  Certainly I do not want to be cast in the role of advancing an argument, for example, for the big drug multinationals.  I have not been sufficiently long out of the trade union movement to forget that there are approximately 5,000 jobs or more in the multinational sector of the drugs industry. There are very few jobs in such an indigenous sector as we have in the generic drugs area, something like 500.  Even then to call it indigenous is a misnomer in as much as the main indigenous company concerned is majority owned, I think, by a Dutch multinational.</P>
    <P>Without appearing to pander to a special lobby case I ask the Minister whether it is true that there is this time span of some years, whether it is unreasonable that this extended period ought be allowed in which to recoup the costs involved.  I am not so sure that it is the nub of this Bill to argue the difference between 16 and 20 years.  I do not see how it is a major issue.  I do not see how it restrains us in any way &mdash; if the political will was there &mdash; to address the question of generic drugs in the wider sense in which I dealt with that on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> I am not convinced that there is a big issue of principle here.  It is important in a country in which, above all else, we need to argue for research and development to be located here.  In those circumstances it is essential that we send out the signals that we are pro-industry, pro-jobs, pro-research, pro-innovation. If we send out any signals to the contrary we are damaging the prospects of having located here a more sustainable and innovative infrastructure for industrial development.</P>
    <P>That is my disposition on the matter without having heard what Deputy Garland had to say.  It may well be that I am ill-advised.  I do not profess to be an expert on the question of patents.  It is not a subject that has kept me awake at night.  There are many others that preoccupy one at present but this is not one of them.  I do not think it is a major issue of principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>For a change I must concur with what Deputy Rabbitte has said, which is a fair summary of the position. What Deputy Barry stated is quite correct, that we would all be in agreement with the 20-year period.  We are concentrating too much here on the generic drugs industry whereas there are many other industries in this business as well.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, we should concentrate on research and development, giving an incentive to those who engage in that very expensive exercise. We cannot place such generic companies at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> their counterparts anywhere else in Europe.  We must render Ireland an attractive location for the establishment of research and development facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Rabbitte said, the drugs industry is different from others in that it may take a period of eight to nine years to have a particular drug licensed, which is deducted from the 20-year period, leaving one with an 11 to 12-year period in which one can actually sell that drug and recoup the costs of its research and development.  I would say that companies are well aware of the drugs that are <Col N="448" /> coming off patent and are available for manufacture here.  There are some tremendous companies here in the generic field very anxious to develop drugs coming off patent in any part of the world. Indeed, anything that An Bord Tráchtála can do to assist them would be forthcoming in relation to exploitation of that area.  However, within the computer industry and manufacturing in general Irish companies would be placed at a disadvantage by undertaking research and development into a product and then discover that people could produce their product after a 16-year period, thereby depriving them of their justifiable reward, and, indeed, the employment created in that area.</P>
    <P>For many reasons I can advance the 20-year period as being very reasonable. Deputy Taylor mentioned the length of time but he did not bear in mind the duration of the licensing of a particular drug which is very relevant.  The European Patent Convention has to be ratified before we can ratify any future Community Patent Convention, bearing in mind that constitutional problems will arise in that regard in the future.</P>
    <P>I am not accepting Deputy Garland's amendment and I am objecting to it for the reasons I have already advanced.  I might make the point that many patented companies actually produce generic drugs so that there is an intermix of these types of operations; there are some in my constituency also.  I am very conscious of the cost of drugs as such.  Not all generic drugs are necessarily cheap although there may be a myth abroad that they are; they are not necessarily always that cheap.  People who incur the cost of research and development into a particular product should be given an opportunity of recouping that cost and indeed of reinvesting in further research and development.  As a matter of policy we are encouraging companies to concentrate their research and development in Ireland and we support them in that regard.  In those circumstances I reject the amendment put forward by Deputy Garland.</P>

This rather motley crew have made a very good contribution to this little debate.  They have not changed my views on the matter one iota.  I realise that there are drawbacks and that whatever we do we are in a cleft stick.  What were we thinking of in 1973 when this was ratified? I cannot remember what Government were in power in 1973 and, perhaps Deputy Barry or Deputy Taylor will tell me.  We have managed for 18 years without ratifying this convention and I suggest we could do without it for another few years.  Perhaps we should refuse to ratify it, thereby forcing a further convention to be held on patents.  We could put forward the views of many Deputies and, perhaps, have the convention changed.  For those reasons I am pressing my amendment.</P>

It stated that the competition between drugs companies is such that within a few years the sales life of a drug will be as low as two or three years, putting further pressure on companies to invest more in research and to bring out even more modern drugs.

      <P>The section is self-explanatory. Subsection (4) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by order alter the period for which a patent shall remain in force for the purpose of giving effect to a provision of any international treaty, convention or agreement relating to the term of protection of a patent to which the State is or proposes to become a party. </P>
      <P>The Minister needs the flexibility provided in this subsection to respond to any future changes in the conventions we have ratified.  Incidentally, the number of years could be extended but it could also be reduced to the 16 years which the Deputy is so anxious to include in the legislation.  In order to avoid bringing forward amendments to this legislation or new legislation in that regard, I think the Minister and future Ministers should have that flexibility which I do not see being changed in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, that may arise in time in relation to international conventions that would be agreed in the future and for that reason the Minister should have the flexibility to adjust the length of time if so required.</P>

      <P>I would like to make one quick comment on the last point made by the Minister.  I am glad the Minister does not foresee any change in the immediate future.  I thought from the first part of his contribution that a door of uncertainty which I had been trying to close would be opened.  If the IDA are to attract industry into this country it must be on a <Col N="454" /> certainty basis that allows people make investments and recoup their investment over a period.</P>

It is only an enabling provision to allow the Minister to have flexibility.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This section refers to the burden of proof.  It is concerned with patents for inventions which are for a new process for producing a new product. This can be quite an important matter especially where the new product is very valuable commercially.  Special difficulties of proof arise where somebody else makes the same product and the question arises as to whether they have used the patented process in doing so. Proof could be difficult to find especially if the product was manufactured abroad. Accordingly, subsection (1) establishes the principle that where a third party produces the same product as the patented one, it will be taken that the product was obtained by use of the patented process unless it is clearly obvious that this is not the case.  This is called a reversal of the burden of proof because under the normal ruling in civil proceedings it would fall on the patentee to prove that the product marketed by a third party was actually made by the patented process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) anticipates that the reversal of the burden of proof, as provided for in subsection (1), could lead to a patentee seeking to use the proceedings against the third party to discover for his own benefit the third party's know-how and trade secrets.  To avoid such abuse, subsection (2) obliges the court to have regard to the interests of the defendant in the protection of his manufacturing and commercial secrets and for that purpose, if it thinks fit, to hear evidence in private and in the absence of parties other <Col N="456" /> than the defendant.  Subsection (3) contains further provisions in connection with proceedings as referred to in subsection (2).  Subsection (3) provides for procedures for private consideration by the court in the interests of protecting manufacturing or trade secrets.</P>

      <P>Is this a new provision, this switching the burden of proof, or has that always been the position in patent law?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some reservations and concern about this major change in our patent law.  It is a basic inalienable feature of our civil law that the burden of proof rests on the person bringing the claim.  To shift the burden of proof here in favour of the patentee is a completely new provision in all aspects of Irish civil law.  Switching the burden of proof may well be appropriate in some European civil law systems but it does not sit easily on our system.  I am concerned about it. It is a novel procedure and its effects would not be desirable.  It could be the thin end of the wedge.  If a person has a patent and alleges infringement he should be required to establish his case in the normal way of obtaining the necessary evidence.  To do otherwise puts the burden on a perhaps innocent third party of having to establish his innocence which could prove as great a difficulty for him as it would for an alleged aggrieved patentee. We should not lightly pass this section.  This is quite a draconian measure in essence and in what effect it might have.  We should consider what is involved in it.</P>

      <P>I wish to confirm that it is a completely new provision.  However, it is in line with the convention.  I would point out to the Deputy that this was accepted by the House in a patents Bill in 1982 which lapsed, not that that would justify its acceptance in 1991.</P>

      <P>I am obviously not making myself clear.  Guidelines were included in the 1964 Act and the controller issued licences subject to those guidelines.  Just because no one ever availed of this provision does not mean that they are unnecessary because the controller took cognisance of them before he issued a licence.  If this Bill goes through there will be no guidelines for the controller because the 1964 Act will have been repealed. As no guidelines are included in this Bill the controller will be free to issue licences using whatever guidelines he chooses to dream up himself.</P>

      <P>No use has been made of this section during the past 27 years.  No patentee has ever availed of the section. It is therefore redundant and there is no need to include it in this Bill.  The 1964 Act will become obsolete when this Bill becomes law.  It has never been availed of and we do not feel it should be included in the 1991 Bill.  It is irrelevant.</P>

      <P>I do not want to drag the matter out but I would like to be clear in <Col N="465" /> my mind on what is involved.  We are dealing with section 68 which reads:</P>
      <P>At any time after the grant of a patent the proprietor of the patent may apply to the Controller for an entry to be made in the register to the effect that licences under the patent are to be available as of right, and where such an application is made, the Controller shall give notice of the application to any person entered on the register as being entitled to an interest in the patent, and if the Controller is satisfied that the proprietor of the patent is not precluded by contract from granting licences under the patent he shall make such entry. </P>
      <P>During the past 27 years the general guidelines under which the controller issued licences have been laid down in the law but we are now saying to him that from now on there will be no guidelines and he must make them up as he goes along.  As I said a couple of hours ago.  I am sure that the present controller will behave in an impeccable manner but the point is that over the passage of time the controller will change and the next controller may not apply the same standards or set of guidelines.  I find it difficult to understand that the guidelines have not been availed of as I would have thought they would have guided the controller in issuing licences.  I would have thought also it would be more desirable to give guidelines to a controller, no matter who the individual may be, under which to operate to ensure that there would be consistency in the matter over a long period of time.  I want to re-enter the amendment on Report Stage when I would like to get more information so I will withdraw it now and re-enter it on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 59.</P>
      <P>In page 44, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where two or more persons are entered in the register as applicants for or proprietors of a patent, the Controller may, upon application made to him in the prescribed manner by any of those persons, give such directions in accordance with the application as to the sale or lease of the patent application or the patent or any interest therein, the grant of licences under the patent application or patent, or the exercise of any right under section 80 in relation thereto, as he thinks fit.</P>
      <P>(2)  If any person who is entered in the register as an applicant for or proprietor of the patent fails to execute any instrument or to do any other thing required for the carrying out of any direction given under this section within fourteen days after being requested in writing so to do by any of the other persons so registered, the Controller may, upon application made to him in the prescribed manner by any such other person, give directions empowering any person to execute that instrument or to do that thing in the name and on behalf of the person in default.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where an application has been made under this section, the Controller shall notify&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> (a)  in the case of an application under subsection (1), the other person or persons registered as <Col N="467" /> applicant for or proprietor of the patent concerned;</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of an application under subsection (2), the person in default;  </P>
    <P>and shall thereafter determine the question.</P>
    <P>(4)  No direction shall be given under this section so as to affect the mutual rights or obligations of trustees or the personal representatives of a deceased person, or their rights or obligations as such.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>This is one of the sections of the Bill which may give rise to contention in the future.  I am endeavouring to limit the areas which could give rise to contention as far as possible in the amendment.  This Bill will not give the controller any power to give directions to co-owners of a patent which corresponds to the power given in section 75 of the 1981 Bill.  The Minister of State earlier referred to it as the 1982 Bill.  I am not sure which date is the correct one but the Bill was published in the early eighties.  Similar powers are contained in section 51 of the Patents Act, 1964 which will go out of existence once this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why this power should be excluded and I therefore suggest that new subsections should be inserted in this section.  These subsections almost correspond precisely with section 75 of the 1981 Bill, as published.  As I said earlier today, the Second Stage of that Bill was discussed in the House but it was not passed.  The point I am trying to make is that the controller will have no power under this Bill to give directions to co-owners similar to the powers contained in section 75 of the 1981 Bill.  My amendment would give him such powers in the 1991 Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Provisions such as these were considered by the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General's office and were regarded as being matters appropriate for consideration by a court. Apart from this, the controller's main job <Col N="468" /> is to deal expeditiously with the grant of patents and not to get bogged down in legal wrangles between joint patent owners.  That is the reason I am not accepting the amendment which has been put down by Deputy Barry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume we are talking here about having an adjudication made in the High Court.  Such an action can be extremely costly if two people are involved.  In relation to matters in dispute under the Competition Bill it was eventually agreed to have these dealt with by the Circuit Court.  If these matters have to be dealt with by the High Court the cost for those who may already have been put to considerable expense will be very high.  I do not think the adjudication or judgment of the controller would necessarily preclude anybody from taking it afterwards to the High Court but, if possible, the matter should be settled out of court.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister of State to look at this matter again as efforts should be made to resolve differences without the need to go to court.  The cost of litigation is extraordinarily high with due respect to the Members of the House who practice in the legal profession.  We should do everything we can to prevent disputes being taken to the courts if they can be solved by agreement or an adjudication of the controller of the Patents Office.  This should be done rather than send people to court.</P>

      <P>It would be very hard for the controller to adjudicate because he would not have the judicial expertise required.  After very careful examination by the Attorney General's Office and the draftsman's office it was felt necessary that adjudication should be transferred <Col N="469" /> where it arises.  It would land there anyway and, ultimately, it could go to the courts if there was dissatisfaction with the controller's decision.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Oireachtas Joint Social and Economic Committee: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Quinn on Tuesday, 19 November 1991:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, alarmed at the projected increase of unemployment to over 300,000 in 1992; conscious of the deteriorating economic situation within Ireland; concerned about the changes which will affect agricultural output as a result of the GATT talks and the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy; determined to act decisively to deal with the wide range of problems in the delivery and extent of our social services, in particular health, housing and education; resolves to establish on a statutory basis an Oireachtas Social and Economic Committee with not less than 18 members drawn from both Houses:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" />  (1)  to review economic and social policy from time to time,</P>
    <P>(2) to examine in detail the reports from various bodies such as NESC and ESRI,</P>
    <P>(3) to deal with such legislation on Committee Stage as Dáil Éireann may from time to time decide,</P>
    <P>(4)  to receive submissions from the social partners and other interested groups on matters concerning the creation of employment and wealth, and on the rights of workers and unemployed persons,</P>
    <P>(5)  to make detailed recommendations, from time to time, to the Government and the Oireachtas on the creation of employment and wealth, and all related matters and</P>
    <P>(6)  to commission reports and employ consultants as required;</P>
    <P>and Dáil Éireann further resolves that adequate staff and resources be provided to the Committee so as to enable it to do its work, and that the proceedings of the Committee may be open to the media and public.  </P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>to delete all words after Dáil Éireann and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;supports the proposals for Oireachtas reform set out in the recently published Programme for Government and in particular</P>
    <P>&mdash;the proposal to enable suitable Bills to be dealt with at Committee Stage by a Select Committee;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the proposal to review after the Christmas recess the possible arrangements whereby short debates on topical matters take place each day; </P>
    <P>notes that these proposals will give ample scope for detailed discussions on Committee Stage of Bills and for frequent debates on economic and <Col N="471" /> social policies including examining in detail reports from various bodies such as the NESC and the ESRI and providing Deputies generally with the possibility of voicing their opinions on economic and social policies including the creation of employment. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> When I spoke last night I indicated that Fine Gael would be supporting the Labour Party motion on his issue.  I talked about the necessity now for a properly developed committee system in this House to ensure that works of Government can be carried out in an effective manner.  I said I believed that the Constitution and the rules which govern this House envisaged majority governments and that the committee system in the House is not developed to cater for coalition or minority governments.</P>
      <P>I should like to talk about the situation in relation to jobs because the motion envisages that the proposed committee would discuss employment.  The Minister for Finance indicated last night that he was very concerned about unemployment. In the course of his speech he claimed again &mdash; as various Governments speakers have over the last 12 months &mdash; that the increase in unemployment, especially on the live register, is due to new entrants to the labour force, together with a reversal of migration patterns to the extent that, up to April last year, about 1,000 people emigrated and that this trend has continued through the year.  He also said that increased PRSI and PAYE payments over the year indicated that employment was holding.  I do not think that is the full picture; the recent preliminary report on the labour force survey up to April 1991 showed that employment fell by 5,000.  If we take into account the fact that 3,000 people were temporarily employed in gathering the census information at the time it is clear that the real fall was 8,000 on those registered as employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1990 the economy was steaming ahead and growth rates of 7 per cent were achieved.  The decline of 8,000 in employment did not come, by and large, <Col N="472" /> in the portion of the 12 months which came into the figures in 1990.  I would say that most of the fall in employment of 8,000 came in the first quarter of the year. There is nothing to indicate that the trend has been reversed; on the contrary the statistics from the CSO and the anecdotal evidence which we all get as public representatives suggest an economy at a standstill.  For example, the index of industrial production for the quarter ending in August shows an increase in volume terms of less than 1 per cent, 0.9. Retail sales for the quarter ending in July showed an increase of less than 1 per cent, again 0.9.</P>
    <P>We have all seen evidence around the country of small shopkeepers' turnover being down; even sales of bread and milk are down slightly, which is very hard to understand with so many more dependants as a result of the reversal in migration patterns.  Business in garages is at a standstill, many of them are on the point of liquidation.  The building industry is virtually at a standstill except for large infrastructural projects like road building, bypasses and bridges, funded by Structural Funds, which have a very low employment content.  There is a serious problem of declining employment which is not explained by new entrants to the labour force or by changing migratory patterns.</P>
    <P>The Minister's evidence that PRSI and PAYE receipts are holding really does not make his case either.  We had a rather expensive wage agreement, even in the public sector the 4 per cent from 1 January last, together with increments, would be an increase of about 5.5 per cent to 6 per cent in all public servants' pay.  I understand that the private sector will settle on around 7 per cent.  We also know that the ceiling, for example, on one of the levies in the budget in January was abolished.  That levy is now collected on all incomes so there would be an extra input on the PRSI side from that.  It is also true that the previous Minister, his Department and the Revenue Commissioners went after small employers this year to make sure that they returned their PAYE and PRSI in time.  That is <Col N="473" /> fair enough but they went after compliant taxpayers who, quite frequently, were about one month or five weeks behind. It had the effect, over a range of businesses, of getting in an extra month's PAYE and PRSI because there was that level of time lag in small businesses.  That is fair enough and I do not have a problem with it as they are bringing it up to date and requiring compliance with the law. However, it counters the claim that PRSI and PAYE receipts remaining up is evidence that employment remains high.  All the evidence is to the contrary.</P>
    <P>I should like to look at what happened between 1987 and 1989.  During that time 40,000 new net jobs were created, which is the best we have done during any period in recent history.  It is well worth asking why.  Professor McAleese is a respected economist in Trinity College and he was the first to put forward the theory that there was, as he called it, an expansionary fiscal contradiction operating at the time, which is a paradox.  He said it brought back confidence which helped and the fact that the Government were cutting back their demand for funds allowed space for the private sector to move in.  There was a replacement of private sector spending instead of public sector spending.  This was a very fashionable theory up to about 18 months ago. The recent theory would suggest that something far more simple was operating, that the expansion between 1987 and 1989 was demand-led, like most recoveries have been, in our experience.</P>
    <P>It was due to a number of factors. First, the devaluation in 1986 was very successful because it was followed by a very rigorous budget introduced by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Mac-Sharry, and it was followed by a very firm pay agreement which restricted pay levels.  The effects of the devaluation in 1986 did not flow out of the economy and, in terms of competitiveness, were maintained within the economy because of the budget and the wage deal.  The competitive effects of devaluation lasted for the two years in which we were doing best as far as jobs were concerned.  It matched a period of very strong growth in <Col N="474" /> the United Kingdom; we were positioned very competitively to supply the UK market and the growing economies of Europe.  Consequently, there was a big demand-led expansion in industrial production. It picked up the spare capacity first and then employers began to hire people.</P>
    <P>There was much pent up demand on the consumer side during the eighties. When the new Government came to power and were seen to take the action believed to be necessary, supported by the main Opposition party in the Tallaght strategy, there was a return to confidence and people began to spend again.  Not alone did savings ratios go down during that period but personal borrowing went up.  Therefore, there was very strong demand on the consumer market domestically and very strong export-led demand especially to the UK.  We know what has happened in the UK since and we know what is happening at home.</P>
    <P>What is most extraordinary when talking about jobs is that we pick out facile periods between 1987 and 1989 and think that what happened then will happen again.  There is a theory among economists and also among civil servants that all we have to do is repeat what happened in 1987, pay for everything out of public expenditure and all of a sudden the economy will begin to grow again and many jobs will be created.  That theory is based on a false analysis of what actually happened. I suggest to the new Minister that he consider the matter very carefully and not go off on a hobby-horse thinking that the same will happen again.  I especially caution him about cutting the capital budget because if he does that he will take further demand out of the economy and plunge it into a very deep recession. This will be a very difficult budget to judge because on the one hand the Minister needs to cut expenditure to give confidence and, on the other hand, if he cuts expenditure too much he will take demand out of the economy and plunge it into recession.</P>
    <P>The most amazing thing that happened in this country in recent times is that the economy that was steaming ahead at 7 <Col N="475" /> per cent last year is now probably running at zero.  There was no slow down and that is extraordianry.  It is like placing a stick into the wheel of a bicycle, suddenly the bicycle stops and the cyclist is catapulted over the handlebars.  We have experienced a similar economic effect.  The speakers on the other side of the House are signalling to me that my time is up.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is plenty of time for what I have to say. Unless interest rates are brought down to at least the European average, the economy will not pick up in 1992.  On the number of occasions when the Central Bank tried to bring interest rates down to the German level there was an outflow of funds from the country.  Whenever the interval fell below 60 base points the outflow commenced, the Central Bank got worried and consequently the interval went up again.</P>
      <P>It is worth referring to a document I have here but I will not quote from it.  For example, Belgium and Denmark have reduced their rates to West German levels and the rate in France is even lower.  Yet, we are hanging in at one and a half points, sometimes two points and sometimes one point ahead of the German rates.  The German rates cannot come down due to the funding problem in the East and therefore, the only leeway we have is to reduce our rates to the German rate.  I wonder whether the Central Bank in their present strategy are over-cautious.  I have been looking at their figures and they are holding a level of reserve which is historically high, a level which would have been considered excessive in previous years.  Certainly, as long as they hold this level of reserve &mdash; if they cut interest rates and there is an outflow of funds the reserve is diminished &mdash; interest rates will remain high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A combination of a lack of demand in the economy and the difficulties with interest rates, together with a budget <Col N="476" /> which has to cut current expenditure once again, will make it very difficult for the Government to pull the country out of recession.  As well as considering all the supply side information offered by the Progressive Democrats' economists, the Minister should also consider the demand side.  I know there are risks on the demand side but from 1987 to 1989 40,000 jobs were created by a boost in demand rather than by supply side strategies.</P>

      <P>I will concentrate on the motion put forward by the Labour Party. It is important that one use this opportunity to debate the economy at large.  In fairness to the Labour Party, they are endeavouring to put forward a procedural change to the House, essentially the formation of a social and economic committee to debate issues pertaining to employment creation and the social dimensions and consequences flowing from that.  My major criticism of the motion is that it is fundamentally elitist. Furthermore, its remit is much too wide. It is a matter for the general body of Dáil Éireann to discuss the more general and fundamental issues pertaining to the economy such as employment creation, education, health, agriculture and so on. The motion as drafted embraces every Government Department.  It would bestow upon a small group of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann Members responsibilities and duties to the detriment of the overall general body.  That is the fundamental flaw in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the members of the Labour Party wish Dáil Éireann to be seen to have a more relevant and effective input into economic and social debate perhaps they could consider alternative methods of doing so.  There must be a greater investment in Dáil Éireann and in democracy. By that I mean that we should increase resources available to individual <Col N="477" /> Deputies in the form of research assistance and facilities.  If Deputies are to perform more ably on economic and social issues, they must have such resources and that is something to which all parties in the House should agree and should endeavour to pursue.  I do not think that at present individual Deputies, irrespective of which party they are members, have the resources, time or enegy to carry out the necessary research which would enable them to make more significant contributions to economic debate.</P>
    <P>This motion is a further episode in Dáil reform.  I have always made the case that you cannot have Dáil reform without electoral reform.  If we are to achieve a greater input from Deputies in relation to the fundamental issues pertaining to the country electoral reform is required. I have said many times that in order to achieve the desired result we should have a single seat electoral system, retaining proportional representation.  A reduced emphasis on parish pump politics and a greater emphasis on legislative and parliamentary duties would result from such a change.  There would be a more radical and dramatic impact on this House and how we perform relative to public perception. In that context I appeal to the Government and to the Minister who is favourably disposed to this scenario to set up an electoral commission to look into alternative electoral systems.  It need not necessarily be a single seat system with proportional representation; it could be a list system or a system based on other models.  That must be to the forefront of our agenda if we want to bring Dáil Éireann as a body to the fore in the discussion of economic and social issues.  Electoral reform is a prerequisite to Dáil reform.  We cannot pursue Dáil reform in isolation from electoral reform.</P>
    <P>Last night in the debate Deputy Michael D. Higgins made a very interesting contribution in relation to the whole process by which economic and social policy is formed.  He said there is an over-dependence by the Department of Finance on bodies such as the ESRI and <Col N="478" /> the National Economic and Social Council. He said there is a need for alternative and more radical economic models to come before the House and that the proposed economic and social affairs committee would be the perfect model.  He rubbished with tremendous emotion a great deal of the terminology used by the Department of Finance &mdash; and, indeed, used most eloquently by Deputy Noonan tonight &mdash; such as, cost competitiveness, low inflation, lowering interest rates and he also spoke about a people's economy. No matter what terminology we use, low inflation, cost competitiveness and a better educational system affect people. He digressed somewhat from the motion before the House.  He was too negative in his attack on the existing institutions of the State which had been responsible for the economic policy, and, indeed, the terminology over the past ten to 20 years.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is essentially a demographic structural problem which cannot be solved by either the Department of Finance or the Department of Labour.  In my view, the Department of Education have the most critical role in dealing with this problem over the next 20 to 25 years. Because of our demographic structure we, unlike other countries, will have a huge influx into the labour market every year for the next ten to 15 years, as Deputy Higgins pointed out last night. We need to look at medium-term plans which will deal with these structural problems. Education offers a solution.  Our young people leave school far too early in comparison with other EC countries. Too many people leave the educational system without the necessary skills to procure sustainable employment.  The committee envisaged in this motion could not carry out a radical analysis of our manpower and educational policies.  In my view the correct model would be an inter-departmental committee comprising the Department of Labour, Finance, Education and other Departments who would come before the general body of Dáil Éireann rather than a select committee as envisaged in the motion.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that we will have in excess of 25,000 people coming onto the <Col N="479" /> labour market every year for whom there will be no jobs even if we create an additional 30,000 jobs per annum over the next five years.  It is obvious that the existing policies will not meet the problem and that we need a radical alternative in the short term to deal with it.</P>
    <P>A factor motivating the Members who tabled this motion was that they felt excluded from the process underlying the social partnership initiated by the previous Fianna Fáil Government in 1987 in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was subsequently followed by the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> so they have suggested the establishment of a social affairs committee. However, it is important that we do not under-value that process because it has made a significant contribution to economic and social development.  The concept of social partnership is good and should be supported by all parties in the House.  A social partnership does not exist across the water and we can see the obvious consequences.  Indeed, the social partnership has had beneficial results in education and has benefited the teaching profession and has resulted in changes in the curriculum.</P>
    <P>If Members want to become more involved, there is no reason that we should not have special debates on reports from the ESRI or NESC on a regular basis.  This might get over the difficulties that members of the Labour Party have in debating economic and social policy.  In the recently agreed Programme for Government, the Government have laid out a programme for Oireachtas reform which provides for short debates on topical issues on a regular basis.  This is welcome.  Having said that, however, Dáil Éireann is not a debating Chamber but is responsible for enacting legislation.  We could come in and debate topical issues <i>ad nauseam</i> without achieving concrete results.  We could spend our time debating like the Philosophical Society in UCC or the Literary and Historical Society but that is not the function of Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>We all know that The Workers' Party have used the committee system to very good effect over the years and hence their strong attachment to the committees.

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the members of The Workers' Party for their ovation. Rather than putting in place more elaborate committees, the Dáil should begin to restructure the existing committees, which have very fundamental problems. While I commend the Labour Party for tabling the motion because it gives us the opportunity to discuss an area which is increasingly important, I suggest that the committee as envisaged in the proposal is quite unworkable in the present circumstances.  This is not because the motion is flawed in itself but because the existing arrangements are deficient.</P>
      <P>In the 25 years that the question of Dáil reform and parliamentary committees have been discussed, the Dáil has failed to address the fundamental issues and flaws relating to the committee system.  It is now vital that improvements be made under a number of specific headings. Before we put a new committee in place we have to deal with these flaws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major problems at present is the question of non-compliance with the request from the committee to assist them in their work.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies have power to send for persons, papers <Col N="481" /> and records but they have no real form of redress when departmental officials or the officials of State-sponsored bodies or Ministers refuse to comply with that request.  The only redress open to that committee, or indeed any other committee at present, in the event of non-compliance is to issue some form of special report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  On virtually each and every occasion that a serious matter has been before an Oireachtas joint committee in recent years we have run into the problem of non compliance.  All administrations are equally to blame.  For example, in 1984 an Oireachtas joint committee wished to examine the affairs of Irish Shipping, but the officials from the Department of Communications refused to co-operate; in November 1984 the then chairman of Irish Shipping, which was rapidly going under water, refused to come before the committee. In December of the same year the Departments of Finance and Communications felt that it would be inappropriate for their officials to appear before the committee.  In 1985 when the committee was considering the issue of Dublin Gas and the role of An Bord Gáis, they refused to appear before the committee.  Special reports were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on each of these occasions but they had no impact whatsoever.  The problem has continued since then through the different administrations comprising different parties.  In March 1989, for example, the Oireachtas joint committee failed to get the co-operation of the Department of Energy in their attempts to examine the affairs of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, indeed the current committee made a special report on this matter as recently as July 1990, but to absolutely no avail.  In April 1989 the committee examined the affairs of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and received less than wholehearted co-operation from the board or the senior management of that company.  More recently, as Members are fully aware, the committee ran into problems when they tried to <Col N="482" /> examine the Sugar Company in the light of the evolving daily scandals.</P>
    <P>Again, in February last witnesses from An Post declined in correspondence to the joint committee and later when they attended a meeting of the joint committee to deal with An Post's viability plan, although they were pressed on that issue by members from all parties. Members from all sides of the House felt it was appropriate and proper that the viability plan be discussed in that forum. In those circumstances it is, I believe, quite ridiculous for us to talk about parliamentary reform or establishing further and more elaborate committees, no matter how well intentioned those committees may be, until the basics are put right.</P>
    <P>In addition to committees being empowered to call witnesses and to request documents, it is vitally important that they be given the powers to compel witnesses to attend and to compel the production of documents.  It is vital that penalties should be put in place for instances when there is any failure to co-operate with committees on this most important issue.</P>
    <P>On several occasions in the past Dáil Éireann has confronted this issue but on each and every occasion it has failed to do anything to resolve it.  The most spectacular example of that failure occurred in 1976 when the question of the power of committees to summon witnesses was contained in a draft Bill that was circulated and debated in the House.  The Government of the day are to be commended for drafting that Bill.  Extraordinarily, however, there was agreement on all sides of the House when the Bill was emasculated and the major elements within it, including its penalty elements, were withdrawn.  That Bill provided, for example, a very strong censure, including the possibility of imprisonment, for those who did not co-operate with Oireachtas committees. However, the Bill was emasculated and the relevant provisions were withdrawn before the Bill was finally enacted.  Lest I appear to be partisan, as I understand from my reading of the Official Report <Col N="483" /> of the time, those provisions were withdrawn with the support of all sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly it was unconstitutional. I accept that there is a difficulty there, but that is not an insurmountable difficulty, as Deputy Noonan knows.</P>
      <P>The second major issue that has to be addressed is the question of privilege of witnesses attending before committees. At present Members of the Dáil and Members of the Seanad have full parliamentary privilege when they appear before committees.  However, witnesses do not have that level of privilege and there is a question mark as to the kind of qualified privilege that exists for witnesses. This matter was also addressed in the legislation proposed in 1976 but again for some inexplicable reason, and it surely could not be on constitutionality&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the question of privilege to be conferred on witnesses was deleted from the Bill.  There was an intention at that time to go back to that issue but we never did.  The Dáil as a body is to blame for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A more fundamental issue raised by the existing arrangements in relation to committees of the House is the regular failure of the Dáil to pay any heed whatsoever to the work carried out by committees. Occasionally &mdash; and Members would agree &mdash; grudgingly the Dáil has debated reports produced by various committees.  Such debates have, however, been the exception rather than the rule and in general at best the debates are <i>pro forma.</i> In nine cases out of ten, reports produced by Oireachtas Committees are simply laid on the shelf, are ignored by the Dáil, by Ministers, by <Col N="484" /> Government Departments and certainly ignored by State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Another issue that must be considered before we put further committees in place is that of resources.  In 1986 the overall budget for parliamentary committees was £200,000.  In 1991 &mdash; and we have more committees now, more active committees &mdash; the budget figure has declined to £80,000.  With that much diminished budget spread over a larger number of committees it is impossible for consultants' studies to be commissioned. In fact, in the case of the Committee of Public Accounts it is not clear whether the committee have the right to engage consultants.</P>
      <P>A final thorny issue that must be resolved before moving further into the construction of committees is that of the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  I know the <i>sub judice</i> rule is before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at the moment but it is ludicrous that spurious suggestions that a particular debate is <i>sub judice</i> should prevent the House, any committee of the House or the other House from going into an issue of public and national importance.  The position is quite extraordinary. No Member of the House, no party in the House and no committee of the House would ever wish to prejudice a case, but to my mind the <i>sub judice</i> rule is regularly used as a red herring to prevent the proper exposition and examination of issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When those issues are examined it would be in order for us to discuss committees in some greater detail.  The kind of committee envisaged here is too broad.  We need a series of standing specialist committees to deal with areas of public policy and I know there is agreement on this issue on the opposite side of the House.  Those committees would have to be well structured and they would have to be well resourced.  Such committees would help us as parliamentarians to develop areas of special interest, they would help us to develop public policy and they would certainly <Col N="485" /> help the House &mdash; which has descended in the past few weeks to a cannibalistic level of debate, and we have all contributed to that decline &mdash; to get back out of confrontation politics.  For example, a standing committee on agriculture could examine all relevant matters relating to that area and could consider Second and Committee Stages of Bills and even the Estimates.  There is a huge amount of work to be done in that area.</P>
    <P>I commend the Labour Party for producing their resolution but it is rather too broad.  Given the structural weakness, the proposition &mdash; although I do not wish to call it untimely &mdash; would certainly be unworkable.  When we get the foundations right we should start talking about reform and about committees.</P>
    <P>I wish to give the rest of my time to Deputy Quill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members who have shared their time with me.  In the little time left to me I wish to congratulate the Labour Party on putting the motion before the House.  Apart from the other benefits of the motion, it has given us a timely opportunity to reflect on the way the existing committee is working in the House.  In that regard, Deputy Roche has given a very skilful explanation of his first-hand experience of the way it is working.  From my short experience as a chairperson of a Select Dáil Committee I endorse everything Deputy Roche said.</P>
      <P>Our committee, the Committee on Crime, is the newest of the Select Committees, being set up in July.  About three weeks after it was set up the committee were given a secretary to enable us to begin our work.  Five months later we still do not have a word processor to enable our secretary to work efficiently and well. The first point I wish to make in relation to that committee, based on the experience of every member is that our powers are much too restricted and our resources are miserly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If committees are to be effective they must all be given the powers and the resources to do their work thoroughly. They must be given powers to summon <Col N="486" /> witnesses, to compel witnesses to attend and to requisition papers and records. They must be given the resources to employ consultants and commission reports.  It is my belief that if Oireachtas committees with real teeth had been in place earlier some of the scandals that arose in recent times in State-sponsored bodies could have been averted.  Much of what is now being investigated by extremely costly tribunals might very well not have been necessary.  I am a firm believer in the benefits that can accrue to the Dáil by having proper network of committees, but those committees must be given teeth.</P>
    <P>From the formation of the Progressive Democrats Party we have always argued in favour of Dáil reform.  Every new Deputy feels a deep sense of frustration that somehow we are not getting the kind of return for the hours we put in.  Many of us came from jobs where time was organised in a different fashion.  We were unable to get much more work done and we were able to enjoy a deeper sense of achievement and fulfilment.  Every Deputy who wants to work to capacity feels frustrated by the system we have designed for ourselves in the House. Therefore, Dáil reform and reform of the committee system is long overdue to facilitate people who want to do their work in a more organised manner.</P>
    <P>In the Programme for Government, just negotiated and agreed between the two parties in Government, certain key elements of Dáil reform have been agreed and will be implemented.  For example, the sitting hours and length of sessions are being increased.  In addition, there is to be much greater use of select committees during consideration of new legislation.  A new European affairs committee is to be established which will involve our MEP's for the first time.  New voting procedures are to be examined.  In that respect, it would be my hope we will be able to move to an electronics system of voting before too long.  Our voting system here is about as out-of-date as the typewriter with which the secretary of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Crime must work at present.  That is a deep <Col N="487" /> source of frustration to every Member of the House.  Certainly I would support Deputy Martin when he said we must make some decent investment in the way in which we organise ourselves in this House.  It is of paramount importance that we invest in the installation of a proper system of electronic voting in line with that obtaining in the European Parliament and, I suspect, every other parliament in member states.</P>
    <P>New procedures will be put in place to facilitate debate on topical items needing to be addressed without delay and which cannot be facilitated within our existing channels.  That constitutes at least a modicum of reform agreed and which, when implemented, will lead to a vast improvement in the system that has obtained to date.</P>
    <P>What is envisaged in the motion before the House this evening is good but its aspirations are too wide-ranging and the relevant committees too unwiedly.  I contend this motion contains material for at least five different committees.  Since becoming elected to this House I have said, and will continue to say, it is a great pity we do not have a select Dáil committee on education, one area riddled with pressure groups.  I should love to see politicians grappling with education, bringing the subject within the political ambit, but, in order to do so effectively, there would need to be a select Dáil committee on education.  I should like to see that subject addressed separately and not forming part of the functions of the committee envisaged in this motion tabled by the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Certainly there is scope for a committee on agriculture but I cannot envisage any committee being able to address themselves to the vast array of economic and social issues mentioned in this motion in any depth or detail.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party might well have put more thought into this motion and identified one or two priority areas specifying that they be addressed by a new committee. Had they done that I am quite certain they would have received more support in the House this evening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="488" /> I reiterate what I said at the outset, that I see no merit whatsoever in proposing the establishment of any additional Oireachtas select or joint committees until such time as a proper system of funding is put in place to enable such committees to carry out their work efficiently and well.  Until such time as these committees are given adequate power they will not be able to achieve their aims and objectives.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate.  A number of Members have spoken of unemployment and what needs to be done about it.  We shall have to address this issue in a piecemeal fashion because there is no one, blanket recipe for curing existing unemployment. Nonetheless a series of different measures, if adopted, would go some way to alleviating the problem.  Here I might draw attention in particular to the failure of indigenous industries recently to deliver the requisite number of jobs. Small industries have worked extremely well.  There are statistics available to prove that, in industries employing 50 and fewer people, something in the region of 10,000 new jobs were created within a seven-year span from 1986 onwards.  Unfortunately, in indigenous industries employing 50 people and more, something like 32,000 jobs were lost, If there is one area beyond any other to which we must look it is our indigenous industries in order to ensure they generate some of the types of jobs so badly needed here in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought this debate was about unemployment.  It would appear that Deputy Quill and the twins on the Fianna Fáil benches vying for promotion regard it as about Dáil reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about setting up a new committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quill spoke a good deal of sense about the necessity for Dáil reform &mdash; I am not disputing that &mdash; but, as I see the thrust of the Labour Party motion, it is about setting up a committee to tackle unemployment; it is not about Dáil reform.  Despite what we <Col N="489" /> have heard this evening the contribution of the new Minister for Finance last evening made clear that it is the intention of the Government to vote down the motion before the House to have established, on a statutory basis, an Oireachtas social and economic committee to confront the current unemployment crisis. The Minister devoted his contribution almost entirely to undermining the mechanics and terms of reference of the motion rather than addressing the concept of such a committee.</P>
      <P>There is no more urgent challenge facing this Dáil than the worsening, horrific unemployment crisis causing such heartache, hopelessness and hardship to so many families.  There is no more important work that could engage an Oireachtas committee than seeking to influence a response to that crisis.  Surely the concept of a committee that would facilitate the emergence of an informed cadre of Deputies and Senators with expertise and influence on economic issues is one deserving of welcome rather than ridicule?  The tenor of the Minister's speech betrays hostility on the part of the Department of Finance and, by extension, on the part of the Government towards the emergence of any rival focus of power on economic policy.  Clearly the Department of Finance want to arrogate to themselves exclusive influence in the formulation of economic policy.  Equally clearly, the Government believe, despite the abundant evidence to the contrary, that they are the repository of all knowledge and power within the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent of participation afforded the social partners is being exposed as a fig leaf by the cruel winds of declining economic growth.  The Government are not prepared to take advice from an all-party Oireachtas committee but are very agreeable to continue receiving advice from the same unelected vested interests, posing as independent commentators, whose policy prescriptions have failed in the past.  It is disingenuous of the Government to pretend that partnership is a cornerstone of their economic policy and then oppose the elected Members of the Dáil being afforded the opportunity of <Col N="490" /> meaningful participation.  It is also plainly ridiculous to argue that a committee such as is being proposed would undermine the rights of those Deputies and Senators who would be excluded from membership. Deputy Martin continued to advance that argument this evening.</P>
    <P>The greatest crisis and challenge facing the country and the Government deserves the concentrated focus of a small number of Oirechtas Members prepared to inform themselves, to garner the expertise and avail of proper backup resources in an attempt to mount a coherent assault on unemployment.  Political crises may come and go but it seems that the jobs crisis goes on forever in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party yesterday published our views of an employment strategy in a document entitled &ldquo;Back to Business; the Real Crisis is Unemployment&rdquo;. The document sets out our broad strategy as to how Irish society might deal with its greatest problem.  We are finalising a further document, a review on industrial policy.  In my view these are the issues that ought to have been the focus of this debate.  For example, it is cynical and untypical of the Minister for Finance to argue that the appropriate forum for any discussion of NESC or ESRI reports is the full assembly of the Dáil or Seanad.  Even Deputy Roche disagreed fundamentally with the Minister on this point last night. The Minister knows that in so far as time has been provided to debate such reports, the debate comprises an unconnected series of monologues, as Deputy Roche said.  The Workers' Party would see the proposed committee as a well-resourced think-tank on unemployment that would study available analyses and publish specific recommendations for legislative action in the Oireachtas where necessary.</P>
    <P>Our own document argues that action is required under three headings, namely, the revision of industrial policy, the extension of democracy in the workplace and throughout our institutions &mdash; not just electoral reform, which has some fascination for Deputy Martin, although on whose behalf he is running with it I <Col N="491" /> do not know &mdash; and the radical reform of tax and social welfare systems with a view to their eventual integration to stimulate employment creation and to tackle the poverty trap.</P>
    <P>We need to dispose of the idea that unemployment is inevitable and that nothing can be done.  Why are people so fatalistic about unemployment?  There are several reasons.  The problem is a big one.  Every year the numbers who enter the labour market far exceed the numbers leaving it, plus the number of net new jobs.  The experts never seem to have solutions that work.  Ordinary people who often have practical and workable solutions usually get pushed aside by the lack of democracy in local industrial and political institutions.  Certain ideologies also breed apathy and fatalism.  People have been led to believe that the market must be left to its own devices and that &ldquo;interference&rdquo; is wrong.  They say, &ldquo;Look at Eastern Europe&rdquo; and claim that attempts at social and economic planning are doomed to failure.  What can individuals possibly do?  The development of the Single European Market and Ireland's marginal position and size within that market also make people feel that national policies, even if they could influence them, are increasingly insignificant. The idea of influencing EC policies to Ireland's advantage has not yet caught on.  Public apathy and fatalism suit Governments who will not tackle the jobs crisis effectively.  We are told that the problem is too big to cope with and would cost too much to solve.</P>
    <P>The size of the jobs crisis is indeed huge but the cost of unemployment is horrendous.  According to official statistics, over 20 per cent of the workforce is unemployed.  That is the worst in the EC but it is not the full truth, having regard to the extent to which the figures are massaged.  When one takes account of the pre-retirement allowance and various training courses, the figure is worse than 20 per cent.  The true cost of unemployment is difficult to quantify.  The direct cost in terms of social welfare and lost taxes is around £2,000 million or 10 <Col N="492" /> per cent of GNP.  The output which is lost as a result of 20 per cent or more of the labour force being jobless could be up to 20 per cent of GDP.  Irish society can ill-afford such a loss.</P>
    <P>Unemployed people suffer much more than a loss of income and society suffers much more than a loss of output or taxes. Unemployment is the main source of poverty.  It breeds lack of confidence and self-esteem.  It can cause poor health, mental as well as physical.  It can be linked to crime.  These can all lead to further problems, both for the unemployed person and for society as a whole. Everyone's confidence and security are undermined.  Even the people with jobs are affected.  Unemployment keeps wages down and taxes up.  It reduces your chances of ever changing jobs voluntarily and increases your risk of becoming stale and dissatisfied, hanging on to a job you dislike because there is no other job available.</P>
    <P>We would need approximately 35,000 extra jobs every year for the next ten years even to reduce official unemployment to the 1980 level of 100,000, which was then considered intolerable. About the year 2010 when the fall in the birth rate starts to show up in the jobs market, this dismal picture might change. Do we have to wait till then, as some people are suggesting?  What about the children who are already born and at school?  Do we really want them to be forced to emigrate, encouraged by cuts in welfare and obvious Government inaction on jobs?</P>
    <P>We are told that this callous agenda cannot be rejected, that there are so many obstacles to employment in the existing economy that they are insurmountable. The usual obstacles trotted out to explain why nothing can be done are the size of the population, the size of the country, our location and infrastructure, high wages, low productivity, high taxes and high debt-GNP ratio.  The Workers' Party recognise that there are problems relating to each of these factors, but we do not accept that they add up to a huge, insurmountable barrier that can never be overcome.  The &ldquo;too <Col N="493" /> many children&rdquo; theory which is fashionable is the first and worst recipe for despair.  Admittedly we caught on to a limited form of family planning rather late and the young people are already there.  They will need jobs and we must meet this challenge.  Other countries have done so.  Why not Ireland?  Our people must be seen as an asset, not a burden.</P>
    <P>As for the small size of the Irish market, this is no longer a real barrier to progress.  We have the huge EC market at our fingertips, if only we can grasp the nettle.  The costs of transport and communications are falling so they are no longer such major disadvantages.  Our physical infrastructure and our modern financial services sector are not serious obstacles either.  Ireland's wage costs are among the lowest in the EC.  Productivity growth during the eighties was the highest.  Personal taxes are indeed high, but this is because too few people are paying them and the burden is not fairly distributed.  There is little or no tax on wealth, companies or property.  There is still underpayment by sections of the self-employed and avoidance and evasion are still widespread.  As recent business scandals have clearly shown, the scope for avoidance runs into millions of pounds for those who are already wealthy enough to set up off-shore companies, engage in various tax scams and squeeze through whatever tax loopholes are visible to their accountants.</P>
    <P>Genuine tax reform, as opposed to tax cuts for the wealthy, would be of great benefit to job creation.  For us, this means reforming both the tax and social welfare systems, the harmonising of them in such a way as to ensure that every individual has an adequate living income, while everyone with an income in excess of this amount, whatever its source, pays tax on that income.  Radical tax and social welfare reform of this kind would provide a truly favourable climate for enterprise, a climate in which every individual released from the insecurity of inadequate income support could make a more active and creative economic contribution than is possible at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> The first lesson from our economic history is that no country can afford a static industrial policy.  It must keep changing and adapting to new conditions.  These days the latter are themselves changing more rapidly than ever before.  Irish industrial policy has a habit of changing too slowly.  We clung too long to protectionism, then to a policy of reliance on attracting foreign investment and now we cling to a policy of over-generous subsidisation of both native and overseas business.  We were advised by Telesis in 1982 to focus more directly on the development of indigenous firms and industries, but the advice was resented and resisted for too long.  Now, nearly a decade on, people are looking in that direction again.</P>
    <P>Indigenous industry is certainly one key to job creation, but at this stage it will not be the only one.  A successful industrial policy which will carry us into the next century will comprise several different and distinct strands.  We need much more productive enterprise in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the claims of some of our political opponents The Workers' Party are not anti-business or anti-enterprise; we oppose corrupt business and parasitic enterprise, as do most people in Ireland and most of the business community. Also contrary to many claims, we are not too bothered whether enterprise is public or private, native or foreign, as long as the firms create secure well paid jobs from an activity that is socially, economically and environmentally desirable. They not only need to be enterprising but efficient and democratic also.  Therein lies the difficulty.  Where are such firms to be found and how are they to be created?</P>
    <P>We favour commercial public enterprise and regard privatisation as a distraction from job creation: as Greencore showed, this can be a major distraction. The question of ownership, while important, is no longer the main issue, if indeed it ever was.  The issue is how and why an organisation succeed in motivating their workforce and fulfilling their objectives be they social, economic or whatever and who benefits from this success.  Neither is <Col N="495" /> the issue of size as crucial as it once appeared.  Very often the successful firms are the ones which are large and can afford to have their own research and development, marketing and so on, to compete and expand further.  Ireland has traditionally been at a disadvantage in this respect.  Only one Irish firm features in the European &ldquo;Top 1,000&rdquo; and then near the bottom of that list.  Three-quar-ters of all Irish manufacturing firms employ only one-quarter of all manufacturing workers.  The other 75 per cent are employed by the remaining 25 per cent of firms, of which many are subsidiaries of multi-nationals with their R&amp;D and marketing based abroad.</P>
    <P>We need more large, successful indigenous firms or rather a strategy to raise them since they are not inclined to grow up by themselves.  It is also clear that not everyone will be employed by such firms in the future or will even want to be.  Therefore, a strategy for small, successful enterprises is also important, particularly if the problem of rural poverty is to be addressed.  To date, this issue has been seriously neglected.  There are obvious difficulties about developing large, indigenous enterprises.  According to an IDA survey only about 150 firms currently have the potential to &ldquo;grow employment&rdquo; and of these one-third are actively trying to do so, one-third are thinking about it and one-third are not interested.  This latter group of large Irish companies prefers to make steady profits without major investment or risk taking. However, experience elsewhere shows that firms which do not change generally fail.</P>
    <P>An industrial policy is required which will direct the development of large successful indigenous industry, allow small enterprises to flourish and provide guidelines and standards for businesses of all kinds.  In future, State intervention and assistance must be more selective than in the past, more highly targeted, less wasteful and better geared towards supporting enterprise that will compete successfully and expand employment levels.</P>
    <P>The Workers's Party also recognise <Col N="496" /> that the role of the nation state is declining both in the global economy and the single European market.  To be effective, Irish industrial policy must have a strong EC dimension.  It must be part of an EC industrial policy.  This appears difficult at present because the EC is preoccupied with agricultural policy and is avoiding the issue of a common industrial policy. However, as resources are redirected from the Common Agricultural Policy EC funded industrial policy could be developed given the political will to do so.</P>
    <P>I strongly favour an interventionist EC industrial policy with convergence of the regions as a major target.  Jobs must be brought to the people, not the other way round.  Most Germans would welcome less industrial congestion, just as we would delight in new jobs in Ireland. Socially and environmentally it makes no sense for the present centralisation of employment to continue.  However, it will take a great deal to reverse, counter or even slow down the strong economic forces which favour centralisation and which are currently seen as sacrosanct. Intervention and interference with market forces are dirty words these days.</P>
    <P>Is it Utopian to imagine that firms could be encouraged through a common EC industrial policy to locate divisions in the poorer regions?  I think not.  Others in Europe, even in the richer states, are starting to favour this, to see an active interventionist policy as necessary and desirable to achieve convergence and equity.  Significantly, the EC has the largest stock of foreign direct investment in the world, well ahead of the United States and Japan.  Therefore, there is a great deal at stake.</P>
    <P>EC intervention is also needed to encourage European multi-nationals to co-operate with each other, merge and invest in other EC countries, especially on the periphery.  Only the EC, centrally, has the potential power to direct these companies and be heeded.  While I favour the development of multi-nationals I want this to occur under the eagle eye of a truly democratic body which represents the interests of workers and consumers <Col N="497" /> as well as shareholders; in other words, a more democratic EC than exists at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Martin in his contribution claimed that democratisation was part of the solution to this problem.  I agree with him but he did not extend the argument beyond proposing a single seat electoral constituency to this House.  The vital ingredient of our job strategy which is omitted is the question of democratisation of all our institutions be they local, industrial or political.  A good industrial policy is useless without the active involvement and commitment of our people.  At present most people feel excluded from the places where important decisions are made.  They are excluded at work, in politics and even in the home.  Greater flexibility and democracy in the workplace are essential if people are to co-operate to their mutual advantage and that of society in the production of modern goods and services. These days no one wants shoddy products of whatever sort and those who produce them will not survive in the marketplace for very long.  Increasingly, successful enterprises are the ones in which a team of workers operating more or less as equals pull together to produce a really good product.  Hierarchical structures, pyramid shaped firms, are seen to be not only distasteful but also given to waste and inefficiency.</P>
    <P>What is needed is a clear and new direction for Irish industrial policy.  Many old myths and clichés have to be abandoned. People must be convinced that it is possible to overcome whatever disadvantages we have by making better use of our advantages.  Our people are not the problem.  They are highly skilled and educated, a tremendous asset.  Ireland's size and location are not big problems either with modern transport and telecommunications and the Single European Market.  The fact that we are the closest part of that market to the US is now seen as an advantage and our green image in the environmental scene is also a major advantage in an increasingly polluted Europe.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party believe that the <Col N="498" /> selective development of large indigenous industry is essential and must be encouraged not just by new fiscal measures but through insistence on democratisation and the highest environmental and business standards.  Nowadays these standards are not merely desirable but absolutely necessary.  What matters is not so much the framework within which this happens or who owns that framework but the fact that it happens and that the beneficiaries are the workers, consumers, and taxpayers as well as the financiers, shareholders and traditional beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>The concept of the multiple stake holder in every enterprise must be recognised and extended.  For that reason, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I do not believe the Labour Party motion was ever intended to be taken up, as Government speakers so far have decided to interpret it, as being about Dáil reform and the establishment of a committee.  In my view the Labour Party proposal to establish a committee is incidental to what that committee were intended to do.  That committee were intended to devise a strategy to tackle the size of the unemployment problem with which I have dealt in my contribution.</P>
    <P>It is an insult to the anger, hopelessness and despair among people when so many families are affected by the scourge of unemployment; almost 300,000 people are heading rapidly in that direction according to some of the so-called independent commentators that the Government quote when it suits them.  It is an insult to those people to interpret it, as I have heard Government speaker after Government speaker, as a motion about Dáil reform.  I think the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, called it a mishmash of a proposal that would not do a first year organisation student justice. That is the kind of rhetoric that has contributed not one iota to the solution of unemployment during this debate.</P>
    <P>If the Government wish to alter the terms of reference of this motion I am quite sure the Labour Party would take that on board.  The facts of the matter are that it is about time a specialist committee <Col N="499" /> of this House was given the opportunity to garner the expertise, knowledge and information to influence the direction of economic policy.  It is a nonsense, as has been argued by the Minister for Finance, that it would be taking away rights from other Members of this House if we were to have such a specialist committee in conclave.  To argue that authoritative studies of the economy by NESC, ESRI or whatever is the proper forum to debate them and that they ought not to be subjected to minute scrutiny by such a specialist committee is a nonsense.  Whatever the defects in the terms of reference of the motion I think it is correct against the background of issues we have debated in this House, unfortunately, for the last four or five weeks that the emphasis should be on unemployment.  That is what this motion is about and it is correct, proper, overdue and too late that this House should be focusing its attention on the greatest problem that confronts this society.</P>

      <P>I will endeavour to signpost what I want to regard as priorities in the two and a half to three minutes available to me. First of all, the Government have already introduced a package of special measures to lessen the immediate effects of the global recession &mdash; I stress that it is a global, international recession.  We provided for 2,500 new places in the special employment schemes for the long term unemployed; the training of 1,000 new apprentices in targeted sectors and the creation of a new marketing initiative to develop tourism.  In addition, we have set up a special employment task force to explore new job creation possibilities and a special review of domestic industrial policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say that consensus has been the cornerstone of this administration's approach to tackling the major <Col N="500" /> economic and social problems which confronted us when we came into office.  We have succeeded in bringing about a level of partnership between the unions, employers, farmers and the Government which none of the parties opposite were even able to attempt, much less achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past five years our labour cost competitiveness has improved by one-fifth in common currency terms &mdash; indeed the OECD forecast that Ireland will experience the lowest unit wage cost increase of all OECD countries over the next two years.</P>
      <P>It is clear that this improved competitiveness means that we are now much better placed to take advantage of the anticipated upswing in world trade than we were ten years ago.  It is vital that we hold our nerve and not allow ourselves to be panicked into rash action merely for the sake of political expediency.  I refer again to the OECD &mdash; the international experts in this area &mdash; who assert and I quote:</P>
      <P>Persistence with the considerable policy efforts already embarked upon provides the best chance for the continuation of the impressive economic performance over the past three years. </P>
      <P>We should remind ourselves that, given the global situation, Ireland is performing well and is proving an attractive location for potential investors.  We must all be careful not to discourage investment by over-emphasising the negative aspects.</P>
      <P>I want to inform the House that I intend to publish very shortly a White Paper on manpower policy.  Policies which we have pursued up to now in relation to the long term unemployed and unqualified school leavers have to be reviewed and, if necessary, modified in the light of practical experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the strong improvement in the overall fundamentals in the last few years, arising from the Government's prudent economic strategy, we are now in a very good position to take advantage <Col N="501" /> of the projected world upswing in economic activity as it gets underway.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for allowing me to make those few comments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Labour rolls off his lips expressions such as level of partnership, cost and competitiveness, unit costs, much better placed, rash action, etc.  It is easy to roll these terms off the lips but what is the position? Where is the proof of the pudding?  The proof of the pudding is that we are rising up to 300,000 unemployed in this country. That is the nub of the matter.  All those plans and expressions and unit costs are not producing the result.  There is something lacking, There is something amiss, there is something wrong.  If we do not admit in this country, led by the Government, that there is ill-health, how can we hope to set about devising the cure?  In medical terms, first, we have acceptance of the fact that there is a problem, acceptance of the fact that this patient is ill; the second phase is diagnosis of what is the matter with the person who is ill; the third phase is cure.  One must proceed along those three steps.  This Government do not admit that the patient is ill.</P>

      <P>Our systems are right, the competitiveness is right, everything is going fine.  How can we hope to devise a diagnosis and a cure unless we come to terms with the fact that there is a major problem.  I would say to the Minister that if he and the Government do not come <Col N="502" /> around to accepting that there is a problem the people will, in the fullness of time, give them that message.</P>
      <P>There was a general election in Sweden within the last three months.  The Govenrment in office was defeated in that election.  The principal reason for the defeat was that the unemployment rate in Sweden had gone over 3 per cent for the first time in over 20 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Sweden is an economy where 85 per cent of married women participate, as of right, in the workforce. In addition, Sweden is a country of net inward migration.  If those two conditions were features of our economy here, our national unemployment rate would be between 30 per cent and 35 per cent and yet our Government and a great many economic commentators refuse point blank to acknowledge there is a crisis of employment in Ireland.  The Minister for Labour yesterday admitted in the Dáil that he was shocked at the fact that the vast majority of women in Ireland work in such low paid jobs, and that for every pound taken home by the average industrial male, the average industrial female takes home only 60p.  Where is the sense of shock at the fact that every family here has suffered a loss through unemployment or emigration?  Why are the Government elected to represent the people not as outraged as the country is at this crisis?  It is pointless talking about indicators as if the economy was somehow different to the people who live in it, who try to raise their families in it and who desperately want to work in it.  It is pointless to talk about the economy doing well if the people who are supposed to be the backbone of that economy are suffering.  It is pointless to talk about young people as our greatest asset if it is the asset that we export in the largest quantities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the last three months the Government have been one of the most active in the history of the State, but that activity consisted primarily of knifing each other <Col N="503" /> in the back at every opportunity.  The internal power struggle in Fianna Fáil which is still going on and will go on well into next year, has clearly taken precedence over the needs of the people. This spectacle of a Government at war with themselves with no prospect of a ceasefire in the immediate future must be a source of total despair for those thousands of people whose priorities are clearly different.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Government do not make choices because they are not capable of making choices.  It is clear that the Government have no priority other than their own medium term survival at any cost.  But each day that passes, people are making choices.  This week they are deciding what they must do without in order to put meat on the table.  Next week they will decide whether they can continue to live here and next month thousands of families will face the agonising choice of telling their children that Santa Claus will not come this year.  The Government tell us that the economy is doing well.  How would they know?  They do not have time to read the economic forecasts, let alone address the economic problems.</P>
    <P>This motion was modest, some might say too modest.  It was intended sincerely to hold out an opportunity to the Government to start building a consensus around an agreed analysis of this crisis and an agreed way of confronting this crisis.  We would like to see the committee established because it would give us an opportunity to put forward our proposals for a radical reform of industrial policy in Ireland and in Europe.  It would give other parties the opportunity to do something similar.  We would have wished to put forward proposals aimed at unleashing the economic potential that everyone knows is in our community.  We would have wished to put forward proposals calling for radical redefinitions of work, lifestyles and income sources.  We would not have approached that committee as if we alone had a monopoly on economic wisdom.  It would have represented a genuine opportunity for all parties in the <Col N="504" /> House to put forward their ideas and have them thrashed out in an objective and non-partisan manner.</P>
    <P>The committee would have given an opportunity for consultation with economists, the managers in the private sector and mangers in the public sector.  The decision of the Government to turn their backs on this proposal while admitting by their every action that they have no ideas, is one of a morally bankrupt government. If the Government cannot be persuaded to begin to take the problem of unemployment seriously they will surely have forfeited the respect of even their dwindling number of supporters.</P>
    <P>We intend to continue to highlight in any way we can the crisis of unemployment and emigration.  We will have an opportunity in the debate next week to address the European dimensions of this crisis.  The Labour Party emphasise that unemployment means waste and the scale of unemployment we are suffering means gigantic waste.  It is a waste of talent, a waste of resources, a waste of energy and, above all, a waste of human lives.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago, average Irish incomes were two-thirds of averge European incomes.  They are still the same today after 20 years of European grants subsidies and handouts.  If we addressed that problem and get average incomes to 75 per cent of the European average, we would have enough resources through additional tax revenue to service our debt comfortably and maintain the services the Government have decimated in the last few years.</P>
    <P>This tired stale Government have shirked their obligations to govern but they remain deeply committed to hanging on to power.  Their failure to govern has been the clearest obstacle in the way of real effective measures to translate any economic growth into sustainable jobs. For that failure, above all their other failures, the Government will long be remembered especially by the 300,000 unemployed we will have next year, as an unmitigated disaster.  The policies being pursued do not go anywhere near providing the level of employment we need.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="505" /> When conditions were booming such policies did not do it and when conditions worldwide were in depression, they did not do it.  We need a new approach drawing in all strands of opinion in this House. There is great merit in such an approach. There are economists, managers and people dedicated to the welfare of this country.  All the expertise must be drawn in and that was our objective in advocating the setting up of this committee. This would being about a change from the history of the last 30 to 50 years of massive emigration which has resulted in huge expatriate communities setting up in countries around the globe.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that with our small population and our resources we cannot provide worthwhile employment for our own people.  It can be done.  We have the expertise, the education and the people, <Col N="506" /> who, if given the opportunity and the leadership can do it.  Sadly, the Government respond by saying &ldquo;everything is all right&rdquo;.  It reminds me of a man I knew some years ago who, after suffering a great number of family tragedies, said &ldquo;I am just going to sit back and let it all happen&rdquo;.  That is precisely what the Government are doing; they are sitting back and letting it all happen instead of standing up straight, agreeing to co-operate with all strands of economic opinion and giving the leadership that the country now so desperately needs.  We in the Labour Party, by this motion, have set out to provide the mechanism to draw those strands together to give us a measure of hope and confidence for the future that the people so desperately ask for and so desperately demand.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Local Authority Bank Accounts.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The two main banks plan to introduce bank charges for local authorities. This could cost local councils more than £2 million per annum, lead to increased service charges and threaten the jobs of some local authority workers. Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks have threatened to close all local authority accounts from next June if the local authorities do not agree to the introduction of bank charges.  I would ask the Minister for the Environment to make it clear to the banks that such threats are not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> The practice of not imposing bank charges on the local authorities has been in place for almost 70 years.  It was an incentive offered by the banks in the twenties in order to attract local authority accounts.  While it is an attractive arrangement for the local authorities there has also been a positive side for the banks who have benefited from the good will generated by these accounts and from the fact that it attracted additional business from local authority customers and employees.</P>
    <P>The consequences of a change in policy would be very serious for local authorities who are already strapped for cash.  Councillors are at present struggling with the estimates for next year and are facing a virtually impossible task in making ends meet.  If they now have to budget for bank charges it will inevitably mean that they will have to raise the money in some <Col N="509" /> other way, such as by increasing service charges or by cutting jobs or services.  I do not believe that any of these options should be acceptable to boost the already substantial profits of the banks.</P>
    <P>It is not as if the banks are hard up. Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks earlier this month reported combined profits of more than £125 million for the six months ending September this year. This gives an annual profit rate of more than £250 million.  The rate of tax that the banks pay on these profits is considerably lower than the rates of tax paid by most PAYE workers.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the two main banks acting as a cartel in order to impose these charges.  Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks control about 80 per cent of the retail banking market.  I do not have the figure for the banks share of the local authority banking market but I suspect that it is higher than 80 per cent and probably nearer 100 per cent.  The Government have repeatedly talked about the need for genuine competition in the business and services sector.  Earlier this year we passed a competition Bill which we were told would prohibit companies coming together to agree on the imposition of a common level of fees or charges; yet, this is exactly what is happening in this case.  It is very unlikely that any of the other banks operating in this country would have the branch network necessary to service local authority accounts.  This would certainly be true outside of Dublin.  Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks are clearly taking advantage of their total dominance of the market in order to improve their profit level.</P>
    <P>The threat by these two banks to unilaterally close all local authority accounts from next June unless they agree to the imposition of charges is particularly regrettable.  This would mean that local authority employees, for example, could not even get their cheques cashed in some cases.  The Government need to take a strong stand on this matter; they should tell the banks that if they insist on taking £2 million extra out of the pockets of the taxpayers the Government will seek to <Col N="510" /> recoup it by increasing the levy or tax on the banks.</P>
    <P>I understand that a committee of city and county managers are discussing this matter with the Department of the Environment and the banks at present.  I ask the Minister for the Environment to ensure that a very strong stand is taken so that the banks do not get away with it and that £2 million is not taken out of the pockets of the taxpayers and local authorities who are already very hard up for money as the estimates debates in various council chambers now demonstrate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the concern of Deputy Gilmore in raising this mater. My Department were informed recently by Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland that they will be resigning their positions as treasurers to local authorities next May and that the accounts of the county and city councils will be closed.  I regret this action by the two main banks and I assure the Deputy that I will be looking into the matter in the near future and taking a strong stand on it.  I will be consulting local authorities about the implications of the threat and how local authorities should respond.  As the Deputy is aware, local authorities are currently discussing their estimates expenditure for next year and they are always faced with difficult decisions in trying to cope with the demand.</P>
      <P>Much progress has been made over the last two years by local authorities and the banks in agreeing to revise procedures for the operation of local authority bank accounts.  The revised procedures are currently being implemented by both parties and this will reduce the cost to the banks of managing local authority accounts.  The agreed report, prepared by a working party from all sides, went most of the way in meeting matters raised by the banks and it is very regrettable that they have not given more time for the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to note that local authorities have been exempt from bank <Col N="511" /> charges since 1925 when banking relationships between the banks and local authorities were put on a uniform footing. There has always been a special relationship between the banks and the local authorities as clients.  There is no doubt, especially in rural areas, that there is a special prestige for whatever bank handles the local authority account. Local authorities are regarded as good customers who can be relied upon to meet their commitments on time and without default.  I do not think that there is a bank manager who would not wish to have a major local authority account. In recent months my Department, jointly with the county and city managers, discussed all aspects of banking matters with the Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland.  It was quite clear that the banks wished to introduce charges for the whole range of local authority banking transactions.  My Department and the local authorities felt that more time should be allowed to see the results of improved banking procedures.  It was felt that it was better to concentrate on improving efficiency rather than having charges imposed.  The banks could not accept this and they have now moved to demanding payment of bank charges, which had been in abeyance during the negotiations.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that some local authorities were not asked to pay any charges because of the profile of their accounts at the time and others who were asked to pay have been resisting the request.  While I have not had the opportunity, in the short period since I became Minister for the Environment, to look into the position as closely as I would like, I feel that the move by the two main banks to give notice at this stage of their intention to resign from handling local authority accounts is precipitate.  I am a little surprised at the banks' apparent attitude to local authorities whose functions are to provide services on a nonprofit basis to local communities.</P>
    <P>I will be looking into the matter closely in the very near future and I assure the House it is my intention to ensure that <Col N="512" /> local authorities will continue to have banking facilities available to them on an appropriate and suitable basis.</P>

      <P>For anyone becoming wholly or partially unemployed it is a major disappointment but for the 40 craft workers currently engaged in the workshops at Davitt Road, Rathmines, by the Employment Board for the Blind to have got notice that they are being put on a three-day week is a source of great stress and strain.  These workers come from many parts of Ireland, including my own county, and they are accommodated in Dublin in flats and elsewhere.  For the first time they find that their weekly wage has been reduced to £85.</P>
      <P>It is not my role to offer criticism or praise to the Employment Board for the Blind.  However, it has been strongly indicated that in 1989, when there was a major transition from Rathmines to Davitt Road, a period of five months elapsed without a board being <i>in situ</i> as a former board had been dissolved and the new board had not taken up their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly after the new board had taken up their responsibilities, they announced a business restructuring plan for the workshops.  Arising from that a variety of changes were proposed to be introduced, including borrowing a very substantial sum of money to pay for a mortgage on the premises.  The national union concerned with the protection of the blind workers feel that the mortgage in question will certainly cause difficulties for the concern.  The 40 blind workers have a tremendous potential in employment and skills and I appeal to the Minister of <Col N="513" /> State to endeavour to defer the introduction of a three-day week.  The craft in which these handicapped people are being engaged has been traditionally under the umbrella of the Department of Health and the health boards.  I ask the Minister to initiate discussions with the Employment Board for the Blind and the union catering for the blind with a view to finding a formula whereby they could defer the introduction of the three-day week at least until after Christmas, and try to initiate proposals which would usher in a protracted and successful future for this necessary industry for our handicapped people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Moynihan I am very disturbed at the threat of a three-day week for the 40 blind staff and the ten sighted staff at Blindcraft.  It must be borne in mind that this is the only properly structured project for supported employment for people with a disability.  It is sad that employment even at this centre has been declining from over 70 workers some years ago to only 40 at present.  If they are put on a three-day week their pay, as Deputy Moynihan said, will be reduced to £85 per week.  That is less than the subvention being given by each health board to the person in the centre living in their area.  The subvention amounts to £147 and, as I said, if the workers are put on a three-day week they will be paid only £85, which is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I recognise that Blindcraft are in financial difficulties but one of the major reasons for this was the prolonged closure of 18 months which was partly due to the delay by the Minister in appointing the board.  It was also due to the fact that the board had to withdraw their original plan for refurbishment.  Those lapses in planning were not the fault of the workers who will now have to pay the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department have been pushing hard for a reduction in the subvention and for rationalisation but their view is short-sighted. It has to be borne in mind that under this proposal there will be extra unemployment benefit payments to <Col N="514" /> the workers of £120,000 in a full year and a lower tax yield of £100,000.  Therefore the loss to the Exchequer will outweigh the savings.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that this project is unique. He should sit down with the board, the national league and the union involved and try to hammer out a deal.  The introduction of a three day week should be postponed, as Deputy Moynihan has said, until at least after Christmas when a new structured proposal can be put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to thank Deputy Moynihan for giving me an opportunity to address this very important issue.  I also express my appreciation to Deputy Richard Bruton for his contribution.</P>
      <P>The board for the employment of the blind were established in 1957 to provide employment opportunities for the blind. They operate the well-known blindcraft workshops which specialise in basketry and bed-making and employ 39 blind workers.  For a number of years the board have experienced difficulties in the areas of sales, marketing and production.  This has resulted in the board incurring increasing deficits on their operations.</P>
      <P>In the current year the total subvention from my Department to the board amounts to £559,000 &mdash; £319,000 capitation payments from health boards and £240,000 additional funding paid directly by my Department.  This level of funding, with every prospect of it increasing in future years, could not be sustained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems were compounded by the poor condition of its former workshop premises in Rathmines.  The Rathmines premises were sold in June 1989.  Under the terms of the sale, the board were forced to vacate the workshops at Ardee Road in July 1990 and the retail shop in Rathmines in April 1991.  The board experienced considerable difficulties in finding a suitable new premises.  A complicating factor was the difficulty of transferring the blind workers out of the city to any of the outlying industrial estates.  The Davitt <Col N="515" /> road premises were purchased in July 1990.  Because substantial refurbishment had to be carried out, it was not ready for occupation until August 1991.  As a result, the workshop staff were idle for a period of 12 months with a consequent loss of production.  I might add that throughout this period the staff who were at home continued to receive full pay from the board.  This caused a further deterioration in their finances.  There was a real prospect that the board would be forced to cease trading if corrective action was not taken.  The board would have required a minimum of a further £138,000 this year to resolve their cash-flow problems which my Department were not in a position to provide.  In order to ensure continued trading, the board drew up a &ldquo;Restructuring/Business Plan&rdquo; which called, <i>inter alia</i> for a significant increase in production and sales; production staff working a three day week, increasing to five days by 1994 as production and sales increased; shedding eight sighted staff who were surplus to requirements resulting in an annual saving of £102,000.</P>
    <P>In view of the serious financial difficulties facing them the board felt that they had no option but to proceed with the introduction of a three day week from the week commencing Monday, 18 November 1991.  While I accept that the board's operations will continue to require a measure of State support, I am, as indeed are the board, concerned at the increasing level of subvention required for the relatively low level of employment they provide.  If the long term survival of the workshops is to be assured, it is essential that the board adopts a more commercial approach to their operations. This will involve some sacrifices in the short term and a willingness by management and staff alike to face up to their current difficulties.  All our efforts must be directed at ensuring the long term survival of the board's operations and the employment they provide for blind people.  My Department are working closely wih the board to identify suitable <Col N="516" /> redeployment opportunities for the staff who are surplus to requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this serious problem which exists not alone in Dublin but throughout Ireland.  I will briefly take this opportunity to congratulate the new Minister for Health and to wish her well.  I would be grateful if the Deputy would convey my sentiments to her.  However, there the honeymoon ends.</P>
      <P>Health cuts are like a death in the family; until they visit you they do not exist.  By way of some short illustrations I will point out the disastrous state of the health services resulting from inadequate and improper funding of the Eastern Health Board by the Department of Health.  As a practising general practitioner I see at first hand every day the problems that have been created by the pesent financial crisis.  Bread supplies to Cherry Orchard hospital were cut off for one day because the bill was seriously in arrears.  An electrical supply firm on the north side of Dublin refused to supply the Eastern Health Board with necessary electrical equipment because the health board are in arrears to the tune of over £10,000.  A builders' providers firm on the south side of the city refused to supply equipment such as doors and locks to the Eastern Health Board because they too are owed over £10,000 by that health board.  Drug companies are threatening to withdraw drug supplies because the Eastern Health Board are nine months in arrears with their payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other side of the health services, elderly people, many of them homeless with no living families, require long term care in nursing homes.  All of these people are means tested and have medical cards but find they must pay for simple nursing requirements such as incontinence pads, incontinence sheets, dressings and so on.  Grants to private nursing homes, normally payable monthly, are in some cases four months <Col N="517" /> in arrears, in many cases they are five or six months in arrears.  The grant payment by the Eastern Health Board for long term patients in nursing homes is, in 1991, £39.50, in 1987 it was £39.50 and in 1983 it was £39.50.  There has been no increase in grant payments for long term patients in nursing homes since 1983. This places an intolerable burden on nursing homes and on the families of the over-burdened and hard-pressed PAYE taxpayers who must fund the difference from limited incomes.</P>
    <P>The Mater Hospital will this year alone have a shortfall of £2 million in their budget.  Wards have been closed, further wards will be closed and tragically patients may die.  That is a fact which can be confirmed by many of the consultants in the hospitals.</P>
    <P>In the last six months there have been major financial scandals in this country. Indeed, for the last two months we have heard of them every day in the Dáil. There was a shortfall of £17.5 million in Aer Lingus Holdings, a shortfall of £8 million in Greencore, major financial scandals in Telecom Éireann and the Goodman organisation are under investigation. For the last three years there has been a two-tiered health service in operation, one for the fortunate to whom high tech, high quality medicine is available on demand and one for the unfortunate and underprivileged who by virtue of their economic and social circumstances have been relegated to the status of second class citizens under the present Coalition Government.  This is morally and socially unjust and is against all the principles of a Christian and caring society.  That is the present position in the Eastern Health Board area.  In short, the health service is a disaster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on this issue.  The question of health service funding levels and the return which the State gets for its investment in this area is one which goes to the heart of any consideration of how <Col N="518" /> best to provide for the health needs of our people.</P>
      <P>The Deputy in his motion refers to a financial crisis in the Eastern Health Board.  I am surprised at the terms he chose to use.  On more than one occasion in the past few months the previous Minister for Health clearly outlined the procedures by which health agencies manage their cash.  Briefly, each health board and hospital are notified at the beginning of the year of their approved expenditure allocation.  They also receive a cash profile calculated on the basis of the approved expenditure level.  This profile sets out the manner in which cash payments will be made by my Department to the agency over the course of the year ahead.  Once these cash and expenditure levels have been determined it is up to each board to manage their affairs so as to live within the limits set down.  This is a statutory responsibility of each health board and the board of management is best placed to decide on these operational issues.</P>
      <P>It has been stated on a number of occasions in this House that services in 1991 are being maintained at approved 1990 levels.  In addition, an enhanced value for money programme is being supported during the course of the current year which has begun to free up valuable resources for redeployment within the system.  In this respect, indeed, the Eastern Health Board have been to the fore in devising new systems of purchasing for the health sector which match quality for the patient with value for the purchaser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no sense in pretending that we have limitless resources available to us in health.  The community make a wide range of demands on the public finances. I referred a moment ago to the link between the approved expenditure allocation given to each agency and the cash made available on foot of this allocation. It must follow that where a board or hospital go beyond the approved level of spending there will not be cash available to match the overspend.  This must be the case.  To do otherwise would be to penalise those who respect budget limits <Col N="519" /> so as to give cash to those who have overspent.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Eastern Health Board, in common with almost every health agency, started out this year with fairly tight budgetary constraints.  The board produced a service plan to live within their budgets and are currently working to that plan.  A number of funding issues remains to be settled between my Department and the board, as is always the case at this point in the budgeting cycle.  I am confident, however, that this year, as last year the Eastern Health Board will continue to deliver a comprehensive and quality service to those in need of it and within approved funding levels.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Deputy's contention that there is a financial crisis, or any sort of crisis, in the Eastern Health Board and I only hope that the terms of his motion do not make the board's task any more difficult than it is at present.</P>

I propose to call the Deputies I have selected in the following order: Deputy Therese Ahearn, Deputy Deasy, Deputy Hogan, Deputy Flanagan and Deputy D'Arcy, Each Deputy is entitled to two minutes in respect of each matter and each of the statements will be followed immediately by a two minute reply from the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  However, as the matters raised by Deputy Ahearn and Deputy Deasy are similar, it is proposed that both Deputies will make their statements and the Minister will reply to both Deputies thereafter.  Similarly as the matters raised by Deputy Hogan and Deputy Flanagan are similar I propose that both these Deputies will make their statements and the Minister will reply to both Deputies thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, <Col N="520" /> I thank you for allowing me raise this urgent and pressing matter.  The enormous delay in the payment of headage premiums in 1991 to over 90,000 farmers is totally unacceptable.  In fact, I consider it nothing short of arrogance on the part of the Government not only to delay the payments but to assume that the farming community can be treated in such an offhand and uncaring manner.</P>
      <P>The Government's action is causing not only annoyance and frustration among farmers but severe hardship and stress at a time when agricultural incomes are at such an alarmingly low level that many farmers are finding it very difficult to survive.  These payments are, I stress, a lifeline to many farmers to take them through the winter months when income from all other sources has ceased.  These payments will make the difference between survival and decline in their livlihoods. I wonder if the Department really appreciate that headage and other premium payments are such an important part of farmers' incomes.  In spite of the protest by the IFA in Castlebar, the Minister for Agriculture and Food could not give a commitment that all headage premiums would be paid before Christmas. I believe that the commitment given by the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughty, to the IFA president, Mr. Alan Gillis, earlier this year that all payments would be made in 1991 should be fulfilled.  I want to impress on the Minister that no farmer can afford to wait, he needs a 100 per cent pay out of what is due to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister to state when headage payments increases will be announced and whether the Department will change the administrative procedures for headage and other premium schemes.  The present procedure is cumbersome and difficult.  In fact its only notable characteristic is that it causes farmers to make mistakes in completing the form.  Surely a more simple and less complicated procedure is possible.  An extraordinary number of farmers has lost out on premium and headage payments due to errors in completing the application forms and as a result has been denied payments.  I appeal to the Minister <Col N="521" /> to take urgent action to ensure that all headage payments will be made.  The money is owed to the farmers, all I am asking is that the Minister pays up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Ahearn has stated, 90,000 farmers are affected, and because of the chronic income crisis in farming they really need the headage payments immediately.</P>
      <P>The sum of £200 million which is involved is made up of headage payments for the disadvantaged areas, and premiums in respect of beef and suckler cows.  There is some prospect, I believe, that the bulk of the headage payments will be made by the end of this year but we are asking that the total amount be paid because of the incomes crisis in farming.  Bank managers and business people in general are crying out for payment and the financial institutions are putting undue pressure on quite a number of farmers.  There is something in the region of £100 million outstanding in headage payments, £12 million of which is an additional payment agreed under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> but we have no details as of yet as to how that money will be distributed.  A further £80 million is due in special beef and sucklet cow premiums, none of which has been paid to date and the indications are that very little of it will be paid in the current year.  In actual fact a category of farmer who is particularly badly off is the small dairy farmer who is entitled to a special suckler cow premium as his milk quota is under 12,800 gallons per annum.  This category of farmer have not been paid their premium payments for 1990, let alone 1991. They have a particular problem.</P>
      <P>In addition sheep farmers, who have been recently reclassified and fall within the disadvantaged areas scheme, have been promised that they will be paid a particular element of the ewe premium but to date it has not been paid and some 7,000 farmers are affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me thank Deputies Ahearn and Deasy <Col N="522" /> for raising this matter.  I propose to take the issues raised by both Deputies together.</P>
      <P>There is no particular delay in the payment of headage grants this year.  In fact so far this year £176 million has been paid out on livestock headage grants in 1991. It is anticipated that another £88 million will be paid out before the end of the year bringing the total to £264 million. The vast bulk of the remaining payments to be made will be headage payments totalling about £63 million under the disadvantaged areas cattle, sheep, equines and goat headage schemes, about £21 million under the suckler cow premium scheme and £4 million under the special beef premium scheme.</P>
      <P>As in previous years, some 70 per cent of all grants due under the disadvantaged areas schemes will be paid in the calendar year to which those schemes refer.  The farmers in our disadvantaged areas, therefore, will receive the same proportion of grants as they have always received.  I assure both Deputies that in the new year every effort will be made to pay all remaining grants as quickly as possible.  In addition, we have managed to bring forward from January 1992 to mid-November 1991 the payment of £32 million under the ewe premium scheme following our request to the EC for such earlier payment.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the need to carry out surveys as soon as possible into the submissions made by many groups throughout the country to the Department of Agriculture and Food and the appeals tribunal in respect of disadvantaged areas.  I hasten to add that the issue of disadvantaged areas is probably one of the greatest political footballs in our political history.  It could have been used and could still be used as a bargaining point in the negotiations in Brussels but the Government, the Minister, and certainly the previous Minister, did <Col N="523" /> not have the will or the political commitment to take the issue on board.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that it will take 220 inspectors three months at a rate of four farms per day to carry out the work on the submissions received by the appeals tribunal.  I was informed, and it was confirmed to Deputy Yates recently in the House, that the surveys would not commence until 1992 in March or April.</P>
      <P>That amounts to another broken promise by the Government.  I welcome the fact that we have a new Minister for Agriculture and Food and I hope that when he makes a commitment he will stick to it, that his word will be his bond unlike the previous Minister, particularly in relation to the issue of disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with the greatest political football since the promise made by the Fianna Fáil Government of the thirties to drain the Shannon. The survey on disadvantaged areas status was a false promise and will go down as such in the folklore of Irish agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Minister for Agriculture and Food should make sufficient resources available to allow the survey be undertaken without delay.  In the light of the farm income crisis, not only in counties Laois and Offaly but throughout the country, the commitment made by the Minister's predecessor, now Minister for Labour, at the first meeting of the appeals <Col N="524" /> panel that all necessary resources would be made available for the carrying out of a 100 per cent survey now rings very hollow indeed.</P>
    <P>On 5 November in the House the Minister stated that the survey would not begin until next March or April.  That is not good enough.  The delay is completely unacceptable at a time when farm incomes have been slashed.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State is aware, designation is the only way of surviving at present.  I note that the appeals panel will meet on Friday next to discuss the matter of funding and, in view of the huge volume of applications received so far by the Department, it is necessary that those resources be made available to allow the field officers undertake the survey without further delay.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the benefits are available primarily from the European Community, it seems ridiculous that the matter should go on and on with little or no progress being made to date.  I trust that the new Minister will undertake this task immediately or else resign.</P>

      <P>The Department have a mammoth task in carrying out the surveys <Col N="525" /> and in the subsequent processing of the data at a time when there are many other demands on resources.</P>
      <P>In the past few weeks the Department have been examining other less expensive options, including the possibility of obtaining survey data from the CSO, who carried out a survey of all farms as recently as last June.  It has now been ascertained, however, that the required information will not be available from the CSO in time or in the detailed form required and that the necessary details can be acquired only through further inspections by departmental staff.  We will, therefore, be going ahead with arrangements for the carrying out of inspections of the 40,000 farms seeking inclusion as soon as possible.  Those inspections are expected to begin next month or early in the new year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me permission to raise this issue.  It has come to my attention that a percentage of farmers are being penalised for providing incorrect information on their application forms under the beef premium scheme.  In many cases although the incorrect information may apply to only one or two beasts in a herd of 30 or 40 the whole herd is deemed ineligible, not just for the 1991 scheme but also for the 1992 scheme.  In some cases the mistake may have been a genuine one.</P>
      <P>The percentage of herds deemed ineligible for one reason or another is, I understand, running at between 10 per cent and 12 per cent in County Wexford, and the same percentage applies right across the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The punishment certainly does not fit the crime.  In one case a farmer applied for the male animals in his herd and entered a tag number from a card which related to a male.  However, when the Department's inspector checked the herd that animal was found to be a female.  As a result the farmer was disqualified from <Col N="526" /> all grants for two years although the mistake was made by a Department inspector in the first instance.  No one is infallible.  I am sure the Minister is aware that when one is reading cattle tags it is very difficult to spend time checking ears for marks of one sort or another, particularly if the cattle are very excitable &mdash; some continental cattle breeds are very excitable and their tags are very difficult to read.</P>
    <P>I accept that the regulations are made at EC level and that the scheme is completely funded by the EC.  The Minister should put a case to the EC for the farmers of Ireland asking that some discretion be used at national level with regard to this year's applications.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate if the Minister would see to it that applicants deemed ineligible are paid for animals identified correctly on the application forms, especially in view of the conditions that prevail this year.  This was referred to previously by the Minister of State and other speakers.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Minster of State that all ear tags are now computerised and nobody can defraud the Department in that respect.  The Minister, as a farmer, will understand that by and large when cattle are being tested one can expect defects to the tune of about 8 per cent.  The Minister's Department consistently make mistakes yet the farmers are penalised.  The amount of time being spent by district veterinary officers and farmers in trying to sort out these problems is incredible, and I appeal to the Minister to change the regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to the beef premium scheme is that last year the EC Commissioners allowed, at our request, a great deal of flexibility under the scheme as it was the first year in which on-farm inspections did not take place in all cases.  As a result of this, a great many 1990 scheme applicants were paid the special beef premium who would otherwise not have been paid for that year at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In allowing this flexibility, however, the EC Commission insisted that from <Col N="527" /> 1991 onwards all applicants in Ireland must fully comply with all the regulations governing the scheme.  Despite warnings issued to this year's applicants, I am sorry to say that some continued to make the same mistakes as last year, for example, by applying on female animals, or on animals whose identity cards had already been marked to show that they had already received the premium.  As a result, my Department had no choice but to apply the appropriate penalties laid down by the EC.</P>
    <P>Having checked this with the appropriate section in the Department I should say that, where mistakes were made without fraudulent intent and where there is <Col N="528" /> reasonable explanation for such mistakes, the Department are making every effort to treat each case with flexibility and understanding because it appears that some of the penalties laid down by the EC are too severe.  In fact the Department have taken up this matter with the Commission.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy D'Arcy that we will continue to press the European Community and that every effort will be made to achieve a satisfactory outcome to this problem.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the European Energy Charter which is still under discussion by participating countries.  It is planned that the Charter will be signed by Ministers with responsibility for energy matters at a conference in The Hague on 16-17 December 1991.</P>
      <P>The European Energy Charter will be a political declaration expressing a desire for European wide co-operation in the energy sectors.  While this declaration will not be binding legally the Principles of the Charter will be given legal effect by means of a basic agreement which is expected to be signed at a later stage by all Charter signatories.</P>
      <P>The aim of the Charter is to improve security of supply, maximising efficiency in all aspects of energy, enhance safety and minimise environmental problems.</P>
      <P>The objectives envisaged under the Charter are: 1, Expansion of trade in energy; 2, Co-operation in the energy field; 3, Facilitation and protection of Energy investment, and 4, Efficient use of energy and environmental protection.</P>
      <P>The basic agreement will cover institutional and organisational issues; there will also be specific agreements (protocols) which will be legally binding. These will be agreed to cover the different issues.  The following areas have already been identified: efficient use of energy including environmental protection; oil and gas sector; electricity; coal; renewable energies; nuclear safety; transfer of technology and co-operation in dealing with major accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has fully supported the initiative for a European Energy Charter from the outset and our support has been made <Col N="372" /> known by the Taoiseach at meetings of Heads of State and by me at European Energy Councils.</P>
    <P>There are 35 participating countries, notably European Community member states, US, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the USSR and countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  While the initial impetus for the Charter was energy security of supply for Europe, there are clearly, also, political advantages and major general economic advantages for the USSR and the Eastern European countries in having major energy development and assured energy markets for gas and oil.</P>

      <P>As part of the Valoren programme, my Department commissioned a survey in 1989 to identify the most suitable sites for wind energy development and to make detailed assessments of the wind regimes at those sites.  The results of this survey published in early 1990 showed that Ireland has one of the best wind resources in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other than this survey, my Department have not undertaken any research <Col N="375" /> in the area of wind energy in recent years. However, during the period 1980-87 my Department undertook a pilot, demonstration programme in co-operation with other bodies and the EC to investigate the potential contribution wind energy could make to Irish energy needs.  The pilot projects carried out under this programme took place at the following locations Innis Oirr, County Galway; Ballyferriter, County Kerry; Sligo Regional Technical College; Ballinamore, County Leitrim; Fermoy, County Cork; Creagh, County Mayo; Kinsealy, County Dublin; Malin Head, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>In addition to this programme, my Department contributed towards the cost of an EC energy demonstration project undertaken by a private German company on Cape Clear Island.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure by my Department on wind energy during this period was in the region of £600,000.</P>
    <P>While it is fair to say that the overall results of this programme did not live up to initial expectations, it did establish a base for further progress.  The programme took place at a very early stage in the development of wind power technology when technical reliability was still evolving.  The results therefore could not be used as a guideline for the future potential development of wind power in Ireland.</P>
    <P>A specific consultative committee or other such arrangement has not been established to deal with wind power questions of mutual interest to my Department and ESB.  Establishment of a windfarm in Bellacorick, County Mayo is the main wind power development in prospect at present and there have been frequent discussions between my Department and ESB on this project.</P>

      <P>The June talks in Pattaya made significant progress.  The Cambodian factions agreed to an unlimited ceasefire and undertook to stop receiving foreign military aid.  Agreement was also reached on the question of the chairmanship of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia and that the SNC should represent Cambodia at the United Nations General Assembly.  These positive developments were an indication of a growing spirit of compromise and flexibility by all concerned which led to the signature of the comprehensive political settlement of the conflict in Cambodia on 23 October in Paris.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Court of Auditors report is a valuable commentary on the EC sugar regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not however agree that the sugar regime has failed to establish a common market.  The common organisation of the market in sugar is in line with the principles enshrined in the treaty.  Indeed the Commission and the Council ensure that <Col N="383" /> each individual measure is in conformity with these principles.  Community competition rules apply to the sugar regime and the Commission can take measures to deal with infringements.</P>
    <P>Regarding the court's comments about Article 39 of the treaty it must be pointed out that stabilisation measures have always existed in the sugar sector through production quotas and self-financing arrangements.  The latter ensures that, over a given year, Community producers meet the full cost of the disposal of quota production surpluses.  There is also a system of compensation for storage costs which is self-financing.  While the Community supply rate is 50 per cent above requirements, imports from third countries account for about half of that figure.</P>
    <P>Production quotas are set for each member state, and these quotas are administered by the member states in accordance with Community rules.  When fixing these quotas, the Community took into account the level of production in each member state.  This policy reflects the Community's determination to maintain a certain level of production by beet growers and sugar manufacturers in all regions of the Community.  This helps to make a direct contribution towards the development of rural society in these regions.  A reduction in either production quotas or in the production of &ldquo;C&rdquo; sugar would not result in savings on the cost of the regime because any surplus quota sugar which is exported is paid for by producers under the self-financing system and &ldquo;C&rdquo; sugar does not attract any export refunds.</P>
    <P>In general I am satisfied with the operation of the EC sugar regime and I would not like to see any major changes when the next review takes place before the 1993-94 marketing year.</P>

      <P>Irish live calf exports have increased significantly this year.  During the first ten months to end October 1991 more than 22,000 calves were exported compared to only 5,000 head for the whole of 1990.  The reason for this turn around is largely due to the imposition by the EC earlier this year of a ceiling on live imports from third countries.  This ceiling of 425,000 head on animals under 300kgs. was reached last May and since then EC importers have had to source their calf supplies inside the Community. As a consequence there has been an increased demand for supplies of Irish calves, mainly from Italy and France, which are the largest EC veal producers, with Spain accounting for a small amount of the trade.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 92 and 94 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The station at Allenwood is well past its projected useful lifespan; it has a low plant load factor and operates at low thermal efficiency.  The cost of the electricity generated there is considerably in <Col N="388" /> excess of that produced in other more modern and efficient generating stations. The details are published in the ESB's annual reports.</P>
    <P>An important element of the Government's energy policy is the development of our indigenous energy resources. Apart from reducing our reliance on imported fuels, and thus improving the balance of payments position, the development of indigenous resources also adds to the delivery of fuels in the Irish market, leading to an improved security of supply.</P>
    <P>I have informed the House previously of the terms of the Government's decision, taken in August 1990, that the ESB will continue to operate the power station and Bord na Móna will supply turf to the station as long as supplies from the local Bord na Móna bogs permit.  The ESB were also informed of the Government's decision in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have also informed the House previously that the continued operation of the station is contingent on the ESB being able to continue operating there, having regard to the age of the station, the possibility of a major breakdown occurring, and the safety of the employees and of the general public.</P>

      <P>There are five permanent staff employed in my private office at present and the total gross cost involved is £54,000 per annum.  There are no part-time staff employed.  I regret to say that it is not possible to furnish comparable data for earlier years given the time available to me.  The situation is also complicated by the fact that prior to the mid-eighties the Departments of Health and Social Welfare were held as a joint ministry and the Minister's private office was staffed by both Departments.</P>

      <P>The present statutory responsibilities of health boards relate to children below the age of 16 years, except where children in their care attain that age in which case the boards are empowered to continue to assist them.  On 31 December 1989 there were 349 children over 16 years of age in the case of health boards.</P>
      <P>Under the Child Care Act, 1991 the boards' responsibilities will extend to children up to the age of 18 years and they will have a specific duty in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless children.  In anticipation of the implementation of the new provisions, the health boards, including the Eastern Health Board, are increasingly providing services for homeless teenagers in the 16 to 18 years age group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish leaving certificate and the British A levels are different types of examination which cannot be compared on a like to like basis.  The leaving certificate is a general subjects examination for candidates who have studied at least five subjects for two years.  A levels are designed for older candidates, who have made a specialised study of not more than three subjects.  In A levels, the percentage of candidates qualifying for particular grades is pre-determined.  In the leaving certificate there can be variations from year to year depending on the quality of the answering.</P>
      <P>It can therefore be misleading and unhelpful to compare the results of the leaving certificate with those of A levels, or to attempt to draw conclusions from such a comparison.</P>

      <P>It is my Department's aim to issue the results of rechecks, particularly upgrades, at the earliest possible date. This year, over 6,200 applications for a recheck were received, an increase of over one-third on the number of applications received in 1990.  Just under 300 applications resulted in an upgrade.  As is normal practice upgrades are notified immediately to schools, by phone, and to the Central Applications Office, by fax. A letter follows.  Where there is no change in the result, schools are advised of the position by letter.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in a small number of cases there have been delays in issuing results.  These were cases where particular difficulties were experienced.  I am having the recheck system examined with a view to eliminating difficulties and issuing results without delay in future years. The question of what resources would be needed in order to issue all results by the time of the opening of the universities, as suggested by the Deputy, will also be examined.  In this connection I am glad to say that arrangements are already in hand for computerisation of the recheck process in 1992 with a view to expediting the issue of recheck results.</P>

      <P>RTE are currently carrying out a number of television and FM radio reception surveys in west Cork and Kerry including the Skibbereen area.  This work is unlikely to be completed until early 1992 and, while RTE have no plans at this time for a local transmitter for the Skibbereen area, the position will be reviewed on the completion of the survey.</P>
